         <title>Ethylene&#8208;Carbonate&#8208;Free Electrolytes for Rechargeable Li&#8208;Ion Pouch Cells at Sub&#8208;Freezing Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of ethylene carbonate (EC)&#8208;free electrolytes, based on methyl acetate and fluorinated ethers, is proposed for Li&#8208;ion batteries operating at sub&#8208;freezing temperatures. The EC&#8208;free electrolyte demonstrates all&#8208;round performance advantages over the traditional EC&#8208;based electrolyte and presents a viable solution to improve the capacity retention and rechargeability of metal&#8208;ion batteries in cold climates.








Abstract
Sub&#8208;freezing temperature presents a significant challenge to the survival of current Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) as it leads to low capacity retention and poor cell rechargeability. The electrolyte in commercial LIBs relies too heavily on ethylene carbonate (EC) to produce a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite (Gr) anodes, but its high melting point (36.4&#160;&#176;C) severely restricts ion transport below 0&#160;&#176;C, causing energy loss and Li plating. Here, a class of EC&#8208;free electrolytes that exhibits remarkable low&#8208;temperature performance without compromising cell lifespan is reported. It is found that at sub&#8208;zero temperatures, EC forms highly resistive SEI that seriously impedes electrode kinetics, whereas EC&#8208;free electrolytes create a highly stable, low&#8208;impedance SEI through anion decomposition, which boosts capacity retention and eliminates Li plating during charging. Pouch&#8208;type LiCoO2 (LCO)|Gr cells with EC&#8208;free electrolytes sustain 900 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C with 1 C charge/discharge, and LiNi0.85Co0.10Al0.05O2 (NCA)|Gr cells last 300 cycles at &#8722;15&#160;&#176;C with 0.3&#160;C charge, both among the best&#8208;performing in the literature under comparable conditions. Even at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C, the NCA|Gr cell with EC&#8208;free electrolytes still delivers 76% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity, outperforming EC&#8208;based electrolytes.

         <title>Continuous Color&#8208;Tunable Light&#8208;Emitting Devices Based on Compositionally Graded Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting diode is realized using compositionally graded monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide alloys. By controlling the light&#8208;emitting positions in the alloys, the composition gradient of the bandgap enables continuous and reversible light emission with energies ranging from 2.1 to 1.7&#160;eV. The results provide a new approach for exploring monolayer&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;alloy&#8208;based broadband optoelectronic device applications.








Abstract
The diverse series of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials has been employed in various optoelectronic applications, such as photodetectors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and lasers. Typically, the detection or emission range of optoelectronic devices is unique to the bandgap of the active material. Therefore, to improve the capability of these devices, extensive efforts have been devoted to tune the bandgap, such as gating, strain, and dielectric engineering. However, the controllability of these methods is severely limited (typically &#8776;0.1&#160;eV). In contrast, alloying TMDCs is an effective approach that yields a composition&#8208;dependent bandgap and enables light emissions over a wide range. In this study, a color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting device using compositionally graded TMDC alloys is fabricated. The monolayer WS2/WSe2 alloy grown by chemical vapor deposition shows a spatial gradient in the light&#8208;emission energy, which varies from 2.1 to 1.7&#160;eV. This alloy is incorporated in an electrolyte&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting device structure that can tune the recombination zone laterally. Thus, a continuous and reversible color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting device is successfully fabricated by controlling the light&#8208;emitting positions. The results provide a new approach for exploring monolayer semiconductor&#8208;based broadband optical applications.

         <title>Modular Nanostructures Facilitate Low Thermal Conductivity and Ultra&#8208;High Thermoelectric Performance in n&#8208;Type SnSe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formation of 2D modular intergrowth [(SnSe)1.05]m(MoSe2)n nanostructures with periodicity of 1.2&#8211;2.6&#160;nm in the bulk SnSe matrix significantly scatters the phonons and reduces the lattice thermal conductivity&#160; drastically to an ultra&#8208;low value of &#8776;0.26&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. Thereby, a record high thermoelectric figure of merit of 2.0 at &#8776;800 K is achieved in n&#8208;type polycrystalline SnSe.








Abstract
Single crystals of SnSe have gained considerable attention in thermoelectrics due to their unprecedented thermoelectric performance. However, polycrystalline SnSe is more favorable for practical applications due to its facile chemical synthesis procedure, processability, and scalability. Though the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of p&#8208;type bulk SnSe polycrystals has reached &gt;2.5, zT of n&#8208;type counterpart is still lower and lies around &#8776;1.5. Herein, record high zT of 2.0 in n&#8208;type polycrystalline SnSe0.92&#160;+ x mol% MoCl5 (x&#160;= 0&#8211;3) samples is reported, when measured parallel to the spark plasma sintering pressing direction due to the simultaneous optimization of n&#8208;type carrier concentration and enhanced phonon scattering by incorporating modular nano&#8208;heterostructures in SnSe matrix. Modular nanostructures of layered intergrowth [(SnSe)1.05]m(MoSe2)n like compounds embedded in SnSe matrix scatters the phonons significantly leading to an ultra&#8208;low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) of &#8776;0.26&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 798 K in SnSe0.92&#160;+ 3 mol% MoCl5. The 2D layered modular intergrowth compound resembles the nano&#8208;heterostructure and their periodicity of 1.2&#8211;2.6&#160;nm in the SnSe matrix matches the phonon mean free path of SnSe, thereby blocking the heat carrying phonons, which result in low &#954;lat and ultra&#8208;high thermoelectric performance in n&#8208;type SnSe.

Abstract
Here, the authors report a highly efficient integrated ideal&#8208;bandgap perovskite/bulk&#8208;heterojunction solar cell (IPBSC) with an inverted architecture, featuring a near infrared (NIR) polymer DTBTI&#8208;based bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) layer atop guanidinium bromide (GABr)&#8208;modified FA0.7MA0.3Pb0.7Sn0.3I3 perovskite film as the photoactive layer. The IPBSC shows cascade&#8208;like energy level alignment between the charge&#8208;extractionlayer/perovskite/BHJ and efficient passivation effect of BHJ on perovskite. Thanks to the well&#8208;matched energy level alignment and high&#8208;quality ideal bandgap&#8208;based perovskite film, an efficient charge transfer occurs between the charge&#8208;extraction&#8208;layer/perovskite/BHJ. Moreover, the NIR polymer DTBTI on the perovskite film leads to an improved NIR light response for the IPBSC. In addition, the O, S and N atoms in the DTBTI polymer yield a strong interaction with perovskite, which is conducive to reducing the defects of the perovskite and suppressing charge recombination. As a result, the solar cell achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.27% (certificated value at 23.4% with 0.283&#8208;volt voltage loss), currently the recorded efficiency for both IPBSCs and Pb&#8208;Sn alloyed PSCs, and which is over the highest efficiency of perovskite&#8211;organic tandem solar cell. Moreover, the thermal, humidity and long&#8208;term operational stabilities of the IPBSCs are also significantly improved compared with the control PSCs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the authors report a highly efficient integrated ideal-bandgap perovskite/bulk-heterojunction solar cell (IPBSC) with an inverted architecture, featuring a near infrared (NIR) polymer DTBTI-based bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) layer atop guanidinium bromide (GABr)-modified FA&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite film as the photoactive layer. The IPBSC shows cascade-like energy level alignment between the charge-extractionlayer/perovskite/BHJ and efficient passivation effect of BHJ on perovskite. Thanks to the well-matched energy level alignment and high-quality ideal bandgap-based perovskite film, an efficient charge transfer occurs between the charge-extraction-layer/perovskite/BHJ. Moreover, the NIR polymer DTBTI on the perovskite film leads to an improved NIR light response for the IPBSC. In addition, the O, S and N atoms in the DTBTI polymer yield a strong interaction with perovskite, which is conducive to reducing the defects of the perovskite and suppressing charge recombination. As a result, the solar cell achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.27% (certificated value at 23.4% with 0.283-volt voltage loss), currently the recorded efficiency for both IPBSCs and Pb-Sn alloyed PSCs, and which is over the highest efficiency of perovskite&#8211;organic tandem solar cell.

         <title>Tropocollagen&#8208;Inspired Hierarchical Spiral Structure of Organic Fibers in Epoxy Bulk for 3D High Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully organic yet 3D thermoconductive bulk material is fabricated via weaving the hierarchical spiral poly(p&#8208;phenylene benzobisoxazole) fibers into an epoxy matrix. Significantly, not only the hierarchical molecular, spiral, and weaving structure of poly(p&#8208;phenylene benzobisoxazole), but also the bridging noncrystalline chains enable spatially phonon transport. This paves the way for fully organic materials in the fields of advanced thermal management.








Abstract
Polymers are usually considered thermal insulators; however, significant enhancements in thermal conductivity (k) have been observed in oriented fibers and films. Despite being advantageous in real&#8208;world applications, extending the linear thermal&#8208;transport advantage of polymers into the 3D space in bulk materials is still limited due to the spatially interfacial phonon&#8208;conduction barriers. Herein, inspired by the structure of tropocollagen, it is discovered that weaving hierarchically arranged poly(p&#8208;phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) fibers with a spiral configuration into an epoxy matrix can yield a 3D continuous thermal pathway. This achieves both a through&#8208;plane k of 10.85&#160;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 and an in&#8208;plane k of 7.15&#160;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1. Theoretical molecular simulations in combination with classical nonlinear modeling attribute the above spatially thermally conductive achievement to not only the hierarchical molecular, spiral and weaving structure of PBO, but also the noncrystalline chains that carry overlapping phonon density of states, thus thermally bridging adjacent high&#8208;k crystals in the PBO fiber. Consequently, the interfacial thermal resistance among high&#8208;k PBO crystals is suppressed to be on the order of 10&#8722;10&#8201;m2&#8201;K&#8201;W&#8722;1 in both the through&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane directions. Other advantages include being lightweight, mechanically strong, flexible, and non&#8208;combustible. This material creates opportunities for organic polymers in high&#8208;performance thermal management applications.

         <title>Wireless Miniature Magnetic Phase&#8208;Change Soft Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed wireless miniature phase&#8208;change soft actuators exhibit enhancing output force and work capacity, which are 106&#8211;107 times that of traditional magnetic soft actuators. This output performance enables the actuator to have the ability for angioplasty applications, locomotion in granular media, and programmable magnetic deformation, demonstrating its potential in medical and other robotic applications.








Abstract
Wireless miniature soft actuators are promising for various potential high&#8208;impact applications in medical, robotic grippers, and artificial muscles. However, these miniature soft actuators are currently constrained by a small output force and low work capacity. To address such challenges, a miniature magnetic phase&#8208;change soft composite actuator is reported. This soft actuator exhibits an expanding deformation and enables up to a 70&#160;N output force and 175.2&#160;J&#160;g&#8722;1 work capacity under remote magnetic radio frequency heating, which are 106&#8211;107 times that of traditional magnetic soft actuators. To demonstrate its capabilities, a wireless soft robotic device is first designed that can withstand 0.24&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1 fluid flows in an artery phantom. By integrating it with a thermally&#8208;responsive shape&#8208;memory polymer and bistable metamaterial sleeve, a wireless reversible bistable stent is designed toward future potential angioplasty applications. Moreover, it can additionally locomote inside and jump out of granular media. At last, the phase&#8208;change actuator can realize programmable bending deformations when a specifically designed magnetization profile is encoded, enhancing its shape&#8208;programming capability. Such a miniature soft actuator provides an approach to enhance the mechanical output and versatility of magnetic soft robots and devices, extending their medical and other potential applications.

         <title>Balanced Interfacial Ion Concentration and Migration Steric Hindrance Promoting High&#8208;Efficiency Deposition/Dissolution Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The important influence of interfacial ion effect on aqueous zinc&#8211;manganese batteries is proposed. The interfacial ion concentration and steric hindrance in the electric double layer are comprehensively balanced from the perspective of thermodynamics and kinetics, respectively, to achieve both high specific capacity and long cycle stability simultaneously.








Abstract
The solid&#8211;liquid transition reaction lays the foundation of electrochemical energy storage systems with high capacity, but realizing high efficiency remains a challenge. Herein, in terms of thermodynamics and dynamics, this work demonstrates the significant role of both interfacial H+ concentration and Mn2+ migration steric hindrance for the high&#8208;efficiency deposition/dissolution chemistry of zinc&#8211;manganese batteries. Specially, the introduction of formate anions can buffer the generated interfacial H+ to stabilize interfacial potential according to the Nernst equation, which stimulates high capacity. Compared with acetate and propionate anions, the formate anion&#160;also provides high adsorption density on the cathode surface to shield the electrostatic repulsion due to the small spatial hindrance. Particularly for the solvated Mn2+, the formate&#8208;anion&#8208;induced lower energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step during the step&#8208;by&#8208;step desolvation process results in lower polarization and higher electrochemical reversibility. In&#160;situ tests and theoretical calculations verify that the electrolyte with formate anions achieve a good balance between ion concentration and ion&#8208;migration steric hindrance. It exhibits both the high energy density of 531.26&#160;W&#160;h&#160;kg&#8208;1&#160;and long cycle life of more than 300&#160;cycles without obvious decay.

The development of eco&#8208;friendly, ultralow&#8208;power and easy&#8208;to&#8208;process electronics is facing dominant challenges in emerging off&#8208;the&#8208;grid applications, such as the Internet of Things (IoTs) and extreme environment explorations at the south/north&#160;pole, in the deep sea, and in outer space. Eco&#8208;friendly, biodegradable, lightweight, and flexible paper&#8208;based electronics can provide many new possibilities for next&#8208;generation devices and circuits. Here, enhancement&#8208;mode (E&#8208;mode, remaining off state at zero gate voltages) carbon nanotube (CNT) complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) are built on paper substrates through a printing&#8208;based process. Benefitting from the CMOS circuit style and E&#8208;mode transistors, the fabricated CMOS inverters exhibit high voltage gains (more than 11) and noise margins (up to 75% 1/2 VDD at VDD of 0.4&#160;V), and rail&#8208;to&#8208;rail operation down to a VDD as low as 0.2&#160;V and record low power dissipation as low as 0.0124 pW &#956;m&#8722;1. Furthermore, the transistors and integrated circuits (ICs) show an excellent radiation tolerance of a total ionizing dose (TID) exceeding 2 Mrad with a high dose rate of 365&#8201;rad&#8201;s&#8722;1. The record power consumption and outstanding radiation tolerance behavior achieved in paper&#8208;based and easy&#8208;to&#8208;process CNT electronics are attractive for emerging energy&#8208;saving and environmentally friendly ICs in harsh environment (such as outer&#8208;space) applications.

         <title>Role of Moisture and Oxygen in Defect Management and Orderly Oxidation Boosting Carbon&#8208;Based CsPbI2Br Solar Cells to a New Record Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orderly oxidation of CsPbI2Br film in moist air leads to more efficient defect passivation in film by grain boundary oxidation, and higher hole extraction efficiency in device via the energy band coupling between CsPbI2Br and oxidation product CsPbIBr2. The champion cell achieves an efficiency of 15.27%, and a certified efficiency of 14.7%, which is a record efficiency for CsPbI2Br C&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Large energy loss (Eloss) caused&#160;by defect&#8208;assisted recombination makes the photovoltaic performance of carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) inferior to that of metal&#8208;electrode ones. Herein, the influence of environmental factors (moisture and oxygen) on defect management during re&#8208;annealing process of CsPbI2Br crystalline films is systematically studied. Density functional theory and experimental results indicate that moisture in the air can significantly reduce the oxidation kinetics of crystalline films, resulting in orderly oxidation. Concomitantly, the oxidation decomposition products PbO and CsPbIBr2 are enriched at grain boundaries, passivating surface defects efficiently. Simultaneously, energy band coupling between CsPbI2Br and CsPbIBr2 improves the hole extraction efficiency. The photovoltage of corresponding C&#8208;PSCs is increased from 1.05 to 1.32&#160;V, indicating a reduced Eloss derived from orderly oxidation strategy. Correspondingly, the champion cell achieves an efficiency of 15.27%, and a certified efficiency of 14.7%, which is a new record efficiency for CsPbI2Br C&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Engineered Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles as Controllable Two&#8208;Way Adaptors to Activate Macrophage Phagocytosis for Improved Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An outer membrane vesicle (OMV)&#8208;based controllable PEG/Se@OMV&#8208;CD47nb remarkedly increase the dose that can be administered safely through intravenous injection. As two&#8208;way adaptors, OMV&#8208;CD47nb activate tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM) phagocytosis of tumor cells via inducing M1 polarization and blocking &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal. Moreover, this activation of TAMs results in the stimulation of T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity through effective antigen presentation.








Abstract
The most immune cells infiltrating tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) closely resemble immunosuppressive M2&#8208;polarized macrophages. Moreover, tumor cells exhibit high expression of CD47 &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal, which obstructs macrophage phagocytosis. The precise and efficient activation of TAMs is a promising approach to tumor immunotherapy; however, re&#8208;education of macrophages remains a challenge. Bacteria&#8208;derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are highly immunogenic nanovesicles that can robustly stimulate macrophages. Here, an OMV&#8208;based controllable two&#8208;way adaptor is reported, in which a CD47 nanobody (CD47nb) is fused onto OMV surface (OMV&#8208;CD47nb), with the outer surface coated with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) layer containing diselenide bonds (PEG/Se) to form PEG/Se@OMV&#8208;CD47nb. The PEG/Se layer modification not only mitigates the immunogenicity of OMV&#8208;CD47nb, thereby remarkedly increasing the dose that can be administered safely through intravenous injection, but also equips the formulation with radiation&#8208;triggered controlled release of OMV&#8208;CD47nb. Application of radiation to tumors in mice injected with the nanoformulation results in remodeling of TME. As two&#8208;way adaptors, OMV&#8208;CD47nb activates TAM phagocytosis of tumor cells via multiple pathways, including induction of M1 polarization and blockade of &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal. Moreover, this activation of TAMs results in the stimulation of T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity through effective antigen presentation.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Homogeneous Ru&#63743;Cu Alloy Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomic&#8208;scale homogeneous alloy of immiscible metals is first implemented in electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction (NRR) by a unique carbothermal shock method. Atomic&#8208;scale mixing of ruthenium and copper facilitates pivotal reaction steps in NRR, showing high selectivity and formation rate to ammonia. This paves the way for developing numerous potential homogeneous alloys of immiscible metal combinations for future efficient NRR electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is the most widely used metal as an electrocatalyst for nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (NRR) because of the relatively high N2 adsorption strength for successive reaction. Recently, it has been well reported that the homogeneous Ru&#8208;based metal alloys such as Ru&#63743;Rh, Ru&#63743;Pt, and Ru&#63743;Co significantly enhance the selectivity and formation rate of ammonia (NH3). However, the metal combinations for NRR have been limited to several miscible combinations of metals with Ru, although various immiscible combinations have immense potential to show high NRR performance. In this study, an immiscible combination of Ru and copper (Cu) is first utilized, and homogeneous alloy nanoparticles (Ru&#63743;Cu NPs) are fabricated by the carbothermal shock method. The Ru&#63743;Cu homogeneous NP alloys on cellulose/carbon nanotube sponge exhibit the highest selectivity and NH3 formation rate of &#8776;31% and &#8722;73&#160;&#956;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, respectively. These are the highest values of the selectivity and NH3 formation rates among existing Ru&#8208;based alloy metal combinations.

         <title>Universal Hopping Motion Protected by Structural Topology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Universal scaling behavior of hopping motion determined by the shape of the interface and its topology is discovered through the current&#8208;driven motion of magnetic skyrmions. This provides insights for implementing the skyrmionic devices and, for understanding the dynamics of moving bodies with a closed interface, which appears in a wide range of physical systems.








Abstract
A scaling law elucidates the universality in nature, presiding over many physical phenomena which seem unrelated. Thus, exploring the universality class of scaling law in a particular system enlightens its physical nature in relevance to other systems and sometimes unearths an unprecedented new dynamic phase. Here, the dynamics of weakly driven magnetic skyrmions are investigated, and its scaling law is compared with the motion of a magnetic domain wall (DW) creep. This study finds that the skyrmion does not follow the scaling law of the DW creep in 2D space but instead shows a hopping behavior similar to that of the particle&#8208;like DW in 1D confinement. In addition, the hopping law satisfies even when a topological charge of the skyrmion is removed. Therefore, the distinct scaling behavior between the magnetic skyrmion and the DW stems from a general principle beyond the topological charge. This study demonstrates that the hopping behavior of skyrmions originates from the bottleneck process induced by DW segments with diverging collective lengths, which is inevitable in any closed&#8208;shape spin structure in 2D. This work reveals that the structural topology of magnetic texture determines the universality class of its weakly driven motion, which is distinguished from the universality class of magnetic DW creep.

         <title>Large Room Temperature Anomalous Transverse Thermoelectric Effect in Kagome Antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kagome antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6 exhibits a maximum transverse thermoelectric effect of &#8776; 2.4 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at 200 K. More importantly, a large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) of &#8776; 2 &#181;V&#160;K&#8722;1 at 300 K is observed, which is the highest value for any antiferromagnetic material. This large ANE value can be attributed to the presence of a Dirac point and flat band close to the Fermi level with intrinsic Berry curvature.








Abstract
Kagome magnets possess several novel nontrivial topological features owing to the strong correlation between topology and magnetism that extends to their applications in the field of thermoelectricity. Conventional thermoelectric (TE) devices use the Seebeck effect to convert heat into electrical energy. In contrast, transverse thermoelectric devices based on the Nernst effect are attracting recent attention due to their unique transverse geometry, which uses a single material to eliminate the need for a multitude of electrical connections compared to conventional TE devices. Here, a large anomalous transverse thermoelectric effect of &#8776;2 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at room temperature in a kagome antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6 single crystal is obtained. The obtained value is larger than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art canted antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials and comparable with ferromagnetic systems. The large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) can be attributed to the net Berry curvature near the Fermi level. Furthermore, the ANE of the AFM YMn6Sn6 exceeds the magnetization scaling relationship of conventional ferromagnets. The results clearly illustrate that AFM material YMn6Sn6 is an ideal topological material for room&#8208;temperature transverse thermoelectric applications.

         <title>A Simple Preheating&#8208;Pyrolysis Strategy Leading to Superior Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity in Fe&#8208;N/Carbon Black</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple pyrolysis strategy by mixing FeSO4, 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, and carbon black can impart high oxygen reduction reaction activities and stabilities to commercial carbon black; the catalyst obtained by this simple method has a stronger catalytic activity than metal&#8211;organic frameworks derived carbon, metal&#8208;loaded graphene, and single&#8208;atom sites catalysts. This approach can also be extended to other nitrogen&#8208;containing ligands.








Abstract
Maintaining the high catalytic activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) while reducing costs is a long&#8208;standing effort to promote the application of polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Here, the binding of nitrogen&#8208;containing ligands and carbon black is enhanced by controlling the pyrolysis conditions of a FeSO4, 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen), carbon black mixture, which significantly improves the ORR catalytic activity of the pyrolysis products. Preheating is proposed as a process improvement method using a heat treatment at a temperature between the melting and boiling points of phen before high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis, which achieves an effective combination of phen and carbon black, and enhances the interaction between phen and ferrous ions. This method substantially increases the number of FeNx active centers in the pyrolysis product, resulting in an impressive Fe&#8208;N/C catalyst with half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) up to 0.93&#160;V and a diffusion&#8208;limited current density (jL) of 5.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 and no obvious decay after 20&#160;000 cyclic voltammetry cycles in 0.1&#160;m&#160;KOH, which are all among the best&#8208;reported data known to date. The interaction between the ratio of Fe/phen and the pyrolysis conditions is also investigated. Under the right conditions, cheap raw materials can also generate highly catalytically active sites.

         <title>&#8220;Red Carbon&#8221;: A Rediscovered Covalent Crystalline Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon suboxide is a molecule spontaneously polymerizing into conjugated ladder oligomers composed of carbon and oxygen atoms only, and named &#8220;red carbon.&#8221; Herein, this partially forgotten chemistry is brought back to the attention of the community of covalent semiconductors. As&#8208;synthesized red carbon generates superoxide species upon light irradiation, acting as an efficient photocatalyst, with performance superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbon nitrides.








Abstract
Carbon suboxide (C3O2) is a unique molecule able to polymerize spontaneously into highly conjugated light&#8208;absorbing structures at temperatures as low as 0&#160;&#176;C. Despite obvious advantages, little is known about the nature and the functional properties of this carbonaceous material. In this work, the aim is to bring &#8220;red carbon,&#8221; a forgotten polymeric semiconductor, back to the community's attention. A solution polymerization process is adapted to simplify the synthesis and control the structure. This allows one to obtain this crystalline covalent material at low temperatures. Both spectroscopic and elemental analyses support the chemical structure represented as conjugated ladder polypyrone ribbons. Density functional theory calculations suggest a crystalline structure of AB stacks of polypyrone ribbons and identify the material as a direct bandgap semiconductor with a medium bandgap that is further confirmed by optical analysis. The material shows promising photocatalytic performance using blue light. Moreover, the simple condensation&#8211;aromatization route described here allows the straightforward fabrication of conjugated ladder polymers and can be inspiring for the synthesis of carbonaceous materials at low temperatures in general.

         <title>An Irradiance&#8208;Adaptable Near&#8208;Infrared Vertical Heterojunction Phototransistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared phototransistor using the graphene/lead sulfide quantum dots/graphene heterojunction as the conductive channel is fabricated. The device demonstrates an intense gate voltage&#8208;dependent photoresponse. The dynamic trapping and de&#8208;trapping processes in the quantum dot film enable the inhibition or potentiation of the photoresponse, based on which the photopic or scotopic adaptation behavior of the human retina is successfully mimicked, respectively.








Abstract
Bioinspired artificial visual perception devices with the optical environment&#8208;adaptable function have attracted significant attention for their promising potential in applications like robotics and machine vision. In this regard, a photodetector with in&#8208;sensor adaptability is longed for in terms of complexity, efficiency, and cost. Here, a near&#8208;infrared phototransistor with a benign light irradiance&#8208;adaptability is presented. The phototransistor uses a vertically stacking graphene/lead sulfide quantum dots/graphene heterojunction as the conductive channel. Compared with ordinary lead sulfide quantum dots&#8208;decorated graphene phototransistors, the present device demonstrates a faster photoresponse speed and an abnormal transfer characteristic. The latter characteristic is induced by the gate voltage&#8208;tunable Fermi level in the heterojunction and the abundant electron trap states in the quantum dot film, which jointly results in an intense dependence of the photoresponse on the gate voltage.

&lt;p&gt;A near-infrared phototransistor using the graphene/lead sulfide quantum dots/graphene heterojunction as the conductive channel is fabricated. The device demonstrates an intense gate voltage-dependent photoresponse. The dynamic trapping and de-trapping processes in the quantum dot film enable the inhibition or potentiation of the photoresponse, based on which the photopic or scotopic adaptation behavior of the human retina is successfully mimicked, respectively.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bioinspired artificial visual perception devices with the optical environment-adaptable function have attracted significant attention for their promising potential in applications like robotics and machine vision. In this regard, a photodetector with in-sensor adaptability is longed for in terms of complexity, efficiency, and cost. Here, a near-infrared phototransistor with a benign light irradiance-adaptability is presented. The phototransistor uses a vertically stacking graphene/lead sulfide quantum dots/graphene heterojunction as the conductive channel. Compared with ordinary lead sulfide quantum dots-decorated graphene phototransistors, the present device demonstrates a faster photoresponse speed and an abnormal transfer characteristic. The latter characteristic is induced by the gate voltage-tunable Fermi level in the heterojunction and the abundant electron trap states in the quantum dot film, which jointly results in an intense dependence of the photoresponse on the gate voltage. The dynamic trapping and de-trapping processes in the quantum dot film enable the inhibition or potentiation of the photoresponse, based on which the photopic or scotopic adaptation behavior of the human retina is successfully mimicked, respectively.

         <title>An Electret&#8208;Powered Skin&#8208;Attachable Auditory Sensor that Functions in Harsh Acoustic Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electret&#8208;powered skin&#8208;attachable auditory sensor operating without a bulky battery is presented. The hole&#8208;patterned electret diaphragm array with elastomer nanodroplets facilitates high sensing performance and clear voice detection in a harsh acoustic environment. The acoustic sensor shows a strong potential of a communication tool for disaster response and quarantine activities, and of diagnosis tool for vocal healthcare applications.








Abstract
Auditory sensors have shortcomings with respect to not only personalization with wearability and portability but also detecting a human voice clearly in a noisy environment or when a mask covers the mouth. In this work, an electret&#8208;powered and hole&#8208;patterned polymer diaphragm is exploited into a skin&#8208;attachable auditory sensor. The optimized charged electret diaphragm induces a voltage bias of &gt;400&#160;V against the counter electrode, which reduces the necessity of a bulky power source and enables the capacitive sensor to show high sensitivity (2.2&#160;V&#160;Pa&#8722;1) with incorporation of an elastomer nanodroplet seismic mass. The sophisticated capacitive structure with low mechanical damping enables a flat frequency response (80&#8211;3000&#160;Hz) and good linearity (50&#8211;80&#160;dBSPL). The hole&#8208;patterned electret diaphragms help the skin&#8208;attachable sensor detect only neck&#8208;skin vibration rather than dynamic air pressure, enabling a person's voice to be detected in a harsh acoustic environment. The sensor operates reliably even in the presence of surrounding noise and when the user is wearing a gas mask. Therefore, the sensor shows strong potential of a communication tool for disaster response and quarantine activities, and of diagnosis tool for vocal healthcare applications such as cough monitoring and voice dosimetry.

         <title>Direct Exciton Harvesting from a Bound Triplet Pair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficacy of using bound triplet pairs directly for electrical and chemical work is demonstrated. In support of this it is shown that triplet pairs can be directly harvested and&#160;that significant benefit in the achievable quantum efficiency is achieved by utilizing the triplet pair before annihilation processes occur.








Abstract
Singlet fission is commonly defined as the generation of two triplet excitons from a single absorbed photon. However, ambiguities within this definition arise due to the complexity of the various double triplet states that exist in SF chromophores and the corresponding interconversion processes. To clarify this process, singlet fission is frequently depicted as sequential two&#8208;step conversion in which a singlet exciton decays into a bound triplet&#8208;pair biexciton state that dissociates into two &#8220;free&#8221; triplet excitons. However, this model discounts the potential for direct harvesting from the coupled biexciton state. Here, it is demonstrated that individual triplet excitons can be extracted directly from a bound triplet pair. It is demonstrated that due to the requirement for geminate triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation in intramolecular singlet fission compounds, unique spectral and kinetic signatures can be used to quantify triplet&#8208;pair harvesting yields. An internal quantum efficiency for triplet exciton transfer from the triplet pair of &gt;50%, limited only by the solubility of the compounds is achieved. The harvesting process is not dependent on the net multiplicity of the triplet&#8208;pair state, suggesting that an explicit, independent dissociation step is not a requirement for using triplet pairs to do chemical or electrical work.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Observation of Grain Boundary Dominated Unsynchronized Phase Transition in Polycrystalline Cu2Se</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The second&#8208;order phase transition behavior of the grains in the polycrystalline system is highly dependent on the surrounding grain boundaries environment. Atomic&#8208;scale observations show that the dominating effect of different grain boundaries leads to coexistence of high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature phases of Cu2Se in one grain.








Abstract
Phase transition is a physical phenomenon that attracts great interest of researchers. Although the theory of second&#8208;order phase transitions is well&#8208;established, their atomic&#8208;scale dynamics in polycrystalline materials remains elusive. In this work, second&#8208;order phase transitions in polycrystalline Cu2Se at the transition temperature are directly observed by in situ aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy. Phase transitions in microcrystalline Cu2Se start at the grain boundaries and extend inside the grains. This phenomenon is more pronounced in nanosized grains. Analysis of phase transitions in nanocrystalline Cu2Se with different grain boundaries demonstrates that grain boundary energy dominates unsynchronized phase transition behavior. This suggests that the energy of grain boundaries is the key factor influencing the energetic barrier for initiation of phase transition. The findings advance atomic&#8208;scale understanding of second&#8208;order phase transitions, which is crucial for the control of this process in polycrystalline materials.

         <title>Self&#8208;Formation CoO Nanodots Catalyst in Co(TFSI)2&#8208;Modified Electrolyte for High Efficient Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CoO nanodot (ND)&#8208;modified electrolyte is designed by employing cobalt bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Co(TFSI)2) as an electrolyte additive for Li&#8208;O2 batteries. The highly dispersed CoO NDs integrate both the high catalytic activity of solid catalyst and the good wettability of soluble catalyst, which can make a contribution to promoting the formation and decomposition of Li2O2, achieving a superior cyclability.








Abstract
The major challenges for Li&#8208;O2 batteries are sluggish reaction kinetics and large overpotentials due to the cathode passivation resulting from insulative and insoluble Li2O2. Here, a novel nanodot (ND)&#8208;modified electrolyte is designed by employing cobalt bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Co(TFSI)2) as an electrolyte additive. The Co(TFSI)2 additive can react with discharge intermediate LiO2 and product Li2O2 to form CoO NDs. The generated CoO NDs are well dispersed in electrolyte, which integrates both the high catalytic activity of solid catalyst and the good wettability of soluble catalyst. Under the catalytis of CoO NDs, Li2O2 is produced and deposits on the cathode together with them. At the recharge process, these well dispersed CoO NDs help to decompose solid Li2O2 at a lower overpotential. The Li&#8208;O2 cells with Co(TFSI)2 exhibit a long cycle life of 200 cycles at a current density of 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1 under a cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh g&#8722;1, as well as a superior reversibility associated with the Li2O2 formation and decomposition. The study is expected to broaden the range of electrolyte additives and provide a new view to developing highly dispersed NDs&#8208;based catalysts for Li&#8208;O2 batteries.

         <title>Unbreakable Hydrogels with Self&#8208;Recoverable 10&#8239;200% Stretchability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unbreakable networks are simply constructed in hydrogels via copolymerization of divinyl benzene micellar with acrylamide. The network provides both dynamic hydrophobic association for recoverable small deformations and homogeneous crosslinking for reversible alignment of polymer chains to resist ultra&#8208;large deformations without crack propagations. The resultant hydrogels exhibit self&#8208;recoverable 102 times stretchability, and superior resistance of fracture and fatigue.








Abstract
Design of tough hydrogels maintaining structural integrity under multivariable mechanical loads remains hugely challenging because the anticipated characteristics such as stretchability, strength, toughness, and fracture resistance can hardly be compatible. Herein, a simple but robust hydrogel network formed by copolymerization of divinyl benzene with acrylamide in micellar solutions for ultra&#8208;high fracture resistance and self&#8208;recoverable stretchability is proposed. The network provides dynamic association of hydrophobic domains and homogeneous crosslinking of hydrophilic chains, which shows step&#8208;by&#8208;step deformation process. The dynamic associations allow recoverable small deformations, then the homogeneous crosslinking ensures reversible unfolding and alignment of polymer chains to self&#8208;strengthen for ultra&#8208;large deformations without crack propagations. The resultant hydrogels exhibit comprehensive unbreakable feature with self&#8208;recoverable ultra&#8208;high stretchability (100% recovery from 10&#8239;200% strain), superior fracture resistance (toughness &gt; 26&#160;kJ m&#8722;2), and anticrack propagation and fatigue (fatigue threshold: &#8776;2.5&#160;kJ m&#8722;2). Even the prenotched hydrogels can undergo tens cyclic loads at 10&#8239;200% strain and thousands cyclic loads at 200% strain without noticeable changes in mechanical performance. The robust network prepared from homogeneous hydrophobic crosslinking provides a facile approach and a new mechanism to explore tough hydrogels with superior antifracture and extreme self&#8208;recoverable deformability for diverse applications.

         <title>In Situ Silver&#8208;Based Electrochemical Oncolytic Bioreactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tumor microenvironment&#8208;enabled in situ silver&#8208;based electrochemical oncolytic bioreactor has been established to unlock anti&#8208;tumor Ag+ prodrugs for highly&#8208;efficient subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor recession via activating reactive oxygen species production, wherein reduced graphene oxide featuring 20&#8208;fold larger catalysis rate than graphene oxide allows intratumoral H2O2 as reductants to reduce Ag+ into silver nanoparticles especially after uniting with VitC&#8208;mediated H2O2 production.








Abstract
In this study, it is shown for the first time that a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) carrier has a 20&#8208;fold higher catalysis rate than graphene oxide in Ag+ reduction. Based on this, a tumor microenvironment&#8208;enabled in situ silver&#8208;based electrochemical oncolytic bioreactor (SEOB) which switched Ag+ prodrugs into in situ therapeutic silver nanoparticles with and above 95% transition rate is constructed to inhibit the growths of various tumors. In this SEOB&#8208;enabled intratumoral nanosynthetic medicine, intratumoral H2O2 and rGO act as the reductant and the catalyst, respectively. Chelation of aptamers to the SEOB&#8208;unlocked prodrugs increases the production of silver nanoparticles in tumor cells, especially in the presence of Vitamin C, which is broken down in tumor cells to supply massive amounts of H2O2. Consequently, apoptosis and pyroptosis are induced to cooperatively contribute to the considerably&#8208;elevated anti&#8208;tumor effects on subcutaneous HepG2 and A549 tumors and orthotopic implanted HepG2 tumors in livers of nude mice. The specific aptamer targeting and intratumoral silver nanoparticle production guarantee excellent biosafety since it fails to elicit tissue damages in monkeys, which greatly increases the clinical translation potential of the SEOB system.

         <title>Fully Textured, Production&#8208;Line Compatible Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells Approaching 29% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>

An ultrathin hybrid hole transporting layer&#160;employing NiOx/[2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) ethyl]phosphonic acid enables complete and uniform coverage on fully textured indium tin oxide (ITO)/silicon surface with pyramid structures of 2&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m sizes. As a result of the depleted shunt pathways between ITO and perovskite top cell, a certified record efficiency&#8212;28.84%&#8212;is achieved on perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with fully textured, production&#8208;line compatible bottom silicon wafers.








Abstract
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells are promising avenues for achieving high&#8208;performance photovoltaics with low costs. However, the highest certified efficiency of perovskite/silicon tandem devices based on economically matured silicon heterojunction technology (SHJ) with fully textured wafer is only 25.2% due to incompatibility between the limitation of fabrication technology which is not compatible with the production&#8208;line silicon wafer. Here, a molecular&#8208;level nanotechnology is developed by designing NiOx/2PACz ([2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) ethyl]phosphonic acid) as an ultrathin hybrid hole transport layer (HTL) above indium tin oxide (ITO)&#160;recombination junction, to serve as a vital pivot for achieving a conformal deposition of high&#8208;quality perovskite layer on top. The NiOx interlayer facilitates a uniform self&#8208;assembly of 2PACz molecules onto the fully textured surface, thus avoiding direct contact between ITO and perovskite top&#8208;cell for a minimal shunt loss. As a result of such interfacial engineering, the fully textured perovskite/silicon tandem cells obtain a certified efficiency of 28.84% on a 1.2&#8208;cm2 masked area, which is the highest performance to date based on the fully textured, production&#8208;line compatible SHJ. This work advances commercially promising photovoltaics with high performance and low costs by adopting a meticulously designed HTL/perovskite interface.

         <title>Visible Light Induced Ag&#8211;Polyoxometalate Coassembly into Single&#8208;Cluster Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A schematic diagram of single&#8208;cluster nanowires constructed by Ag&#8208;polyoxometalate (POM) coassembly is presented. Ag clusters are generated by visible light induced reduction, which are then connected with POM clusters to form 1D superstructures with alternative arrangement. Ag&#8208;P2W17 nanowires perform enhanced activities in both electrochemical sensing and catalytic gasoline desulfurization, due to the promoted electron transfer in nanowire heterojunctions.








Abstract
1D superlattices with long&#8208;ranged periodicity present extraordinary application properties due to their unique electronic structures. Here, the visible light driven synthesis of 1D single&#8208;cluster chains constructed by polyoxometalate (POM) and Ag clusters is reported, where two types of clusters align alternatively along the nanowire. Low symmetrical POM clusters of [P2W17O61]10&#8211;, [P2W15O56]12&#8211;, and [EuW10O36]9&#8211; can be used as building blocks. The directly bonding cluster units result in interactive electronic structures of Ag and POM clusters, as well as the greatly promoted electron transfer during the redox reaction. The Ag&#8211;P2W17 nanowires perform significantly enhanced activities in both electrochemical sensing and catalytic gasoline desulfurization compared with individual building blocks, demonstrating the extraordinary application properties and promising potentials of cluster&#8208;based heteroconstructions.

         <title>Multidimensional Perovskites for High Detectivity Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite thin films with a 2D&#8211;3D gradient result in graded electronic bandgap structures that are ideal for photodiode applications. Low&#8208;dimensional perovskite phases at the interface with the electron blocking layer increase the activation energy for thermal charge generation and thereby effectively lower the dark current density to a record&#8208;value of 10&#8211;9&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, resulting in maximized sensitivity.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional perovskites attract increasing interest due to tunable optoelectronic properties and high stability. Here, it is shown that perovskite thin films with a vertical gradient in dimensionality result in graded electronic bandgap structures that are ideal for photodiode applications. Positioning low&#8208;dimensional, vertically&#8208;oriented perovskite phases at the interface with the electron blocking layer increases the activation energy for thermal charge generation and thereby effectively lowers the dark current density to a record&#8208;low value of 5 &#215; 10&#8722;9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 without compromising responsivity, resulting in a noise&#8208;current&#8208;based specific detectivity exceeding 7 &#215; 1012 Jones at 600&#160;nm. These multidimensional perovskite photodiodes show promising air stability and a dynamic range over ten orders of magnitude, and thus represent a new generation of high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost photodiodes.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Anode&#8208;Less All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries via the Conversion Reaction of Metal Fluorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature anode&#8208;less all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery is reported by utilizing the conversion reaction of metal fluorides. Silver fluoride is identified as a seed component to induce uniform and reversible lithium plating via a conversion reaction that produces metallic silver nanodomains. These nanodomains, together with the lithium fluoride formed during the conversion reaction, enable sustainable cycling with an extremely high areal capacity.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) that employ anode&#8208;less electrodes have drawn attention from across the battery community because they offer competitive energy densities and a markedly improved cycle life. Nevertheless, the composite matrices of anode&#8208;less electrodes impose a substantial barrier for lithium&#8208;ion diffusion and inhibit operation at room temperature. To overcome this drawback, here, the conversion reaction of metal fluorides is exploited because metallic nanodomains formed during this reaction induce an alloying reaction with lithium ions for uniform and sustainable lithium (de)plating. Lithium fluoride (LiF), another product of the conversion reaction, prevents the agglomeration of the metallic nanodomains and also protects the electrode from fatal lithium dendrite growth. A systematic analysis identifies silver (I) fluoride (AgF) as the most suitable metal fluoride because the silver nanodomains can accommodate the solid&#8208;solution mechanism with a low nucleation overpotential. AgF&#8208;based full cells attain reliable cycling at 25 &#176;C even with an exceptionally high areal capacity of 9.7 mAh cm&#8722;2 (areal loading of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2&#160;= 50&#160;mg cm&#8211;2). These results offer useful insights into designing materials for anode&#8208;less electrodes for sulfide&#8208;based ASSBs.

         <title>Magnetic Alignment for Plasmonic Control of Gold Nanorods Coated with Iron Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assembly of spherical, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles on gold nanorods yields magnetic gold nanorods (MagGNRs) that align in applied magnetic fields. Magnetic manipulation of the surface plasmon resonance of MagGNRs is comprehensively investigated through structural and optical characterization, and an analytical model provides a unified understanding of the magnetic alignment behavior. Dynamic alignment of MagGNRs is demonstrated in rotating magnetic fields.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanoparticles that can be manipulated with magnetic fields are of interest for advanced optical applications, diagnostics, imaging, and therapy. Alignment of gold nanorods yields strong polarization&#8208;dependent extinction, and use of magnetic fields is appealing because they act through space and can be quickly switched. In this work, cationic polyethyleneimine&#8208;functionalized superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) are deposited on the surface of anionic gold nanorods coated with bovine serum albumin. The magnetic gold nanorods (MagGNRs) obtained through mixing maintain the distinct optical properties of plasmonic gold nanorods that are minimally perturbed by the magnetic overcoating. Magnetic alignment of the MagGNRs arising from magnetic dipolar interactions on the anisotropic gold nanorod core is comprehensively characterized, including structural characterization and enhancement (suppression) of the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance and suppression (enhancement) of the transverse surface plasmon resonance for light polarized parallel (orthogonal) to the magnetic field. The MagGNRs can also be driven in rotating magnetic fields to rotate at frequencies of at least 17&#160;Hz. For suitably large gold nanorods (148&#160;nm long) and Fe3O4 NPs (13.4&#160;nm diameter), significant alignment is possible even in modest (&lt;500&#160;Oe) magnetic fields. An analytical model provides a unified understanding of the magnetic alignment of MagGNRs.

         <title>A Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery&#8208;Type Self&#8208;Powered Pressure Sensor with Long Service Life</title>

         <dc:description>
A zinc&#8208;ion battery (ZIB)&#160;pressuresensor where the rechargeable solid&#8208;state ZIB is&#160;itself designed as a flexible pressure sensor has excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance, endowing it with the real&#8208;time detection ability of human vital signs and ultrahigh stability. The sensor strategy provides a new solution for the future development of miniaturized wearable electronic devices.








Abstract
Accurate and continuous pressure signal detection without external power supply is a key technology to realize the miniaturization of wearable electronic equipment, the internet of things, and artificial intelligence. However, it is difficult to be achieved by using current sensor technologies. Here, a new one&#8208;body strategy, i.e., zinc&#8208;ion battery pressure (ZIB&#8208;P) sensor technology, which designs the rechargeable solid&#8208;state ZIB itself as a flexible pressure sensor is reported. In the device, an isolation layer is introduced into the sandwich configuration solid&#8208;state battery to realize the change of device internal resistance by pressure during the transformation of the mechanical signal to the electrical signal. This battery pressure sensor possesses good flexibility, fast response/recovery time (76.0/88.0&#160;ms), stable long&#8208;term response, excellent cycle stability (100&#8239;000 times), and wide pressure detection range (2.0 to 3.68 &#215; 105&#160;Pa). Especially, the excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance in the ZIB&#8208;P sensor endows it with the real&#8208;time detection ability of human vital signs (pulse, limb movement, etc.) and ultrahigh stability without degradation even under 100&#8239;000 times pressure stimulation. The ZIB&#8208;P sensor strategy provides a new solution for the future development of miniaturized wearable electronic devices.

An artificial neural network consisting of a hardware&#8208;based cross&#8208;point synaptic memristor array should employ selectors with two&#8208;terminal electrodes to prevent an undesired sneak current and to improve learning and inference efficiencies. Here, a highly reliable super&#8208;linear&#8208;threshold&#8208;switching selector with multiple jar&#8208;shaped Cu&#8208;filaments in the amorphous Ge3Se7 resistive switching layer by controlling the Cu ion concentration depth profile is developed.








Abstract
The learning and inference efficiencies of an artificial neural network represented by a cross&#8208;point synaptic memristor array can be achieved using a selector, with high selectivity (Ion/Ioff) and sufficient death region, stacked vertically on a synaptic memristor. This can prevent a sneak current in the memristor array. A selector with multiple jar&#8208;shaped conductive Cu filaments in the resistive switching layer is precisely fabricated by designing the Cu ion concentration depth profile of the CuGeSe layer as a filament source, TiN diffusion barrier layer, and Ge3Se7 switching layer. The selector performs super&#8208;linear&#8208;threshold&#8208;switching with a selectivity of &gt; 107, death region of &#8722;0.70&#8211;0.65 V, holding time of 300 ns, switching speed of 25 ns, and endurance cycle of &gt;&#160;106. In addition, the mechanism of switching is proven by the formation of conductive Cu filaments between the CuGeSe and Ge3Se7 layers under a positive bias on the top Pt electrode and an automatic rupture of the filaments after the holding time. Particularly, a spiking deep neural network using the designed one&#8208;selector&#8208;one&#8208;memory cross&#8208;point array improves the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology classification accuracy by &#8776;3.8% by eliminating the sneak current in the cross&#8208;point array during the inference process.

Phototransistors
In article number 2205679, Peiguang Yan, Zhenhua Sun, and co&#8208;workers report a near&#8208;infrared phototransistor with benign light&#8208;irradiance adaptability using a vertically stacking graphene/lead sulfide quantum dots/graphene heterojunction as the conductive channel. The dynamic trapping and detrapping processes in the quantum dot film enable the inhabitation or potentiation of the photoresponse, based on which the photopic or scotopic adaptation behavior of the human retina is successfully mimicked, respectively.

Skyrmion Motion
Understanding skyrmion motion is essential for the efficient operation of skyrmionic devices. In article number 2203275, Chanyong Hwang, Kyoung&#8208;Whan Kim, Albert Min Gyu Park, Kab&#8208;Jin Kim, and co&#8208;workers uncover a universal scaling behavior in the current&#8208;driven motion of skyrmions. The topology of the shape of the interface drags the skyrmions and causes them to show hopping properties distinct from the creep motion expected for magnetic domains. The universal scaling can provide insights for implementing skyrmion devices and understanding the dynamics of moving bodies with a closed interface.

Bioreactors
In article number 2109973, Liping Zhong, Kun Zhang, Yongxiang Zhao, and co&#8208;workers describe how a tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;enabled in situ silver&#8208;based electrochemical oncolytic bioreactor (SEOB) unlocks antitumor Ag+ prodrugs for highly efficient subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor recession via activating production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Reduced graphene oxide (rGO), featuring 20&#8208;fold larger catalysis rate than GO, allows intratumoral H2O2 as reductants to reduce Ag+ into silver nanoparticles especially after uniting with vitamin&#8208;C&#8208;mediated H2O2 production.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their intriguing and specific appearance and architecture, necklace&#8208;like nanostructures carry some unique features over simple 1D nanogeometries. In this review, necklace&#8208;like structures by focusing on their diverse synthetic strategies, distinctive properties, and applications, as well as future directions for fabricating and capitalizing on necklace&#8208;like structures are summarized.








Abstract
The shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of nanocrystals remains a hot research topic in nanotechnology. Particularly, the fabrication of 1D structures such as wires, rods, belts, and tubes has been an interesting and important subject within nanoscience in the last few decades. 1D necklace&#8208;like micro/nanostructures are a sophisticated geometry that has attracted increasing attention due to their anisotropic and periodic structure, intrinsic high surface area, abundant transport channels, exposure of each component to the surface, and multiscale roughness of the surface. These characteristics enable their unique electrical, optical, and catalytic properties. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the advanced research progress on the fabrication strategies, novel properties, and various applications of necklace&#8208;like structures. It begins with the main fabrication methods of necklace&#8208;like structures and subsequently details a variety of their properties and applications. It concludes with the authors&#8217; perspectives on future research and development of the necklace&#8208;like structures.

         <title>Amplifying Molecular Scale Rotary Motion: The Marriage of Overcrowded Alkene Molecular Motor with Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amplifying the molecular rotary motion of photoresponsive overcrowded alkene molecular motor (OAMM) by liquid crystal provides great opportunities in design and fabrication of advanced materials and functional systems. This review summarizes the recent progress of the OAMM triggered light&#8208;directed systems and the challenges and outlooks in the development of OAMM&#8208;liquid crystal composite system are concluded.








Abstract
Design and fabrication of macroscopic functional devices by molecular engineering is an emerging and effective strategy in exploration of advanced materials. Photoresponsive overcrowded alkene&#8208;based molecular motor (OAMM) is considered as one of the most promising molecular machines due to the unique rotary motion driven by light with high temporal and spatial precision. Amplifying the molecular rotary motions into macroscopic behaviors of photodirected systems links the molecular dynamics with macroscopic motions of materials, providing new opportunities to design novel materials and devices with a bottom&#8208;up strategy. In this review, recent developments of the light&#8208;responsive liquid crystal system triggered by OAMM will be summarized. The mechanism of amplification effect of liquid crystal matrix will be introduced first. Then progress of the OAMM&#8208;driven liquid crystal materials will be described including light&#8208;controlled photonic crystals, texture&#8208;tunable liquid crystal coating and microspheres, photoactuated soft robots, and dynamic optical devices. It is hoped that this review provides inspirations in design and exploration of light&#8208;driven soft matters and novel functional materials from molecular engineering to structural modification.

         <title>An Electrochemical&#8208;Electret Coupled Organic Synapse with Single&#8208;Polarity Driven Reversible Facilitation&#8208;to&#8208;Depression Switching</title>

Abstract
Neuromorphic engineering and artificial intelligence demands hardware elements that emulates synapse algorithms. During the last decay electrolyte&#8208;gated organic conjugated materials have been explored as a platform for artificial synapses for neuromorphic computing. Unlike biological synapses, in current devices the synaptic facilitation and depression are triggered by voltages with opposite polarity. To enhance the reliability and simplify the operation of synapse without lowering its sophisticated functionality, here we have devised an electrochemical&#8208;electret coupled organic synapse (EECS) possessing a reversible facilitation&#8208;to&#8208;depression switch. Electret charging counterbalances channel conductance changes due to electrochemical doping, inducing depression without inverting the gate polarity. Overall, EECS functions as a threshold&#8208;controlled synaptic switch ruled by its amplitude&#8208;dependent, dual&#8208;modal operation, which can well emulate information storage and erase as in real synapses. By varying energy level offset between channel material and electret, the EECS's transition threshold can be adjusted for specific applications, e.g. imparting additional light responsiveness to the device operation. Our novel device architecture represents a major step forward in the development of artificial organic synapses with increased functional complexity and it opens new perspectives towards the fabrication of abiotic neural networks with higher reliability, efficiency and endurance.

         <title>Shining Transparent Display with Stable Narrow&#8208;Band Blue&#8208;Emitting Phosphor in Layered Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Transparent display (TD) rendering &#8220;levitating&#8221; images on screen has appeared as an emerging technology towards augmented/mixed reality applications. However, the traditional phosphor design and screen construction have severely limited the TD performance owing to the lack of efficient narrow&#8208;band blue emitters and stable screen structure. Herein, we explore the novel narrow&#8208;band (full width at half maximum: 32&#160;nm) NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ phosphor with a peak at 467&#160;nm as a key blue emitter, and sandwich it in layered film as a unique screen design. The devised screen features decent transparency, high emission color purity and good reliability, and our TD prototype renders &#8220;floating&#8221; static images and vivid animation with broad viewing angle (15&#176;&#8764;165&#176;) and large color gamut (97% of National Television Standards Committee). Spectroscopic and micro&#8208;structural characterizations reveal the TD superior performance originates from synergistic contributions of moderate crystal field effect (&#949;c, ca. 1.13&#160;eV; &#949;cfs, ca. 1.60&#160;eV), weak vibronic coupling (S, ca. 3; &#295;&#969;, ca. 285 cm&#8722;1), and limited thermal ionization of 5d electrons (Ea, ca. 0.43&#160;eV) for NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ emission and layered architecture for screen film. These findings establish the fundamental guidelines for narrow&#8208;band emitting materials design and shine light on superior TD innovative development.

A room&#8208;temperature molten salt dimethylamine acetate is developed as the solvent for precursor solutions, which also regulates the phase conversion process of the CsPbI3 film. Consequently, 1.25 V of the open&#8208;circuit voltage and &gt;21% power conversion efficiency are achieved, which is the record highest for CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells reported so far.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite has emerged as an important photovoltaic material due to its high thermal stability and suitable bandgap for tandem devices. Currently, the cell performance of CsPbI3 solar cells is mainly subject to a large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit. Herein, a multifunctional room&#8208;temperature molten salt, dimethylamine acetate (DMAAc) is demonstrated, which not only directly acts as a solvent for precursor solutions, but also regulates the phase conversion process of the CsPbI3 film for high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaics. DMAAc can stabilize the DMAPbI3 structure and eliminate the Cs4PbI6 intermediate phase, which is easily spatially segregated. Meanwhile, a new homogeneous intermediate phase DMAPb(I,Ac)3 is formed, which finally affords high&#8208;quality CsPbI3 films. With this approach, the charge capture activity of defects in the CsPbI3 film is significantly suppressed. Consequently, a VOC of 1.25&#160;V and &gt;21% power conversion efficiency are achieved, which is the record highest reported thus far. This intermediate phase&#8208;regulation strategy is believed to be applicable to other perovskite material systems.

         <title>Triarylboron&#8208;doped Acenethiophenes as Organic Sonosensitizers for Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Therapy with Low Phototoxicity</title>

Abstract
The development of efficient organic sonosensitizers is crucial for sonodynamic therapy (SDT) in the field of cancer treatment. Herein, we present a new strategy for the development of efficient organic sonosensitizers based on triarylboron&#8208;doped acenethiophene scaffolds. The attachment of boron to the linear acenethiophenes lowers the LUMO energy, resulting in red&#8208;shifted absorptions and emissions. After encapsulation with the amphiphilic polymer DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000, we find that the nanostructured BAnTh&#8208;NPs and BTeTh&#8208;NPs shows efficient hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) generation under ultrasound (US) irradiation in aqueous solution with almost no phototoxicity, which can overcome the shortcomings of O2&#8208;dependent SDT and avoid the potential cutaneous phototoxicity issue. In vitro and in vivo therapeutic results validate that boron&#8208;doped acenethiophenes as sonosensitizers enable high SDT efficiency with low phototoxicity and good biocompatibility, indicating that boron&#8208;functionalization of acenes is a promising strategy toward organic sonosensitizers for SDT.

         <title>V&#8208;Doped Cu2Se Hierarchical Nanotubes Enabling Flow&#8208;Cell CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol with High Efficiency and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
CO2 electrocatalytic reduction (CO2ER) to multicarbon (C2+) products are heavily pursued because of their commercial values, whose efficiency and selectivity have both attracted tremendous attention. Flow&#8208;cell is a device configuration that can greatly enhance the conversion efficiency but requires catalysts to possess high electrical conductivity and gas permeability; meanwhile, the catalysts should enable the reaction pathway to specific products. Herein, we report that V&#8208;doped Cu2Se nanotubes with a hierarchical structure can be perfectly compatible with flow&#8208;cell and fulfil such a task, achieving CO2 electroreduction to ethanol with high efficiency and selectivity. As revealed by our experimental characterization and theoretical calculation, the substitutional vanadium doping alters the local charge distribution of Cu2Se and diversifies the active sites. The unique active sites promote the formation of bridge *COB and its further hydrogenation to *COH, and as such, the subsequent coupling of *COH and *COL eventually generates ethanol. As a result, the optimal Cu1.22V0.19Se nanotubes can electrocatalyze CO2 to ethanol with a Faradaic efficiency of 68.3% and a partial current density of &#8722;207.9&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 for the single liquid product of ethanol at &#8722;0.8&#160;V in a flow&#8208;cell. This work provides insights into the materials design for steering the reaction pathway toward C2+ products, and opens the avenue for flow&#8208;cell CO2ER toward a single C2+ liquid fuel.

         <title>A Non&#8208;Flammable High&#8208;Voltage 4.7 V Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Battery</title>

Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries employ in&#8208;situ lithium plated current collectors as negative electrodes to afford optimal mass and volumetric energy densities. The main challenges to such batteries include their poor cycling stability and safety issues of flammable organic electrolytes. Here, we report a high&#8208;voltage 4.7&#160;V anode&#8208;free lithium metal battery using a Cu foil coated with a layer (&#8764; 950&#160;nm) of silicon&#8208;polyacrylonitrile (Si&#8208;PAN, 25.5&#160;&#956;g cm&#8722;2) as the negative electrode, a high&#8208;voltage cobalt&#8208;free LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) as the positive electrode and a safe, non&#8208;flammable ionic liquid electrolyte comprised of 4.5&#160;M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) salt in N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;propyl pyrrolidiniumbis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (Py13FSI) with 1 wt% lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) as additive. The Si&#8208;PAN coating was found to seed the growth of lithium during charging, and reversibly expand/shrink during lithium plating/stripping over battery cycling. The wide voltage&#8208;window electrolyte containing a high concentration of FSI&#8722; and TFSI&#8722; facilitated the formation of stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, affording a 4.7&#160;V anode&#8208;free Cu@Si&#8208;PAN/LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 battery with a reversible specific capacity of &#8764; 120 mAh g&#8722;1 and high cycling stability (80% capacity retention after 120 cycles). These results represent the first anode&#8208;free Li battery with a high 4.7&#160;V discharge voltage and high safety.

         <title>Perovskite Photodetector Crossbar Array by Vapor Deposition for Dynamic Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
With the development of perovskite photodetectors, integrating photodetectors into array image sensor is the next target to pursue. The major obstacle of integrating perovskite photodiodes for dynamic imaging is the optoelectrical crosstalk among the pixels. Herein, a perovskite photodiode&#8208;blocking diode (PIN&#8208;BD) crossbar array with pixel&#8208;wise rectifying property by vapor deposition method is presented. The PIN&#8208;BD shows a large rectification ratio of 3.3&#215;102 under illumination, suppressing the electrical crosstalk to as small as 8.0% in the imaging array. The fast response time of 72.8&#160;ns allows the real&#8208;time image acquisition by over 25 frames per seconds. The imaging sensor exhibit excellent imaging capability with a large linear dynamic range of 112&#160;dB with 4096 grey levels, and weak light sensitivity under 1.2 lux.

         <title>Biomineralized Two&#8208;Enzyme Nanoparticles Regulated Tumor Glycometabolism Inducing Tumor Cell Pyroptosis and Robust Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Currently, immune checkpoint therapy combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy is a useful strategy for improving immunotherapy's therapeutic efficacy. However, chemotherapy and radiotherapy cause serious side effects, so finding safe and effective methods to combine with immunotherapy is critical. Our research found that regulating tumor glycometabolism could induce tumor cell pyroptosis and regulate the degree of expression of programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1). Therefore, this article looked at how to treat tumors by regulating tumor glycometabolism in combination with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 therapy. First, the biomineralization&#8208;like method was used to construct nanoparticles with two&#8208;enzymatic activity by hybridizing nanozymes and glucose oxidase (GOx). It had the ability to self&#8208;amplify and regulate the glycolytic activity of tumor cells. It could also induce tumor cell pyroptosis and increase the expression of PD&#8208;L1 in tumor cells. To treat tumors, we further combined nanoparticles with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1, which substantially inhibited tumor development and significantly increased mice survival time. Combination therapy also had a significant immunological memory effect, successfully preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study that combines tumor glycometabolism with immune checkpoints in cancer therapy. This innovative, safe, low&#8208;toxic, and highly effective anti&#8208;tumor strategy will have good prospects in clinical applications.

&lt;p&gt;Currently, immune checkpoint therapy combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy is a useful strategy for improving immunotherapy's therapeutic efficacy. However, chemotherapy and radiotherapy cause serious side effects, so finding safe and effective methods to combine with immunotherapy is critical. Our research found that regulating tumor glycometabolism could induce tumor cell pyroptosis and regulate the degree of expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Therefore, this article looked at how to treat tumors by regulating tumor glycometabolism in combination with anti-PD-L1 therapy. First, the biomineralization-like method was used to construct nanoparticles with two-enzymatic activity by hybridizing nanozymes and glucose oxidase (GOx). It had the ability to self-amplify and regulate the glycolytic activity of tumor cells. It could also induce tumor cell pyroptosis and increase the expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells. To treat tumors, we further combined nanoparticles with anti-PD-L1, which substantially inhibited tumor development and significantly increased mice survival time. Combination therapy also had a significant immunological memory effect, successfully preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study that combines tumor glycometabolism with immune checkpoints in cancer therapy. This innovative, safe, low-toxic, and highly effective anti-tumor strategy will have good prospects in clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Engineered Extracellular Vesicles with SHP2 High Expression Promote Mitophagy for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a fundamental pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, toxicity and poor brain enrichment of existing mitophagy inducers limit their further applications. In this study, we develops a platform for AD therapy using nanosized mesenchymal stem cells&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles with tyrosine phosphatase&#8208;2 (SHP2) high&#8208;expression (MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2). The high blood&#8208;brain barrier penetration ability of MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2 is demonstrated in AD&#8208;mice, facilitating SHP2 delivery to the brain. In addition, MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2 significantly induces mitophagy of neuronal cells, which alleviates mitochondrial damage&#8208;mediated apoptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Mitophagy further diminishes neuronal cells apoptosis and neuroinflammation, culminating with rescued synaptic loss and cognitive decline in an AD mouse model. Our EV&#8208;engineering technology provide a potential platform for effective AD therapy by inducing mitophagy.

         <title>Machine Learning Spectral Indicators of Topology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological materials discovery has emerged as an important frontier in condensed matter physics. While theoretical classification frameworks have been used to identify thousands of candidate topological materials, experimental determination of materials' topology often poses significant technical challenges. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a widely&#8208;used materials characterization technique sensitive to atoms' local symmetry and chemical bonding, which are intimately linked to band topology by the theory of topological quantum chemistry. Moreover, as a local structural probe, XAS is known to have high quantitative agreement between experiment and calculation, suggesting that insights from computational spectra can effectively inform experiments. In this work, we&#160;leverage computed X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) spectra of more than 10,000 inorganic materials to train a neural network classifier that predicts topological class directly from XANES signatures, achieving F1 scores of 89% and 93% for topological and trivial classes, respectively. Given the simplicity of the XAS setup and its compatibility with multimodal sample environments, the proposed machine learning&#8208;augmented XAS topological indicator has the potential to discover broader categories of topological materials, such as non&#8208;cleavable compounds and amorphous materials, and may further inform field&#8208;driven phenomena in situ, such as magnetic field&#8208;driven topological phase transitions.

         <title>Ultrathin Piezoelectric Resonators Based on Graphene and Free&#8208;Standing Single&#8208;Crystal BaTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric resonators are ubiquitous elements for frequency filtering in telecom devices. A piezoelectric resonator consisting of a suspended van der Waals heterostructure of ultrathin single&#8208;crystal free&#8208;standing BaTiO3 sandwiched between graphene sheets is reported. The heterostructure is piezoelectrically driven into a flexural motion and the resulting mechanics shows ferroelectric switching. The bulk&#8208;mode resonance at 233 GHz is the highest reported.








Abstract
Suspended piezoelectric thin films are key elements enabling high&#8208;frequency filtering in telecommunication devices. To meet the requirements of next&#8208;generation electronics, it is essential to reduce device thickness for reaching higher resonance frequencies. Here, the high&#8208;quality mechanical and electrical properties of graphene electrodes are combined with the strong piezoelectric performance of the free&#8208;standing complex oxide, BaTiO3 (BTO), to create ultrathin piezoelectric resonators. It is demonstrated that the device can be brought into mechanical resonance by piezoelectric actuation. By sweeping the DC bias voltage on the top graphene electrode, the BTO membrane is switched between the two poled ferroelectric states. Remarkably, ferroelectric hysteresis is also observed in the resonance frequency, magnitude and Q&#8208;factor of the first membrane mode. In the bulk acoustic mode, the device vibrates at 233 GHz. This work demonstrates the potential of combining van der Waals materials with complex oxides for next&#8208;generation electronics, which not only opens up opportunities for increasing filter frequencies, but also enables reconfiguration by poling, via ferroelectric memory effect.

         <title>Nanopatterning Technologies of 2D Materials for Integrated Electronic and Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanopatterning bridges the microstructure of 2D materials and integrated chip devices, essentially enabling and prompting their successful application in industry. A critical summary on the recent development of key nanopatterning technologies of 2D materials, with the aim of realizing large&#8208;scale device integration, is provided. This contribution offers a pioneering reference and guidelines to promote 2D materials from laboratory research to practical use.








Abstract
With the reduction of feature size and increase of integration density, traditional 3D semiconductors are unable to meet the future requirements of chip integration. The current semiconductor fabrication technologies are approaching their physical limits based on Moore's law. 2D materials such as graphene, transitional metal dichalcogenides, etc., are of great promise for future memory, logic, and photonic devices due to their unique and excellent properties. To prompt 2D materials and devices from the laboratory research stage to the industrial integrated circuit&#8208;level, it is necessary to develop advanced nanopatterning methods to obtain high&#8208;quality, wafer&#8208;scale, and patterned 2D products. Herein, the recent development of nanopatterning technologies, particularly toward realizing large&#8208;scale practical application of 2D materials is reviewed. Based on the technological progress, the unique requirement and advances of the 2D integration process for logic, memory, and optoelectronic devices are further summarized. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of nanopatterning technologies of 2D materials for future integrated chip devices are prospected.

Integrated tunable pressure sensors built with uniform gallium microgranules provide high sensitivity and bandwidth and excellent sensor&#8208;to&#8208;sensor uniformity, enabling a large&#8208;scale robotic skin with sensing performance superior to human skin. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstrations show its unique sensing capability and versatility covering a broad range of pressure.








Abstract
Robotic skin with human&#8208;skin&#8208;like sensing ability holds immense potential in various fields such as robotics, prosthetics, healthcare, and industries. To catch up with human skin, numerous studies are underway on pressure sensors integrated on robotic skin to improve the sensitivity and detection range. However, due to the trade&#8208;off between them, existing pressure sensors have achieved only a single aspect, either high sensitivity or wide bandwidth. Here, an adaptive robotic skin is proposed that has both high sensitivity and broad bandwidth with an augmented pressure sensing ability beyond the human skin. A key for the adaptive robotic skin is a tunable pressure sensor built with uniform gallium microgranules embedded in an elastomer, which provides large tuning of the sensitivity and the bandwidth, excellent sensor&#8208;to&#8208;sensor uniformity, and high reliability. Through the mode conversion based on the solid&#8211;liquid phase transition of gallium microgranules, the sensor provides 97% higher sensitivity (16.97 kPa&#8722;1) in the soft mode and 262.5% wider bandwidth (&#8776;1.45&#160;MPa) in the rigid mode compared to the human skin. Successful demonstration of the adaptive robotic skin verifies its capabilities in sensing a wide spectrum of pressures ranging from subtle blood pulsation to body weight, suggesting broad use for various applications.

         <title>An Integrated 3D Hydrophilicity/Hydrophobicity Design for Artificial Sweating Skin (i&#8208;TRANS) Mimicking Human Body Perspiration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile surface modification method for fibrous materials is developed to fabricate artificial sweating skin, based on an integrated 3D hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity design. With the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity contrast in both the lateral and vertical directions, the constructed &#8220;skin&#8221; can transport &#8220;sweat&#8221; directionally without trapping undesired excess water and attain uniform &#8220;secretion&#8221; of sweat droplets on the top, decently mimicking human skin perspiration situation.








Abstract
Artificial skins reproducing properties of human skin are emerging and significant for study in various areas, such as robotics, medicine, and textiles. Perspiration, as one of the most imperative thermoregulation functions of human skin, is gaining increasing attention, but how to realize ideal artificial skin for perspiration simulation remains challenging. Here, an integrated 3D hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity design is proposed for artificial sweating skin (i&#8208;TRANS). Based on normal fibrous wicking materials, the selective surface modification with gradient of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) creates hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity contrast in both lateral and vertical directions. With the additional help of bottom hydrophilic Nylon 6 nanofibers, the constructed i&#8208;TRANS is able to transport &#8220;sweat&#8221; directionally without trapping undesired excess water and attain uniform &#8220;secretion&#8221; of sweat droplets on the top surface, decently mimicking human skin perspiration situation. This fairly comparable simulation not only presents new insights for replicating skin properties, but also provides proper in vitro testing platforms for perspiration&#8208;relevant research, greatly avoiding unwanted interference from the &#8220;skin&#8221; layer. In addition, the facile, fast, and cost&#8208;effective fabrication approach and versatile usage of i&#8208;TRANS can further facilitate its application.

         <title>Weakening the Solvating Power of Solvents to Encapsulate Lithium Polysulfides Enables Long&#8208;Cycling Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large steric hindrance of its fluorohydrocarbon chains and the electron&#8208;withdrawing &#63743;CF2&#63743; segments endow 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether with prominently weak solvating power and high reduction stability. The weakening solvating power of fluorohydrocarbon solvent leads the formation of encapsulating&#8208;lithium polysulfide electrolyte for lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells with long cycling lifespan.








Abstract
Long cycling lifespan is a prerequisite for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries yet is restricted by side reactions between soluble polysulfides and the lithium&#8208;metal anode. The regulation on solvation structure of polysulfides renders encapsulating polysulfides electrolytes (EPSE) as a promising solution to suppress the parasitic reactions. The solvating power of the solvents in the outer solvent shell of lithium polysulfides is critical for the encapsulation effect of EPSE. Herein, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether&#160;(HFE) is demonstrated as a superior outer&#8208;shell solvent to construct EPSE. Based on the&#160;large steric hindrance of the fluorohydrocarbon chains, the electron&#8208;withdrawing perfluoro segment (&#63743;CF2&#63743; further endows HFE with prominently weak solvating power. The HFE&#8208;EPSE improves the lifespan from 54 to 135 cycles for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with an ultrathin lithium&#8208;metal anode (50&#160;&#181;m) and high&#8208;areal&#8208;loading sulfur cathode (4.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, a 334&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cell (2.4 Ah level) with HFE&#8208;EPSE stably undergoes 25 cycles. This work demonstrates the role of weakening solvating power of outer&#8208;shell solvents to construct superior EPSE and inspires the significance of the solvation chemistry of polysulfides to achieve practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Regulating the Coordination Environment of Mesopore&#8208;Confined Single Atoms from Metalloprotein&#8208;MOFs for Highly Efficient Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalized strategy to construct highly active ferric&#8208;centered SACs (Fe&#8208;SACs) via a biomineralization strategy that enables the homogeneous encapsulation of metalloproteins within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) followed by pyrolysis is developed. The enhanced catalytic activity of the Fe&#8208;SACs benefits from the highly dispersed atoms, mesopores, as well as the regulated coordination environment of single&#8208;atom active sites induced by metalloproteins.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit unparalleled atomic utilization and catalytic efficiency, yet it is challenging to modulate SACs with highly dispersed single&#8208;atoms, mesopores, and well&#8208;regulated coordination environment simultaneously&#160;and ultimately maximize their catalytic efficiency. Here, a generalized strategy to construct highly active ferric&#8208;centered SACs (Fe&#8208;SACs) is developed successfully via a biomineralization strategy that enables the homogeneous encapsulation of metalloproteins within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) followed by pyrolysis. The results demonstrate that the constructed metalloprotein&#8208;MOF&#8208;templated Fe&#8208;SACs achieve up to 23&#8208;fold and 47&#8208;fold higher activity compared to those using metal ions as the single&#8208;atom source and those with large mesopores induced by Zn evaporation, respectively, as well as up to a 25&#8208;fold and 1900&#8208;fold higher catalytic efficiency compared to natural enzymes and natural&#8208;enzyme&#8208;immobilized MOFs. Furthermore, this strategy can be generalized to a variety of metal&#8208;containing metalloproteins and enzymes. The enhanced catalytic activity of Fe&#8208;SACs benefits from the highly dispersed atoms, mesopores, as well as the regulated coordination environment of single&#8208;atom active sites induced by metalloproteins. Furthermore, the developed Fe&#8208;SACs act as an excellent and effective therapeutic platform for suppressing tumor cell growth. This work advances the development of highly efficient SACs using metalloproteins&#8208;MOFs as a template with diverse biotechnological applications.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Bioactive Nanomicelle&#8208;Based &#8220;One Stone for Multiple Birds&#8221; Strategy for Precision Therapy of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;one stone for multiple birds&#8221; strategy is proposed for therapy of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Three engineered conjugates can assemble into nanomicelles capable of inhibiting migration/activation of inflammatory cells and protecting smooth muscle cells from oxidative stress, calcification, and apoptosis. Intravenously delivered nanomicelles efficiently accumulate in aneurysms of rats and distribute in multiple pathological cells, thereby alleviating AAA progression.








Abstract
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains a lethal aortic disease in the elderly. Currently, no effective drugs can be clinically applied to prevent the development of AAA. Herein, a &#8220;one stone for multiple birds&#8221; strategy for AAA therapy is reported. As a proof of concept, three bioactive conjugates are designed and synthesized, which can assemble into nanomicelles. Cellularly, these nanomicelles significantly inhibit migration and activation of inflammatory cells as well as protect vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from induced oxidative stress, calcification and apoptosis, with the best effect for nanomicelles (TPTN) derived from a conjugate defined as TPT. After intravenous delivery, TPTN efficiently accumulates in the aneurysmal tissue of AAA rats, showing notable distribution in neutrophils, macrophages and VSMCs, all relevant to AAA pathogenesis. Whereas three examined nanomicelles effectively delay expansion of AAA in rats, TPTN most potently prevents AAA growth by simultaneously normalizing the pro&#8208;inflammatory microenvironment and regulating multiple pathological cells. TPTN is effective even at 0.2&#160;mg&#160;kg&#8722;1. Besides, TPTN can function as a bioactive nanoplatform for site&#8208;specifically delivering and triggerably releasing anti&#8208;aneurysmal drugs, affording synergistic therapeutic effects. Consequently, TPTN is a promising multi&#8208;bioactive nanotherapy and bioresponsive targeting delivery nanocarrier for effective therapy of AAA and other inflammatory vascular diseases.

     alt="A Multi-Bioactive Nanomicelle-Based &#8220;One Stone for Multiple Birds&#8221; Strategy for Precision Therapy of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;one stone for multiple birds&#8221; strategy is proposed for therapy of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Three engineered conjugates can assemble into nanomicelles capable of inhibiting migration/activation of inflammatory cells and protecting smooth muscle cells from oxidative stress, calcification, and apoptosis. Intravenously delivered nanomicelles efficiently accumulate in aneurysms of rats and distribute in multiple pathological cells, thereby alleviating AAA progression.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains a lethal aortic disease in the elderly. Currently, no effective drugs can be clinically applied to prevent the development of AAA. Herein, a &#8220;one stone for multiple birds&#8221; strategy for AAA therapy is reported. As a proof of concept, three bioactive conjugates are designed and synthesized, which can assemble into nanomicelles. Cellularly, these nanomicelles significantly inhibit migration and activation of inflammatory cells as well as protect vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from induced oxidative stress, calcification and apoptosis, with the best effect for nanomicelles (TPTN) derived from a conjugate defined as TPT. After intravenous delivery, TPTN efficiently accumulates in the aneurysmal tissue of AAA rats, showing notable distribution in neutrophils, macrophages and VSMCs, all relevant to AAA pathogenesis. Whereas three examined nanomicelles effectively delay expansion of AAA in rats, TPTN most potently prevents AAA growth by simultaneously normalizing the pro-inflammatory microenvironment and regulating multiple pathological cells. TPTN is effective even at 0.2&#160;mg&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Besides, TPTN can function as a bioactive nanoplatform for site-specifically delivering and triggerably releasing anti-aneurysmal drugs, affording synergistic therapeutic effects. Consequently, TPTN is a promising multi-bioactive nanotherapy and bioresponsive targeting delivery nanocarrier for effective therapy of AAA and other inflammatory vascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Smart Photothermal Nanosystem with an Intrinsic Temperature&#8208;Control Mechanism for Thermostatic Treatment of Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart photothermal nanosystem with an intrinsic temperature&#8208;control mechanism is established for thermostatic treatment of bacterial infections. In contrast to conventional photothermal therapy with severe thermal damage, the reported smart photothermal nanosystem provides an internal protection mechanism on healthy tissues and/or organs, which remarkably accelerates the recovery of bacteria&#8208;infected wounds.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted extensive attention in disease treatments. However, conventional photothermal systems do not possess a temperature&#8208;control mechanism, which poses a serious risk to healthy tissues and/or organs due to inevitable thermal damage. Herein, a smart photothermal nanosystem with an intrinsic temperature&#8208;control mechanism for thermostatic treatment of bacterial infections is reported. The smart photothermal nanosystem is constructed by loading a thermochromic material into a hollow&#8208;structured silica nanocarrier, in which the thermochromic material is composed of naturally occurring phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs), a proton&#8208;responsive spirolactone, and a proton source. The resulting nanosystem shows strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and efficient photothermal conversion in solid PCMs but becomes NIR&#8208;transparent when PCMs are melted upon NIR irradiation. Such an attractive feature can precisely regulate the photothermal equilibrium temperature to the melting point of PCMs, regardless of the variation in external experimental parameters. In contrast to conventional PTT with severe thermal damage, the reported smart photothermal nanosystem provides an internal protection mechanism on healthy tissues and/or organs, which remarkably accelerates the recovery of bacteria&#8208;infected wounds. The smart photothermal nanosystem is a versatile PTT platform, holding great promise in the safe and efficient treatment of bacterial infections and multimodality synergistic therapy.

         <title>Janus Helical Ribbon Structure of Ordered Nanowire Films for Flexible Solar Thermoelectric Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solar thermoelectric generator is fabricated with outstanding temperature difference and the property of synergistic utilization of solar energy and waste heat by in situ redox reaction to construct n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type, and photothermal sides in one nanowire film that is the reverse side of passive radiative cooling film. The ordered nanowire film also imparts the solar thermoelectric generator with better thermoelectrical performance.








Abstract
Solar thermoelectric devices play a significant role in addressing the problem of global warming, owing to their unique features of converting both waste heat and solar energy directly into electricity. Herein, a flexible 3D Janus helical ribbon architecture is designed, starting from well&#8208;aligned tellurium (Te) nanowire film, using an in situ redox process reacting with Ag+ and Cu2+ resulting in n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type, and photothermal sides in one film. Remarkably, the device shows all&#8208;day electricity generation and large temperature gradient by coupling the cold side with a passive radiative cooling technique and the hot side with a selective solar absorption technique, showing a temperature gradient of 29.5 K, which is much higher than previously reported devices under a low solar radiation of only 614 W m&#8722;2. Especially, the device can still generate electricity even at night. The present strategy offers a new way for heat management by efficiently utilizing solar energy and the cold of the universe.

         <title>Local Diverse Polarization Optimized Comprehensive Energy&#8208;Storage Performance in Lead&#8208;Free Superparaelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent energy&#8208;storage properties with an ultrahigh recoverable energy storage density &#8776;10.59 J cm&#8722;3 and a large efficiency &#8776;87.6% are realized in lead&#8208;free relaxor ferroelectrics, which is responsible by the local diverse polarization design, leading to the ultrasmall polar nanoregions, reduced heat loss, substantially enhanced polarization, and breakdown electric field compared to single polarization configuration.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free dielectric ceramics with ultrahigh energy&#8208;storage performance are the core components used in next&#8208;generation advanced pulse power capacitors. However, the low energy storage density largely hinders their development towards miniaturization, lightweight, and integration. Here, an effective strategy of constructing local diverse polarization is designed in superparaelectrics to realize an ultrahigh energy storage density of &#8776;10.59 J cm&#8722;3 as well as a large efficiency of &#8776;87.6%. The excellent comprehensive energy&#8208;storage performance is mainly attributed to the design of ultrasmall polar nanoregions with local diverse polarization configuration, confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy, leading to the reduced heat loss, substantially enhanced polarization, and breakdown electric field compared to ceramics with single polarization configuration. Benefiting from these features, outstanding temperature/frequency/cycling stability and superior charge/discharge performance (power density &#8776;187.5 MW cm&#8722;3, discharge energy density &#8776;3.52 J cm&#8722;3, discharge rate &#8776;77&#160;ns) are also achieved. This work demonstrates that local diverse polarization is a super strategy to design new dielectric materials with high energy&#8208;storage performance.

         <title>Metal Confined in 2D Membranes for Molecular Recognition and Sieving towards Ethylene/Ethane Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rationally confining metal into 2D&#160;sub&#8208;nanometer channels, a graphene oxide (GO) interlayer with size&#8208;sieving property and molecular recognition effect can efficiently discriminate ethylene over ethane. The GO membrane exhibits outstanding separation performance far exceeding the ethylene/ethane upper&#8208;bound. The metal confined in the 2D nanostructure will be of interest in other fields such as single&#8208;atom catalysis, sensors, and energy conversion.








Abstract
Membranes with nanochannels have exhibited great potential in molecular separations, while it remains a great challenge to separate molecules with very close physical properties and kinetic diameters (e.g., ethylene/ethane) owing to the lack of size&#8208;sieving property and specific affinity. Herein, a metal confined 2D&#160;sub&#8208;nanometer channel is reported to successfully discriminate ethylene over ethane via molecular recognition and sieving. Transition metal cations are paired with polyelectrolyte anions to achieve high dissociation activity, forming reversible complexation with ethylene. Aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy observes that the metals with size of &#8776;2&#160;nm are uniformly confined in graphene oxide (GO) interlayer channels with average height of &#8776;0.44&#160;nm, thereby cooperating the size&#8208;sieving effect with a molecular recognition ability toward ethylene and stimulating its selective transport over ethane. The resulting ultrathin (&#8776;60&#160;nm) membrane exhibits superior ethylene/ethane separation performance far beyond the polymeric upper&#8208;bound. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the metal@2D interlayer channel provides a molecular recognition pathway for selective gas transport. The proposed metal confined in 2D channel with molecular recognition and sieving properties would have broad application in other related fields such as single&#8208;atom catalysis, sensor and energy conversion.

         <title>A Optically Controlled Virtual Microsensor for Biomarker Detection In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new technique for biomarker detection in vivo, named as &#8220;optically controlled virtual microsensor&#8221; (OCViM), is developed by employing a specially shaped laser beam as a virtual handle and a fluorescent nanoprobe as the sensor tip. With the advantages of noninvasiveness, active control, and high resolution, OCViM demonstrates great potential for studying thrombosis in living zebrafish.








Abstract
Current technologies for the real&#8208;time analysis of biomarkers in vivo, such as needle&#8208;type microelectrodes and molecular imaging methods based on exogenous contrast agents, are still facing great challenges in either invasive detection or lack of active control of the imaging probes. In this study, by combining the design concepts of needle&#8208;type microelectrodes and the fluorescence imaging method, a new technique is developed for detecting biomarkers in vivo, named as &#8220;optically controlled virtual microsensor&#8221; (OCViM). OCViM is established by the organic integration of a specially shaped laser beam and fluorescent nanoprobe, which serve as the virtual handle and sensor tip, respectively. The laser beam can trap and manipulate the nanoprobe in a programmable manner, and meanwhile excite it to generate fluorescence emission for biosensing. On this basis, fully active control of the nanoprobe is achieved noninvasively in vivo, and multipoint detection can be realized at sub&#8208;micrometer resolution by shifting a nanoprobe among multiple positions. By using OCViM, the overexpression and heterogenous distribution of biomarkers in the thrombus is studied in living zebrafish, which is further utilized for the evaluation of antithrombotic drugs. OCViM may provide a powerful tool for the mechanism study of thrombus progression and the evaluation of antithrombotic drugs.

         <title>Morphology&#8208;Control Growth of Graphene Islands by Nonlinear Carbon Supply</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional nonlinear&#8208;carbon&#8208;supply growth strategy for synthesizing hexagonal graphene with specific sizes is presented. The dynamic adjustment of the carbon supply and precise control of the growth and etching processes result in the direct growth of graphene&#8208;based tunnel&#8208;junction structures and small&#8208;gapped quasi&#8208;monolayer films. This study provides a foundation for directly synthesizing 2D materials for applications in highly integrated electronics.








Abstract
Controlling the morphology of graphene and other 2D materials in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth is crucial because the morphology reflects the crystal quality of as&#8208;synthesized nanomaterials in a certain way, and consequently it indirectly represents the physical properties of 2D materials such as bandgap, selective ion transportation, and impermeability. However, precise control of the morphology is limited by the complex formation mechanism and sensitive growth&#8208;environment factors of graphene. Therefore, the CVD synthesis of single&#8208;crystal hexagonal&#8208;shaped graphene islands with specific sizes is challenging. Herein, an unconventional nonlinear&#8208;carbon&#8208;supply growth strategy is proposed to realize controllable CVD growth of desired hexagonal graphene islands with specific sizes on Cu substrates. Large&#8208;area graphene films of isolated islands with desired densities, sizes, and distances between the islands are&#160;successfully synthesized. Subsequently, the direct growth of a planar&#8208;tunnel&#8208;junction structure based on two parallel gapped graphene islands is&#160;achieved by specific adjustment of the growth and etching processes of graphene CVD synthesis. It is therefore demonstrated that the nonlinear&#8208;carbon&#8208;supply growth strategy is a reliable method for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality graphene and can facilitate the direct growth of graphene&#8208;based nanodevices in the future.

         <title>Multifunctionality of Li2SrNb2O7: Memristivity, Tunable Rectification, Ferroelasticity, and Ferroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered perovskite Li2SrNb2O7&#160;bulk single crystals are synthesized. At room temperature, Li ions show significant intralayer activities, which creates a giant memristivity and a rectification effect combining with a relaxation upon time. At low temperature, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity and in&#8208;plane antiferroelectricity develop, and the rectification state becomes robust. The results demonstrate a selectively controlling of the ferroic orders and ionic migration.








Abstract
Layered Li2SrNb2O7, an inorganic oxide in its bulk single&#8208;crystalline form, is experimentally demonstrated to exhibit multiple structural facets such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, and antiferroelectricity. The transition from a room temperature (RT) centrosymmetric structure to a low&#8208;temperature out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric and in&#8208;plane antiferroelectric structure and the low&#8208;temperature (LT) ferroelectric domain configuration are unveiled in TEM, piezoresponse force microscopy, and polarization loop studies. Li2SrNb2O7&#160;also exhibits highly tunable ferroelasticity and excellent Li+ in&#8208;plane conduction, which leads to a giant in&#8208;plane memristor behavior and an in&#8208;plane electronic conductivity increase by three orders of magnitude by electric poling at room RT). The accumulation of Li+ vacancies at the crystal&#8211;electrode interface is visualized using in&#160;situ optical microscopy. The Li&#8208;ionic biased state shows a clear in&#8208;plane rectification effect combined with a significant relaxation upon time at RT. Relaxation can be fully suppressed at LTs such as 200&#160;K, and utilizing an electric field cooling, a stable rectification can be achieved at 200&#160;K. The results shed light on the selective control of multifunctionalities such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, and ionic&#8208;migration&#8208;mediated effects (a memristor effect and rectification) in a single&#8208;phase bulk material utilizing, for example, different directions, temperatures, frequencies, and magnitudes of electric field.

         <title>Efficient Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Heavy&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient In(Zn)As&#8211;In(Zn)P&#8211;GaP&#8211;ZnS colloidal quantum dot (CQD) light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) that operate with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 13.3% at 1006 nm are reported. The implementation of a thin hole&#8208;transporting poly(vinylcarbazole) (PVK) layer at the electron&#8208;injecting side of the device gives rise to improved charge balance and luminescence efficiencies.








Abstract
Short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) light emission is important for a diverse range of modern applications, such as eye&#8208;safe depth sensing, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), facial recognition, eye tracking, optical communication, and health&#8208;monitoring technologies. However, there are a very limited number of known semiconductors that can emit efficiently in the SWIR spectral range. Presently, SWIR light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on colloidal quantum dots (CQD) are dominated by lead chalcogenide systems, despite the presence of heavy metal and modest efficiencies. Here, a highly efficient SWIR LED based on heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free indium arsenide (InAs) core&#8211;shell CQDs is presented. In the LED design, the implementation of an otherwise hole&#8208;transporting poly(vinylcarbazole) (PVK) layer on the electron&#8208;injecting side of the device stack leads to a surprising enhancement in device performance, giving remarkably high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 13.3% at 1006 nm. Single&#8208;carrier device and optical investigations reveal the origins of enhancement to be the electronic decoupling of the CQD layer with the electron&#8208;injecting zinc oxide (ZnO) layer, which mitigates luminescence quenching and improves charge balance. This work marks one of the highest efficiencies reported for heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free solution&#8208;processed LEDs in the SWIR spectral region, and can find significant applications in emerging consumer electronic technologies.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short-wave infrared (SWIR) light emission is important for a diverse range of modern applications, such as eye-safe depth sensing, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), facial recognition, eye tracking, optical communication, and health-monitoring technologies. However, there are a very limited number of known semiconductors that can emit efficiently in the SWIR spectral range. Presently, SWIR light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on colloidal quantum dots (CQD) are dominated by lead chalcogenide systems, despite the presence of heavy metal and modest efficiencies. Here, a highly efficient SWIR LED based on heavy-metal-free indium arsenide (InAs) core&#8211;shell CQDs is presented. In the LED design, the implementation of an otherwise hole-transporting poly(vinylcarbazole) (PVK) layer on the electron-injecting side of the device stack leads to a surprising enhancement in device performance, giving remarkably high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 13.3% at 1006 nm. Single-carrier device and optical investigations reveal the origins of enhancement to be the electronic decoupling of the CQD layer with the electron-injecting zinc oxide (ZnO) layer, which mitigates luminescence quenching and improves charge balance. This work marks one of the highest efficiencies reported for heavy-metal-free solution-processed LEDs in the SWIR spectral region, and can find significant applications in emerging consumer electronic technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Design of Molybdenum&#8211;Selenium Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical role of the synergy between nonmetallic single atoms and transition&#8208;metal single atoms for the promotion of electrochemical CO2 reduction performance is highlighted. This is similar to the synergy of nonmetallic elements and metal active centers in enzymes. More importantly, the distance effect between nonmetallic single atoms and transition&#8208;metal single atoms is clarified.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) is becoming an increasingly important technology for achieving carbon neutrality. Inspired by the structure of naturally occurring Mo&#8208;dependent enzymes capable of activating CO2, a heteronuclear Mo&#8211;Se dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom electrocatalyst (MoSA&#8211;SeSA) for ECR into CO with a Faradaic efficiency of above 90% over a broad potential window from &#8722;0.4 to &#8722;1.0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode is demonstrated here. Both operando characterization and theoretical simulation results verify that MoSA acts as central atoms that directly interact with the ECR feedstock and intermediates, whereas the SeSA adjacent to MoSA modulates the electronic structure of MoSA through long&#8208;range electron delocalization for inhibiting MoSA poisoning caused by strong CO adsorption. In addition, the SeSAs far from MoSA help suppress the competing hydrogen evolution side reaction and accelerate the CO2 transport by repelling H2O. This work provides new insight into the precise regulation and in&#8208;depth understanding of multisite synergistic catalysis at the atomic scale.

         <title>A Honeycomb&#8208;Like Porous Crystalline Hetero&#8208;Electrocatalyst for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of honeycomb&#8208;like metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)@covalent organic framework (COF) heterostructures with integrated porous MOF template and ultrathin COF coating are synthesized and successfully applied in efficient CO2 electroreduction to CH4.








Abstract
Porous heterostructured electrocatalysts with multifunctionality and synergistic effect have much benefit for efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet it still remains a daunting challenge to explore heterostructures based on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in this field. Here, a series of honeycomb&#8208;like porous crystalline hetero&#8208;electrocatalysts (MCH&#8208;X, X&#160;= 1&#8211;4, X stands for the numbered sample obtained from different MOF doses in the synthesis of the MCH) are synthesized, and these are successfully applied in electrocatalytic CO2RR. The specially designed heterostructures with integrated porous MOF&#8208;template and ultrathin COF&#8208;coating enable efficient CO2 adsorption/activation and conversion into CH4. The best of them, MCH&#8208;3, shows greatly inhibited H2 evolution, excellent current density (&#8722;398.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), and superior FECH4${\rm{F}}{{\rm{E}}_{{\rm{C}}{{\rm{H}}_4}}}$ (76.7%) to the physical mixture (38.0%), the MOF@COF without the honeycomb&#8208;like morphology (47.7%), and the bare COF (37.5%) and MOF (15.9%) at &#8722;1.0&#160;V. Based on the density functional theory calculations and various characterizations, the vital roles of the MOF in facilitating CO2 adsorption/activation, stabilizing intermediates, and conquering the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step are intensively studied.

         <title>Chemical Welding of the Electrode&#8211;Electrolyte Interface by Zn&#8208;Metal&#8208;Initiated In Situ Gelation for Ultralong&#8208;Life Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ gel electrolyte initiated by Zn metal produces chemical welding between the anode and the electrolyte, enabling a well&#8208;bonded and water&#8208;poor electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface that suppresses the growth of Zn dendrites and side reactions while improving the Zn utilization up to 87%. The as&#8208;prepared cells showcase superior cycling stability, with an ultralong life of over 212&#160;days.








Abstract
A compatible and robust electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface is favorable in resolving the severe dendritic growth and side reactions of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries toward commercial&#8208;standard lifespan and charging&#8211;discharging rate. Herein, a chemical welding strategy through in&#160;situ construction of a gel electrolyte that enables Zn&#8208;ion batteries to achieve ultralong life and reversibility is reported. The gel electrolyte is spontaneously formed on the Zn anode surface by redox polymerization with the initiation of Zn metal. The direct participation of the Zn anode in the chemical synthesis of the gel electrolyte brings a well&#8208;bonded and water&#8208;poor electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, which not only alleviates side reactions but also enables preferential (002) Zn deposition. The in&#160;situ symmetric cell thus prepared delivers an ultralong lifespan of 5100&#160;h (&gt;212&#160;days), and a hybrid capacitor with the in&#160;situ electrolyte runs smoothly over 40&#160;000&#160;cycles at 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Even at an ultrahigh current density of 40&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;and capacity of 40&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, the cell still operates stably for 240&#160;h, alongside a high Zn utilization with 87% depth of discharge. The in&#160;situ gel electrolyte integrating robust interface and preparation of all&#8208;in&#8208;one cells demonstrate a commercializable path for aqueous Zn&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Strong Electronic Metal&#8211;Support Interaction between Iridium Single Atoms and a WO3 Support Promotes Highly Efficient and Robust CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir single atoms are stably anchored on the WO3 support via a strong electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI). The catalyst demonstrates an excellent activity and stability for the CO2 cycloaddition of styrene oxide to styrene carbonate at relatively low temperatures, superior to most other heterogeneous competitors. Such a great performance is understood as a direct result of the strong EMSI effect.








Abstract
The carbon dioxide (CO2) cycloaddition of epoxides to cyclic carbonates is of great industrial importance owing to the high economical values of its products. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have great potential in CO2 cycloaddition by virtue of their high atom utilization efficiency and desired activity, but they generally suffer from poor reaction stability and catalytic activity arising from the weak interaction between the active centers and the supports. In this work, Ir single atoms stably anchored on the WO3 support (Ir1&#8211;WO3) are developed with a strong electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI). Superior CO2 cycloaddition is realized in the Ir1&#8211;WO3 catalyst via the EMSI effect: 100% conversion efficiency for the CO2 cycloaddition of styrene oxide to styrene carbonate after 15&#160;h at 40 &#176;C and excellent stability with no degradation even after ten reaction cycles for a total of more than 150&#160;h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the EMSI effect results in significant charge redistribution between the Ir single atoms and the WO3 support, and consequently lowers the energy barrier associated with epoxide ring opening. This work furnishes new insights into the catalytic mechanism of CO2 cycloaddition and would guide the design of stable SACs for efficient CO2 cycloaddition reactions.

         <title>Triple&#8208;Function Electrolyte Regulation toward Advanced Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn&#8208;battery issues in aqueous media are fundamentally studied, revealing that besides the well&#8208;known H2 evolution and dendrite growth, Zn electrodes also face an O2&#8208;involving corrosion reaction. Thus, a one&#8208;off electrolyte regulation is proposed by introducing the triple&#8208;function C3H7Na2O6P additive, which can take effects to suppress the O2&#8208;involving corrosion reaction, water decomposition, and dendritic deposition during the shelf time.








Abstract
The poor Zn reversibility has been criticized for limiting applications of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs); however, its behavior in aqueous media is not fully uncovered yet. Here, this knowledge gap is addressed, indicating that Zn electrodes face a O2&#8208;involving corrosion, besides H2 evolution and dendrite growth. Differing from aqueous Li/Na batteries, removing O2 cannot enhance ZIB performance because of the aggravated competing H2 evolution. To address Zn issues, a one&#8208;off electrolyte strategy is reported by introducing the triple&#8208;function C3H7Na2O6P, which can take effects during the shelf time of battery. It regulates H+ concentration and reduces free&#8208;water activity, inhibiting H2 evolution. A self&#8208;healing solid/electrolyte interphase (SEI) can be triggered before battery operation, which suppresses O2 adsorption corrosion and dendritic deposition. Consequently, a high Zn reversibility of 99.6% is achieved under a high discharge depth of 85%. The pouch full&#8208;cell with a lean electrolyte displays a record lifespan with capacity retention of 95.5% after 500 cycles. This study not only looks deeply into Zn behavior in aqueous media but also underscores rules for the design of active metal anodes, including Zn and Li metals, during shelf time toward real applications.

A flexible and robust quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (QSSE) with a &#8220;tree&#8208;trunk&#8221; structure is designed for ultralong&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries, in which an in&#8208;situ&#8208;grown metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer covers the cellulose&#8208;based framework to form hierarchical ion&#8208;channels, enabling rapid ionic transfer kinetics and excellent durability.








Abstract
The construction of robust (quasi)&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) for flexible lithium&#8208;metal batteries is desirable but extremely challenging. Herein, a novel, flexible, and robust quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (QSSE) with a &#8220;tree&#8208;trunk&#8221; design is reported for ultralong&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). An in&#8208;situ&#8208;grown metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer covers the cellulose&#8208;based framework to form hierarchical ion&#8208;channels, enabling rapid ionic transfer kinetics and excellent durability. A conductivity of 1.36&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, a transference number of 0.72, an electrochemical window of 5.26&#160;V, and a good rate performance are achieved. The flexible LMBs fabricated with as&#8208;designed QSSEs deliver areal capacity of up to 3.1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at the initial cycle with high mass loading of 14.8&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 in Li&#8208;NCM811 cells and can retain &#8776;80% capacity retention after 300 cycles. An ultralong&#8208;life of 3000 cycles (6000&#160;h) is also achieved in Li&#8208;LiFePO4 cells. This work presents a promising route in constructing a flexible QSSE toward ultralong&#8208;life LMBs, and also provides a design rationale for material and structure development in the area of energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Universal Metasurfaces for Complete Linear Control of Coherent Light Transmission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is proved&#160;that a bilayer nanostructure array is sufficient to completely control amplitudes, polarizations, and phases of coherent light transmission. Universal metasurfaces with such full control are realized with silicon nanostructures. A new kind of 3D&#160;vector hologram and a general platform for arbitrary optical transformation are demonstrated. This work provides another degree of freedom in light transmission control.








Abstract
Recent advances in metasurfaces and optical nanostructures have enabled complex control of incident light with optically thin devices. However, it has thus far been unclear whether it is possible to achieve complete linear control of coherent light transmission, that is, independent control of polarization, amplitude, and phase for both input polarization states, with just a single, thin nanostructure array. Here, it is proved possible, and a universal metasurface is proposed, a bilayer array of high&#8208;index elliptic cylinders&#160;that possesses a complete degree of optical freedom with fully designable chirality and anisotropy. The completeness of achievable light control is mathematically shown with corresponding Jones matrices, new types of 3D&#160;holographic schemes that&#160;were&#160;formerly impossible are experimentally demonstrated, and a systematic way of realizing any input&#8208;state&#8208;sensitive vector linear optical device is presented. The results unlock previously inaccessible degrees of freedom in light transmission control.

         <dc:description>
2D layered materials, exhibiting exotic structural, electrical, and magnetic properties, provide a superior platform for implementing novel quantum devices&#8212;from tunneling diodes and transistors, to spin&#8208;FETs, valley&#8208;FETs, and qubits. The physics are highlighted and the opportunities and challenges of exploiting the unique quantum properties of 2D materials to enable revolutionary ultra&#8208;energy&#8208;efficient quantum devices are analyzed.








Abstract
As an approximation to the quantum state of solids, the band theory, developed nearly seven decades ago, fostered the advance of modern integrated solid&#8208;state electronics, one of the most successful technologies in the history of human civilization. Nonetheless, their rapidly growing energy consumption and accompanied environmental issues call for more energy&#8208;efficient electronics and optoelectronics, which necessitate the exploration of more advanced quantum mechanical effects, such as band&#8208;to&#8208;band tunneling, spin&#8211;orbit coupling, spin&#8211;valley locking, and quantum entanglement. The emerging 2D layered materials, featured by their exotic electrical, magnetic, optical, and structural properties, provide a revolutionary low&#8208;dimensional and manufacture&#8208;friendly platform (and many more opportunities) to implement these quantum&#8208;engineered devices, compared to the traditional electronic materials system. Here, the progress in quantum&#8208;engineered devices is reviewed and the opportunities/challenges of exploiting 2D materials are analyzed to highlight their unique quantum properties that enable novel energy&#8208;efficient devices, and useful insights to quantum device engineers and 2D&#8208;material scientists are provided.

         <title>Nonequilibrium Lattice Dynamics in Photoexcited 2D Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonequilibrium structures of 2D perovskites are studied using ultrafast X&#8208;ray diffraction. Diffraction peaks post&#8208;photoexcitation increase in intensity and narrow over 1 ns, suggesting an increase in long&#8208;range order within the lead iodide octahedra. These results are corroborated using ultrafast photoluminescence, which shows redshifting and narrowing of photoluminescence peaks on the same timescale as transient X&#8208;ray diffraction.








Abstract
Interplay between structural and photophysical properties of metal halide perovskites is critical to their utility in optoelectronics, but there is limited understanding of lattice response upon photoexcitation. Here, 2D perovskites butylammonium lead iodide, (BA)2PbI4, and phenethylammonium lead iodide, (PEA)2PbI4, are investigated using ultrafast transient X&#8208;ray diffraction as a function of optical excitation fluence to discern structural dynamics. Both powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence linewidths narrow over 1 ns following optical excitation for the fluence range studied, concurrent with slight redshifting of the optical bandgaps. These observations are attributed to transient relaxation and ordering of distorted lead iodide octahedra stimulated mainly by electron&#8211;hole pair creation. The c axis expands up to 0.37% over hundreds of picoseconds; reflections sampling the a and b axes undergo one tenth of this expansion with the same timescale. Post&#8208;photoexcitation appearance of the (110) reflection in (BA)2PbI4 would suggest a transient phase transition,&#160;however, through new single&#8208;crystal XRD, reflections are found that violate glide plane conditions in the reported Pbca structure. The static structure space group is reassigned as P212121. With this, a nonequilibrium phase transition is ruled out. These findings offer increased understanding of remarkable lattice response in 2D perovskites upon excitation.

         <title>Sprayable Hydrogel for Instant Sealing of Vascular Anastomosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bleeding related complications following vascular surgery represent a real challenge for patients and their clinicians. Commercially available materials force clinicians to choose between adequate performance or adequate biocompatibility. An adhesive hydrogel approach, combining oxidized dextran, oxidized alginate, and polyamidoamine (PAMAM) allows sealing at the tissue:graft interface while maintaining biocompatibility. The biocompatibility and functionality of this family of materials is been tested in small and large animal models.








Abstract
Bleeding&#8208;related complications following vascular surgeries occur in up to half of the patients&#8212;500&#8201;000 cases annually in the United States alone. This results in additional procedures, increased mortality rate, and prolonged hospitalization, posing a burden on the healthcare system. Commercially available materials rely, in large, on forming covalent bonds between the tissue and the biomaterial to achieve adhesion. Here, it is shown that a biomaterial based on oxidized alginate and oxidized dextran together with polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer amine provides simultaneous electrostatic and covalent interactions between the biomaterial and the tissue, maximizing adhesion. This study finds that the material withstands supraphysiological pressures (&#8776;300&#160;mmHg) and prevents bleeding in a rabbit aortic puncture model and in a pig carotid bilateral poly(tetrafluoroethylene) graft model&#8212;achieving superior performance to commercially available materials such as Tisseel and BioGlue. Material biocompatibility is validated in comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines, including in vitro neutral red uptake test, subcutaneous implantation in rabbits, ames genotoxicity, and guinea pig maximization test. This material has the potential to provide with adequate seal and reduced complications following complex vascular surgeries, including hard&#8208;to&#8208;seal tissue&#8211;graft interfaces.

         <title>Over 200 &#176;C Broad Temperature Lasers Reconstructed from Blue Phase Polymer Scaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Blue phase liquid crystal (BPLC) lasers have received extensive attention and potential applications in sensors, displays, and anticounterfeiting, owing to their unique three&#8208;dimensional photonic bandgap. However, the working temperature range of such BPLC lasers is insufficient and investigations are required to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Herein, a broad temperature reconstructed laser is successfully achieved in dye&#8208;doped polymer&#8208;stabilized blue phase liquid crystals (DD&#8208;PSBPLCs) with an unprecedented working temperature range of 25&#176;C &#8764; 230&#176;C based on a robust polymer scaffold, which combines the thermal stability and the tunability from the system. The broad temperature lasing stems from the high thermal stability of the robust polymerized system used there, which affords enough reflected and matached fluorescent signals. While the temperature&#8208;tunable lasing behavior of the DD&#8208;PSBPLCs is associated with the phase transition of the unpolymerized content (&#8764; 60 wt%) in the system, which endows with a reconstructed characteristic of BP lasers including a U&#8208;shaped lasing threshold, a reversible lasing wavelength and an obvious lasing enhancement at about 70 &#176;C. This work not only provides a new idea for the design of broad temperature BPLCs lasers, but also sets out important insight in innovative microstructure changes for novel multi&#8208;functional organic optic devices.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Sustainable Defect&#8208;Passivation for Stable Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>

Abstract
The generation of photoinduced defects and freely moving halogen ions is dynamically updated in real time. Accordingly, most reported strategies are static and short&#8208;term, which make their improvements in photostability very limited. Therefore, seeking for new passivation strategies to match the dynamic characteristics of defect generation is very urgent. Without newly generated defects, the passivation molecule should exist in the configuration which would not become the initiation sites for defect generation. With newly generated defects, the passivation molecule should transfer into the other configuration which owns the passivation sites. Herein, we adopted a classical photoisomeric molecule spiropyran, whose pre and post isomeric forms meet the requirements for two different configurations, to realize the state transition once the photo induced defects appear during subsequent operation and dynamic capture for continuous renewal defects. Consequently, spiropyrans worked as the light&#8208;triggered and self&#8208;healing sustainable passivation sites to realize continuous defects repairing. The target devices kept 93% and 99% of their initial power conversion efficiencies after 456&#160;h aging under ultraviolet illumination and 1200&#160;h aging under full&#8208;spectrum illumination, respectively. This work provides a novel concept of sustainable passivation strategy to realize continuous defect&#8208;passivation and film&#8208;healing in perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelled Nanomotors with Alloyed Engine for Emergency Rescue of Traumatic Brain Injury</title>

Abstract
In severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI), acute oxidative stress and inflammatory cascades rapidly spread to cause irreversible brain damage and low survival rate within minutes. Therefore, developing feasible solution for the quick&#8208;treatment of life&#8208;threatening emergency is urgently demanded to earn time for hospital treatment. We herein carefully constructed Janus catalysis&#8208;driven nanomotors (JCNs) via plasma&#8208;induced alloying technology and sputtering&#8208;caused half coating strategy. The theoretical calculation and experiment results indicated that heteroatom&#8208;doping alloyed engine endowed JCNs much higher catalytic activity for removing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) than common Pt&#8208;based engine. When JCNs were dropped to the surface of ruptured skull, they can effectively catalyze endogenous hydrogen peroxide, which induces movement as fuels to promote JCNs to deep brain lesions for further nanocatalysts&#8208;mediated cascade&#8208;blocking therapy (CBT). Results demonstrated that JCNs successfully blocked the inflammatory cascades, thereby reversing multiple behavioral defects and dramatically declining the mortality of sTBI mice. Together, this work provides a revolutionary nanomotors&#8208;based strategy to sense brain injury and scavenge oxidative stress. Meanwhile, our JCNs provide a feasible strategy to adapt various first aid scenarios due to their self&#8208;propelled movement combined with highly multienzymes&#8208;like catalytic activity, exhibiting tremendous therapeutic potential to help people for emergency pretreatment.

         <title>Strong and Tough Supramolecular Microneedle Patches with Ultrafast Dissolution and Rapid&#8208;onset Capabilities</title>

Abstract
Dissolving microneedle (DMN) patches are emerging as a minimally&#8208;invasive and efficient transdermal drug delivery platform. Generally, noncrystalline, water&#8208;soluble, and high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers are employed in DMN because their sufficient intermolecular interactions can endow DMN with necessary mechanical strength and toughness. However, high viscosity and heavy chain entanglement of polymer solutions greatly hinder processing and dissolution of polymeric DMNs. Here, we describe a strong and tough supramolecular DMN made of highly water&#8208;soluble cyclodextrin (CD) derivatives. Due to the synergy of multiple supramolecular interactions, CD DMN patch exhibits robust mechanical strength outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymeric DMNs. CD DMN displays ultrafast dissolution (&lt; 30 s) in skin models by virtue of the dynamic and weak noncovalent bonds, which also enables CD DMN and its payloads to diffuse rapidly into the deep skin layer. Moreover, the unique supramolecular structure of CD allows CD DMN to load not only hydrophilic drugs (e.g., rhodamine B as model) but also hydrophobic model drugs (e.g., ibuprofen). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, CD DMN loading ibuprofen shows a rapid onset of therapeutic action in a xylene&#8208;induced acute inflammation model in mice. This work opens a new avenue for the development of mechanically robust supramolecular DMN and broadens the applications of supramolecular materials.

         <title>Decoupled Electrochemical Hydrazine &#8220;Splitting&#8221; via Rechargeable Zn&#8208;Hydrazine Battery</title>

Abstract
Hydrogen generation via electrochemical splitting plays an important role to achieve hydrogen economy. However, the large&#8208;scale application is highly limited by high cost and low efficiency. Herein, a new type of rechargeable Zn&#8208;Hydrazine (Zn&#8208;Hz) battery is proposed and realized by a bifunctional electrocatalyst based on two separate cathodic reactions of hydrogen evolution (discharge: 2H2O + 2e&#8722; &#8594; H2 + 2OH&#8722;) and hydrazine oxidation (charge: 1/2N2H4 + 2OH&#8722; &#8594; 1/2N2 + 2H2O + 2e&#8722;). This Zn&#8208;Hz battery, driven by temporally decoupled electrochemical hydrazine splitting on cathode during discharge and charge processes, can generate separated hydrogen without purification. When the highly active bifunctional cathode of three&#8208;dimensional Mo2C/Ni@C/CS is paired with Zn foil, the Zn&#8208;Hz battery can achieve efficient hydrogen generation with low energy input of less than 0.4&#160;V (77.2&#160;kJ/mol) and high energy efficiency of 96%. Remarkably, this battery exhibits outstanding long&#8208;term stability for 600 cycles (200&#160;h), getting continuous hydrogen production on demand, which presents great potential for practical application.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Homojunction Organic Nonfullerene Photovoltaics Featuring Fundamentals Distinct from Bulk Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In contrast to classical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) in organic solar cells (OSCs), quasi&#8208;homojunction (QHJ) with extremely low donor contents (&#8804; 10 wt%) is unusual and generally yields much lower device efficiency. Here, we select representative polymer donors and nonfullerene acceptors to fabricate QHJ OSCs, and illustrate a complete picture for the operation mechanisms of high&#8208;efficiency QHJ devices. PTB7&#8208;Th:Y6 QHJ devices at donor: acceptor (D:A) ratios of 1:8 or 1:20 can achieve 95% or 64% of the efficiency obtained from its BHJ counterpart at the optimal D:A ratio of 1:1.2, respectively, whereas QHJ devices with other donors or acceptors suffer from rapid roll&#8208;off of efficiency when the donors are diluted. Moreover, these QHJ devices show superior thermal stability compared to their BHJ counterparts. We use a suite of electronic device measurements, current&#8208;sensing atomic force microscopy, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray scattering morphology characterization to elucidate the fundamentals of the high&#8208;performance QHJ devices. A large portion of free charges can be intrinsically generated in the neat Y6 domains rather than at the D/A interface. Y6 also serves as an ambipolar transport channel, so that hole transport can be realized with small amounts of donor PTB7&#8208;Th. The key role of the small amount of PTB7&#8208;Th is primarily to reduce charge recombination, likely assisted by enhancing quadrupolar fields within the Y6 itself, rather than the previously thought principal roles of light absorption, exciton splitting and hole transport.

         <title>Ionothermal Synthesis of Fully Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;capacity and Ultra&#8208;stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>

Abstract
Fully aromatic conjugated covalent organic frameworks (FAC&#8208;COFs) with excellent physicochemical stability have been emerging as active semiconductors for diverse potential applications. Developing efficient synthesis methods for fabricating FAC&#8208;COFs will significantly facilitate the exploration over their material and photonic/electronic functionalities. Herein, a facile solvent&#8208;free strategy was developed for the synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional phthalocyanine&#8208;based FAC&#8208;COFs (FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COFs). Cyclopolymerization of benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8216;]bis[1,4]benzodioxin&#8208;2,3,9,10&#8208;tetracarbonitrile and quinoxalino[2&#8220;,3&#8221;:9,10]phenanthro[4,5&#8208;abc]phenazine&#8208;6,7,15,16&#8208;tetracarbonitrile in ZnCl2 leads to the fast formation and isolation of BB&#8208;FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COF and QPP&#8208;FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COF, respectively. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and electron microscopy analysis reveal their crystalline nature with sql topology and AA stacking configuration. Thermogravimetric analysis and immersion experiment indicate their excellent stability. The conductivity test demonstrates their high conductivity of 0.93&#8208;1.94&#215;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 owing to the fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated electronic structural nature. In particular, the as&#8208;prepared FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COFs show high&#8208;performance K+ storage in potassium&#8208;ion batteries due to their excellent conductivity, highly ordered and robust structure, and N/O&#8208;rich framework nature. Impressively, QPP&#8208;FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COF shows a record&#8208;large reversible capacity of 424&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 among organic electrodes after 100 cycles at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and the capacity retention of nearly 100% at 2000&#160;mA g&#8722;1 for over 10000 cycles. The present result should be helpful for designing and fabricating fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic frameworks towards energy storage.

         <title>Overcoming the Outcoupling Limit of Perovskite Light&#8208;emitting Diodes with Artificially Formed Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art planar&#8208;structure perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is mainly limited by the outcoupling efficiency, which is around 20% and decreases significantly with the perovskite thickness. Here, we report an approach to artificially form textured perovskite films to boost the outcoupling limit of the PeLEDs. By manipulating the dwell time of antisolvents, the perovskite phase precipitation mechanism, film forming process, and surface texture can be finely controlled. The film surface roughness can be tuned from 15.3 to 241 nanometers, with haze increasing accordingly from 6% to &gt;90% for films with an average thickness of 1.5 micrometers. The light outcoupling limit increases accordingly from 11.7% for the flat PeLEDs to 26.5% for the textured PeLEDs due to photon scattering at the interface. Consequently, the EQE is boosted significantly from around 10% to 20.5% with an extraordinarily thick emissive layer of 1.5 micrometers. This study provides a novel way of forming light extraction nanostructures for perovskite optoelectronic devices.

By manipulating the dwell time of antisolvents, the perovskite phase precipitation mechanism, film forming process, and surface texture can be finely controlled. The film surface roughness can be tuned from 15.3 to 241 nanometers, with haze increasing accordingly from 6% to &amp;gt;90% for films with an average thickness of 1.5 micrometers. The light outcoupling limit increases accordingly from 11.7% for the flat PeLEDs to 26.5% for the textured PeLEDs due to photon scattering at the interface. Consequently, the EQE is boosted significantly from around 10% to 20.5% with an extraordinarily thick emissive layer of 1.5 micrometers. This study provides a novel way of forming light extraction nanostructures for perovskite optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dielectric Polymer with Designable Large Motion under Low Electric Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dielectric elastomers can perform fast and large in&#8208;plane expansion/contraction due to electric field induced Maxwell stress. For robotic applications, it is often necessary that the in&#8208;plane actuation is converted into out&#8208;of&#8208;plane motions with mechanical frames. Despite their performance appeal, their high driving electric field (20&#8208;100&#160;V/&#956;m) demands bulky power accessories and severely compromises the durability. Here, we report a dielectric polymer that can be programmed into diverse motions actuated under a low electric field (2&#8208;10&#160;V/&#956;m). The material is a crystalline dynamic covalent network that can be reconfigured into arbitrary 3D geometries. This gives rise to a geometric effect that markedly amplifies the actuation, leading to designable large motions when the dielectric polymer is heated above its melting temperature to become a dielectric elastomer. Additionally, the crystallization transition enables dynamic multi&#8208;modal motions and active deployability. These attributes result in unique design versatility for soft robots.

&lt;p&gt;Dielectric elastomers can perform fast and large in-plane expansion/contraction due to electric field induced Maxwell stress. For robotic applications, it is often necessary that the in-plane actuation is converted into out-of-plane motions with mechanical frames. Despite their performance appeal, their high driving electric field (20-100&#160;V/&#956;m) demands bulky power accessories and severely compromises the durability. Here, we report a dielectric polymer that can be programmed into diverse motions actuated under a low electric field (2-10&#160;V/&#956;m).

         <title>Self&#8208;powered, Implantable, and Wirelessly&#8208;Controlled NO Generation System for Intracranial Neuroglioma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Gas therapy has been emerging technology for improving cancer therapy with high efficiency and low side effects. However, due to the existence of the gatekeeper of blood &#8211; brain barrier (BBB) and limited availability of current drug delivery systems, there still have no reports on gas therapy for intracranial neuroglioma. Herein, we report an integrated, self&#8208;powered and wirelessly&#8208;controlled gas therapy system composed of a self&#8208;powered triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and implantable nitric oxide (NO) releasing device for intracranial neuroglioma therapy. In the system, the patient self&#8208;driven TENG converts the mechanical energy of body movements into electricity as a sustainable and self&#8208;controlled power source. When delivering the energy to lighten LED light in the implantable NO releasing device via wireless control, the encapsulated NO donor s&#8208;nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) can generate NO gas to locally kill the glioma cells. We verify the efficacy of the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept system in subcutaneous 4T1 breast cancer model in mice and intracranial glioblastoma multiforme in rats. This self&#8208;powered gas therapy system has great potential to be an effective adjuvant treatment modality to inhibit tumor growth, relapse, and invasion via teletherapy.

         <title>Vacancy Defects in 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Electrocatalysts: From Aggregated to Atomic Configuration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Vacancy defect engineering has been well leveraged to flexibly shape comprehensive physicochemical properties of diverse catalysts. In particular, growing research effort has been devoted to engineering chalcogen anionic vacancies (S/Se/Te) of two&#8208;dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) towards the ultimate performance limit of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In spite of remarkable progress achieved in the past decade, systematic and in&#8208;depth insights into the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art vacancy engineering for 2D TMDs&#8208;based electrocatalysis are still lacking. Herein, this review delivers a full picture of vacancy engineering evolving from aggregated to atomic configurations covering their development background, controllable manufacturing, thorough characterization and representative HER application. Of particular interest, the deep&#8208;seated correlations between specific vacancy regulation routes and resulted catalytic performance improvement are logically clarified in terms of atomic rearrangement, charge redistribution, energy band variation, intermediate adsorption&#8208;desorption optimization, and charge/mass transfer facilitation. Beyond that, a broader vision is cast into the cutting&#8208;edge research fields of vacancy engineering based single&#8208;atom catalysis and dynamic structure&#8208;performance correlations across catalyst service lifetime. Together with critical discussion on residual challenges and future prospects, this review sheds new light on the rational design of advanced defect catalysts and navigate their broader application in high&#8208;efficiency energy conversion and storage fields.

         <title>Large Exchange Coupling Between Localized Spins and Topological Bands in Magnetic Topological Insulator MnBi2Te4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Magnetism in topological materials creates phases exhibiting quantized transport phenomena with potential technological applications. The emergence of such phases relies on strong interaction between localized spins and the topological bands, and the consequent formation of an exchange gap. However, this remains experimentally unquantified in intrinsic magnetic topological materials. Here, this interaction is quantified in MnBi2Te4, an intrinsic antiferromagnetic topological insulator. To achieve this, a multimodal ultrafast approach is employed to interrogate optically induced nonequilibrium spin dynamics. Momentum&#8208;resolved ultrafast electron scattering and magneto&#8208;optic measurements show that Bi&#8208;Te p&#8208;like states comprising the bulk topological bands demagnetize via electron&#8208;phonon scattering at picosecond timescales. Localized Mn 3d spins, probed by ultrafast resonant X&#8208;ray scattering, are found to disorder concurrently with the p&#8208;like spins, despite being energetically decoupled from the optical excitation. These results, together with atomistic simulations, reveal that the exchange coupling between localized spins and the bulk topological bands is at least 100 times larger than the primary superexchange interaction, implying an optimal exchange gap of at least 25 meV in the topological surface states. By directly quantifying this exchange coupling, the study validates the materials&#8208;by&#8208;design strategy of utilizing localized magnetic order to create and manipulate magnetic topological phases, spanning static to ultrafast timescales.

         <title>Oral Supramolecular Adsorbent for Preventing Chemo&#8208;Induced Gastrointestinal Mucositis &amp; Microbial Dysbiosis and for Enhancing Chemoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The addition of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to cytotoxic chemotherapy has emerged as the first&#8208;line treatment for multiple cancers. Paradoxically, cytotoxic chemotherapy may limit the therapeutic potential of ICB by significantly impairing the largest immune organ, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and driving gut microbial dysbiosis. Here, we report an orally administered polymeric adsorbent containing a supramolecular motif (named SPORA&#8208;SN9) that can selectively remove chemotherapeutics from the GI tract, thereby preventing chemotherapy&#8208;induced GI mucositis and microbial dysbiosis and providing better chemoimmunotherapy synergy. By theoretical design and experimental screening of the molecular recognition motifs, SPORA&#8208;SN9 exhibits superior complexation capacity for doxorubicin and irinotecan and high selectivity over a range of commonly used combinational medications. In mouse models of chemotherapy&#8208;induced GI mucositis, SPORA&#8208;SN9 protected the integrity of the GI tissues and the homeostasis of the gut microbiota. Finally, the addition of SPORA&#8208;SN9 enhanced the efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. SPORA&#8208;SN9 offers a translational approach for supramolecular chemistry to modulate complex biosystems by selectively removing target substrates from the GI tract.

         <title>Dopant&#8208;free Bithiophene Imide&#8208;based Polymeric Hole Transporting Materials for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
The development of hole transport materials (HTMs) with high mobility, long&#8208;term stability and comprehensive passivation is of vital significance for simultaneously improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Herein, two donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugated polymers PBTI and PFBTI with alternated benzodithiophene (BDT) and bithiophene imide (BTI) units are successfully developed with desirable hole mobilities due to the good planarity and extended conjugation of molecular backbone. Both copolymers can be employed as HTMs with suitable energy levels and efficient defect passivation. Shortening the alkyl chain of the BTI unit and introducing fluorine atoms on the BDT moiety can effectively enhance the hole mobility and hydrophobicity of the HTMs, leading to improved efficiency and stability of PVSCs. As a result, the organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid PVSCs with PFBTI as HTM deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.1% with much enhanced long&#8208;term operational and ambient stability, which is one of the best efficiencies reported for the PVSCs with dopant&#8208;free polymeric HTMs to date. Moreover, PFBTI can also be applied in inorganic PVSCs and perovskite/organic tandem solar cells, achieving a record high PCE of 17.4% and 22.2%, respectively. These results illustrate the great potential of PFBTI as an efficient and widely applicable HTM for the fabrication of cost&#8208;effective and stable PVSCs.

         <title>Oxygen Evolution Activity of Amorphous Cobalt Oxyhydroxides: Interconnecting Precatalyst Reconstruction, LongRange Order, Buffer&#8208;Binding, Morphology, Mass Transport, and Operation Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nanocrystalline or amorphous cobalt oxyhydroxides (CoCat) are promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). While having the same shortrange order, CoCat phases possess different electrocatalytic properties. This phenomenon is not conclusively understood, as multiple interdependent parameters affect the OER activity simultaneously. Herein, a layered cobalt borophosphate precatalyst, Co(H2O)2[B2P2O8(OH)2]&#8729;H2O, is fully reconstructed into two different CoCat phases. In marked contrast to previous reports, this reconstruction is not initiated at the surface but at the electrodesubstrate to catalyst interface. Ex&#8208; and quasi in&#8208;situ investigations of the two borophosphate derived CoCats, as well as the prominent CoPi and CoBi identify differences in the Tafel slope/range, buffer binding and content, long&#8208;range order, number of accessible edge sites, redox activity, and morphology. Considering and interconnecting these aspects together with proton mass transport limitations, we provide a comprehensive picture explaining the different OER activities. The most decisive factors are the buffers used for reconstruction, the number of edge sites that are not inhibited by irreversibly bond buffers, and the morphology of the catalysts. With this acquired knowledge, an optimized OER system is realized operating in nearneutral potassium borate media at 1.62&#177;0.03 VRHE yielding 250&#160;mA/cm2 at 65&#176;C for one month without degrading performance.

         <title>Multifunctional 4D&#8208;printed Sperm&#8208;hybrid Microcarriers for Assisted Reproduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Remotely controllable microrobots are appealing for various biomedical in vivo applications. In particular, our group has focused in the last years in developing sperm&#8208;microcarriers to assist sperm cells with motion deficiencies or low count (two of the most prominent male infertility problems) to reach the oocyte towards in vivo assisted fertilization. Different sperm carriers considering their motion in realistic media and confined environments have been optimized. However, the already reported sperm carriers have been mainly designed to transport single sperm cells, with limited functionality. Thus, to take a step forward, here we propose the development of a 4D&#8208;printed multifunctional microcarrier containing soft and smart materials, which can not only transport and deliver multiple sperm cells, but also release heparin and mediate local enzymatic reactions by hyaluronidase&#8208;loaded polymersomes (HYAL&#8208;Psomes). These multifunctional facets enable in&#8208;situ (i) sperm capacitation/hyperactivation, and (ii) local degradation of the cumulus complex that surrounds the oocyte, both to facilitate the sperm&#8208;oocyte interaction for the ultimate goal of in vivo assisted fertilization.

         <title>Organic Hole&#8208;Transport Layers for Efficient, Stable, and Scalable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) attract great attention due to their low&#8208;temperature processing, negligible hysteresis, and superior stability. For these devices, hole&#8208;transport layers play a decisive role in carrier extraction, transport, and perovskite crystallization. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the structural engineering of organic hole&#8208;transport layers utilized in inverted PSCs including conductive polymers, small molecules, and emerging self&#8208;assembled monolayers.








Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting layers (HTLs) are an essential component in inverted, p&#8211;i&#8211;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs) where they play a decisive role in extraction and transport of holes, surface passivation, perovskite crystallization, device stability, and cost. Currently, the exploration of efficient, stable, highly transparent and low&#8208;cost HTLs is of vital importance for propelling p&#8211;i&#8211;n PSCs toward commercialization. Compared to their inorganic counterparts, organic HTLs offer multiple advantages such as a tunable bandgap and energy level, easy synthesis and purification, solution processability, and overall low cost. Here, recent progress of organic HTLs, including conductive polymers, small molecules, and self&#8208;assembled monolayers, as utilized in inverted PSCs is systematically reviewed and summarized. Their molecular structure, hole&#8208;transport properties, energy levels, and relevant device properties and resulting performances are presented and analyzed. A summary of design principles and a future outlook toward highly efficient organic HTLs in inverted PSCs is proposed. This review aims to inspire further innovative development of novel organic HTLs for more efficient, stable, and scalable inverted PSCs.

         <title>Wet&#8208;Adhesive On&#8208;Skin Sensors Based on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Wireless Monitoring of Metabolites in Sweat</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Materials and techniques are demonstrated to achieve wearable and breathable sensing devices by integrating conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks with a flexible nanocellulose membrane. This robust sensor can self&#8208;adhere to sweaty skin for the wireless and in situ monitoring of vitamin C in human sweat.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with well&#8208;defined porous structures and tailored functionalities have been widely used in chemical sensing. However, the integration of MOFs with flexible electronic devices for wearable sensing is challenging because of their low electrical conductivity and fragile mechanical properties. Herein, a wearable sweat sensor for metabolite detection is presented by integrating an electrically conductive Ni&#8208;MOF with a flexible nanocellulose substrate. The MOF&#8208;based layered film sensor with inherent conductivity, highly porous structure, and active catalytic properties enables the selective and accurate detection of vitamin C and uric acid. More importantly, the lightweight sensor can conformably self&#8208;adhere to sweaty skin and exhibits high water&#8208;vapor permeability. Furthermore, a wireless epidermal nutrition tracking system for the in situ monitoring of the dynamics of sweat vitamin C is demonstrated, the results of which are comparable to those tested by high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography. This study opens a new avenue for integrating MOFs as the active layer in wearable electronic devices and holds promise for the future development of high&#8208;performance electronics with enhanced sensing, energy production, and catalytic capabilities through the implementation of multifunctional MOFs.

         <title>Structural Design and Fabrication of Multifunctional Nanocarbon Materials for Extreme Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocarbon materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene have provided a variety of unique extreme environmental properties. The recent advances on nanocarbon materials for extreme environments are summarized from the feature of individual nanocarbon components, principles of structural design, fabrication technologies, while examples of their extreme environmental applications with the underlying working mechanism are given.








Abstract
Extreme environments represent numerous harsh environmental conditions, such as temperature, pressure, corrosion, and radiation. The tolerance of applications in extreme environments exemplifies significant challenges to both materials and their structures. Given the superior mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, thermal stability, and chemical stability of nanocarbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene, they are widely investigated as base materials for extreme environmental applications and have shown numerous breakthroughs in the fields of wide&#8208;temperature structural&#8208;material construction, low&#8208;temperature energy storage, underwater sensing, and electronics operated at high temperatures. Here, the critical aspects of structural design and fabrication of nanocarbon materials for extreme environments are reviewed, including a description of the underlying mechanism supporting the performance of nanocarbon materials against extreme environments, the principles of structural design of nanocarbon materials for the optimization of extreme environmental performances, and the fabrication processes developed for the realization of specific extreme environmental applications. Finally, perspectives on how CNTs and graphene can further contribute to the development of extreme environmental applications are presented.

         <title>Ultrathin Covalent Organic Framework Membranes Prepared by Rapid Electrophoretic Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel two&#8208;cell electrophoretic deposition strategy to assemble covalent organic frameworks (COFs) nanosheets into ultrathin COF membranes with homogenous structures within several minutes is reported. The constructed COF membranes exhibit outstanding separation performance toward the negatively charged probe molecules with a dimension larger than 1&#160;nm due to their uniform architecture and unique chemical composition.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a disruptive material platform for various novel applications including nanofiltration for water purification due to their excellent physicochemical features. Nevertheless, the currently available approaches for preparing COF membranes need stringent synthesis conditions, prolonged fabrication time, and tedious post&#8208;processing, leading to poor productivity. Herein, a simple and efficient layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking assembly strategy is developed based on electrophoretic deposition (EPD) to rapidly generate ionic COF membranes due to the uniform driving force for nanosheet assembly. A new two&#8208;cell EPD design avoids the usual EPD problems such as bubbles and acidic/alkaline microenvironments in the near&#8208;electrode region in aqueous EPD processes. Ultrathin COF membranes with homogenous structures can be produced within several minutes. Consequently, the prepared COF membranes exhibit outstanding permselectivity and possess good stability and anti&#8208;pressure ability due to their uniform architecture and unique chemical composition.

         <title>Tailoring Materials for Epilepsy Imaging: From Biomarkers to Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A framework for understanding potential biomarkers of epilepsy is provided and they are classified them into three categories: functional, molecular, and structural aberrances during epileptogenesis. Then, the materials used to fabricate the imaging probes and their performances in defining the epileptic foci are highlighted. Imaging strategies overcoming the heterogenous nature of epilepsy are thoroughly discussed.








Abstract
Excising epileptic foci (EF) is the most efficient approach for treating drug&#8208;resistant epilepsy (DRE). However, owing to the vast heterogeneity of epilepsies, EF in one&#8208;third of patients cannot be accurately located, even after exhausting all current diagnostic strategies. Therefore, identifying biomarkers that truly represent the status of epilepsy and fabricating probes with high targeting specificity are prerequisites for identifying the &#8220;concealed&#8221; EF. However, no systematic summary of this topic has been published. Herein, the potential biomarkers of EF are first summarized and classified into three categories: functional, molecular, and structural aberrances during epileptogenesis, a procedure of nonepileptic brain biasing toward epileptic tissue. The materials used to fabricate these imaging probes and their performance in defining the EF in preclinical and clinical studies are highlighted. Finally, perspectives for developing the next generation of probes and their challenges in clinical translation are discussed. In general, this review can be helpful in guiding the development of imaging probes defining EF with improved accuracy and holds promise for increasing the number of DRE patients who are eligible for surgical intervention.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Robust Full&#8208;Color Organic Afterglow through 2D Superlattices Embedment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and universal strategy is proposed to prepare high&#8208;performance and robust organic afterglow with high figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit by 2D&#160;hydrogen&#8208;bonded superlattices embedment of phosphors. Deep&#8208;blue organic afterglow with high efficiency up to 65%, ultralong lifetime over 1300 ms, and robust emission that can resist the quenching effects from oxygen, solvent, stress, and heat is achieved.








Abstract
Purely organic afterglow (POA) originating from the slow radiative decay of stabilized triplet excited states has shown amazing potential in many fields. However, achieving highly stable POA with high phosphorescent quantum yield (PhQY) and long lifetime is still a formidable challenge owing to the intrinsically active and sensitive nature of triplet excitons. Here, triplet excitons of phosphors are protected and stabilized by embedding in tricomponent trihapto self&#8208;assembled 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded superlattices, which not only enables deep&#8208;blue POA with high PhQY (up to 65%), ultralong lifetime (over 1300&#160;ms) and the highest figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit at room temperature, but also achieves excellent stability capable of resisting quenching effects of oxygen, solvent, pressure, light, and heat. In addition, the POA color is tuned from deep&#8208;blue to red via efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the deep&#8208;blue POA emitters to the fluorophores. Moreover, with the high&#8208;performance, robust, and full&#8208;color POA materials, flexible anti&#8208;counterfeit displays and direct&#8208;current (DC)&#8208;driven lifetime&#8208;encrypted color Morse Code applications are facilely realized.

         <title>Catalase&#8208;Mimetic Artificial Biocatalysts with Ru Catalytic Centers for ROS Elimination and Stem&#8208;Cell Protection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalase&#8208;mimetic artificial biocatalysts with Ru catalytic centers are constructed for reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination. The activity merits and structure diversities of different Ru catalytic sites are systematically disclosed. Notably, the biocatalysts with Ru clusters present exceptional ROS&#8208;elimination activity, thus providing efficient rescue ability for the survival, adhesion, and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells in high ROS conditions.








Abstract
Exploring high&#8208;efficiency reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;elimination materials is of great importance for combating oxidative stress in diverse diseases, especially stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based biotherapeutics. By mimicking the Fe&#63743;N active centers of natural catalase, here, an innovative concept to design ROS&#8208;elimination artificial biocatalysts with Ru catalytic centers for stem&#8208;cell protection is reported. The experimental studies and theoretical calculations have systematically disclosed the activity merits and structure diversities of different Ru sites when serving as ROS&#8208;elimination artificial biocatalysts. Benefiting from the metallic electronic structures and synergetic effects of multiple sites, the artificial biocatalysts with Ru cluster centers present exceptional ROS&#8208;elimination activity; notably, it shows much higher catalytic efficiency per Ru atom on decomposing H2O2 when compared to the isolated single&#8208;atom Ru sites, which is more efficient than that of the natural antioxidants and recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ROS&#8208;scavenging biocatalysts. The systematic stem&#8208;cell protection studies reveal that the catalase&#8208;like artificial biocatalysts can provide efficient rescue ability for survival, adhesion, and differentiation functions of human mesenchymal stem cells in high ROS level conditions. It is suggested that applying these artificial biocatalysts with Ru cluster centers will offer a new pathway for engineering high&#8208;performance ROS&#8208;scavenging materials in stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based therapeutics and many other ROS&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing of Prussian Blue Analogues with Electrochemically Driven Morphological Rejuvenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phenomenon of self&#8208;healing can be determined through kinetic dynamics under an electric field in terms of an &#8220;electrochemically driven dissolution&#8211;recrystallization process&#8221; for the periodic morphology variations in Prussian blue analogue electrodes.








Abstract
Maintaining the morphology of electrode materials with high invertibility contributes to the prolonged cyclic stability of battery systems. However, the majority of electrode materials tend to degrade during the charge&#8211;discharge process owing to the inevitable increase in entropy. Herein, a self&#8208;healing strategy is designed to promote morphology rejuvenation in Prussian blue analogue (PBA) cathodes by cobalt doping. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations demonstrate that a trace amount of cobalt can decelerate the crystallization process and restore the cracked areas to ensure perfect cubic structures of PBA cathodes. The electric field controls the kinetic dynamics, rather than the conventional thermodynamics, to realize the &#8220;electrochemically driven dissolution&#8211;recrystallization process&#8221; for the periodic self&#8208;healing phenomenon. The properties of electron transportation and ion diffusion in bulk PBA are also improved by the doping strategy, thus boosting the cyclability with 4000 cycles in a diluent electrolyte. This discovery provides a new paradigm for the construction of self&#8208;healing electrodes for cathodes.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Socketed Sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Copper for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to C2+</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing perovskite&#8211;Cu heteronanostructures through in situ socketing sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Cu onto perovskite backbones provides a favorable platform for efficient and stable CO2 electroreduction (CER) to C2+ products. Within such heteronanostructures, the significant strong metal&#8211;support interactions, which modulate electronic structure of active Cu and strengthen perovskite&#8211;Cu adhesion, play key roles in simultaneously enhancing CER activity, selectivity for C2+ products, and stability.








Abstract
In situ socketing metal nanoparticles onto perovskite oxides has shown great potential in heterogeneous catalysis, but its employment in boosting ambient CO2 electroreduction (CER) is unexplored. Here, a CER catalyst of perovskite&#8208;socketed sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Cu equipped with strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSIs) is constructed to promote efficient and stable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion. For such a catalyst, plentiful sub&#8208;3&#160;nm ellipsoid Cu particles are homogeneously and epitaxially anchored on the perovskite backbones, with concomitant creation of significant SMSIs. These SMSIs are able to not only modulate electronic structure of active Cu and facilitate adsorption/activation of key intermediates, but also to strengthen perovskite&#8211;Cu adhesion and intensify resistance to structural degradation. Beneficial from these advantageous merits, when evaluated in CER, it performs comparably to or better than most reported Cu&#8208;based heteronanostructures. Relative to a physical&#8208;mixture counterpart, it features marked improvements (up to 6.2 folds) in activity and selectivity for C2+, together with greatly boosted stability (&gt;80&#160;h). This work gives a new avenue to rationally design more advanced Cu&#8208;based heteronanostructures for CER.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Enabled by Passivating Defect and Constructing Dual Energy&#8208;Transfer Pathway through Functional Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>

         <dc:description>
Phenethylammonium bromine&#8208;modified CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are successfully introduced into perovskite film to passivate the intrinsic defects and accelerate the energy&#8208;transfer process. Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate/poly[9,9&#8208;dioctylfluoreneco&#8208;N&#8208;[4&#8208;(3&#8208;methylpropyl)]diphenylamine]:black phosphorus is also constructed to enhance carrier injection and charge&#8208;transport ability. Consequently, a champion external quantum efficiency of 25.32% and a maximal brightness of 128&#8239;842 cd m&#8722;2 are successfully achieved.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D perovskites have emerged as a promising luminescent material for perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (Pe&#8208;LEDs). However, efficiency and stability are still obstacles to practical application due to numerous defects and inefficient energy transfer of perovskite films. Herein, functional phenethylammonium bromine&#8208;modified CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3 NCs) are first introduced as multifunctional additive to simultaneously improve abovementioned problems. PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3 NCs not only serve as heteronuclear seeds and trigger growth, thus greatly reducing leakage current, but also deliver Cs+ and Br&#8722; to passivate the intrinsic defects inside film. More importantly, the PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3 construct a new carrier&#8208;transfer pathway from the small&#8208;n phase of the quasi&#8208;2D perovskite to the PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3, which not only accelerates the energy&#8208;transfer process but also promotes radiation recombination of carriers due to stronger quantum confinement effect. Afterward, the poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate/poly[9,9&#8208;dioctylfluoreneco&#8208;N&#8208;[4&#8208;(3&#8208;methylpropyl)]diphenylamine]:black phosphorus quantum dot double hole&#8208;transport layer is successfully constructed to enhance its carrier&#8208;injection and charge&#8208;transport abilities. Consequently, a champion external quantum efficiency of 25.32% and maximal brightness of 128&#8239;842&#160;cd m&#8722;2 are achieved, which is the record efficiency of the quasi&#8208;2D Pe&#8208;LED with pure green emission at 530&#160;nm. Moreover, an impressive 174&#160;min lifetime is obtained at T50, which is about five times longer than the control device.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Production of Rectorite Nanosheets and their Co&#8208;Assembly with Aramid Nanofibers for High&#8208;Performance Electrical Insulating Nanopapers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gram&#8208;scale rectorite nanosheets (RNs) with ultrathin thickness (&#8776;5 nm) are efficiently prepared from raw rectorite microplatelets via a scalable exfoliation approach and rapidly separated from their suspension by an efficient poly(dienedimethylammonium chloride)&#8208;assisted sedimentation strategy. Then, the RNs are co&#8208;assembled with aramid nanofibers into large&#8208;scale nacre&#8208;mimetic nanopapers, achieving considerably enhanced mechanical, electrical insulating, and high&#8208;temperature resistant properties.








Abstract
Compared with raw rectorite microplatelets (RMs), rectorite nanosheets (RNs) have considerably greater application prospects in the preparation of advanced composite materials because of their larger aspect ratio, higher surface reactivity, and intrinsically superior mechanical and physical properties. However, the difficulty in the efficient preparation of RNs significantly limits their large&#8208;scale applications. Here, a scalable poly(vinylpyrrolidone)&#8208;assisted stirring approach is developed to prepare ultrathin RNs from the abundant natural RMs. A higher production rate (&#8776;0.675&#160;g h&#8722;1) is achieved compared with that of most other nanosheets. Additionally, instead of using conventional time&#8208; and energy&#8208;consuming high&#8208;speed centrifugation, an efficient poly(dienedimethylammonium chloride)&#8208;assisted sedimentation strategy is proposed here to rapidly separate the exfoliated RNs from the RN dispersion. Then, the RNs are co&#8208;assembled with aramid nanofibers (ANFs) into large&#8208;scale nacre&#8208;mimetic ANF&#8208;RN nanopapers with considerably enhanced mechanical, electrical insulating, and high&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant&#160;properties compared with pure ANF nanopapers and ANF&#8208;RM micropapers. Moreover, these properties are superior to those of previously reported ANF&#8208;based nanopapers and commercial insulating micropapers.

         <title>Transfer&#8208;Tattoo&#8208;Like Cell&#8208;Sheet Delivery Induced by Interfacial Cell Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a transfer&#8208;tattoo&#8208;like cell&#8208;sheet delivery platform is described, based on interfacial cell migration. The use of a commercially available flexible parylene film facilitates the manipulation of cell sheets and the creation of freeform designs. The efficacy of a multilayered cell&#8208;sheet skin substitute in promoting re&#8208;epithelialization and re&#8208;vascularization of wounds in mouse models is demonstrated.








Abstract
A direct transfer of a cell sheet from a culture surface to a target tissue is introduced. Commercially available, flexible parylene is used as the culture surface, and it is proposed that the UV&#8208;treated parylene offers adequate and intermediate levels of cell adhesiveness for both the stable cell attachment during culture and for the efficient cell transfer to a target surface. The versatility of this cell&#8208;transfer process is demonstrated with various cell types, including MRC&#8208;5, HDFn, HULEC&#8208;5a, MC3T3&#8208;E1, A549, C2C12 cells, and MDCK&#8208;II cells. The novel cell&#8208;sheet engineering is based on a mechanism of interfacial cell migration between two surfaces with different adhesion preferences. Monitoring of cytoskeletal dynamics and drug treatments during the cell&#8208;transfer process reveals that the interfacial cell migration occurs by utilizing the existing transmembrane proteins on the cell surface to bind to the targeted surface. The re&#8208;establishment and reversal of cell polarity after the transfer process are also identified. Its unique capabilities of 3D multilayer stacking, freeform design, and curved surface application are demonstrated. Finally, the therapeutic potential of the cell&#8208;sheet delivery system is demonstrated by applying it to cutaneous wound healing and skin&#8208;tissue regeneration in mice models.

         <title>Vertical Growth of 2D Covalent Organic Framework Nanoplatelets on Macroporous Scaffold for High&#8208;Performance Electrodes</title>

Abstract
Hierarchically structural engineering of electrodes is critical to achieving high energy density and high power density in electrochemical energy storage (EES). However, rational regulation of the mesoscopic structure that coordinates microscopic and macroscopic structural features simultaneously remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the construction of electrodes with well&#8208;defined hierarchical pores spanning multiple length scales from 1&#160;nm to 50&#160;&#956;m. Vertically aligned two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) nanoplatelets with a thickness around 30&#160;nm were in&#8208;situ grown on macroporous graphene aerogel scaffold by a reversible polycondensation&#8208;termination strategy. The obtained electrode thus combines abundant accessible active sites and efficient transport expressways for both ions and electrons. When used for supercapacitors, a superior gravimetric capacitance of 289 F&#183;g&#8722;1 as well as outstanding capacitance retention at both high charge/discharge rates of 77% from 0.5 A&#183;g&#8722;1 to 50 A&#183;g&#8722;1 and high mass loading of 74% from 1.2 mg&#183;cm&#8722;2 to 10.4 mg&#183;cm&#8722;2 are achieved. Hierarchical engineering of mesostructured 2D COF units on the macroporous scaffold will bring unprecedented structural designability and performance enhancement for EES electrodes.

         <title>Regulation of Outer Solvation Shell toward Superior Low&#8208;temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries are well regarded among the next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies due to their low cost and high safety. However, the unstable stripping/plating process leading to severe dendrite growth under high current density and low temperature impede their practical application. Herein, we demonstrate that the addition of 2&#8208;propanol can regulate the outer solvation shell structure of Zn2+ by replacing water molecules to establish a &#8220;eutectic solvation shell&#8221;, which provides strong affinity with the Zn (101) crystalline plane and fast desolvation kinetics during the plating process, rendering homogeneous Zn deposition without dendrite formation. As a result, the Zn anode exhibits promising cycle stability over 500 hours under an elevated current density of 15&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and high depth of discharge of 51.2%. Furthermore, remarkable electrochemical performance was achieved in a 150 mAh Zn|V2O5 pouch cell over 1000 cycles at low temperature of &#8208;20&#176;C. This work not only offers a new strategy to achieve excellent performance of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries under harsh conditions, but also reveals electrolyte structure designs that can be applied in related energy storage and conversion fields.

         <title>Visualized Gallium/Lyticase&#8208;Integrated Antifungal Strategy for Fungal Keratitis Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fungal keratitis has been one of the common corneal infections that causes blindness, but an effective antifungal strategy remains a challenge. The exopolysaccharides both in fungal cell walls and biofilms are a key that acts as a permeation barrier to weaken the therapeutic effect of antifungal agents. Herein, we present lyticase and gallium ions co&#8208;integrated nanosystems (MLPGa) that could degrade exopolysaccharides and then effectively eradicate both the planktonic C. albicans and mature biofilms. The potential antifungal mechanism involves ROS production and metabolic interference of antioxidant&#8208;related genes, exopolysaccharide&#8208;related genes, iron ion utilization&#8208;related genes, fungal/biofilm development&#8208;related genes, and virulence genes. Meanwhile, the Raman signals generated by the chelation between nanosystems and gallium ions provide a real&#8208;time visualization tool to monitor Ga release. Finally, the MLPGa&#8208;based antifungal strategy with good biocompatibility achieves a satisfactory therapeutic effect in a fungal keratitis mouse model. This study provides a unique approach to the effective treatment of fungal keratitis in clinical practice.

         <title>Machine learning&#8211;accelerated development of efficient mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides as the air electrodes for protonic ceramic cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Currently, the development of high&#8208;performance protonic ceramic cells (PCCs) is limited by the scarcity of efficient mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides that can act as air electrodes to satisfy the high protonic conductivity of electrolytes. Despite the extensive research efforts in the past decades, the development of mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides still remains in a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error process, which is extremely time&#8208;consuming and high&#8208;cost. Herein, based on the data acquired from published literature, the machine learning (ML) method is introduced to accelerate the discovery of efficient mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides. Accordingly, the hydrated proton concentration (HPC) of 3200 oxides is predicted to evaluate the proton conduction that is essential for enhancing the electrochemical performances of PCCs. Subsequently, feature importance for HPC is evaluated to establish a guideline for rapid and accurate design and development of high&#8208;efficiency mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides. Thereafter, screened (La0.7Ca0.3)(Co0.8Ni0.2)O3 (LCCN7382) is prepared, and the experimental HPC adequately corresponds with the predicted results. Moreover, the PCC with LCCN7382 exhibited satisfactory electrochemical performances in electrolysis and fuel cell modes. In addition to the development of a promising air electrode for PCC, this study establishes a new avenue for ML&#8208;based development of mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides.

Electroactive organic materials with tailored functional groups are of great importance for aqueous Zn&#8208;organic batteries due to their green and renewable nature. Herein, we designed and synthesized a completely new N&#8208;heteroaromatic material, hexaazatrinaphthalene&#8208;phenazine (HATN&#8208;PNZ), by an acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation reaction, and demonstrated its use as an ultrahigh performance cathode for Zn ion batteries. Compared with a phenazine monomer, we reveal that the &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure of N&#8208;heteroaromatics can effectively increase electron delocalization, thereby improving its electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the enlarged aromatic structure noticeably suppresses its dissolution in aqueous electrolytes, thus enabling high structural stability. As expected, the HATN&#8208;PNZ cathode delivers a large reversible capacity of 257 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1, ultrahigh rate capability of 144 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 A g&#8722;1, and extremely long cycle life of 45,000 cycles at 50 A g&#8722;1. Charge storage mechanism investigation demonstrated the synergistic coordination of both Zn2+ and H+ cations with phenanthroline groups, with Zn2+ first followed by H+, accompanying the reversible formation of zinc hydroxide sulfate hydrate. Our work provides a molecular engineering strategy for superior organic materials and add new insights to understand the charge storage behavior of aqueous Zn&#8208;organic batteries.

Abstract
Developing fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8208;air battery is crucial for widening its application but remains challenging owing to the limitation of sluggish OER kinetics and insufficient active sites of electrocatalysts. To solve this issue, the reconstructed amorphous FeCoNiSx electrocatalyst with high&#8208;density efficient active sites, yielding low OER overpotentials of 202, 255 and 323&#160;mV at 10, 100 and 500&#160;mA/cm2, respectively, was developed for fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8208;air battery with low charging voltages at 100&#8211;400&#160;mA/cm2. Furthermore, the fabricated 3241.8 mAh (20&#160;mA/cm2, 25&#160;&#176;C) quasi&#8208;solid Zn&#8208;air battery shows long lifetime of 500&#160;h at &#8208;10 and 25&#160;&#176;C as well as 150&#160;h at 40&#160;&#176;C under charging 100&#160;mA/cm2. The detailed characterizations combine with DFT calculation indicate that the defect&#8208;rich crystalline /amorphous ternary metal (oxy) hydroxide formed by the reconstruction of amorphous multi&#8208;metallic sulfide, where the electron coupling effect among multi active sites and migration of intermediate O* from Ni site to Fe site breaks the scaling relationship to lead to a low theoretical OER overpotential of 170&#160;mV, accounting for the outstanding fast&#8208;charging property. This work not only provides insights into designing advanced OER catalysts by the self&#8208;reconstruction of pre&#8208;catalyst but also pioneers the pathway for the practical fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8208;air battery.

         <title>Solution Processed Ternary Tin (II) Alloy as Hole&#8208;Transport Layer of Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells for Enhanced Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) narrow bandgap (NBG) perovskites show great potential in both single&#8208;junction and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still limited by low charge collection efficiency and poor stability. Here, we report a ternary Sn (II) alloy of SnOCl as the hole&#8208;transport material (HTM) with a work function of 4.95&#160;eV for Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs. The solution processed SnOCl layer has a texture structure which not only reduces the optical loss of the devices but also changes grain growth of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites and boosts the carrier diffusion length to 3.63&#160;&#956;m. The formation of small perovskite grains at the HTM/perovskite interface is suppressed. These result in an almost constant internal quantum efficiency of 96 &#177; 2% across the absorption spectrum of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites. The SnOCl HTM significantly enhances the stability of Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs with 87% of its initial efficiency retained after 1&#8208;sun illumination for 1,200&#160;h, and keep 85% efficiency under 85&#176;C thermal stress for 1,500&#160;h. The hybrid HTM further improve the stabilized efficiencies of single&#8208;junction Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells to 23.2% and 25.9%, respectively. This discovery opens an avenue to the multi&#8208;component metal alloys as HTM in PSCs.

         <title>Quantum Advantage in A Molecular Spintronic Engine that Harvests Thermal Fluctuation Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recent theory and experiments have showcased how to harness quantum mechanics to assemble heat/information engines with efficiencies that surpass the classical Carnot limit. So far, this has required atomic engines that are driven by cumbersome external electromagnetic sources. Here, using molecular spintronics, we propose an implementation that is both electronic and autonomous. Our spintronic quantum engine heuristically deploys several known quantum assets by having a chain of spin qubits formed by the paramagnetic Co centers of phthalocyanine (Pc) molecules electronically interact with electron&#8208;spin selecting Fe/C60 interfaces. Density functional calculations reveal that transport fluctuations across the interface can stabilize spin coherence on the Co paramagnetic centers, which host spin flip processes. Across vertical molecular nanodevices, we measure enduring dc current generation, output power above room temperature, two quantum thermodynamical signatures of the engine's processes, and a record 89% spin polarization of current across the Fe/C60 interface. It is crucially this electron spin selection that forces, through demonic feedback and control, charge current to flow against the built&#8208;in potential barrier. Further research into spintronic quantum engines, insight into the quantum information processes within spintronic technologies, and retooling the spintronic&#8208;based information technology chain, could help accelerate the transition to clean energy.

         <title>Many&#8208;Body Molecular Interactions in a Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By maneuvering the supramolecular dynamics in a molecular memristor, a wide variation of functionalities starting from diode and passing between nonvolatile and volatile, unipolar and bipolar memristors with sharp and gradual transitions within a single circuit element is captured. A mathematical design space evolves thereof that can enable almost all possible characteristic variations, desirable in neuromorphic devices.








Abstract
Electronic transitions in molecular&#8208;circuit elements hinge on complex interactions between molecules and ions, offering a multidimensional parameter space to embed, access, and optimize material functionalities for target&#8208;specific applications. This opportunity is not cultivated in molecular memristors because their low&#8208;temperature charge transport, which is a route to decipher molecular many&#8208;body interactions, is unexplored. To address this, robust, temperature&#8208;resilient molecular memristors based on a Ru complex of an azo aromatic ligand are designed, and current&#8211;voltage sweep measurements from room temperature down to 2 K with different cooling protocols are performed. By freezing out or activating different components of supramolecular dynamics, the local Coulombic interactions between the molecules and counterions that affect the electronic transport can be controlled. Operating conditions are designed where functionalities spanning bipolar, unipolar, nonvolatile, and volatile memristors with sharp as well as gradual analog transitions are captured within a single device. A mathematical design space evolves, thereof comprising 36 tuneable parameters in which all possible steady&#8208;state functional variations in a memristor characteristic can be attainable. This enables a deterministic design route to engineer neuromorphic devices with unprecedented control over the transformation characteristics governing their functional flexibility and tunability.

         <title>Black Phosphorous Mediates Surface Charge Redistribution of CoSe2 for Electrochemical H2O2 Production in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Black phosphorus chemically nailed on metallic cobalt diselenide mediates surface charge redistribution, which enables a selective and efficient two&#8208;electron reduction of oxygen toward&#160;hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in acid. The catalyst exhibits a 91% Faradic efficiency for H2O2 at an overpotential of 300 mV, and a high production rate of &#8776;1530&#160;mg L&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in a flow&#8208;cell reactor.








Abstract
Electrochemical generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction offers a green method to mitigate the current dependence on the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process, promising its on&#8208;site applications. Unfortunately, in alkaline environments, H2O2 is not stable and undergoes rapid decomposition. Making H2O2 in acidic electrolytes can prevent its decomposition, but choices of active, stable, and selective electrocatalysts are significantly limited. Here, the selective and efficient two&#8208;electron reduction of oxygen toward H2O2 in acid by a composite catalyst that is composed of black phosphorus (BP) nailed chemically on the metallic cobalt diselenide (CoSe2) surface is reported. It is found that this catalyst exhibits a 91% Faradic efficiency for H2O2 product at an overpotential of 300 mV. Moreover, it can mediate oxygen to H2O2 with a high production rate of &#8776;1530&#160;mg L&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in a flow&#8208;cell reactor. Spectroscopic and computational studies together uncover a BP&#8208;induced surface charge redistribution in CoSe2, which leads to a favorable surface electronic structure that weakens the HOO* adsorption, thus enhancing the kinetics toward H2O2 formation.

         <title>Stability of Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes: Existing Issues and Mitigation Strategies Related to Both Material and Device Aspects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Present perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are sensitive to light, humidity, heat, and electric field, and their limited stability constitutes severe bottleneck for display applications. Strategies including structure design, composition adjustment, shell protection, dimensionality control, heat dissipation, and defect passivation, which can be applied to improve the PeLED stability, are reviewed, and future opportunities and challenges are considered.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites combine excellent electronic and optical properties, such as defect tolerance and high photoluminescence efficiency, with the benefits of low&#8208;cost, large&#8208;area, solution&#8208;based processing. Composition&#8208; and dimension&#8208;tunable properties of perovskites have already been utilized in bright and efficient light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). At the same time, there are still great challenges ahead to achieving operational and spectral stability of these devices. In this review, the origins of instability of perovskite materials, and reasons for their degradation in LEDs are considered. Then, strategies for improving the stability of perovskite materials are reviewed, such as compositional engineering, dimensionality control, defect passivation, suitable encapsulation matrices, and fabrication of core/shell perovskite nanocrystals. For improvement of the operational stability of perovskite LEDs, the use of inorganic charge&#8208;transport layers, optimization of charge balance, and proper thermal management are considered. The review is concluded with a detailed account of the current challenges and a perspective on the key approaches and opportunities on how to reach the goal of stable, bright, and efficient perovskite LEDs.

         <title>One&#8208;Phototransistor&#8211;One&#8208;Memristor Array with High&#8208;Linearity Light&#8208;Tunable Weight for Optic Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;phototransistor&#8211;one&#8208;memristor array is proposed that works as an artificial optic neural network for image recognition. The device shows highly&#160;linear, light&#8208;tunable conductance weight during the online training process of the optic artificial neural network and yields a recognition accuracy of 99.33% after only ten training epochs, indicating the potential in highly efficient optic neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
The recent advances in optic neuromorphic devices have led to a subsequent rise in use for construction of energy&#8208;efficient artificial&#8208;vision systems. The widespread use can be attributed to their ability to capture, store, and process visual information from the environment. The primary limitations of existing optic neuromorphic devices include nonlinear weight updates, cross&#8208;talk issues, and silicon process incompatibility. In this study, a highly&#160;linear, light&#8208;tunable, cross&#8208;talk&#8208;free, and silicon&#8208;compatible one&#8208;phototransistor&#8211;one&#8208;memristor (1PT1R) optic memristor is experimentally demonstrated for the implementation of an optic artificial neural network (OANN). For optic image recognition in the experiment, an OANN is constructed using a 16&#160;&#215;&#160;3 1PT1R memristor array, and it is trained on an online platform. The model yields an accuracy of 99.3% after only ten training epochs. The 1PT1R memristor, which shows good performance, demonstrates its ability as an excellent hardware solution for highly efficient optic neuromorphic and edge computing.

         <title>Hydro/Organo/Ionogels: &#8220;Controllable&#8221; Electromagnetic Wave Absorbers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy of the co&#8208;contribution of functional polymer frameworks and diverse liquids with strong absorption properties is proposed. These gels show a comprehensive controllability from composition, microstructure, and dielectric properties to electromagnetic wave absorption properties, offering a conceptually novel platform to develop customizable and low&#8208;cost functional absorbers.








Abstract
Demand for electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorbers continues to increase with technological advances in wearable electronics and military applications. In this study, a new strategy to overcome the drawbacks of current absorbers by employing the co&#8208;contribution of functional polymer frameworks and liquids with strong EMW absorption properties is proposed. Strongly polar water, dimethyl sulfoxide/water mixtures, and highly conductive 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium ethyl sulfate ([EMI][ES]) are immobilized in dielectrically inert polymer networks to form different classes of gels (hydrogels, organogels, and ionogels). These gels demonstrate a high correlation between their dielectric properties and polarity/ionic conductivity/non&#8208;covalent interaction of immobilized liquids. Thus, the EMW absorption performances of the gels can be precisely tuned over a wide range due to the diversity and stability of the liquids. The prepared hydrogels show good shielding performance (shielding efficiency &gt; 20&#160;dB) due to the high dielectric constants, while organogels with moderate attenuation ability and impedance matching achieve full&#8208;wave absorption in X&#8208;band (8.2&#8211;12.4&#160;GHz) at 2.5 &#177; 0.5&#160;mm. The ionogels also offer a wide effective absorption bandwidth (10.79&#8211;16.38&#160;GHz at 2.2&#160;mm) via prominent ionic conduction loss. In short, this work provides a conceptually novel platform to develop high&#8208;efficient, customizable, and low&#8208;cost functional absorbers.

         <title>Information Storage Expansion Enabled by a Resilient Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Active Nanocomposite Hydrogel</title>

Abstract
Advanced materials with high performance and distinctive function are one of the main driving forces for the development of human society. The selection of appropriate materials and adequately utilizing their features to apply them in a specific area rationally are of great significance but remain challenging. Herein, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active nanocomposite (NC) hydrogel is developed by introducing a pH&#8208;responsive AIE luminogen (AIEgen) into a Laponite XLS/polyacrylamide&#8208;based NC hydrogel. The AIEgen can protonate to interact with the negatively charged clay through the electrostatic interaction, which results in a drastic fluorescence enhancement due to the restriction of intramolecular motion by the rigid clay to the protonated AIEgen. This behavior facilitates the input of fluorescent information with a high contrast ratio in the hydrogel by acid stimulation. What's more, by utilizing the excellent resilience of the hydrogel, hierarchically inputting and displaying the information in the original and stretched states of the hydrogel film is realized, which achieves information storage expansion and dual&#8208;encryption via switching between stretching and restoring the film. This work showcases fully and synergistically utilizing the superiorities of various advanced materials to achieve superior applications and should guide the future development of advanced materials in emerging areas.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced materials with high performance and distinctive function are one of the main driving forces for the development of human society. The selection of appropriate materials and adequately utilizing their features to apply them in a specific area rationally are of great significance but remain challenging. Herein, an aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-active nanocomposite (NC) hydrogel is developed by introducing a pH-responsive AIE luminogen (AIEgen) into a Laponite XLS/polyacrylamide-based NC hydrogel. The AIEgen can protonate to interact with the negatively charged clay through the electrostatic interaction, which results in a drastic fluorescence enhancement due to the restriction of intramolecular motion by the rigid clay to the protonated AIEgen. This behavior facilitates the input of fluorescent information with a high contrast ratio in the hydrogel by acid stimulation. What's more, by utilizing the excellent resilience of the hydrogel, hierarchically inputting and displaying the information in the original and stretched states of the hydrogel film is realized, which achieves information storage expansion and dual-encryption via switching between stretching and restoring the film. This work showcases fully and synergistically utilizing the superiorities of various advanced materials to achieve superior applications and should guide the future development of advanced materials in emerging areas.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Puffball&#8208;Inspired Microrobotic Systems with Robust Payload, Strong Protection, and Targeted Locomotion for On&#8208;Demand Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by features of natural puffball fungi, including a fruitbody to store trillions of spores and a barrier cap to provide payload protection and stimuli&#8208;triggered release, a bioinspired microrobotic system with an internal chamber and near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive sealing layer is presented for drug delivery. The microrobots show robust payload capacity, strong payload protection, on&#8208;demand release, and targeted locomotion.








Abstract
Microrobots are recognized as transformative solutions for drug delivery systems (DDSs) because they can navigate through the body to specific locations and enable targeted drug release. However, their realization is substantially limited by insufficient payload capacity, unavoidable drug leakage/deactivation, and strict modification/stability criteria for drugs. Natural puffballs possess fascinating features that are highly desirable for DDSs, including a large fruitbody for storing spores, a flexible protective cap, and environmentally triggered release mechanisms. This report presents a puffball&#8208;inspired microrobotic system which incorporates an internal chamber for loading large drug quantities and spatial drug separation, and a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive top&#8208;sealing layer offering strong drug protection and on&#8208;demand release. These puffball&#8208;inspired microrobots (PIMs) display tunable loading capacities up to high concentrations and enhanced drug protection with minimal drug leakage. Upon near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation, on&#8208;demand drug delivery with rapid release efficiency is achieved. The PIMs also demonstrate translational motion velocities, switchable motion modes, and precise locomotion under a rotating magnetic field. This work provides strong proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for a DDS that combines the superior locomotion capability of microrobots with the unique characteristics of puffballs, thereby illustrating a versatile avenue for development of a new generation of microrobots for targeted drug delivery.

         <title>Triclinic Metamaterials by Tristable Origami with Reprogrammable Frustration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring full anisotropy (triclinic symmetry) of material microstructures can lead to surprising discoveries. A class of origami&#8208;inspired triclinic metamaterials is proposed, which couples shear and normal strains, and leads to reversible auxeticity, in the changing triclinic frame. In the tessellation, linear and point defects emerge as a result of geometric frustration, which can be reprogrammed into distinct frustrated material states.








Abstract
Geometrical&#8208;frustration&#8208;induced anisotropy and inhomogeneity are explored to achieve unique properties of metamaterials that set them apart from conventional materials. According to Neumann's principle, to achieve anisotropic responses, the material unit cell should possess less symmetry. Based on such guidelines, a triclinic metamaterial system of minimal symmetry is presented, which originates from a Trimorph origami pattern with a simple and insightful geometry: a basic unit cell with four tilted panels and four corresponding creases. The intrinsic geometry of the Trimorph origami, with its changing tilting angles, dictates a folding motion that varies the primitive vectors of the unit cell, couples the shear and normal strains of its extrinsic bulk, and leads to an unusual Poisson effect. Such an effect, associated with reversible auxeticity in the changing triclinic frame, is observed experimentally, and predicted theoretically by elegant mathematical formulae. The nonlinearities of the folding motions allow the unit cell to display three robust stable states, connected through snapping instabilities. When the tristable unit cells are tessellated, phenomena that resemble linear and point defects emerge as a result of geometric frustration. The frustration is reprogrammable into distinct stable and inhomogeneous states by arbitrarily selecting the location of a single or multiple point defects. The Trimorph origami demonstrates the possibility of creating origami metamaterials with symmetries that are hitherto nonexistent, leading to triclinic metamaterials with tunable anisotropy for potential applications such as wave propagation control and compliant&#160;microrobots.

         <title>A Medium&#8208;Bandgap Nonfullerene Acceptor Enabling Organic Photovoltaic Cells with 30% Efficiency under Indoor Artificial Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new acceptor of FTCC&#63743;Br and frequently&#8208;used ITCC is studied, due to their similar optical and electrochemistry properties. Under a light intensity of 1000 lux, the PB2:ITCC&#8208;based device with a small electrostatic potential (ESP) offset gives a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.4%, while the PB2:FTCC&#63743;Br&#8208;based device with a large ESP offset achieves a record PCE of 30.2%.








Abstract
The correlation between molecular structure and photovoltaic performance is lagging for constructing high&#8208;performance indoor organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Herein, this relationship is investigated in depth by employing two medium&#8208;bandgap nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). The newly synthesized NFA of FTCC&#63743;Br exhibits a similar bandgap and molecular energy level, but a much stronger dipole moment and larger average electrostatic potential (ESP) compared with ITCC. After blending with the polymer donor PB2, the PB2:ITCC and PB2:FTCC&#63743;Br blends exhibit favorable bulk&#8208;heterojunction morphologies and the same driving force, but the PB2:FTCC&#63743;Br blend exhibits a large ESP difference. In OPV cells, the PB2:ITCC&#8208;based device produces a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.0%, whereas the PB2:FTCC&#63743;Br&#8208;based device gives an excellent PCE of 14.8% with an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.05&#160;V, which is the highest value among OPV cells with VOC values above 1.0&#160;V. When both acceptor&#8208;based devices work under a 1000 lux of 3000 K light&#8208;emitting diode, the PB2:ITCC&#8208;based 1 cm2 device yields a good PCE of 25.4%; in contrast, the PB2:FTCC&#63743;Br&#8208;based 1 cm2 device outputs a record PCE of 30.2%. These results suggest that a large ESP offset in photovoltaic materials is important for achieving high&#8208;performance OPV cells.

         <title>Roughness Suppression in Electrochemical Nanoimprinting of Si for Applications in Silicon Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel chip&#8208;scale near&#8208;infrared optics requires scalable fabrication of 3D&#160;freeform nano&#8208; and microstructures in silicon. This manuscript investigates the origin of silicon roughening during metal&#8208;assisted electrochemical nanoimprinting and minimizes it to levels comparable with plasma etching. Functional imprinted rib waveguides on silicon&#8208;on&#8208;insulator wafers are demonstrated, paving the way for its broad use to micromachine 3D photonic devices at scale.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;assisted electrochemical nanoimprinting (Mac&#8208;Imprint) scales the fabrication of micro&#8208; and nanoscale 3D freeform geometries in silicon and holds the promise to enable novel chip&#8208;scale optics operating at the near&#8208;infrared spectrum. However, Mac&#8208;Imprint of silicon concomitantly generates mesoscale roughness (e.g., protrusion size&#160;&#8776;45&#160;nm) creating prohibitive levels of light scattering. This arises from the requirement to coat stamps with nanoporous gold catalyst that, while sustaining etchant diffusion, imprints its pores (e.g., average diameter&#160;&#8776;42&#160;nm) onto silicon. In this work, roughness is reduced to sub&#8208;10&#160;nm levels, which is in par with plasma etching, by decreasing pore size of the catalyst via dealloying in far&#8208;from equilibrium conditions. At this level, single&#8208;digit nanometric details such as grain&#8208;boundary grooves of the catalyst are imprinted and attributed to the resolution limit of Mac&#8208;Imprint, which is argued to be twice the Debye length (i.e., 1.7&#160;nm)&#8212;a finding that broadly applies to metal&#8208;assisted chemical etching. Last, Mac&#8208;Imprint is employed to produce single&#8208;mode rib&#8208;waveguides on pre&#8208;patterned silicon&#8208;on&#8208;insulator wafers with root&#8208;mean&#8208;square line&#8208;edge roughness less than 10&#160;nm while providing depth uniformity (i.e., 42.9&#160;&#177;&#160;5.5&#160;nm), and limited levels of silicon defect formation (e.g., Raman peak shift&#160;&lt;&#160;0.1&#160;cm&#8722;1) and sidewall scattering.

Last, Mac-Imprint is employed to produce single-mode rib-waveguides on pre-patterned silicon-on-insulator wafers with root-mean-square line-edge roughness less than 10&#160;nm while providing depth uniformity (i.e., 42.9&#160;&#177;&#160;5.5&#160;nm), and limited levels of silicon defect formation (e.g., Raman peak shift&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;0.1&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and sidewall scattering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallic PtRhBiSnSb Nanoplates for Highly Efficient Alcohol Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy PtRhBiSnSb intermetallic nanoplates with intrinsically isolated Pt/Rh/Bi/Sn/Sb atoms are successfully constructed via a one&#8208;pot method. Benefiting from the synergism of the chosen five elements, these well&#8208;defined PtRhBiSnSb intermetallic nanoplates achieve ultrahigh performance toward the electrochemical oxidation of methanol, ethanol, and glycerol in alkaline electrolytes, emerging as a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multifunctional electrocatalyst for the alcohol oxidation reactions.








Abstract
The control of multimetallic ensembles at the atomic&#8208;level is challenging, especially for high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) possessing five or more elements. Herein, the one&#8208;pot synthesis of hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packed (hcp) PtRhBiSnSb high&#8208;entropy intermetallic (HEI) nanoplates with intrinsically isolated Pt, Rh, Bi, Sn, and Sb atoms is reported, to boost the electrochemical oxidation of liquid fuels. Taking advantage of these combined five metals, the well&#8208;defined PtRhBiSnSb HEI nanoplates exhibit a remarkable mass activity of 19.529, 15.558, and 7.535 A mg&#8722;1Pt+Rh toward the electrooxidation of methanol, ethanol, and glycerol in alkaline electrolytes, respectively, representing a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multifunctional electrocatalyst for alcohol oxidation reactions. In particular, the PtRhBiSnSb HEI achieves record&#8208;high methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) activity in an&#160;alkaline environment. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the introduction of the fifth metal Rh enhances the electron&#8208;transfer efficiency in PtRhBiSnSb HEI nanoplates, which contributes to the improved oxidation capability. Meanwhile, robust electronic structures of the active sites are achieved due to the synergistic protections from Bi, Sn, and Sb sites. This work offers significant research advances in developing well&#8208;defined HEA with delicate control over compositions and properties.

         <title>Digital Keying Enabled by Reconfigurable 2D Modulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ambipolar transport and nonvolatile programming of MoTe2 field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) are exploited to enable a low&#8208;power, compact, and multibit digital modulator, which can be used in internet&#8208;of&#8208;things edge communication.








Abstract
Energy, area, and bandwidth efficient communication primitives are essential to sustain the rapid increase in connectivity among internet&#8208;of&#8208;things (IoT) edge devices. While IoT edge&#8208;sensing, edge&#8208;computing, and edge&#8208;storage have witnessed innovation in materials and devices, IoT edge communication is yet to experience such transformation. The aging silicon (Si)&#8208;based complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) technology continues to remain the mainstay of communication devices where they are used to implement amplitude, frequency, and phase shift keying (amplitude&#8208;shift keying [ASK]/frequency&#8208;shift keying [FSK]/phase&#8208;shift keying [PSK]). Keying allows digital information to be communicated over a radio channel. While CMOS&#8208;based keying devices have evolved over the years, their hardware footprint and energy consumption are major concerns for resource constrained IoT communication. Furthermore, separate circuit designs and hardware elements are needed for each keying scheme and achieving multibit modulation to improve bandwidth efficiency remains a challenge. Here, a reconfigurable modulator is introduced that exploits unique ambipolar transport and programmable Dirac voltage in ultrathin MoTe2 field&#8208;effect transistors to achieve ASK, FSK, and PSK modulation. Furthermore, by integrating two programmed MoTe2 field&#8208;effect transistors, multibit data modulation is demonstrated, which improves the bandwidth efficiency by 200%. Finally, a frequency quadrupler is also realized exploiting the unique &#8220;double&#8208;well&#8221; transfer characteristic.

         <title>Ion Migration Mechanism: An Overall Understanding of Anionic Redox Activity in Metal Oxide Cathodes of Li/Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Anionic redox reaction (ARR) has attracted extensive attention in recent years due to its potential to enhance the reversible capacity of cathode materials in Li/Na&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). However, the understanding of its activation mechanism is still limited by the insufficient mastering of the underlying thermodynamics and kinetics. In this work, a series of Mg/Li/Zn&#8208;substituted NaxMnO2 and LixMnO2 cathode materials are designed to investigate their ARR behaviors. It is found that ARR can be activated in only Li&#8208;substituted LixMnO2 but not for Mg and Zn&#8208;substituted ones, while all Mg/Li/Zn&#8208;substituted NaxMnO2 cathode materials exhibit ARR activities. Combining ab initio calculations with experimental XRD refinements, such a huge difference between Li and Na cathodes, with Mg substituted compounds as a proof of concept, was revealed to be closely related to the migration of Mg2+ from the transition metal (TM) layer to the alkali metal (AM) layer in a kinetic aspect. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane migration of Mg2+ ions can merely occur in the Na compound but not in Li one, thus generating unique Na&#8208;O&#8208;&#9633;TM and/or &#9633;Na&#8208;O&#8208;&#9633;TM configurations and reducing reaction activation energy to trigger the ARR. Based on these findings, an ion migration mechanism is proposed for the first time to explain the different ARR behaviors between the NaxMnO2 and LixMnO2, which can not only reveal the origin of ARR in the kinetic aspect, but also provide a new insight for the development of high&#8208;capacity metal oxide cathode materials for LIBs/SIBs.

         <title>Electro&#8208;thermal Characterization of Dynamical VO2 Memristors via Local Activity Modeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Translating the surging interest in neuromorphic electronic components, such as those based on nonlinearities near Mott transitions, into large&#8208;scale commercial deployment faces steep challenges in the current lack of means to identify and design key material parameters. These issues are exemplified by the difficulties in connecting measurable material properties to device behavior via circuit element models. Here we use the principle of Local Activity to build a model of VO2 / SiN Mott threshold switches by sequentially accounting for constraints from a minimal set of quasi&#8208;static and dynamic electrical and high spatial resolution thermal data obtained via in&#8208;situ thermoreflectance mapping. By combining independent data sets for devices with varying dimensions, we distill the model to measurable material properties and established device scaling laws. The model can accurately predict electrical and thermal conductivities and capacitances and locally active dynamics (especially persistent spiking self&#8208;oscillations). The systematic procedure by which we develop this model has been a missing link in predictively connecting neuromorphic device behavior with their underlying material properties, and should enable rapid screening of material candidates before employing expensive manufacturing processes and testing procedures.

         <title>Functional Coating from Amyloid Superwetting Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tailoring the hydrophilicity of solid surfaces with a strong affinity to water has been extensively explored in the last 20 years, but studies have been limited to the single function of wettability. Here, we extend the multifunctional properties of tailored surface films from exhibiting superwettability to facilitating biological activities. We show that amyloid fibrils can be universally coated onto various substrates, such as fabrics (non&#8208;woven organic masks), metal meshes, polyethersulfone (PES), glass and more, endowing the resulting surfaces with excellent performance in oil/water mixture and emulsion separation, antifouling, and antifogging. Moreover, the biocompatible crosslinked amyloid fibrils coatings can serve as a platform for biocatalytic activities by immobilizing enzymes, as we show in the ABTS oxidation and RB5 degradation by laccase from Trametes versicolor. The study provides a universal approach to modifying surface morphology and chemical properties via fibrous protein templates, opening the way to unexplored bio&#8208;based applications and functionalities.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tailoring the hydrophilicity of solid surfaces with a strong affinity to water has been extensively explored in the last 20 years, but studies have been limited to the single function of wettability. Here, we extend the multifunctional properties of tailored surface films from exhibiting superwettability to facilitating biological activities. We show that amyloid fibrils can be universally coated onto various substrates, such as fabrics (non-woven organic masks), metal meshes, polyethersulfone (PES), glass and more, endowing the resulting surfaces with excellent performance in oil/water mixture and emulsion separation, antifouling, and antifogging. Moreover, the biocompatible crosslinked amyloid fibrils coatings can serve as a platform for biocatalytic activities by immobilizing enzymes, as we show in the ABTS oxidation and RB5 degradation by laccase from &lt;i&gt;Trametes versicolor&lt;/i&gt;. The study provides a universal approach to modifying surface morphology and chemical properties via fibrous protein templates, opening the way to unexplored bio-based applications and functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Calcium Fluoride Nanozyme for Ultrasound&#8208;Amplified and Ca2+&#8208;Overload&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Tumor Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinct valence&#8208;invariable CaF2 nanozyme with ultrasound&#8208;enhanced peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activity is rationally designed and engineered for efficient Ca2+&#8208;overload&#8208;enhanced catalytic tumor nanotherapy, which is the first paradigm of Ca&#8208;based nanozymes for catalytic cancer treatment.








Abstract
The anticancer mechanism of nanozymes is dominantly associated with the capacity for generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by the valence change of metal elements. However, very little research is focused on and has achieved the exploration and development of enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities of valence&#8208;invariable metal compounds. Herein, a distinct valence&#8208;invariable calcium fluoride (CaF2) nanozyme with ultrasound (US)&#8208;enhanced peroxidase (POD)&#8208;mimicking activity is rationally designed and engineered for efficient calcium (Ca2+)&#8208;overload&#8208;enhanced catalytic tumor nanotherapy, which is the first paradigm of Ca&#8208;based nanozymes for catalytic cancer treatment. The release of exogenous Ca2+ ions from CaF2 nanocrystals and deleterious ROS generation derived from US&#8208;amplified POD&#8208;mimicking properties facilitate intracellular Ca2+ accumulation and achieve Ca2+&#8208;overload&#8208;induced mitochondrial dysfunction through introducing exogenous Ca2+ ions and regulating calcium&#8208;pumping channels of neoplastic cells. Especially, US as an exogenous energy input is capable of substantially amplifying POD&#8208;mimicking catalytic activities of CaF2 nanozyme, ultimately achieving efficient anti&#8208;neoplastic outcome on both 4T1 breast tumor and H22 hepatic carcinoma animal models. Such a discovery of enzyme&#8208;like activity of valence&#8208;invariable metal compounds can broaden the cognition scope of nanozymes and effectively serves the field of catalytic and chemoreactive nanomedicine.

         <title>Advances on Thermally Conductive Epoxy&#8208;Based Composites as Electronic Packaging Underfill Materials&#8212;A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Underfill materials with high thermal conductivity play crucial roles in ensuring the reliability and performance of microelectronic devices. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances that have been made to meet the key requirements of capillary underfill materials are reviewed. Perspectives and an outlook for designing high&#8208;performance underfill materials with novel microstructures in electronic packaging are provided.








Abstract
The integrated circuits industry has been continuously producing microelectronic components with ever higher integration level, packaging density, and power density, which demand more stringent requirements for heat dissipation. Electronic packaging materials are used to pack these microelectronic components together, help to dissipate heat, redistribute stresses, and protect the whole system from the environment. They serve an important role in ensuring the performance and reliability of the electronic devices. Among various packaging materials, epoxy&#8208;based underfills are often employed in flip&#8208;chip packaging. However, widely used capillary underfill materials suffer from their low thermal conductivity, unable to meet the growing heat dissipation required of next&#8208;generation IC chips with much higher power density. Many strategies have been proposed to improve the thermal conductivity of epoxy, but its application as underfill materials with complex performance requirements is still difficult. In fact, optimizing the combined thermal&#8211;electrical&#8211;mechanical&#8211;processing properties of underfill materials for flip&#8208;chip packaging remains a great challenge. Herein, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances that have been made to satisfy the key requirements of capillary underfill materials are reviewed. Based on these studies, the perspectives for designing high&#8208;performance underfill materials with novel microstructures in electronic packaging for high&#8208;power density electronic devices are provided.

         <title>Super&#8208;Reversible CuF2 Cathodes Enabled by Cu2+&#8208;Coordinated Alginate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;ion dissolution in copper fluoride (CuF2) cathodes is successfully suppressed by in&#160;situ formation of a Cu2+&#8208;coordinated sodium alginate&#160;layer on the surface of CuF2&#160;nanoparticles during the electrode&#8208;fabrication, which can selectively enable the transportation of Li ions while blocking the mobility of Cu ions, reduce the undesirable interaction between electrolyte/electrode interface, and thus improving the cyclic stability of CuF2.








Abstract
Copper fluoride (CuF2) has the highest energy density among all metal fluoride cathodes owing to its high theoretical potential (3.55&#160;V) and high capacity (528&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1). However, CuF2&#160;can only survive for less than five cycles, mainly due to serious Cu&#8208;ion dissolution during charge/discharge cycles. Herein, copper dissolution is successfully suppressed by forming Cu2+&#8208;coordinated sodium alginate (Cu&#8208;SA) on the surface of CuF2&#160;particles during the electrode fabrication process, by using water as a slurry solvent and sodium alginate (SA) as a binder. The trace dissolved Cu2+ in water from CuF2&#160;can in situ cross&#8208;link with SA binder forming a conformal Cu&#8208;SA layer on CuF2&#160;surface. After water evaporation during the electrode dry process, the Cu&#8208;SA layer is Li&#8208;ion conductor but Cu2+ insulator, which can effectively suppress the dissolution of Cu&#8208;ions in the organic 4&#160;m LiClO4/ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate electrolyte, enhancing the reversibility of CuF2. CuF2&#160;electrode with SA binder delivers a reversible capacity of 420.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8208;1&#160;after 50&#160;cycles at 0.05&#160;C, reaching an energy density of 1009.1&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8208;1. Cu2+ cross&#8208;link polymer coating on CuF2&#160;opens the door for stabilizing the high&#8208;energy and low&#8208;cost CuF2&#160;cathode for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Intrinsic (Trap&#8208;Free) Transistors Based on Epitaxial Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsic (trap&#8208;free) field&#8208;effect transistors based on epitaxial single&#8208;crystalline CsPbBr3 perovskite films are reported. Extensive structural, electrical, and gated Hall&#8208;effect characterization confirms outstanding quality of the material and a nearly ideal transistor behavior. Hole mobility of 30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at room temperature, monotonically increasing on cooling to 250 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at 50 K, is measured in these transistors.








Abstract
The first experimental realization of the intrinsic (not dominated by defects) charge conduction regime in lead&#8208;halide perovskite field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) is reported. The advance is enabled by: i) a new vapor&#8208;phase epitaxy technique that results in large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystalline cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) films with excellent structural and surface properties, including atomically flat surface morphology, essentially free from defects and traps at the level relevant to device operation; ii) an extensive materials analysis of these films using a variety of thin&#8208;film and surface probes certifying the chemical and structural quality of the material; and iii) the fabrication of nearly ideal (trap&#8208;free) FETs with characteristics superior to any reported to date. These devices allow the investigation of the intrinsic FET and (gated) Hall&#8208;effect carrier mobilities as functions of temperature. The intrinsic mobility is found to increase on cooling from &#8776;30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at room temperature to &#8776;250 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at 50 K, revealing a band transport limited by phonon scattering. Establishing the intrinsic (phonon&#8208;limited) mobility provides a solid test for theoretical descriptions of carrier transport in perovskites, reveals basic limits to the technology, and points to a path for future high&#8208;performance perovskite electronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;The first experimental realization of the intrinsic (not dominated by defects) charge conduction regime in lead-halide perovskite field-effect transistors (FETs) is reported. The advance is enabled by: i) a new vapor-phase epitaxy technique that results in large-area single-crystalline cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) films with excellent structural and surface properties, including atomically flat surface morphology, essentially free from defects and traps at the level relevant to device operation; ii) an extensive materials analysis of these films using a variety of thin-film and surface probes certifying the chemical and structural quality of the material; and iii) the fabrication of nearly ideal (trap-free) FETs with characteristics superior to any reported to date. These devices allow the investigation of the intrinsic FET and (gated) Hall-effect carrier mobilities as functions of temperature. The intrinsic mobility is found to increase on cooling from &#8776;30 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature to &#8776;250 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 50 K, revealing a band transport limited by phonon scattering. Establishing the intrinsic (phonon-limited) mobility provides a solid test for theoretical descriptions of carrier transport in perovskites, reveals basic limits to the technology, and points to a path for future high-performance perovskite electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Unique NiOOH@FeOOH Heteroarchitecture for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution in Saline Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NiOOH@FeOOH heteroarchitecture shows outstanding electrocatalytic performance with an ultralow overpotential of 292&#160;mV to drive the current density of 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. An unconventional dual&#8208;sites mechanism is proposed to address the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process on NiOOH@FeOOH and show that the FeOOH underlayer plays a critical role on the enhanced OER activity of NiOOH.








Abstract
The development of highly efficient non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in low&#8208;grade or saline water is currently of great importance for the large&#8208;scale production of hydrogen. In this study, by using an electrochemical activation pretreatment, metal oxy(hydroxide) nanosheet structures derived from self&#8208;supported nickel&#8211;iron phosphide and nitride nanoarrays grown on Ni foam are successfully fabricated for OER catalysis in saline water. It is demonstrated that the different NiOOH and NiOOH@FeOOH (NiOOH grown on FeOOH) structures are generated from nickel&#8211;iron nitride and phosphide, respectively, after electrochemical activation. In particular, the NiOOH@FeOOH heteroarchitecture shows outstanding electrocatalytic performance with an ultralow overpotential of 292&#160;mV to drive the current density of 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. An unconventional dual&#8208;sites mechanism (UDSM) is proposed to address the OER process on NiOOH@FeOOH and show that the FeOOH underlayer plays a critical role regarding the enhanced OER activity of NiOOH. The new possible UDSM involving two reaction sites presents a different understanding of the OER process on multi&#8208;OH layer complexes, which is expected to guide the design of heteroarchitecture electrocatalysts.

         <title>Nanochitin and Nanochitosan: Chitin Nanostructure Engineering with Multiscale Properties for Biomedical and Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanochitins have recently attracted attention as a source of advanced green materials. Recent advances in molecular&#8208; and nanoscience have enabled the development of chitin nanostructures exhibiting physicochemical and biological properties depending on the length scale. This review summarizes new perspectives in developing sustainable advanced functional materials based on nanochitins with multiscale properties.








Abstract
Nanochitin and nanochitosan (with random&#8208;copolymer&#8208;based multiscale architectures of glucosamine and N&#8208;acetylglucosamine units) have recently attracted immense attention for the development of green, sustainable, and advanced functional materials. Nanochitin and nanochitosan are multiscale materials from small oligomers, rod&#8208;shaped nanocrystals, longer nanofibers, to hierarchical assemblies of nanofibers. Various physical properties of chitin and chitosan depend on their molecular&#8208; and nanostructures; translational research has utilized them for a wide range of applications (biomedical, industrial, environmental, and so on). Instead of reviewing the entire extensive literature on chitin and chitosan, here, recent developments in multiscale&#8208;dependent material properties and their applications are highlighted; immune, medical, reinforcing, adhesive, green electrochemical materials, biological scaffolds, and sustainable food packaging are discussed considering the size, shape, and assembly of chitin nanostructures. In summary, new perspectives for the development of sustainable advanced functional materials based on nanochitin and nanochitosan by understanding and engineering their multiscale properties are described.

         <title>Doping Engineering in the MoS2/SnSe2 Heterostructure toward High&#8208;Rejection&#8208;Ratio Solar&#8208;Blind UV Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The staggered large band offset heterojunction based on MoS2 and SnSe2 is an ideal structure for the separation of photogenerated carriers. Combined with doping engineering, a photodetector based on the doped MoS2/SnSe2 heterostructure exhibits excellent solar&#8208;blind UV photoresponse ability compared to the pure MoS2/SnSe2 heterostructure. The rejection ratio is significantly improved by about five orders of magnitude.








Abstract
The intentionally designed band alignment of heterostructures and doping engineering are keys to implement device structure design and device performance optimization. According to the theoretical prediction of several typical materials among the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and group&#8208;IV metal chalcogenides, MoS2 and SnSe2 present the largest staggered band offset. The large band offset is conducive to the separation of photogenerated carriers, thus MoS2/SnSe2 is a theoretically ideal candidate for fabricating photodetector, which is also verified in the experiment. Furthermore, in order to extend the photoresponse spectrum to solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (SBUV), doping engineering is adopted to form an additional electron state, which provides an extra carrier transition channel. In this work, pure MoS2/SnSe2 and doped MoS2/SnSe2 heterostructures are both fabricated. In terms of the photoelectric performance evaluation, the rejection ratio R254/R532 of the photodetector based on doped MoS2/SnSe2 is five orders of magnitude higher than that of pure MoS2/SnSe2, while the response time is obviously optimized by 3 orders. The results demonstrate that the combination of band alignment and doping engineering provides a new pathway for constructing SBUV photodetectors.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Mismatch&#8208;Driven Small&#8208;Angle Moir&#233; Twists in Epitaxially Grown 2D Vertical Layered Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epitaxially grown vertical layered heterostructures (VLHs) of mixed 2D layered materials are often thought to align without angular misorientation. However, it is shown that high&#8208;mismatch VLHs show discrete and sometimes non&#8208;zero twist angles dependent on their natural lattice mismatch value. This opens a pathway for scalable Moire VLH systems.








Abstract
Artificially introduced small twist angles at the interfaces of vertical layered heterostructures (VLHs) have allowed deterministic tuning of electronic and optical properties such as strongly correlated electronic phases and Moir&#233; excitons. But creating a Moir&#233; twist in van der Waals (vdWs) systems by manual stacking is challenging in reproducibility, uniformity, and accuracy of the twist angle, which hinders future studies. Here, it is demonstrated that contrary to the commonly believed 0&#176;&#8208;orientation in vdWs epitaxy, these VLHs show small twist angles controlled by the low&#8208;order commensurate phase with low energy and local atomic relaxation. A commensurate multilevel map is proposed to predict possible orientations. Remarkably, high&#8208;mismatch VLHs show discrete and sometimes non&#8208;zero twist angles dependent on their natural mismatch value. Such framework is experimentally confirmed in five epitaxially grown VLHs under high&#8208;angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM), and can provide significant insights for large&#8208;scale engineering of twist angle in VLHs.

         <title>Isolating Contiguous Ir Atoms and Forming Ir&#8208;W Intermetallics with Negatively Charged Ir for Efficient NO Reduction by CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The lack of efficient catalysts with a wide working temperature window and vital O2 and SO2 resistance for selective catalytic reduction of NO by CO (CO&#8208;SCR) largely hinders its implementation. Here a novel Ir&#8208;based catalyst with only 1 wt% Ir loading is reported for efficient CO&#8208;SCR. In this catalyst, contiguous Ir atoms are isolated into single atoms, and Ir&#8208;W intermetallic nanoparticles are formed, which are supported on ordered mesoporous SiO2 (KIT&#8208;6). Notably, this catalyst enabled complete NO conversion to N2 at 250&#176;C in the presence of 1% O2 and had a wide temperature window (250&#8211;400&#176;C), outperforming the comparison samples with Ir isolated&#8208;single&#8208;atomic&#8208;sites and Ir nanoparticles, respectively. Also, it possessed a high SO2 tolerance. Both experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that single Ir atoms are negatively charged, dramatically enhancing the NO dissociation, while the Ir&#8208;W intermetallic nanoparticles accelerate the reduction of the N2O and NO2 intermediates by CO.

         <title>Intrinsically Stretchable, Highly&#8208;Efficient Organic Solar Cells Enabled by Polymer Donors Featuring Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Spacers</title>

Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs), consisting of all stretchable layers, are attracting significant attention as a future power source for wearable electronics. However, most of the efficient active layers for OSCs are mechanically brittle due to their rigid molecular structures designed for high electrical and optical properties. Here, we develop a series of new polymer donors (PDs, PhAmX) featuring phenyl amide (PhAm)&#8208;based flexible spacer (FS) inducing hydrogen&#8208;bonding (H&#8208;bonding) interactions. These PDs enable IS&#8208;OSCs with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.73% and excellent stretchability (PCE retention &gt; 80% of the initial value at 32% strain), representing the best performances among the reported IS&#8208;OSCs to date. The incorporation of PhAm&#8208;based FS enhances the molecular ordering of PDs as well as their interactions with a Y7 acceptor, enhancing the mechanical stretchability and electrical properties simultaneously. We also find that in rigid OSCs, the PhAm5:Y7 blend achieves a much higher PCE of 17.5% compared to that of the reference PM6:Y7 blend. The impact of the PhAm&#8208;FS linker on the mechanical and photovoltaic properties of OSCs is thoroughly investigated.

         <title>low&#8208;fouling zwitterionic polymeric colloids as resuscitation fluids for hemorrhagic shock</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Colloids, known as volume expanders, have been used as resuscitation fluids for hypovolemic shock for decades, as they increase plasma oncotic pressure and expand intravascular volume. However, recent studies show that commonly used synthetic colloids have adverse interactions with human biological systems. In this work, we design a low&#8208;fouling amine(N)&#8208;oxide based zwitterionic polymer as an alternative volume expander with improved biocompatibility and efficacy. We demonstrate that the polymer possesses anti&#8208;fouling ability, resisting cell interaction and deposition in major organs, and is rapidly cleared via renal filtration and hepatic circulation, reducing the risk of long&#8208;term side effects. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies showed an absence of adverse effects on hemostasis or any acute safety risks. Finally, we show that, in a head&#8208;to&#8208;head comparison with existing colloids and plasma, the zwitterionic polymer serves as more potent oncotic agents for restoring intravascular volume in a hemorrhagic shock model. Our design of N&#8208;oxide&#8208;based zwitterionic polymers may lead to the development of alternative fluid therapies to treat hypovolemic shocks and to improve fluid management in general.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Structure Dynamics of Nanocrystals Revealed by In&#8208;Situ and Environmental Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nanocrystals are of great importance in material sciences and industry. Engineering nanocrystals with desired structures and properties is no doubt one of the most important challenges in the field, which requires deep insight into atomic&#8208;scale dynamics of nanocrystals during the process. The rapid developments of in&#8208;situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), especially environmental TEM have revealed insights into nanocrystals to digest. According to the considerable progress based on in&#8208;situ electron microscopy, we will give a comprehensive review on nanocrystal dynamics from three aspects: nucleation and growth, structure evolution, and dynamics in reaction conditions. In the nucleation and growth part, we organize existing nucleation theories and growth pathways based on liquid and gas&#8208;solid phases. In the structure evolution part, we focus on in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of the evolution, including defects, phase, and disorder/order transitions. In the part of dynamics in reaction conditions, we discuss solid&#8208;solid and gas&#8208;solid interfaces of nanocrystals in atmosphere and correlate the structure&#8208;property relationship. Even though impressive progress has been made, additional efforts are required to develop the integrated and operando TEM methodologies for unveiling nanocrystal dynamics with high spatial, energy, and temporal resolutions.

         <title>Revisiting the Design Strategies for Metasurfaces: Fundamental Physics, Optimization, and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Over the last two decades, the capabilities of metasurfaces in light modulation with subwavelength thickness have been proven, and metasurfaces are expected to miniaturize conventional optical components and add various functionalities. In this review article, various metasurface design strategies are reviewed thoroughly. First, we revisit the scalar diffraction theory to provide the basic principle of light propagation. Then, we discuss widely used design methods based on the unit&#8208;cell approach. The methods include a set of simplified steps, including the phase map retrieval and meta&#8208;atom unit&#8208;cell design. Then, we introduce recently emerging metasurfaces that may not be accurately designed using unit&#8208;cell approach. We examine unconventional metasurfaces where the conventional design methods fail and finally discuss potential design methods for such metasurfaces.

         <title>Dual&#8208;interface reinforced flexible perovskite solar cells for enhanced performance and mechanical reliability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The two key interfaces in flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) are mechanically reinforced simultaneously: one between the electron transport layer (ETL) and the 3D metal halide perovskite (MHP) thin film using self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM), and the other between the 3D&#8208;MHP thin film and the hole transport layer (HTL) using an in situ&#8208;grown low&#8208;dimensional (LD) MHP capping layer. The interfacial mechanical properties are measured and modeled. This rational interface engineering results in not only enhancement of the mechanical properties of both interfaces but also of their optoelectronic properties holistically. As a result, the new class of dual&#8208;interface reinforced f&#8208;PSCs have an unprecedented combination of the following three important performance parameters: high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.03% (with reduced hysteresis), enhanced operational stability of 1,000&#160;h T90 (duration at 90% initial PCE retained), and enhanced mechanical reliability of 10,000 cycles n88 (number of bending cycles at 88% initial PCE retained). The scientific underpinnings of these synergistic enhancements are elucidated.

         <title>Electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical failure of solid electrolyte induced by growth of internal lithium filaments</title>

Abstract
Growth of lithium (Li) filaments within solid electrolytes, leading to the mechanical degradation of electrolyte and even short circuit of cell under high current density, is a great barrier to commercial adoption of solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries. Understanding of this electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical phenomena is usually hindered by the challenge of tracking local fields such as stress, displacement, and electric fields inside solid electrolyte by experimental techniques. Here, we report a multiphysics simulation aiming to investigate the evolution of mechanical failure of solid electrolyte induced by the electrochemical plating of Li inside. Visualization of local stress, resulted damage and crack propagation within solid electrolyte enables comprehensive examination of critical factors dominating the degradation process, including the geometry, number, and size of Li filaments as well as pre&#8208;existing voids in the electrolyte. The relative damage induced by locally high stress is found to preferentially occur at the region with great fluctuation at the solid electrolyte/Li filament interface. Under the condition of multiple Li filaments in the solid electrolyte pellet, high number density of Li filament or voids triggers the integration of damage and crack networks by the enhanced propagation between adjacent filaments. Our model is built on the synchronous coupling of the mechanical behavior of solid electrolyte and the electrochemical plating of Li inside, revealing the evolution of multi&#8208;physical fields that can barely be captured by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art experimental techniques. The understanding for the mechanical degradation of solid electrolyte with presence of Li filaments paves the way to design advanced solid electrolyte for future solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Growth of lithium (Li) filaments within solid electrolytes, leading to the mechanical degradation of electrolyte and even short circuit of cell under high current density, is a great barrier to commercial adoption of solid-state Li metal batteries.

         <title>Design of smart aggregates: towards rapid clinical diagnosis of hyperlipidemia in human blood</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Molecular aggregates with environmental responsive property are desired for their wide practical applications such as bio&#8208;probes. Here, we report a series of smart near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminogens for hyperlipidemia (HLP) diagnosis. The aggregates of these molecules exhibit the twisted intramolecular charge transfer effect in aqueous medium, but aggregation&#8208;induced emission in high viscous medium due to the restriction of the intramolecular motion. We describe these aggregates, which can autonomously respond to different environments via switching of the aggregation state without changing their chemical structures, as &#8220;smart aggregates&#8221;. Intriguingly, these luminogens demonstrate NIR&#8208;II and NIR&#8208;III luminescence with ultra&#8208;large Stokes shifts (&gt; 950&#160;nm). Both in vitro detection and in vivo imaging of HLP can be realized in a mouse model. Linear relationships exist between the emission intensity and multiple pathological parameters in blood samples of HLP patients. Thus, the design of smart aggregate facilitates rapid and accurate detection of HLP and provides a promising attempt in aggregate science.

         <title>Freestanding and Scalable Force&#8208;softness Bimodal Sensor Arrays for Haptically Body Feature Identification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tactile technologies that can identify human body features are valuable in clinical diagnosis and human&#8208;machine interactions. Previously cutting&#8208;edge tactile platforms can identify structured non&#8208;living objects; however, human body feature identification remains challenging mainly because of the irregular contour and heterogeneous spatial distribution of softness. Here we develop freestanding and scalable tactile platforms of force&#8208;softness bimodal sensor arrays, enabling tactile gloves to identify body features using machine learning methods. The bimodal sensors are engineered by adding a protrusion on a piezoresistive pressure sensor, endowing the resistance signals with combined information of pressure and the softness of samples. The simple design enables 112 bimodal sensors to be integrated into the thin, conformal, and stretchable tactile glove, allowing the tactile information to be digitalized while hand skills are performed on the human body. The tactile glove shows high accuracy (98%) in identifying four body features of a real person, and four organ models (healthy and pathological) inside an abdominal simulator, demonstrating body feature identification of the bimodal tactile platforms and showing their potential use in future healthcare and robotics.

         <title>Spatially Band Separation in Surface Doped Heterolayered Structure for Realizing Efficient Singlet Oxygen Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) with electrical neutrality and long lifetime holds great promise in producing high value&#8208;added chemicals via selective oxidation reaction. However, photocatalytic 1O2 generation via charge&#8208;transfer mechanism still suffers from low efficiency due to mismatched redox capacities and low concentration of photo&#8208;generated carriers in confined systems. Herein, by taking bismuth oxysilicate (Bi2O2SiO3) with alternating heterogeneous layered structure as a model, we show that iodine doping can facilitate the spatial redistributions of bands on alternated [Bi2O2] and [SiO3] layers, which could promote the separation and transfer of photo&#8208;generated charge carriers. Meanwhile, the band positions of Bi2O2SiO3 was optimized to match the redox potential of 1O2 generation. Benefiting from these features, iodine doped Bi2O2SiO3 exhibits efficient 1O2 generation with respect to its pristine counterpart, leading to promoted performance in selective sulfide oxidation reaction. This study offers a new strategy for optimizing charge transfer&#8208;mediated 1O2 generation.

         <title>Electron Transport Layers Employing Strongly&#8208;Bound Ligands Enhance Stability in Colloidal Quantum Dot Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed photodetectors based on colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising candidates for short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) light sensing applications. Present&#8208;day CQD photodetectors employ a CQD active layer sandwiched between carrier transport layers in which the electron transport layer (ETL) is composed of metal oxides. Herein we develop a new class of ETLs using n&#8208;type CQDs, finding that these benefit from quantum&#8208;size effect tuning of band energies, as well as from surface ligand engineering. We demonstrate 1450&#160;nm&#8208;operating photodetectors using CQDs with tailored functionalities for each of the transport layers and the active layer. By optimizing the band alignment between the ETL and the active layer, we report CQD photodetectors that combine low dark current of &#8764;1 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;mA/cm2 with high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8764;66% at 1&#160;V, outperforming prior reports of &gt;1400&#160;nm&#8208;operating CQD photodetectors that relied on metal oxides as ETLs. We show that stable CQD photodetectors rely on well&#8208;passivated CQDs: for ETL CQDs, a strongly&#8208;bound organic ligand trans&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)cinnamic acid (TFCA) provides improved passivation compared to the weakly&#8208;bound inorganic ligand tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI). TFCA suppresses bias&#8208;induced ion migration inside the ETL and improves the operating stability of photodetectors by 50x compared to TBAI.

&lt;p&gt;Solution-processed photodetectors based on colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising candidates for short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) light sensing applications. Present-day CQD photodetectors employ a CQD active layer sandwiched between carrier transport layers in which the electron transport layer (ETL) is composed of metal oxides. Herein we develop a new class of ETLs using n-type CQDs, finding that these benefit from quantum-size effect tuning of band energies, as well as from surface ligand engineering. We demonstrate 1450&#160;nm-operating photodetectors using CQDs with tailored functionalities for each of the transport layers and the active layer. By optimizing the band alignment between the ETL and the active layer, we report CQD photodetectors that combine low dark current of &#8764;1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8764;66% at 1&#160;V, outperforming prior reports of &amp;gt;1400&#160;nm-operating CQD photodetectors that relied on metal oxides as ETLs.

Abstract
Flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density are highly desirable for wearable electronics. However, current approaches for designing flexible LIBs are diffcult to achieve the excellent flexibility and high energy density simultaneously. To mitigate the mismatch, mechano&#8208;graded electrodes with gradient&#8208;distributed maximum allowable strain are proposed to endow high&#8208;loading&#8208;mass slurry&#8208;coating electrodes with brilliant intrinsic flexibility without sacrificing energy density. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the up&#8208;graded LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 cathodes (&#8764;15&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, &#8764;70&#160;&#956;m) and graphite anodes (&#8764;8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, &#8764;105&#160;&#956;m) can tolerate an extremely low bending radius of 400&#160;&#956;m and 600&#160;&#956;m, respectively. Finite element analysis (FEA) reveals that, compared with conventionally homogeneous electrodes, the flexibility of up&#8208;graded electrodes is enhanced by specifically strengthening the upper layer and avoiding crack initiation. Benefiting from this, the foldable pouch cell (required bending radius of &#8764;600&#160;&#956;m) successfully realized a remarkable figure of merit (FOM, energy density versus bending radius) of 121.3 mWh cm&#8722;3. Moreover, the up&#8208;graded electrodes&#8208;based pouch cells can deliver a stable power supply, even under various deformation modes, such as twisting, folding, and knotting. This work proposes new insights for harmonizing mechanics and electrochemistry of energy storage devices to achieve high energy density under flexible extremes.

         <title>Bioactive Iridium Nanoclusters with Glutathione Depletion Ability for Enhanced Sonodynamic&#8208;Triggered Ferroptosis&#8208;like Cancer Cell Death</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ferroptosis is a regulated form of necrotic cell death that involves the accumulation of lipid peroxide (LPO) species in an iron&#8208; and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;dependent manner. Previous investigations reported that ferroptosis&#8208;based cancer therapy could overcome the limitations of traditional therapeutics targeting the apoptosis pathway. However, it is still challenging to enhance the antitumor efficacy of ferroptosis due to intrinsic cellular regulation. In this study, ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agent, i.e., chlorine e6 (Ce6)&#8208;conjugated human serum albumin&#8208;iridium oxide (HSA&#8208;Ce6&#8208;IrO2, HCIr) nanoclusters were developed to achieve sonodynamic therapy (SDT)&#8208;triggered ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cells death. The sonosensitizing role of both Ce6 and IrO2 within the HCIr nanoclusters exhibited highly efficient 1O2 generation capacity upon ultrasound stimulation, which promoted the accumulation of LPO and subsequently induced ferroptosis. Meanwhile, the HCIr could deplete glutathione (GSH) by accelerating Ir (IV)&#8208;Ir (III) transition, which further suppressed the activity of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) to enhance the ferroptosis efficacy. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrated that HCIr possessed tremendous capacity to reduce the intracellular GSH content, which enhanced SDT&#8208;triggered ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death. We developed iridium nanoclusters&#8208;based ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agent providing a promising strategy for inducing ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death.

         <title>Tuning the Dynamics of Viral Factories&#8208;Inspired Compartments Formed by Peptide&#8208;RNA Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Viral factories are intracellular microcompartments formed by mammalian viruses in their host cells, and contain necessary machinery for viral genome replication, capsid assembly and maturation, thus serve as &#8220;factories&#8221; for formation of new viral particles. Recent evidence suggest that these compartments are formed by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) of viral proteins and nucleic acids and present dynamic properties. Inspired by the remarkable functionalities of viral factories we designed dynamic compartments that are formed by complexation between a minimalistic, disordered peptide and RNA. By systematic studies using sequence variants we show that the material properties of the compartments can be modulated by changes to the peptide sequence, at a single amino acid level. Moreover, by taking this approach to the next step, we developed liquid compartments with light&#8208;induced tunable dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the material properties of liquid droplets can be temporally regulated by increasing peptide polarity and charge, and that these changes can be further utilized for controlled partitioning and release of payloads from the compartments.

         <title>Zwitterionic Dendrimersomes: A Closer Xenobiotic Mimic of Cell Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Building functional mimics of cell membranes is an important task toward the development of synthetic cells. So far, lipid and amphiphilic block copolymers are the most widely used amphiphiles with the bilayers by the former lacking stability while membranes by the latter are typically characterized by very slow dynamics. Herein, we introduce a new type of Janus dendrimer containing a zwitterionic phosphocholine hydrophilic headgroup (JDPC) and a 3,5&#8208;substituted dihydrobenzoate&#8208;based hydrophobic dendron. JDPC self&#8208;assembles in water into zwitterionic dendrimersomes (z&#8208;DSs) that faithfully recapitulate the cell membrane in thickness, flexibility, and fluidity, while being resilient to harsh conditions and displaying faster pore closing dynamics in the event of membrane rupture. This enables the fabrication of hybrid DSs with components of natural membranes, including pore&#8208;forming peptides, structure&#8208;directing lipids, and glycans to create raft&#8208;like domains or onion vesicles. Moreover, z&#8208;DSs can be used to create active synthetic cells with life&#8208;like features that mimic vesicle fusion and motility as well as environmental sensing. Despite their fully synthetic nature, z&#8208;DSs are minimal cell mimics that can integrate and interact with living matter with the programmability to imitate life&#8208;like features and beyond.

         <title>Interface Capture Effect Printing Atomic&#8208;thick Two&#8208;dimensional Semiconductor Thin Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductor crystals offer the opportunity to further extend Moore's law to the atomic scale. For practical and low&#8208;cost electronic applications, directly printing devices on substrates is advantageous compared to conventional microfabrication techniques that utilize expensive photolithography, etching, and vacuum metallization processes. However, the currently printed 2D transistors are plagued by unsatisfactory electrical performance, thick semiconductor layers, and low device density. Herein, we demonstrate a facile and scalable 2D semiconductor printing strategy utilizing the interface capture effect and hyperdispersed 2D nanosheet ink to fabricate high&#8208;quality and atomic&#8208;thick semiconductor thin&#8208;film arrays without additional surfactants. Printed robust thin&#8208;film transistors using 2D semiconductors (e.g., MoS2) and 2D conductive electrodes (e.g., graphene) exhibit high electrical performance, including a carrier mobility of up to 6.7 cm2&#183;V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 and an on/off ratio of 2&#215;106 at 25&#176;C. As a proof of concept, we printed 2D transistors with a density of &#8764;47000 devices per square centimeter. In addition, this method can be applied to many other 2D materials, such as NbSe2, Bi2Se3, and black phosphorus, for printing diverse high&#8208;quality thin films. Thus, the strategy of printable 2D thin&#8208;film transistors provide a scalable pathway for the facile manufacturing of high&#8208;performance electronics at an affordable cost.

Abstract
Direct detection of circularly polarized light (CPL) is a challenging task due to limited materials and ambiguous structure&#8208;property relationships that lead to low distinguishability of the light helicities. Perovskite ferroelectric semiconductors incorporating chirality provide new opportunities in dealing with this issue. Herein, we report a pair of 2D chiral perovskite ferroelectrics with enhanced CPL detection performance due to interplays among lattice, photon, charge, spin, and orbit. The chirality&#8208;transfer induced chiral&amp;polar ferroelectric phase enhances the asymmetric nature of the photo&#8208;active sublattice and achieves a switchable self&#8208;powered detection via the bulk photovoltaic effect. The single&#8208;crystal&#8208;based device exhibits a CPL&#8208;sensitive detection performance under 430&#160;nm with an asymmetric factor of 0.20 for left&#8208; and right&#8208;CPL differentiation, about two times of pure chiral counterparts. The enhanced CPL detection performance is ascribed to the Rashba&#8208;Dresselhaus effect that originates from the bulk inversion asymmetry and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling, shown with a large Rashba coefficient that is demonstrated by DFT calculation and circularly polarized light excited photoluminescence measurement. Our results provide new perspectives on chiral Rashba ferroelectric semiconductors for direct CPL detection and ferroelectrics&#8208;based chiroptics and spintronics.

         <title>Macroscopic Heterostructure Membrane of Graphene Oxide /Porous Graphene/Graphene Oxide for Selective Separation of Deuterium Water from Natural Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Deuterium water (D2O) is strategic material that is widely used in nuclear weapons, civilian nuclear energy, and scientific research. However, its content in natural water is extremely low. Therefore, the development of a room temperature technology for achieving simple, efficient, and low&#8208;cost separation of D2O from natural water is challenging. In this study, porous graphene (PG) nanosheets with &#8220;crater&#8208;like&#8221; pores were sandwiched between two layers of graphene oxide (GO) membranes to prepare a GO/PG/GO membrane with a macroscopic heterostructure, which can be used to separate D2O and H2O by pressure&#8208;driven filtration. At 25 &#176;C, the rejection rate of D2O was approximately 97%, the selectivity of H2O/D2O was approximately 35.2, and the excellent performance could be attributed to the difference of transmembrane resistance and flow state of H2O and D2O in the confinement state. In addition, the D2O concentration in natural water was successfully enriched from 0.013% to 0.059% using only one stage and the membrane exhibited excellent structural and cycling stability. Therefore, this method did not require ultra&#8208;low temperatures, high energy supplies, complex separation equipment, or the introduction of toxic chemicals. Thus, it can be directly applied to the large&#8208;scale industrial production and removal of D2O.

         <title>Making Highly Elastic and Tough Hydrogels from Doughs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A hydrogel is often fabricated from preexisting polymer chains by covalently crosslinking them into a polymer network. The crosslinks make the hydrogel swell&#8208;resistant but brittle. This conflict is resolved here by making a hydrogel from a dough. The dough is formed by mixing long polymer chains with a small amount of water and photoinitiator. The dough is then homogenized by kneading and annealing at elevated temperatures, during which the crowded polymer chains densely entangle. The polymer chains are then sparsely crosslinked into a polymer network under an ultraviolet lamp, and submerged in water to swell to equilibrium. The resulting hydrogel is both swell&#8208;resistant and tough. The hydrogel also has near&#8208;perfect elasticity, high strength, high fatigue resistance, and low friction. The method is demonstrated with widely used polymers, poly(ethylene glycol) and cellulose. These hydrogels have never been made swell&#8208;resistant, elastic, and tough before. The method is generally applicable to synthetic and natural polymers, and is compatible with industrial processing technologies, opening doors to the development of sustainable, high&#8208;performance hydrogels.

         <title>Unique Role of GeO2 as a Noninvasive Promoter of Nano&#8208;sized Zeolite Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The synthesis of zeolites with nano&#8208;sized dimensions is often limited to a narrow design space that conventionally relies upon the design of organics to direct hierarchical materials. Here, we demonstrate that the addition of an inorganic modifier, germanium oxide, to a zeolite growth mixture directs the formation of crystals with ultra&#8208;small dimensions. This effect was observed for both MEL&#8208; and MFI&#8208;type frameworks over a range of synthesis conditions wherein the role of GeO2 in zeolite crystallization deviates from its typical function as a heteroatom. Notably, the final products contain trace amounts of Ge, which indicates the inorganic modifier does not compete for sites in the zeolite framework based on its formation of a discrete phase that enables GeO2 recovery. Catalytic tests using the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons reaction reveal significant enhancement in the performance of zeolite catalysts prepared with GeO2 compared to reported examples of nano&#8208;sized MFI and MEL zeolites. These findings highlight a potentially generalizable and commercially viable synthesis method to reduce mass transport limitations in zeolites for diverse applications.

         <title>Biomimetic Polymeric Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Chemotherapy Potentiates Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy via Amplification of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Construction of multifunctional nanoplatforms to elevate chemotherapeutic efficacy and induce long&#8208;term antitumor immunity still remains to be an extreme challenge. Herein, we report the design of an advanced redox&#8208;responsive nanomedicine formulation based on phosphorus dendrimer&#8208;copper(II) complexes (1G3&#8208;Cu)&#8208; and toyocamycin (Toy)&#8208;loaded polymeric nanoparticles (GCT NPs) coated with cancer cell membranes (CM). The designed GCT@CM NPs with a size of 210 nm are stable under a physiological condition but are rapidly dissociated in the reductive tumor microenvironment to deplete glutathione and release drugs. The co&#8208;loading of 1G3&#8208;Cu and Toy within the NPs causes significant tumor cell apoptosis and immunogenic cell death through 1G3&#8208;Cu&#8208;induced mitochondrial dysfunction and Toy&#8208;mediated amplification of endoplasmic reticulum stress, respectively, thus effectively suppressing tumor growth, promoting dendritic cell maturation, and increasing tumor&#8208;infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Likewise, the coated CM and the loaded 1G3&#8208;Cu render the GCT@CM NPs with homotypic targeting and T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging of tumors, respectively. With the assistance of programmed cell death ligand 1 antibody, the GCT@CM NP&#8208;mediated chemotherapy can significantly potentiate tumor immunotherapy for effective inhibition of tumor recurrence and metastasis. The developed GCT@CM NPs hold a great potential for chemotherapy&#8208;potentiated immunotherapy of different tumor types through different mechanisms or synergies.

         <title>Engineering Electro&#8208;Optic BaTiO3 Nanocrystals via Efficient Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electro&#8208;optic (EO) modulators provide electrical&#8208;to&#8208;optical signal conversion relevant to optical communications. Barium titanate (BaTiO3) is a promising material system for EO modulation in light of its optical ultrafast nonlinearity, low optical loss, and high refractive index. To enhance further its spontaneous polarization, BaTiO3 can be doped at the Ba and Ti sites; however, doping is often accompanied by ion migration, which diminishes EO performance. Here we investigate donor&#8208;acceptor doping and its effect on EO efficiency, finding that La&#8208;doped BaTiO3 achieves an EO coefficient of 42 pm/V at 1&#160;kHz, fully twice that of the pristine specimen; however, we also observe that, with this single&#8208;element doping, the EO response falls off rapidly with frequency. From impedance spectroscopy, we find that frequency&#8208;dependent EO is correlated with ion migration. Density functional theory calculations predict that the ion migration barrier decreases with La3+ doping but can be recovered with further Mn2+ doping, a finding that prompts us to prevent ion migration by incorporating Mn2+ into the Ti&#8208;site to compensate for the charge imbalance.

Density functional theory calculations predict that the ion migration barrier decreases with La&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; doping but can be recovered with further Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; doping, a finding that prompts us to prevent ion migration by incorporating Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into the Ti-site to compensate for the charge imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) voxel printing enables site&#8208;specific variation of materials and properties at a voxel scale in one printed part, but it is currently limited to building voxelated parts with varying mechanical properties and colors. Here, we report the design and fabrication of voxelated conductive elastomers using Multi Jet Fusion 3D voxel printing actualized by a newly developed multifunctional agent (MA). The MA mainly consists of carbon nanotubes and poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate, serving as an infrared absorbing colorant, reinforcement, and conductive fillers. By controlling drop&#8208;on&#8208;demand agent dispensing on thermoplastic polyurethane powder, a wide range of electrical conductivity, ranging from 10&#8211;10 S/cm to 10&#8211;1 S/cm, can be tailored across a single printed part at a voxel resolution of &#8764;100&#160;&#956;m. Assembly&#8208;free strain sensors comprising conductive sensing layers and insulating frames are fabricated to demonstrate the capability of the technique in manufacturing all&#8208;printed wearable devices.
