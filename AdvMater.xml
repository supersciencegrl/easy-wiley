         <title>Exciton Dissociation and Recombination Afford Narrowband Organic Afterglow Through Efficient FRET</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy is proposed for achieving narrow&#8208;band, long&#8208;lived, and full&#8208;color organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) by isolating multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent fluorophores in a steroid&#8208;type host capable of exciton dissociation and recombination. Through efficient FRET, the LPL exhibits a small full&#8208;width at a half&#8208;maximum of 33&#160;nm, persistent time exceeding 10&#160;s, and tunable color among 414&#8211;600&#160;nm.








Abstract
Organic afterglow with long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) after photoexcitation is highly attractive, but the realization of narrowband afterglow with small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) is a huge challenge since it is intrinsically contradictory to the triplet&#8208; and solid&#8208;state emission nature of organic afterglow. Here, narrow&#8208;band, long&#8208;lived, and full&#8208;color organic LPL is realized by isolating multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) fluorophores in a glassy steroid&#8208;type host through a facile melt&#8208;cooling treatment. Such prepared host becomes capable of exciton dissociation and recombination (EDR) upon photoirradiation for both long&#8208;lived fluorescence and phosphorescence; and, the efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the host to various MR&#8208;TADF emitters leads to high&#8208;performance LPL, exhibiting small FWHM of 33&#160;nm, long persistent time over 10&#160;s, and facile color&#8208;tuning in a wide range from deep&#8208;blue to orange (414&#8211;600&#160;nm). Moreover, with the extraordinary narrowband LPL and easy processability of the material, centimeter&#8208;scale flexible optical waveguide fibers and integrated FWHM/color/lifetime&#8208;resolved multilevel encryption/decryption devices have been designed and fabricated. This novel EDR and singlet/triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet FRET strategy to achieve excellent LPL performances illustrates a promising way for constructing flexible organic afterglow with easy preparation methods, shedding valuable scientific insights into the design of narrow&#8208;band emission in organic afterglow.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Enabled Tomographic Imaging of Chemical Short&#8208;Range Atomic Ordering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning enhanced approach is introduced to break the inherent resolution limitation of atom probe tomography, and precisely image multiple arrangements of atoms associated with (non&#8208;) statistical chemical short&#8208;range order, in three dimensions, in CoCrNi medium&#8208;entropy alloys with no prior knowledge of the presence of chemical short&#8208;range order or which type.








Abstract
In solids, chemical short&#8208;range order (CSRO) refers to the self&#8208;organization of atoms of certain species occupying specific crystal sites. CSRO is increasingly being envisaged as a lever to tailor the mechanical and functional properties of materials. Yet quantitative relationships between properties and the morphology, number density, and atomic configurations of CSRO domains remain elusive. Herein, it is showcased how machine learning&#8208;enhanced atom probe tomography (APT) can mine the near&#8208;atomically resolved APT data and jointly exploit the technique's high elemental sensitivity to provide a 3D quantitative analysis of CSRO in a CoCrNi medium&#8208;entropy alloy. Multiple CSRO configurations are revealed, with their formation supported by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Monte&#8208;Carlo simulations. Quantitative analysis of these CSROs allows establishing relationships between processing parameters and physical properties. The unambiguous characterization of CSRO will help refine strategies for designing advanced materials by manipulating atomic&#8208;scale architectures.

         <title>Asymmetric Wettability Hydrogel Surfaces for Enduring Electromyographic Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversal wettability inducing strategy based on hydrophobic interaction is proposed to integrally synthesize Janus hydrogel without affecting the mechanical elasticity and electrical properties. This interfacial engineering successfully realizes the optional inducing on the hydrogel surfaces. A combination of asymmetric wettability surfaces, excellent elasticity, and compatible conductivity endows the hydrogel electrode patch with a high&#8208;fidelity EMG signal in a perspiration environment.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrode interfaces have shown tremendous promise in the acquisition of surface electromyography (EMG) signals. However, the perspiration or moisture environments will trigger the deadhesion between hydrogel electrodes and human skin. Despite the hydrophobic/hydrophilic surfaces can perform the anti&#8208;moisture or adhesion respectively, it remains a challenge to integrally form a Janus hydrogel with homogeneous mechanical elasticity and electronic performance. Herein, a surface induction strategy is proposed to approach the hydrophobic/hydrophilic hydrogel surfaces. The hydrophobic interaction between surfactants and molds regulates the distribution of hydrophobic/hydrophilic monomers on the surface. The hydrophobic molds induce a hydrophilic hydrogel surface, while the hydrophilic molds induce a hydrophobic surface. It presents a new phenomenon of reversal wettability inducing and optional hydrogel surfaces. The integral Janus hydrogel can be easily obtained by the hydrophilic molds. Balance of adhesion, elasticity, and conductivity endows the hydrogel electrode patch with durable conformal adhesion and high&#8208;fidelity EMG signals even in the sweaty epidermis due to the asymmetric wettability surfaces. This hydrogel performs the quantitative description of muscle strength and accurate fatigue assessment. It offers a reliable candidate for future practical applications in continuous digital healthcare and intelligent human&#8211;machine interaction, even the Metaverse.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Weak Polarization&#8208;Strain Coupling Effect Boosts Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As the service electric field for MLCCs in pulsed circuit systems increases, electrostrain&#8208;induced vibration has become a critical failure mechanism. By employing a polarization&#8208;strain weak coupling strategy, the electrostriction coefficient of the relaxor dielectrics is significantly suppressed. This mitigation reduces the breakdown risk, enhancing the stability, performance, and lifespan of MLCCs.








Abstract
In pulse power systems, multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) encounter significant challenges due to the heightened loading electric field (E), which can lead to fatigue damage and ultrasonic concussion caused by electrostrictive strain. To address these issues, an innovative strategy focused on achieving an ultra&#8208;weak polarization&#8208;strain coupling effect is proposed, which effectively reduces strain in MLCCs. Remarkably, an ultra&#8208;low electrostrictive coefficient (Q33) of 0.012 m4 C&#8722;2 is achieved in the composition 0.55(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3&#8208;0.45Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3, resulting in a significantly reduced strain of 0.118% at 330&#160;kV cm&#8722;1. At the atomic scale, the local structural heterogeneity leads to an expanded and loose lattice structure, providing ample space for large ionic displacement polarization instead of lattice stretching when subjected to the applied E. This unique behavior not only promotes energy storage performance (ESP) but also accounts for the observed ultra&#8208;low Q33 and strain. Consequently, the MLCC device exhibits an impressive energy storage density of 14.6 J cm&#8722;3 and an ultrahigh efficiency of 93% at 720&#160;kV cm&#8722;1. Furthermore, the superior ESP of the MLCC demonstrates excellent fatigue resistance and temperature stability, making it a promising solution for practical applications. Overall, this pivotal strategy offers a cost&#8208;effective solution for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MLCCs with ultra&#8208;low strain&#8208;vibration in pulse power systems.

Local dipole modulation in organic solar cells can significantly enhance device performance. By adjusting molecular asymmetries, two non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, AA&#8208;1 and AA&#8208;2 are synthesized. The unidirectional asymmetry in AA&#8208;2 led to an improved balanced charge transport, resulting in an exceptional fill factor of 0.830 and a power conversion efficiency of 18.3%.








Abstract
Dipole moment arrangement in organic semiconductors plays a critical role in affecting the intermolecular packing, determining optoelectronic properties and device performance. Here, to get the desired fill factor (FF) values in organic solar cells (OSCs), the local dipole of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) is modulated by changing the molecular asymmetries. Two NFAs, AA&#8208;1 and AA&#8208;2 are designed and synthesized, which have different substitutions of alkyl and alkoxyl groups. The unidirectional asymmetry in AA&#8208;2 creates distinct local dipoles, while the bidirectional asymmetry in AA&#8208;1 mitigates dipole variation. Despite the minimal impact on monomolecular properties, the local dipole moment significantly influences terminal group packing modes in the film state. This, in turn, enhances the relative dielectric constant, prolongs exciton lifetime, and reduces sub&#8208;bandgap defect states. Consequently, PBDB&#8208;TF:AA&#8208;2&#8208;based OSCs achieve an exceptional FF of 0.830 and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.3%, with a ternary device reaching a PCE of 19.3%. This work highlights the potential of dipole modulation in material design to get ideal FF values for high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Compliant Lattice Modulations Enable Anomalous Elasticity in Ni&#8211;Mn&#8211;Ga Martensite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike any other crystalline metal, modulated Ni&#8211;Mn&#8211;Ga can achieve large reversible strains under mechanical loads comparable to a fingertip grip force. Dedicated laser&#8208;ultrasonic measurements on this material reveal that it has locally nearly zero elastic stiffness with respect to shear loads that modify the lattice modulations. This anomalous compliance makes Ni&#8211;Mn&#8211;Ga crystal one of the most elastically anisotropic materials ever reported, and is the key for understanding its peculiar mechanical instability and for searching for new materials with similar functionality.








Abstract
High mobility of twin boundaries in modulated martensites of Ni&#8211;Mn&#8211;Ga&#8208;based ferromagnetic shape memory alloys holds a promise for unique magnetomechanical applications. This feature has not been fully understood so far, and in particular, it has yet not been unveiled what makes the lattice mechanics of modulated Ni&#8211;Mn&#8211;Ga specifically different from other martensitic alloys. Here, results of dedicated laser&#8208;ultrasonic measurements on hierarchically twinned five&#8208;layer modulated (10M) crystals fill this gap. Using a combination of transient grating spectroscopy and laser&#8208;based resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, it is confirmed that there is a shear elastic instability in the lattice, being significantly stronger than in any other martensitic material and also than what the first&#8208;principles calculations for Ni&#8211;Mn&#8211;Ga predict. The experimental results reveal that the instability is directly related to the lattice modulations. A lattice&#8208;scale mechanism of dynamic faulting of the modulation sequence that explains this behavior is proposed; this mechanism can explain the extraordinary mobility of twin boundaries in 10M.

         <title>Photocatalytic Carbon Dots&#8208;Triggered Pyroptosis for Whole Cancer Cell Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic carbon dots (CDs)&#8208;induced pyroptotic cancer cells (PCIP), as a potential candidate for whole cancer cell vaccines (WCCV), can be used for effective tumor immunoprevention. In vivo, assessments reveal that PCIP induced specific immune&#8208;preventive effects through anticancer immune memory, demonstrating effective WCCV. This study provides a facile strategy that utilized photocatalytic CDs to induce pyroptosis of cancer cells for fabricating WCCV.








Abstract
Manufacturing whole cancer cell vaccines (WCCV) with both biosafety and efficacy is crucial for tumor immunotherapy. Pyroptotic cancer cells, due to their highly immunogenic properties, present a promising avenue for the development of WCCV. However, the successful development of WCCV based on pyroptotic cancer cells is yet to be accomplished. Here, a facile strategy that utilized photocatalytic carbon dots (CDs) to induce pyroptosis of cancer cells for fabricating WCCV is reported. Photocatalytic CDs are capable of generating substantial amounts of hydroxyl radicals and can effectively decrease cytoplasmic pH values under white light irradiation. This process efficiently triggers cancer cell pyroptosis through the reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mitochondria&#8208;caspase 3&#8208;gasdermin E pathway and the proton motive force&#8208;driven mitochondrial ATP synthesis pathway. Moreover, in vitro, these photocatalytic CDs&#8208;induced pyroptotic cancer cells (PCIP) can hyperactivate macrophage (M0&#8211;M1) with upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class II expression. In vivo, PCIP induced specific immune&#8208;preventive effects in melanoma and breast cancer mouse models through anticancer immune memory, demonstrating effective WCCV. This work provides novel insights for inducing cancer cell pyroptosis and bridges the gap in the fabrication of WCCV based on pyroptotic cancer cells.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Biased Bionic Fingertip E&#8208;Skin with Multimodal Tactile Perception and Artificial Intelligence for Augmented Touch Awareness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an intelligent E&#8208;skin featuring a minimalist design and versatile functions. Based on zero&#8208;biased triboelectric&#8208;based and ionic hydrogel&#8208;based artificial neurons, it realizes high&#8208;accuracy perception of surface texture, roughness, hardness, material, and temperature with only a single sensing unit, empowered by multimodal tactile sensing capability and artificial intelligence.








Abstract
Electronic skins (E&#8208;Skins) are crucial for future robotics and wearable devices to interact with and perceive the real world. Prior research faces challenges in achieving comprehensive tactile perception and versatile functionality while keeping system simplicity for lack of multimodal sensing capability in a single sensor. Two kinds of tactile sensors, transient voltage artificial neuron (TVAN) and sustained potential artificial neuron (SPAN), featuring self&#8208;generated zero&#8208;biased signals are developed to realize synergistic sensing of multimodal information (vibration, material, texture, pressure, and temperature) in a single device instead of complex sensor arrays. Simultaneously, machine learning with feature fusion is applied to fully decode their output information and compensate for the inevitable instability of applied force, speed, etc, in real applications. Integrating TVAN and SPAN, the formed E&#8208;Skin achieves holistic touch awareness in only a single unit. It can thoroughly perceive an object through a simple touch without strictly controlled testing conditions, realize the capability to discern surface roughness from 0.8 to 1600&#160;&#181;m, hardness from 6HA to 85HD, and correctly distinguish 16 objects with temperature variance from 0 to 80&#160;&#176;C. The E&#8208;skin also features a simple and scalable fabrication process, which can be integrated into various devices for broad applications.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Magneto&#8208;Photoresponse in All&#8208;2D Optoelectronic Devices for In&#8208;Sensor Vision Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In 2D optoelectronic devices with the electrodes of 2D ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 and channel of WSe2, the photoresponse is effectively controlled by magnetic fields at room temperature. This room&#8208;temperature magneto&#8208;photoresponse, achieved by the 2D magneto&#8208;band structure, lays the groundwork for multidimensional responsive optoelectronic devices. It holds promise for the development of robust in&#8208;sensor machine vision systems with gate&#8208;free architectures.








Abstract
Interplay between magnetism and photoelectric properties introduces the effective control of photoresponse in optoelectronic devices via magnetic field, termed as magneto&#8208;photoresponse. It enriches the application scenarios and shows potential to construct in&#8208;sensor vision systems for artificial intelligence with gate&#8208;free architecture. However, achieving a simultaneous existence of room&#8208;temperature magnetism and notable photoelectric properties in semiconductors is a great challenge. Here, the room&#8208;temperature magneto&#8208;photoresponse is accomplished in all&#8208;2D optoelectronic devices, employing 2D ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 as the source and drain, with WSe2 forming the channel. The interplay between room&#8208;temperature magnetism and photoelectric properties is realized by introducing the unique magneto&#8208;band structure effect from 2D interface, resulting in magneto&#8208;tunable charge transfer between Fe3GaTe2 and WSe2. The photocurrent in this 2D optoelectronic device exhibits robust response to both the direction and amplitude of external magnetic fields. Utilizing constructed 2D optoelectronic devices with magneto&#8208;photoresponse, traditional gate&#8208;controlled phototransistors are replaced and a prototype in&#8208;sensor vision system with visual adaptation, significantly improving the recognition accuracy to over four times in low&#8208;contrast environments is established. These findings pave a way for achieving high&#8208;temperature magneto&#8208;photoresponse, thereby guiding the construction of robust in&#8208;sensor vision systems toward high performance and broad applications.

         <title>A Porous Li&#8211;Al Alloy Anode toward High&#8208;Performance Sulfide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous Li&#8211;Al alloy anode exhibits a record critical current density of 6.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 5000&#160;h cycling in symmetric cells, and 1800 cycles (83% retention) and the highest areal capacity of 11.9 mAh cm&#8722;2 in LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2&#8208;based full cells at room temperature.








Abstract
Compared to lithium (Li) anode, the alloy/Li&#8208;alloy anodes show more compatible with sulfide solid electrolytes (SSEs), and are promising candidates for practical SSE&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries (ASSLBs). In this work, a porous Li&#8211;Al alloy (LiAl&#8208;p) anode is crafted using a straightforward mechanical pressing method. Various characterizations confirm the porous nature of such anode, as well as rich oxygen species on its surface. To the best knowledge, such LiAl&#8208;p anode demonstrates the best room temperature cell performance in comparison with reported Li and alloy/Li&#8208;alloy anodes in SSE&#8208;based ASSLBs. For example, the LiAl&#8208;p symmetric cells deliver a record critical current density of 6.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an ultralong cycling of 5000&#160;h; the LiAl&#8208;p|LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cells achieve a high areal capacity of 11.9 mAh cm&#8722;2 and excellent durability of 1800 cycles. Further in situ and ex situ experiments reveal that the porous structure can accommodate volume changes of LiAl&#8208;p and ensure its integrity during cycling; and moreover, a robust Li inorganics&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase can be formed originated from the reaction between SSE and surface oxygen species of LiAl&#8208;p. This study offers inspiration for designing high&#8208;performance alloy anodes by focusing on designing special architecture to alleviate volume change and constructing stable interphase.

         <title>Highly Conductive and Stretchable Hydrogel Nanocomposite Using Whiskered Gold Nanosheets for Soft Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High electrical conductivity (&#8776;520&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1) and high stretchability (&#8776;300%) are achieved simultaneously for conductive hydrogel nanocomposite, through a sequential formation method using whiskered gold nanosheets. The maximum conductivity reaches 3304&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1. The conductive hydrogel nanocomposite functionalized with tissue adhesive property realizes robust integration with living organs, demonstrating high&#8208;performance bioelectronics in vivo.








Abstract
The low electrical conductivity of conductive hydrogels limits their applications as soft conductors in bioelectronics. This low conductivity originates from the high water content of hydrogels, which impedes facile carrier transport between conductive fillers. This study presents a highly conductive and stretchable hydrogel nanocomposite comprising whiskered gold nanosheets. A dry network of whiskered gold nanosheets is fabricated and then incorporated into the wet hydrogel matrices. The whiskered gold nanosheets preserve their tight interconnection in hydrogels despite the high water content, providing a high&#8208;quality percolation network even under stretched states. Regardless of the type of hydrogel matrix, the gold&#8208;hydrogel nanocomposites exhibit a conductivity of &#8776;520&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a stretchability of &#8776;300% without requiring a dehydration process. The conductivity reaches a maximum of &#8776;3304&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 when the density of the dry gold network is controlled. A gold&#8208;adhesive hydrogel nanocomposite, which can achieve conformal adhesion to moving organ surfaces, is fabricated for bioelectronics demonstrations. The adhesive hydrogel electrode outperforms elastomer&#8208;based electrodes in in vivo epicardial electrogram recording, epicardial pacing, and sciatic nerve stimulation.

         <title>Unraveling the Capacitive Behaviors in Nanoconfined Ionophilic Carbon Pores</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compressed micropore&#8208;rich carbon framework is synthesized with tailored monolayer and bilayer confinement pores. With compatible ionophilic interfaces, they accommodate both cations and anions in ionic liquid electrolytes. A voltage&#8208;induced gradient pore&#8208;filling process has been proposed to explain the capacitive storage mechanism.








Abstract
Intensifying the synergy between confined carbon nanopores and ionic liquids (ILs) and a deep comprehension of the ion behavior is required for enhancing the capacitive storage performance. Despite many theoretical insights on the storage mechanism, experimental verification has remained lacking due to the intricate nature of pore texture. Here, a compressed micropore&#8208;rich carbon framework (CMCF) with tailored monolayer and bilayer confinement pores is synthesized, which exhibits a compatible ionophilic interface to accommodate the IL [EMIM][BF4]. By deploying in situ Raman spectroscopy, in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance, the effect of the pore textures on ions storage behaviors is elucidated. A voltage&#8208;induced ion gradient filling process in these ionophilic pores is proposed, in which ion exchange and co&#8208;ion desorption dominate the charge storage process. Moreover, it is established that the monolayer confinement of ions enhances the capacity, and bilayer confinement facilitates the charging dynamics. This work may guide the design of nanoconfinement carbon for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density supercapacitors and deepen the understanding of the charge storage mechanism in ionophilic pores.

         <title>Non&#8208;Centrosymmetric Single Crystalline Biomolecular Nano&#8208;Arrays for Responsive Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating dip&#8208;pen nanolithography with solvent vapor annealing, a novel strategy is reported for synthesizing libraries of nanoscale amino acid (AA) single crystals with control over size, anisotropy, and polymorphism. Importantly, these nanocrystals exhibit second harmonic generation (SHG), piezoelectric, and ferroelectric properties due to their non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures, making them potentially useful for sustainable electronics.








Abstract
Herein, a novel strategy is reported for synthesizing libraries of single crystalline amino acid (AA) nanocrystals with control over size, anisotropy, and polymorphism by leveraging dip&#8208;pen nanolithography (DPN) and recrystallization via solvent vapor annealing. The crystals are prepared by first depositing nanoreactors consisting of a solvent with AAs, followed by water vapor&#8208;induced recrystallization. This leads to isotropic structures that are non&#8208;centrosymmetric with strong piezoelectric (g33 coefficients &gt;1000&#160;mVm&#160;N&#8722;1), ferroelectric, and non&#8208;linear optical properties. However, recrystallizing arrays of isotropic DL&#8208;alanine nanodot features with a binary solvent (water and ethanol) leads to arrays of 1D piezoelectric nanorods with their long axis coincident with the polar axis. Moreover, positioning nanoreactors containing AAs (the nanodot features) between micro electrodes leads to capillary formation, making the reactors anisotropic and facilitating piezoelectric nanorod formation between the electrodes. This offers a facile route to device fabrication. These as&#8208;fabricated devices respond to ultrasonic stimulation in the form of a piezoelectric response. The technique described herein is significant as it provides a rapid way of investigating non&#8208;centrosymmetric nanoscale biocrystals, potentially pivotal for fabricating a new class of stimuli&#8208;responsive devices such as sensors, energy harvesters, and stimulators.

         <title>Half&#8208;metallization Atom&#8208;Fingerprints Achieved at Ultrafast Oxygen&#8208;Evaporated Pyrochlores for Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intriguing ultrafast oxygen evaporation technology is proposed in the high&#8208;entropy Bi1Pb0.5Y0.5Ir1.5Sn0.5O7 pyrochlores to realize a controllable half&#8208;metallization atom&#8208;fingerprints at pyrochlore catalysts, in which the coexistence of metallic bonds and covalent bonds can reconfigure the spin electron occupation. This spin renormalization from low&#8208;spin state to high&#8208;spin state facilitates the spin&#8208;related charge transfer and orbital interaction between catalysts and intermediates, leading to spin&#8208;dependent reaction kinetics.








Abstract
The stability and catalytic activity of acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are strongly determined by the coordination states and spatial symmetry among metal sites at catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;An intriguing ultrafast oxygen evaporation technology is proposed in the high-entropy Bi&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Y&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Ir&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; pyrochlores to realize a controllable half-metallization atom-fingerprints at pyrochlore catalysts, in which the coexistence of metallic bonds and covalent bonds can reconfigure the spin electron occupation. This spin renormalization from low-spin state to high-spin state facilitates the spin-related charge transfer and orbital interaction between catalysts and intermediates, leading to spin-dependent reaction kinetics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stability and catalytic activity of acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are strongly determined by the coordination states and spatial symmetry among metal sites at catalysts. Herein, an ultrafast oxygen evaporation technology to rapidly soften the intrinsic covalent bonds using ultrahigh electrical pulses is suggested, in which prospective charged excited states at this extreme avalanche condition can generate a strong electron&#8211;phonon coupling to rapidly evaporate some coordinated oxygen (O) atoms, finally leading to a controllable half-metallization feature. Simultaneously, the relative metal (M) site arrays can be orderly locked to delineate some intriguing atom-fingerprints at pyrochlore catalysts, where the coexistence of metallic bonds (M&#9472;M) and covalent bonds (M&#9472;O) at this symmetry-breaking configuration can partially restrain crystal field effect to generate a particular high-spin occupied state. This half-metallization catalyst can effectively optimize the spin-related reaction kinetics in acidic OER, giving rise to 10.3 times (at 188&#160;mV overpotential) reactive activity than pristine pyrochlores. This work provides a new understanding of half-metallization atom-fingerprints at catalyst surfaces to accelerate acidic water oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Composition Modulation&#8208;Mediated Band Alignment Engineering from Type I to Type III in 2D vdW Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The band alignment of 1L&#8208;WSe2/5L&#8208;Bi2Te3&#8208;xSex vdWHs can be continuously modulated from Type I (x = 0) to Type III (x = 3) by increasing Se mole fraction, which is crucial for promoting charge separation and transfer in optoelectronic devices, ultimately determining the behavior of photodetectors and LEDs based on vdWHs.








Abstract
Band alignment engineering is crucial for facilitating charge separation and transfer in optoelectronic devices, which ultimately dictates the behavior of Van der Waals heterostructures (vdWH)&#8208;based photodetectors and light emitting diode (LEDs). However, the impact of the band offset in vdWHs on important figures of merit in optoelectronic devices has not yet been systematically analyzed. Herein, the regulation of band alignment in WSe2/Bi2Te3&#8208;xSex vdWHs (0 &#8804; x &#8804; 3) is demonstrated through the implementation of chemical vapor deposition (CVD). A combination of experimental and theoretical results proved that the synthesized vdWHs can be gradually tuned from Type I (WSe2/Bi2Te3) to Type III (WSe2/Bi2Se3). As the band alignment changes from Type I to Type III, a remarkable responsivity of 58.12 A&#160;W&#8722;1 and detectivity of 2.91&#215;1012 Jones (in Type I) decrease in the vdWHs&#8208;based photodetector, and the ultrafast photoresponse time is 3.2 &#181;s (in Type III). Additionally, Type III vdWH&#8208;based LEDs exhibit the highest luminance and electroluminescence (EL) external quantum efficiencies (EQE) among p&#8208;n diodes based on Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) at room temperature, which is attributed to band alignment&#8208;induced distinct interfacial charge injection. This work serves as a valuable reference for the application and expansion of fundamental band alignment principles in the design and fabrication of future optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Self&#8208;Anchored Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals Stacking Growth of Transition&#8208;Metal Dichalcogenide Nanoplates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;anchored van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals stacking growth mechanism is developed to produce transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide nanoplates with desired lateral size and locations. As such, WSe2 and MoSe2 nanoplate arrays are produced for the subsequent fabrication of nanoplate&#8208;based optoelectronics.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide (TMDs) nanoplates exhibit unique properties different from their monolayer counterparts. Controllable nucleation and growth are prerequisite and highly desirable for their practical applications. Here, a self&#8208;anchored van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals stacking growth method is developed, by which the substrate pit induced by precursor etching anchors the source material, impedes the lateral spreading of source droplets and facilitates the in situ stacking growth of high&#8208;quality TMD nanoplates with a thickness of tens to hundreds of nanometers at well&#8208;defined locations. As such, an array of TMD nanoplates with controlled lateral dimensions are produced and applied in arrayed photodetectors. This study solves the problem of controllable preparation of TMD nanoplates, holding promise for applications in electronics and optoelectronics.

         <title>Concurrent Amorphization and Nanocatalyst Formation in Cu&#8208;Substituted Perovskite Oxide Surface: Effects on Oxygen Reduction Reaction at Elevated Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface amorphization and the nanocatalysts ex&#8208;solution are concurrently evolved on Cu&#8208;substituted La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#948; through a straightforward reduction process with prolonged time. The investigation focuses on understanding the evolution process of these phenomena and identifying the factors that contribute to improvements in performance and durability. These findings offer a practical and novel strategy for designing catalysts with redox&#8208;dynamic perovskite oxide host materials.








Abstract
The activity and durability of chemical/electrochemical catalysts are significantly influenced by their surface environments, highlighting the importance of thoroughly examining the catalyst surface. Here, Cu&#8208;substituted La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#948; is selected, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art material for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), to explore the real&#8208;time evolution of surface morphology and chemistry under a reducing atmosphere at elevated temperatures. Remarkably, in a pioneering observation, it is discovered that the perovskite surface starts to amorphize at an unusually low temperature of approximately 100 &#176;C and multicomponent metal nanocatalysts additionally form on the amorphous surface as the temperature raises to 400 &#176;C. Moreover, this investigation into the stability of the resulting amorphous layer under oxidizing conditions reveals that the amorphous structure can withstand a high&#8208;temperature oxidizing atmosphere (&#8805;650 &#176;C) only when it has undergone sufficient reduction for an extended period. Therefore, the coexistence of the active nanocatalysts and defective amorphous surface leads to a nearly 100% enhancement in the electrode resistance for the ORR over 200 h without significant degradation. These observations provide a new catalytic design strategy for using redox&#8208;dynamic perovskite oxide host materials.

         <title>Dynamically Precise Constructing Dual&#8208;Atom Pd2 Catalyst:A Monodisperse Catalyst With High Stability for Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkyne</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomically dispersed Pd2 DAC constructed by the dynamic strategy exhibits higher activity and selectivity than that of Pd1 SAC and Pd2 NC in the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes. DFT calculations and systematic experiments confirm the high performance of Pd2 DAC is due to the synergistic effect of dynamically generated Pd&#9472;Pd bonds.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) originate unprecedented reactivity and maximize resource efficiency. The fundamental difficulty lies in the high complexity and instability of DACs, making the rational design and targeted performance optimization a grand challenge. Here, an atomically dispersed Pd2 DAC with an in situ generated Pd&#9472;Pd bond is constructed by a dynamic strategy, which achieves high activity and selectivity for semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes and functional internal acetylene, twice higher than commercial Lindlar catalyst. Density functional theory calculations and systematic experiments confirms the ultrahigh properties of Pd2 DAC originates from the synergistic effect of the dynamically generated Pd&#9472;Pd bonds. This discovery highlights the potential for dynamic strategies and opens unprecedented possibilities for the preparation of robust DACs on an industrial scale.

         <title>Circadian Rhythm&#8208;Regulated ADSC&#8208;Derived sEVs and a Triphasic Microneedle Delivery System to Enhance Tendon&#8208;to&#8208;Bone Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimized circadian rhythms in ADSCs enhance the production and the inflammatory regulatory capacity of their secreted sEVs (CR&#8208;sEVs). These CR&#8208;sEVs inhibit macrophage M1 polarization by modulating the cAMP signaling pathway via PF4 delivery. Delivered via a triphasic microneedle in a rat rotator cuff repair model, CR&#8208;sEVs/MN reduces inflammation, facilitates fibrocartilage regeneration, enhances tendon repair, and ultimately promotes tendon&#8208;to&#8208;bone healing.








Abstract
Modulating the inflammatory microenvironment to reconstruct the fibrocartilaginous layer while promoting tendon repair is crucial for enhancing tendon&#8208;to&#8208;bone healing in rotator cuff repair (RCR), a persistent challenge in orthopedics. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) hold significant potential to modulate inflammation, yet the efficient production of highly bioactive sEVs remains a substantial barrier to their clinical application. Moreover, achieving minimally invasive local delivery of sEVs to the tendon&#8208;to&#8208;bone interface presents significant technical difficulties. Herein, the circadian rhythm of adipose&#8208;derived stem cells is modulated to increase the yield and enhance the inflammatory regulatory capacity of sEVs. Circadian rhythm&#8208;regulated sEVs (CR&#8208;sEVs) enhance the cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling pathway in macrophage (M&#966;) via platelet factor 4 delivery, thereby inhibiting M&#966; M1 polarization. Subsequently, a triphasic microneedle (MN) scaffold with a tip, stem, and base is designed for the local delivery of CR&#8208;sEVs (CR&#8208;sEVs/MN) at the tendon&#8208;to&#8208;bone junction, incorporating tendon&#8208;derived decellularized extracellular matrix in the base to facilitate tendon repair. CR&#8208;sEVs/MN mitigates inflammation, promotes fibrocartilage regeneration, and enhances tendon healing, thereby improving biomechanical strength and shoulder joint function in a rat RCR model. Combining CR&#8208;sEVs with this triphasic microneedle delivery system presents a promising strategy for enhancing tendon&#8208;to&#8208;bone healing in clinical settings.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Phase Exfoliation of 3D Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks into Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D metal&#8211;organic framework crystals can be exfoliated into 2D nanosheets via simple sonication&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation. The ease of exfoliation for a given 3D crystal can be quantified by the facilely available mechanical anisotropy index, Emax/Emin (Emax and Emin denote the maximum and minimum elastic modulus, respectively).








Abstract
Traditionally, the acquisition of 2D materials involved the exfoliation of layered crystals. However, the anisotropic bonding arrangements within 3D crystals indicate they are mechanically reminiscent of 2D counterparts and could also be exfoliated into nanosheets. This report delineates the preparation of 2D nanosheets from six representative 3D metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) through liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation. Notably, the cleavage planes of exfoliated nanosheets align perpendicular to the direction of the minimum elastic modulus (Emin) within the pristine 3D frameworks. The findings suggest that the in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane bonding forces of the exfoliated nanosheets can be correlated with the maximum elastic modulus (Emax) and Emin of the 3D frameworks, respectively. Emax influences the ease of cleaving adjacent layers, while Emin governs the ability to resist cracking of layers. Hence, a combination of large Emax and small Emin indicates an efficient exfoliation process, and vice versa. The ratio of Emax/Emin, denoted as Amax/min, is adopted as a universal index to quantify the ease of mechanical exfoliation for 3D MOFs. This ratio, readily accessible through mechanical experiments and computation, serves as a valuable metric for selecting appropriate exfoliation methods to produce surfactant&#8208;free 2D nanosheets from various 3D materials.

         <title>Transforming Commercial Polymers into Tough yet Switchable Adhesives by Trident Photoswitch Molecule Doping: Break Adhesion&#8208;Switchability Paradox</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trident photoswitch molecule doping strategy is proposed to simultaneously balance the cohesion&#8208;adhesion trade&#8208;off and overcome the conflict of strong adhesion and easy detachment for the magic transformation of commercial polymers into tough yet smart switchable adhesives, which integrates high bonding strength, remarkable switch ratio, extended reuses and broad harsh&#8208;condition adaptability.








Abstract
Here, a trident molecule doping strategy is introduced to overcome both cohesion&#8208;adhesion trade&#8208;off and adhesion&#8208;switchability conflict, transforming commercial polymers into tough yet photo&#8208;switchable adhesives. The strategy involves initial rational design of new trident photoswitch molecules namely TAzo&#8208;3 featuring azobenzene and hydroxy&#8208;terminated alkyl chains involved rigid&#8208;soft tri&#8208;branch structure, and subsequent doping into commercial polycaprolactone (PCL) via simple blending. Unique design enables TAzo&#8208;3 as a versatile dopant, not only regulating the internal and external supramolecular interaction to balance cohesion and interface adhesion for tough bonding, but also affording marked photothermal effect to facilitate rapid adhesive melting for great photo&#8208;switchability. Thus, the optimal TAzo&#8208;3&#8208;doped PCL (TAzo&#8208;3@P) displays markedly&#8208;improved bonding performance on diverse substrates compared to linear azobenzene&#8208;doped PCL and pure PCL. Impressively, TAzo&#8208;3@P on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) attains large room&#8208;temperature adhesion strength of 6.7&#160;MPa &#8211; surpassing most reported adhesives and many commercial adhesives on PMMA, along with easy photo&#8208;induced detachment with remarkable switch ratio of 2.09&#160;&#215;&#160;105. Besides, TAzo&#8208;3@P can also act as &#8220;permanent&#8221; adhesives for only adhesion, demonstrating excellent multi&#8208;reusability, anti&#8208;freezing and waterproof ability. Mechanism studies unveil that the switchable adhesion is closely linked with the dopant molecule structure while rigid&#8208;soft coupled trident structures and hydroxy&#8208;terminated alkyl chains are key factors.

         <title>Fusible and Radiopaque Microspheres for Embolization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fusible and radiopaque microspheres (FRMs) are prepared for transcatheter arterial embolization. A clinical contrast agent, Lipiodol, is encapsulated in the microspheres, making them fusible in physiological environments, contributing to complete ischemic necrosis. Additionally, Lipiodol provides the microspheres with a sustained X&#8208;ray imaging feature, allowing for the monitoring of their location in vivo.








Abstract
In this work, fusible microspheres loaded with radiopaque agents as an embolic agent for transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) are developed. A poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) multi&#8208;block copolymer basing polyurethane (PCEU) is synthesized and fabricated into blank microspheres (BMs). The microspheres are elastic in compression test. A clinical contrast agent lipiodol is encapsulated in the microspheres to receive fusible radiopaque microspheres (FRMs). The sizes of FRMs are uniform and range from 142.2 to 343.1&#160;&#181;m. The encapsulated lipiodol acts as the plasticizer to reduce the melting temperature point (Tm) of PECU microspheres, thus, leading to the fusion of microspheres to exhibit efficient embolization in vivo. The performance of FRMs is carried out on a rabbit ear embolization model. Serious ischemic necrosis is observed and the radiopacity of FRMs sustains much longer time than that of commercial contrast agent Loversol in vivo. The fusible and radiopaque microsphere is promising to be developed as an exciting embolic agent.

         <title>Olivine&#8208;Type Fe2GeX4 (X = S, Se, and Te): A Novel Class of Anode Materials for Exceptional Sodium Storage Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The investigation in Na+ storage properties in Fe2GeX4 (X = S, Se, and Te) reveals their superior electrochemical performance and a combined intercalation&#8208;conversion&#8208;alloying reaction pathway, with the alloying process dominating capacity and determining the rate of Fe2GeS4 and Fe2GeSe4. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that Fe2GeS4 preferentially adsorbs Na&#8314; onto coexistence regions of Fe&#8208;S octahedral and Ge&#8208;S tetrahedral. Conversely, Fe2GeSe4 and Fe2GeTe4 exhibit homogeneous adsorption.








Abstract
The introduction of abundant metals to form ternary germanium&#8208;based chalcogenides can dilute the high price and effectively buffer the volume variation of germanium. Herein, olivine&#8208;structured Fe2GeX4 (X = S, Se, and Te) are synthesized by a chemical vapor transport method to compare their sodium storage properties. A series of in situ and ex situ measurements validate a combined intercalation&#8208;conversion&#8208;alloying reaction mechanism of Fe2GeX4. Fe2GeS4 exhibits a high capacity of 477.9&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 2660 cycles at 8 A g&#8722;1, and excellent rate capability. Furthermore, the Na3V2(PO4)3//Fe2GeS4 full cell delivers a capacity of 375.5&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1, which is more than three times that of commercial hard carbon, with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 93.23%. Capacity&#8208;contribution and kinetic analyses reveal that the alloying reaction significantly contributes to the overall capacity and serves as the rate&#8208;determining step within the reaction for both Fe2GeS4 and Fe2GeSe4. Upon reaching a specific cycle threshold, the assessment of the kinetic properties of Fe2GeX4 primarily relies on the ion diffusion process that occurs during charging. This work demonstrates that Fe2GeX4 possesses promising practical potential to outperform hard carbon, offering valuable insights and impetus for the advancement of ternary germanium&#8208;based anodes.

         <title>Observation of Antiferroelectric Domain Walls in a Uniaxial Hyperferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of antiferroelectric domain walls in ferroelectric Pb5Ge3O11 is reported. Alternating Pb displacements are resolved, resulting in antiferroelectrically coupled dipole layers. Calculations show that Pb5Ge3O11 is hyperferroelectric, allowing the system to stabilize antiparallel ordering of dipoles along the longitudinal direction. The results suggest a new type of excited domain&#8208;wall state, expanding studies on ferroelectric domain walls into the realm of antiferroic phenomena.








Abstract
Ferroelectric domain walls are a rich source of emergent electronic properties and unusual polar order. Recent studies show that the configuration of ferroelectric walls can go well beyond the conventional Ising&#8208;type structure. N&#233;el&#8208;, Bloch&#8208;, and vortex&#8208;like polar patterns have been observed, displaying strong similarities with the spin textures at magnetic domain walls. Here, the discovery of antiferroelectric domain walls in the uniaxial ferroelectric Pb5Ge3O11 is reported. Highly mobile domain walls with an alternating displacement of Pb atoms are resolved, resulting in a cyclic 180&#176; flip of dipole direction within the wall. Density functional theory calculations show that Pb5Ge3O11 is hyperferroelectric, allowing the system to overcome the depolarization fields that usually suppress the antiparallel ordering of dipoles along the longitudinal direction. Interestingly, the antiferroelectric walls observed under the electron beam are energetically more costly than basic head&#8208;to&#8208;head or tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail walls. The results suggest a new type of excited domain&#8208;wall state, expanding previous studies on ferroelectric domain walls into the realm of antiferroic phenomena.

         <title>A Dopamine&#8208;Modified Hyaluronic Acid&#8208;Based Mucus Carrying Phytoestrogen and Urinary Exosome for Thin Endometrium Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CUEHD is an artificial mucus based on L&#8208;DOPA&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid combining phytoestrogen cajaninstilbene acid and rat urinary exosomes. Such a platform with long retention time and high biosafety promises good therapeutic efficacy in a rat model with thin endometrium. The improvement is manifested both in morphological endometrial thickness and fertility function.








Abstract
Thin endometrium (TE) is closely associated with infertility in reproductive medicine. Estrogen therapy gains unsatisfactory outcomes. In this study, an artificial mucus based on dopamine (L&#8208;DOPA)&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid combining phytoestrogen cajaninstilbene acid and rat urinary exosomes (CUEHD) is constructed for TE treatment using a rat TE model. In the rat TE model, the dominant elastic behavior and adhesive properties of CUEHD guarantee adequate retention, rendering superior synergistic treatment efficacy and favorable biosafety characteristics. CUEHD treatment significantly increases endometrial thickness and promotes receptivity and fertility. Mechanistically, estrogen homeostasis, inflammation inhibition, and endometrial regeneration are achieved through the crosstalk between ER&#8208;NLRP3&#8208;IL1&#946; and Wnt&#8208;&#946; catenin&#8208;TGF&#946;&#8208;smad signaling pathways. Moreover, the therapeutic potential of exosomes from human urine and adipose tissue&#8208;derived stem cells (ADSCs) and rat ADSCs are also demonstrated, indicating extensive use of the artificial mucus system. Thus, this study illustrates a platform combining phytoestrogen and exosomes with promising implications for TE treatment.

         <title>Coexistence and Interplay of Two Ferroelectric Mechanisms in Zn1&#8208;xMgxO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the ferroelectric properties of Zn1&#8208;xMgxO using automated piezoresponse force microscopy, unveiling a novel &#8220;fringing&#8208;ridge mechanism&#8221; for polarization switching, marked by lateral nucleation expansion without depth propagation. This contradicts the conventional polarization switching process observed in perovskite ferroelectrics. This discovery enhances the understanding of polarization dynamics and their potential applications in information technology.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials promise exceptional attributes including low power dissipation, fast operational speeds, enhanced endurance, and superior retention to revolutionize information technology. However, the practical application of ferroelectric&#8208;semiconductor memory devices has been significantly challenged by the incompatibility of traditional perovskite oxide ferroelectrics with metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor technology. Recent discoveries of ferroelectricity in binary oxides such as Zn1&#8208;xMgxO and Hf1&#8208;xZrxO have been a focal point of research in ferroelectric information technology. This work investigates the ferroelectric properties of Zn1&#8208;xMgxO utilizing automated band excitation piezoresponse force microscopy. This findings reveal the coexistence of two ferroelectric subsystems within Zn1&#8208;xMgxO. A &#8220;fringing&#8208;ridge mechanism&#8221; of polarization switching is proposed that is characterized by initial lateral expansion of nucleation without significant propagation in depth, contradicting the conventional domain growth process observed in ferroelectrics. This unique polarization dynamics in Zn1&#8208;xMgxO suggests a new understanding of ferroelectric behavior, contributing to both the fundamental science of ferroelectrics and their application in information technology.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Disordered High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Engineered by Thermal Dezincification for Improved Catalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This summarizes a novel approach (i.e. thermal diffusion scattering) to the characterization of lattice disordered high entropy alloys produced by thermal dezincification favorable for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. This work provides a new route toward exploring and developing the catalytic activities of materials benefiting from asymmetrically disordered lattices.








Abstract
A disordered crystal structure is an asymmetrical atomic lattice resulting from the missing atoms (vacancies) or the lattice misarrangement in a solid&#8208;state material. It has been widely proven to improve the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process. In the present work, due to the special physical properties (the low evaporation temperature of below 900 &#176;C), Zn is utilized as a sacrificial component to create senary PtIrNiCoFeZn high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) with highly disordered lattices. The structure of the lattice&#8208;disordered PtIrNiCoFeZn HEA is characterized by the thermal diffusion scattering (TDS) in transmission electron microscope. Density functional theory calculations reveal that lattice disorder not only accelerates both the Volmer step and Tafel step during the HER process but also optimizes the intensity and distribution of projected density of states near the Fermi energy after the H2O and H adsorption. Anomalously high alkaline HER activity and stability are proven by experimental measurements. This work introduces a novel approach to preparing irregular lattices offering highly efficient HEA and a TDS characterization method to reveal the disordered lattice in materials. It provides a new route toward exploring and developing the catalytic activities of materials with asymmetrically disordered lattices.

         <title>Design Principles of Quinone Redox Systems for Advanced Sulfide Solid&#8208;State Organic Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A designing criterion for quinone redox compounds integration into Li6PS5Cl&#8208;based solid&#8208;state organic lithium metal batteries is developed through a combination of DFT calculations and experimental analysis. Following this criterion, 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetraamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone and 2,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone are successfully validated and effectively utilized as active electrode materials in solid&#8208;state organic lithium metal batteries, displaying exceptional material utilization and high specific energy density.








Abstract
The emergence of solid&#8208;state battery technology presents a potential solution to the dissolution challenges of high&#8208;capacity small molecule quinone redox systems. Nonetheless, the successful integration of argyrodite&#8208;type Li6PS5Cl, the most promising solid&#8208;state electrolyte system,&#160;and quinone redox systems remains elusive due to their inherent reactivity. Here, a library of quinone derivatives is selected as model electrode materials to ascertain the critical descriptors governing the (electro)chemical compatibility and subsequently the performances of Li6PS5Cl&#8208;based solid&#8208;state organic lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Compatibility is attained if the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level of the quinone derivative is sufficiently higher than the highest occupied molecular orbital level of Li6PS5Cl. The energy difference is demonstrated to be critical in ensuring chemical compatibility during composite electrode preparation and enable high&#8208;efficiency operation of solid&#8208;state organic LMBs. Considering these findings, a general principle is proposed for the selection of quinone derivatives to be integrated with Li6PS5Cl, and two solid&#8208;state organic LMBs, based on 2,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetraamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone, are successfully developed and tested for the first time. Validating critical factors for the design of organic battery electrode materials is expected to pave the way for advancing the development of high&#8208;efficiency and long cycle life solid&#8208;state organic batteries based on sulfides electrolytes.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Enhanced UV&#8208;C LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene directly grown on a UV&#8208;C LED by plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition provides a disruptive approach for tackling the light&#8208;extraction challenge in UV&#8208;C LEDs. Graphene is used as a current spreading layer for top&#8208;emitting UV&#8208;C LEDs in standard geometry, while it acts as a contact interlayer in UV&#8208;C LEDs in flip&#8208;chip geometry enabling a turn&#8208;on voltage &lt;5&#160;V.








Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting diodes in the UV&#8208;C spectral range (UV&#8208;C LEDs) can potentially replace bulky and toxic mercury lamps in a wide range of applications including sterilization and water purification. Several obstacles still limit the efficiencies of UV&#8208;C LEDs. Devices in flip&#8208;chip geometry suffer from a huge difference in the work functions between the p&#8208;AlGaN and high&#8208;reflective Al mirrors, whereas the absence of UV&#8208;C transparent current spreading layers limits the development of UV&#8208;C LEDs in standard geometry. Here it is demonstrated that transfer&#8208;free graphene implemented directly onto the p&#8208;AlGaN top layer by a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition approach enables highly efficient 275&#160;nm UV&#8208;C LEDs in both, flip&#8208;chip and standard geometry. In flip&#8208;chip geometry, the graphene acts as a contact interlayer between the Al&#8208;mirror and the p&#8208;AlGaN enabling an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 9.5% and a wall&#8208;plug efficiency (WPE) of 5.5% at 8&#160;V. Graphene combined with a &#8776;1&#160;nm NiOx support layer allows a turn&#8208;on voltage &lt;5&#160;V. In standard geometry graphene acts as a current spreading layer on a length scale up to 1&#160;mm. These top&#8208;emitting devices exhibit a EQE of 2.1% at 8.7&#160;V and a WPE of 1.1%.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This novel &#8220;Twistron energy cell harvester&#8221; (TECH), consisting of coiled carbon nanotube yarn, produces electrical energy from mechanical contraction. The TECH device is applied to an artificial heartbeat system and in a second step to a porcine heart and is able continuously generated electrical energy from cardiac contraction. This energy can potentially be used for medical implants.








Abstract
Reliability of power supply for current implantable electronic devices is a critical issue for longevity and for reducing the risk of device failure. Energy harvesting is an emerging technology, representing a strategy for establishing autonomous power supply by utilizing biomechanical movements in human body. Here, a novel &#8220;Twistron energy cell harvester&#8221; (TECH), consisting of coiled carbon nanotube yarn that converts mechanical energy of the beating heart into electrical energy, is presented. The performance of TECH is evaluated in an in vitro artificial heartbeat system which simulates the deformation pattern of the cardiac surface, reaching a maximum peak power of 1.42&#160;W kg&#8722;1 and average power of 0.39&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 60 beats per minute. In vivo implantation of TECH onto the left ventricular surface in a porcine model continuously generates electrical energy from cardiac contraction. The generated electrical energy is used for direct pacing of the heart as documented by extensive electrophysiology mapping. Implanted modified carbon nanotubes are applicable as a source for harvesting biomechanical energy from cardiac motion for power supply or cardiac pacing.

         <title>Enhanced Ocular Delivery of Beva via Ultra&#8208;Small Polymeric Micelles for Noninvasive Anti&#8208;VEGF Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;small polymeric micelles are developed for noninvasive delivery of Beva to treat oxygen&#8208;induced retinal (OIR) neovascularization model in mice. It can penetrate through the cornea and sclera&#8208;conjunctiva&#8208;choroid to reach the retina, producing the same therapeutic effect as intravitreal injection. This innovative protein nanocarrier platform offers a potential alternative to invasive intravitreal injections, improving patient experience and outcomes.








Abstract
Pathological ocular neovascularization resulting from retinal ischemia constitutes a major cause of vision loss. Current anti&#8208;VEGF therapies rely on burdensome intravitreal injections of Bevacizumab (Beva). Herein ultrasmall polymeric micelles encapsulating Beva (P@Beva) are developed for noninvasive topical delivery to posterior eye tissues. Beva is efficiently loaded into 11&#160;nm micelles fabricated via self&#8208;assembly of hyperbranched amphiphilic copolymers. The neutral, brush&#8208;like micelles demonstrate excellent drug encapsulation and colloidal stability. In vitro, P@Beva enhances intracellular delivery of Beva in ocular cells versus free drug. Ex vivo corneal and conjunctival&#8208;sclera&#8208;choroidal tissues transport after eye drops are improved 23&#8208;fold and 7.9&#8208;fold, respectively. Anti&#8208;angiogenic bioactivity is retained with P@Beva eliciting greater inhibition of endothelial tube formation and choroid sprouting over Beva alone. Remarkably, in an oxygen&#8208;induced retinopathy (OIR) model, topical P@Beva matching efficacy of intravitreal Beva injection, is the clinical standard. Comprehensive biocompatibility verifies safety. Overall, this pioneering protein delivery platform holds promise to shift paradigms from invasive intravitreal injections toward simplified, noninvasive administration of biotherapeutics targeting posterior eye diseases.

     alt="Enhanced Ocular Delivery of Beva via Ultra-Small Polymeric Micelles for Noninvasive Anti-VEGF Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultra-small polymeric micelles are developed for noninvasive delivery of Beva to treat oxygen-induced retinal (OIR) neovascularization model in mice. It can penetrate through the cornea and sclera-conjunctiva-choroid to reach the retina, producing the same therapeutic effect as intravitreal injection. This innovative protein nanocarrier platform offers a potential alternative to invasive intravitreal injections, improving patient experience and outcomes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathological ocular neovascularization resulting from retinal ischemia constitutes a major cause of vision loss. Current anti-VEGF therapies rely on burdensome intravitreal injections of Bevacizumab (Beva). Herein ultrasmall polymeric micelles encapsulating Beva (P@Beva) are developed for noninvasive topical delivery to posterior eye tissues. Beva is efficiently loaded into 11&#160;nm micelles fabricated via self-assembly of hyperbranched amphiphilic copolymers. The neutral, brush-like micelles demonstrate excellent drug encapsulation and colloidal stability. In vitro, P@Beva enhances intracellular delivery of Beva in ocular cells versus free drug. Ex vivo corneal and conjunctival-sclera-choroidal tissues transport after eye drops are improved 23-fold and 7.9-fold, respectively. Anti-angiogenic bioactivity is retained with P@Beva eliciting greater inhibition of endothelial tube formation and choroid sprouting over Beva alone. Remarkably, in an oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model, topical P@Beva matching efficacy of intravitreal Beva injection, is the clinical standard. Comprehensive biocompatibility verifies safety. Overall, this pioneering protein delivery platform holds promise to shift paradigms from invasive intravitreal injections toward simplified, noninvasive administration of biotherapeutics targeting posterior eye diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Adaptive Processing Enabled by Sodium Alginate Based Complementary Memristor for Neuromorphic Sensory System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functions of desensitization and sensitivity changing with background intensity are biorealistically demonstated in Ag nanowire (NW)&#8208;embedded sodium alginate (SA) based complementary memristor. The scotopic and photopic adaptation functions are reproduced for image enhancement under dark and bright backgrounds. The neuromorphic sensory system (NSS) with multisensory integration function is demonstrated, in which the accuracy of pattern recognition can be obviously enhanced.








Abstract
Adaptive processing allows sensory systems to autonomically adjust their sensitivity with exposure to a constant sensory stimulus and thus organisms to adapt to environmental variations. Bioinspired&#160;electronics with adaptive functions are highly desirable for the development of neuromorphic sensory systems (NSSs). Herein, the functions of desensitization and sensitivity changing with background intensity (i.e., Weber's law), as two fundamental cues of sensory adaptation, are biorealistically demonstrated in an Ag nanowire (NW)&#8208;embedded sodium alginate (SA) based complementary memristor. In particular, Weber's law is experimentally emulated in a single complementary memristor. Furthermore, three types of adaptive NSS unit are constructed to realize a multiple perceptual capability that processes the stimuli of illuminance, temperature, and pressure signals. Taking neuromorphic vision as an example, scotopic and photopic adaptation functions are well reproduced for image enhancement against dark and bright backgrounds. Importantly, an NSS system with multisensory integration function is demonstrated by combining light and pressure spikes, where the accuracy of pattern recognition is obviously enhanced relative to that of an individual sense. This work offers a new strategy for developing neuromorphic electronics with adaptive functions and paves the way toward developing a highly efficient NSS.

Yang et&#160;al. introduce a reversible cohesive interface made of thermoplastic elastomer that allows for strong attachment and easy detachment of distributed soft robot modules without direct human handling. The reversible joint boasts a modulus similar to materials commonly used in soft robotics and can be distributed throughout soft robot bodies without introducing mechanical incongruities.








Abstract
Biological organisms exhibit phenomenal adaptation through morphology&#8208;shifting mechanisms including self&#8208;amputation, regeneration, and collective behavior. For example, reptiles, crustaceans, and insects amputate their own appendages in response to threats. Temporary fusion between individuals enables collective behaviors, such as in ants that temporarily fuse to build bridges. The concept of morphological editing often involves the addition and subtraction of mass and can be linked to modular robotics, wherein synthetic body morphology may be revised by rearranging parts. This work describes a reversible cohesive interface made of thermoplastic elastomer that allows for strong attachment and easy detachment of distributed soft robot modules without direct human handling. The reversible joint boasts a modulus similar to materials commonly used in soft robotics, and can thus be distributed throughout soft robot bodies without introducing mechanical incongruities. To demonstrate utility, the reversible joint is implemented in two embodiments: a soft quadruped robot that self&#8208;amputates a limb when stuck, and a cluster of three soft&#8208;crawling robots that fuse to cross a land gap. This work points toward future robots capable of radical shape&#8208;shifting via changes in mass through autotomy and interfusion, as well as highlights the crucial role that interfacial stiffness change plays in autotomizable biological and artificial systems.

         <title>Injectable 2D Material&#8208;Based Sensor Array for Minimally Invasive Neural Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graphene and MoS2&#8208;based implantable multi&#8208;modal sensor array is developed, presenting a minimally invasive implantation process for neural monitoring apparatus. The sensor array is injected via syringe and air pressure through a small hole in the skull and spreads out to conformally cover the cortical surface. The sensors detect epileptic discharges and monitor intracranial temperature and pressure.








Abstract
Intracranial implants for diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases have been developed over the past few decades. However, the platform of conventional implantable devices still relies on invasive probes and bulky sensors in conjunction with large&#8208;area craniotomy and provides only limited biometric information. Here, an implantable multi&#8208;modal sensor array that can be injected through a small hole in the skull and inherently spread out for conformal contact with the cortical surface is reported. The injectable sensor array, composed of graphene multi&#8208;channel electrodes for neural recording and electrical stimulation and MoS2&#8208;based sensors for monitoring intracranial temperature and pressure, is designed based on a mesh structure whose elastic&#160;restoring&#160;force enables the contracted device to spread out. It is demonstrated that the sensor array injected into a rabbit's head can detect epileptic discharges on the surface of the cortex and mitigate it by electrical stimulation while monitoring both intracranial temperature and pressure. This method provides&#160;good&#160;potential&#160;for implanting a variety of functional devices via minimally invasive surgery.

LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4&#8212;a high&#8208;voltage cathode for lithium&#8208;ion batteries&#8212;often suffers from poor cycling stability&#8212;a challenge frequently addressed through cationic substitution. Bridging experimental testing&#160;and computational modeling, this research&#160;delves into the intricacies of Fe&#8208; and Mg&#8208;substituted LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, exploring the effects on [Mn3+], [Ni3+], oxygen vacancies, defects, and impurity phases. The correlation between Li&#8208;site defects and Li&#8208;rich impurity phases is revealed.








Abstract
An understanding of the structural properties that allow for optimal cathode performance, and their origin, is necessary for devising advanced cathode design strategies and accelerating the commercialization of next&#8208;generation cathodes. High&#8208;voltage, Fe&#8208; and Mg&#8208;substituted LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathodes offer a low&#8208;cost, cobalt&#8208;free, yet energy&#8208;dense alternative to commercial cathodes. In this work, the effect of substitution on several important structure properties is explored, including Ni/Mn ordering, charge distribution, and extrinsic defects. In the cation&#8208;disordered samples studied, a correlation is observed between increased Fe/Mg substitution, Li&#8208;site defects, and Li&#8208;rich impurity phase formation&#8212;the concentrations of which are greater for Mg&#8208;substituted samples. This is attributed to the lower formation energy of MgLi defects when compared to FeLi defects. Li&#8208;site defect&#8208;induced impurity phases consequently alter the charge distribution of the system, resulting in increased [Mn3+] with Fe/Mg substitution. In addition to impurity phases, other charge compensators are also investigated to explain the origin of Mn3+ (extrinsic defects, [Ni3+], oxygen vacancies and intrinsic off&#8208;stoichiometry), although their effects are found to be negligible.

         <title>Vapor Deposition of Bilayer 3R MoS2 with Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, van der Waals (vdW) sliding ferroelectricity is confirmed in twisted 2D materials by artificially stack design. Here, controllable vapor deposition growth of bilayer 3R MoS2 is achieved. The ferroelectricity of as&#8208;grown bilayer 3R MoS2 is investigated via in situ atomic force probe technique. This work can be a big step toward industrial applications of 2D vdW ferroelectric memory.









Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional ultrathin ferroelectrics have attracted much interest due to their potential application in high&#8208;density integration of non&#8208;volatile memory devices. Recently, 2D van der Waals ferroelectric based on interlayer translation has been reported in twisted bilayer h&#8208;BN and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, sliding ferroelectricity is not well studied in non&#8208;twisted homo&#8208;bilayer TMD grown directly by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In this paper, for the first time, experimental observation of a room&#8208;temperature out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric switch in semiconducting bilayer 3R MoS2 synthesized by reverse&#8208;flow CVD is reported. Piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM) hysteretic loops and first principle calculations demonstrate that the ferroelectric nature and polarization switching processes are based on interlayer sliding. The vertical Au/3R MoS2/Pt device exhibits a switchable diode effect. Polarization modulated Schottky barrier height and polarization coupling of interfacial deep states trapping/detrapping may serve in coordination to determine switchable diode effect. The room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity of CVD&#8208;grown MoS2 will proceed with the potential wafer&#8208;scale integration of 2D TMDs in the logic circuit.

         <title>Engineering an Organic Nanoplatform for Augmented Pyroeletroimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance organic nanoplatform, tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 NPs, is rationally engineered for the effective pyroelectroimmunotherapy of tumor metastasis. In vivo assessments reveal that tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 NPs and NIR laser exposure significantly inhibit the proliferation of primary and distant tumors and prominently retarded lung metastasis. This study provides a strategy for designing organic pyroelectric nanoplatforms to effectively cure tumor metastasis and overcome the inherent shortcomings of photothermal immunotherapy.








Abstract
Photothermal immunotherapy has shown great promise in the treatment of tumor metastasis. However, the thermal resistance of tumor cells substantially compromises the treatment effect of photothermal immunotherapy. Herein, a high&#8208;performance organic pyroelectric nanoplatform, tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 nanoparticles (NPs), is rationally engineered for the effective pyroelectroimmunotherapy of tumor metastasis. Biocompatible tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 NPs with excellent pyroelectric and photothermal conversion properties are constructed by assembling organic, low&#8208;bandgap pyroelectric molecules with amphiphilic polymers. After internalization by tumor cells, treatment with tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 NPs causes an apparent temperature elevation upon near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, inducing potent immunogenic cell death (ICD). Additionally, the temperature variations under alternating NIR laser irradiation facilitate reactive oxygen species production for pyroelectric therapy, thus promoting ICD activation and lowering thermal resistance. Importantly, in vivo assessments illustrate that tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 NPs in combination with NIR laser exposure notably inhibit primary and distant tumor proliferation and prominently retarded lung metastasis. RNA profiling reveals that treatment with tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 NPs markedly suppresses metastasis under NIR laser illumination by downregulating metastasis&#8208;related genes and upregulating immune response&#8208;associated pathways. Therefore, this study provides a strategy for designing high&#8208;performance pyroelectric nanoplatforms to effectively cure tumor metastasis, thereby overcoming the inherent shortcomings of photothermal immunotherapy.

         <title>Optically Actuated Soft Microrobot Family for Single&#8208;Cell Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel family of cell manipulators is presented, which are deformable by optical tweezers and rely on their elasticity to hold single, nonadherent cells. The structures, prepared with multiphoton polymerization, provide high spatial and temporal control over the manipulation of the cells enabling single cell movement with 6&#176; of freedom and cell&#8211;cell interactions.








Abstract
Precisely controlled manipulation of nonadherent single cells is often a pre&#8208;requisite for their detailed investigation. Optical trapping provides a versatile means for positioning cells with submicrometer precision or measuring forces with femto&#8208;Newton resolution. A variant of the technique, called indirect optical trapping, enables single&#8208;cell manipulation with no photodamage and superior spatial control and stability by relying on optically trapped microtools biochemically bound to the cell. High&#8208;resolution 3D lithography enables to prepare such cell manipulators with any predefined shape, greatly extending the number of achievable manipulation tasks. Here, it is presented for the first time a novel family of cell manipulators that are deformable by optical tweezers and rely on their elasticity to hold cells. This provides a more straightforward approach to indirect optical trapping by avoiding biochemical functionalization for cell attachment, and consequently by enabling the manipulated cells to be released at any time. Using the photoresist Ormocomp, the deformations achievable with optical forces in the tens of pN range and present three modes of single&#8208;cell manipulation as examples to showcase the possible applications such soft microrobotic tools can offer are characterized. The applications describe here include cell collection, 3D cell imaging, and spatially and temporally controlled cell&#8211;cell interaction.

         <title>Ceramic Meta&#8208;Aerogel with Thermal Superinsulation up to 1700&#160;&#176;C Constructed by Self&#8208;Crosslinked Nanofibrous Network via Reaction Electrospinning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;free reaction electrospinning strategy is proposed to prepare a ceramic meta&#8208;aerogel constructed from a cross&#8208;linked nanofiber network, whose cold surface is only 303&#160;&#176;C in a 1700&#160;&#176;C environment, laying a basis for developing advanced oxide ceramic aerogels for reliable thermal protection in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments.








Abstract
Thermal insulation under extreme conditions requires the materials to be capable of withstanding complex thermo&#8208;mechanical stress, significant gradient temperature transition, and high&#8208;frequency thermal shock. The excellent structural and functional properties of ceramic aerogels make them attractive for thermal insulation. However, in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments (above 1500&#160;&#176;C), they typically exhibit limited insulation capacity and thermo&#8208;mechanical stability, which may lead to catastrophic accidents, and this problem is never effectively addressed. Here, a novel ceramic meta&#8208;aerogel constructed from a crosslinked nanofiber network using a reaction electrospinning strategy, which ensures excellent thermo&#8208;mechanical stability and superinsulation under extreme conditions, is designed. The ceramic meta&#8208;aerogel has an ultralow thermal conductivity of 0.027&#160;W m&#8211;1 k&#8211;1, and the cold surface temperature is only 303&#160;&#176;C in a 1700&#160;&#176;C high&#8208;temperature environment. After undergoing a significant gradient temperature transition from liquid nitrogen to 1700&#160;&#176;C flame burning, the ceramic meta&#8208;aerogel can still withstand thousands of shears, flexures, compressions, and other complex forms of mechanical action without structural collapse. This work provides a new insight for developing ceramic aerogels that can be used for a long period in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments.

         <title>Stem Cell&#8208;Derived Nanovesicles Embedded in Dual&#8208;Layered Hydrogel for Programmed ROS Regulation and Comprehensive Tissue Regeneration in Burn Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanovesicle embedded programable dual&#8208;layered hydrogel is designed for burn wound tissue repair. The inner layer hydrogel first responsively delivers aggregation&#8208;induced emission functionalized stem cell nanovesicles to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) for antibiosis. Then, the tissue regeneration can be enhanced consequently though ROS elimination of outer layer hydrogel as well as the nutrients supply and tissue mobilizing effects of stem cell nanovesicles.








Abstract
Burn wounds often bring high risks of delayed healing process and even death. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in burn wound repair. However, the dynamic process in wound healing requires both the generation of ROS to inhibit bacteria and the subsequent reduction of ROS levels to initiate and promote tissue regeneration, which calls for a more intelligent ROS regulation dressing system. Hence, a dual&#8208;layered hydrogel (Dual&#8208;Gel) tailored to the process of burn wound repair is designed: the inner layer hydrogel (Gel 2) first responds to bacterial hyaluronidase (Hyal) to deliver aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer functionalized adipose&#8208;derived stem cell nanovesicles, which generate ROS upon light irradiation to eliminate bacteria; then the outer layer hydrogel (Gel 1) continuously starts a long&#8208;lasting consumption of excess ROS at the wound site to accelerate tissue regeneration. Simultaneously, the stem cell nanovesicles trapped in the burns wound also provide nutrients and mobilize neighboring tissues to thoroughly assist in inflammation regulation, cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. In summary, this study develops an intelligent treatment approach on burn wounds by programmatically regulating ROS and facilitating comprehensive wound tissue repair.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Engineered Cobalt Catalysts for Fenton&#8208;Like Reactions: Synergy of Single Atom Metal Sites and Nonmetal&#8208;Bonded Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of single&#8208;atom Co catalysts with different types of nitrogen species are synthesized to study the roles of metal&#8208; and nonmetal&#8208;bonded functionalities in Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Co&#9472;N coordination is optimal for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) adsorption to trigger electron transfer pathway, while graphitic N helps adsorb target micropollutant and acts as a secondary PMS adsorption site, synergistically promoting the degradation efficiency.








Abstract
Single atom catalysts (SACs) are atomic&#8208;level&#8208;engineered materials with high intrinsic activity. Catalytic centers of SACs are typically the transition metal (TM)&#8211;nonmetal coordination sites, while the functions of coexisting non&#8208;TM&#8208;bonded functionalities are usually overlooked in catalysis. Herein, the scalable preparation of carbon&#8208;supported cobalt&#8208;anchored SACs (CoCN) with controlled Co&#9472;N sites and free functional N species is reported. The role of metal&#8208; and nonmetal&#8208;bonded functionalities in the SACs for peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;driven Fenton&#8208;like reactions is first systematically studied, revealing their contribution to performance improvement and pathway steering. Experiments and computations demonstrate that the Co&#9472;N3C coordination plays a vital role in the formation of a surface&#8208;confined PMS* complex to trigger the electron transfer pathway and promote kinetics because of the optimized electronic state of Co centers, while the nonmetal&#8208;coordinated graphitic N sites act as preferable pollutant adsorption sites and additional PMS activation sites to accelerate electron transfer. Synergistically, CoCN exhibits ultrahigh activity in PMS activation for p&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid oxidation, achieving complete degradation within 10&#160;min with an ultrahigh turnover frequency of 0.38&#160;min&#8722;1, surpassing most reported materials. These findings offer new insights into the versatile functions of N species in SACs and inspire rational design of high&#8208;performance catalysts in complicated heterogeneous systems.

         <title>Achieving Planar Zn Electroplating in Aqueous Zinc Batteries with Cathode&#8208;Compatible Current Densities by Cycling under Pressure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Applying pressure to aqueous zinc battery cells during operation improves the metal anode cycling performance, particularly when cycled at the lower current densities necessary for compatibility with current cathode materials. This low&#8208;rate stable inter&#8208;cycle coulombic efficiency is achieved due to the pressure encouraging planar plating, and thereby inhibiting dead Zn detachment.








Abstract
The value of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion rechargeable batteries is held back by the degradation of the Zn metal anode with repeated cycling. While raising the operating current density is shown to alleviate this anode degradation, such high cycling rates are not compatible with full cells, as they cause Zn&#8208;host cathodes to undergo capacity decay. A simple approach that improves anode performance while using more modest cathode&#8208;compatible current densities is required. This work reports reversible planar Zn deposition under cathode&#8208;compatible current densities can instead be achieved by applying external pressure to the cell. Employing multiscale characterization, this work illustrates how cycling under pressure results in denser and more uniform Zn deposition, analogous to that achieved under high cycling rates, even at low areal current densities of 1 to 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Microstructural mechanical measurements reveal that Zn structures plated under lower current densities are particularly susceptible to pressure&#8208;induced compression. The ability to achieve planar Zn plating at cathode&#8208;compatible current densities holds significant promise for enabling high&#8208;capacity Zn&#8208;ion battery full cells.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Biodegradable Molybdenum &#8211; From Powder to Vascular Stent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>

Schematic diagram showing the additive manufacturing of Mo&#8208;based bioresorbable vascular stents from Mo powder and their potential applications within intravascular and extravascular conditions. The SLMed thin&#8208;wall (&#8804; 100 &#181;m) Mo owns comparable strength to its Mg and Zn based counterparts, while, it exhibits remarkable biocompatibility both in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Magnesium, iron, and zinc&#8208;based biodegradable metals are widely recognized as promising candidate materials for the next generation of bioresorbable stent (BVS). However, none of those metal BVSs are perfect at this stage. Here, a brand&#8208;new BVS based on a novel biodegradable metal (Molybdenum, Mo) through additive manufacturing is developed. Nearly full&#8208;dense and crack&#8208;free thin&#8208;wall Mo is directly manufactured through selective laser melting (SLM) with fine Mo powder. Systemic analyses considering the forming quality, wall&#8208;thickness, microstructure, mechanical properties, and in vitro degradation behaviors are performed. Then, Mo&#8208;based thin&#8208;strut (&#8804; 100&#160;&#181;m) stents are successfully obtained through an optimized single&#8208;track laser melting route. The SLMed thin&#8208;wall Mo owns comparable strength to its Mg and Zn based counterparts (as&#8208;drawn), while, it exhibits remarkable biocompatibility in vitro. Vessel related cells are well adhered and spread on SLMed Mo, and it exhibits a low risk of hemolysis and thrombus. The SLMed stent is compatible to vessel tissues in rat abdominal aorta, and it can provide sufficient support in an animal model as an extravascular stent. This work possibly opens a new era of manufacturing Mo&#8208;based stents through additive manufacturing.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;&#8220;In Situ&#8221; Analysis of the Reactive Liquid&#8208;Solid Interface during Magnesium Corrosion Using Cryo&#8208;Atom Probe Tomography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach is demonstrated, which has the potential to study liquid&#8208;solid interfaces quasi&#8208;&#8220;in situ&#8221; at the near&#8208;atomic level with high chemical sensitivity using a fully cryo&#8208;enabled workflow. Using the new method&#160;in the early&#8208;stages of Mg corrosion, observed the inward growth of an intermediate corrosion layer with different compositions at the reactive interface under these conditions.








Abstract
The early stages of corrosion occurring at liquid&#8208;solid interfaces control the evolution of the material's degradation process, yet due to their transient state, their analysis remains a formidable challenge. Here corrosion tests are performed on a MgCa alloy, a candidate material for biodegradable implants using pure water as a model system. The corrosion reaction is suspended by plunge freezing into liquid nitrogen. The evolution of the early&#8208;stage corrosion process on the nanoscale by correlating cryo&#8208;atom probe tomography (APT) with transmission&#8208;electron microscopy (TEM) and spectroscopy, is studied. The outward growth of Mg hydroxide Mg(OH)2 and the inward growth of an intermediate corrosion layer consisting of hydrloxides of different compositions, mostly monohydroxide Mg(OH) instead of the expected MgO layer, are observed.

     alt="Quasi-&#8220;In Situ&#8221; Analysis of the Reactive Liquid-Solid Interface during Magnesium Corrosion Using Cryo-Atom Probe Tomography"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new approach is demonstrated, which has the potential to study liquid-solid interfaces quasi-&#8220;in situ&#8221; at the near-atomic level with high chemical sensitivity using a fully cryo-enabled workflow. Using the new method&#160;in the early-stages of Mg corrosion, observed the inward growth of an intermediate corrosion layer with different compositions at the reactive interface under these conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early stages of corrosion occurring at liquid-solid interfaces control the evolution of the material's degradation process, yet due to their transient state, their analysis remains a formidable challenge. Here corrosion tests are performed on a MgCa alloy, a candidate material for biodegradable implants using pure water as a model system. The corrosion reaction is suspended by plunge freezing into liquid nitrogen. The evolution of the early-stage corrosion process on the nanoscale by correlating cryo-atom probe tomography (APT) with transmission-electron microscopy (TEM) and spectroscopy, is studied. The outward growth of Mg hydroxide Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the inward growth of an intermediate corrosion layer consisting of hydrloxides of different compositions, mostly monohydroxide Mg(OH) instead of the expected MgO layer, are observed. In addition, Ca partitions to these newly formed hydroxides and oxides. Density-functional theory calculations suggest a domain of stability for this previously experimental unreported Mg(OH) phase. This new approach and these new findings advance the understanding of the early stages of magnesium corrosion, and in general reactions and processes at liquid-solid interfaces, which can further facilitate the development of corrosion-resistant materials or better control of the biodegradation rate of future implants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mucus&#8208;Inspired Self&#8208;Healing Hydrogels: A Protective Barrier for Cells against Viral Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work reports a scalable synthetic approach to prepare mucus&#8208;mimetic hydrogels with tuneable rheological properties and microstructures. The synthesized hydrogels are characterized at several length scales by macrorheology, single particle tracking microrheology, cryo&#8208;scanning electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;SEM), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements. The synthesized hydrogels exhibit self&#8208;healing properties and protect the underlying cells from viral infection tested in a transwell.








Abstract
Mucus is a dynamic biological hydrogel, composed primarily of the glycoprotein mucin, exhibits unique biophysical properties and forms a barrier protecting cells against a broad&#8208;spectrum of viruses. Here, this work develops a polyglycerol sulfate&#8208;based dendronized mucin&#8208;inspired copolymer (MICP&#8208;1) with &#8776;10% repeating units of activated disulfide as cross&#8208;linking sites. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM)&#160;analysis of MICP&#8208;1 reveals an elongated single&#8208;chain fiber morphology. MICP&#8208;1 shows potential inhibitory activity against many viruses such as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV&#8208;1) and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (including variants such as Delta and Omicron). MICP&#8208;1 produces hydrogels with viscoelastic properties similar to healthy human sputum and with tuneable microstructures using linear and branched polyethylene glycol&#8208;thiol (PEG&#8208;thiol) as cross&#8208;linkers. Single particle tracking microrheology, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and cryo&#8208;scanning electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;SEM) are used to characterize the network structures. The synthesized hydrogels exhibit self&#8208;healing properties, along with viscoelastic properties that are tuneable through reduction. A transwell assay is used to investigate the hydrogel's protective properties against viral infection against HSV&#8208;1. Live&#8208;cell microscopy confirms that these hydrogels can protect underlying cells from infection by trapping the virus, due to both network morphology and anionic multivalent effects. Overall, this novel mucin&#8208;inspired copolymer generates mucus&#8208;mimetic hydrogels on a multi&#8208;gram scale. These hydrogels can be used as models for disulfide&#8208;rich airway mucus research, and as biomaterials.

         <title>Multifunctional Dopamine&#8208;Based Hydrogel Microneedle Electrode for Continuous Ketone Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogel microneedle continuous ketone monitoring (HMN&#8208;CKM) sensor utilizes the dopamine's catechol&#8211;quinone chemistry to monitor ketone bodies in interstitial fluid and facilitate formation of a crosslinked hydrogel network for stable entrapment of sensing components. In vivo experiments demonstrate that the HMN&#8208;CKM can track ketone levels of type 1 diabetes (T1D)&#160;rat models in real&#8208;time in conjunction with a data&#8208;driven machine learning model.









Abstract
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a severe complication of type 1 diabetes (T1D), is triggered by production of large quantities of ketone bodies, requiring patients with T1D to constantly monitor their ketone levels. Here, a skin&#8208;compatible hydrogel microneedle (HMN)&#8208;continuous ketone monitoring (HMN&#8208;CKM) device is reported. The sensing mechanism relies on the catechol&#8211;quinone chemistry inherent to&#160;the dopamine (DA) molecules that are covalently linked to the polymer structure of the HMN patch. The DA serves the dual&#8208;purpose of acting as a redox mediator for measuring the byproduct of oxidation of 3&#8208;beta&#8208;hydroxybutyrate (&#946;&#8208;HB), the primary ketone bodies; while, also facilitating the formation of a crosslinked HMN patch. A universal approach involving pre&#8208;oxidation and detection of the generated catechol compounds is introduced to correlate the sensor response to the &#946;&#8208;HB concentrations. It is further shown that real&#8208;time tracking of a decrease in ketone levels of T1D rat model is possible using the HMN&#8208;CKM device, in conjunction with a data&#8208;driven machine learning model that considers potential time delays.

         <title>Electromechanically Reconfigurable Terahertz Stereo Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The massive strain change associated with the phase transition in VO2 is harnessed to achieve structurally reconfigurable metadevices that can be reversibly switched between 3D and planar geometries. Accessing the third dimension with complete dynamic control holds the potential to unlock exotic light&#8211;matter interactions, paving the way for novel and high&#8208;performance electromagnetic devices.








Abstract
Dynamic terahertz devices are vital for the next generation of wireless communication, sensing, and non&#8208;destructive imaging technologies. Metasurfaces have emerged as a paradigm&#8208;shifting platform, offering varied functionalities, miniaturization, and simplified fabrication compared to their 3D counterparts. However, the presence of in&#8208;plane mirror symmetry and reduced degree of freedom impose fundamental limitations on achieving advanced chiral response, beamforming, and reconfiguration capabilities. In this work, a platform composed of electrically actuated resonators that can be colossally reconfigured between planar and 3D geometries is demonstrated. To illustrate the platform, metadevices with 3D Split Ring Resonators are fabricated, wherein two counteracting driving forces are combined: i) folding induced by stress mismatch, which enables non&#8208;volatile state design and ii) unfolding triggered by the strain associated with insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition in VO2, which facilitates volatile structural reconfiguration. This large structural reconfiguration space allows for resonance mode switching, widely tunable magnetic and electric polarizabilities, and increased frequency agility. Moreover, the unique properties of VO2, such as the hysteretic nature of its phase transition is harnessed to demonstrate a multi&#8208;state memory. Therefore, these VO2 integrated metadevices are highly attractive for the realization of 6G communication devices such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, holographic beam formers, and spatial light modulators.

         <title>Floating Bimetallic Catalysts for Growing 30&#160;cm&#8208;Long Carbon Nanotube Arrays with High Yields and Uniformity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Floating bimetallic catalysts are developed in this work to grow ultralong CNT arrays with high yields and uniformity. With optimized FeCu catalysts, 30&#8208;centimeters&#8208;long ultralong CNT arrays with a record&#8208;breaking areal density of &#8776;8100&#160;CNTs&#160;mm&#8722;1 and significantly improved uniformity can be synthesized, which can be attributed to balancing the tradeoff between catalyst fluidity and carbon solubility.








Abstract
Ultralong carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are considered as promising candidates for many cutting&#8208;edge applications. However, restricted by the extremely low yields of ultralong CNTs, their practical applications can hardly be realized. Therefore, new methodologies shall be developed to boost the growth efficiency of ultralong CNTs and alleviate their areal density decay at the macroscale level. Herein, a facile, universal, and controllable method for the in situ synthesis of floating bimetallic catalysts (FBCs) is proposed to grow ultralong CNT arrays with high yields and uniformity. Ferrocene and metal acetylacetonates serve as catalyst precursors, affording the successful synthesis of a series of FBCs with controllable compositions. Among these FBCs, the optimized FeCu catalyst increases the areal density of ultralong CNT arrays to a record&#8208;breaking value of &#8776;8100&#160;CNTs&#160;mm&#8722;1 and exhibits a lifetime 3.40 times longer than that of Fe, thus achieving both high yields and uniformity. A 30&#8208;centimeters&#8208;long and high&#8208;density ultralong CNT array is also successfully grown with the assistance of FeCu catalysts. As evidenced by this kinetic model and molecular dynamics simulations, the introduction of Cu into Fe can simultaneously improve the catalyst fluidity and decrease carbon solubility, and an optimal catalytic performance will be achieved by balancing this tradeoff.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultralong carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are considered as promising candidates for many cutting-edge applications. However, restricted by the extremely low yields of ultralong CNTs, their practical applications can hardly be realized. Therefore, new methodologies shall be developed to boost the growth efficiency of ultralong CNTs and alleviate their areal density decay at the macroscale level. Herein, a facile, universal, and controllable method for the in situ synthesis of floating bimetallic catalysts (FBCs) is proposed to grow ultralong CNT arrays with high yields and uniformity. Ferrocene and metal acetylacetonates serve as catalyst precursors, affording the successful synthesis of a series of FBCs with controllable compositions. Among these FBCs, the optimized FeCu catalyst increases the areal density of ultralong CNT arrays to a record-breaking value of &#8776;8100&#160;CNTs&#160;mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and exhibits a lifetime 3.40 times longer than that of Fe, thus achieving both high yields and uniformity. A 30-centimeters-long and high-density ultralong CNT array is also successfully grown with the assistance of FeCu catalysts. As evidenced by this kinetic model and molecular dynamics simulations, the introduction of Cu into Fe can simultaneously improve the catalyst fluidity and decrease carbon solubility, and an optimal catalytic performance will be achieved by balancing this tradeoff.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Electrical Bandage Based on Body&#8208;Coupled Energy Harvesting</title>

An innovative SEB based on high&#8208;permittivity P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) nanocomposites is designed to provide autonomous and effective electrical treatment that accelerates wound healing by leveraging body&#8208;coupled energy harvesting from ambient 60&#8208;Hz EM waves. Combining human&#8208;centered energy solution and flexible, skin&#8208;conformable design, this work suggests the potential of the SEB as a straightforward, convenient, and practical wound care apparatus.








Abstract
Self&#8208;powered electrical bandages (SEBs), integrated with wearable energy harvesters, can provide an effective and autonomous electrical stimulation (ES) solution for rapid and scarless wound healing. A continuously operating, wireless, and applicable&#8208;to&#8208;comprehensive&#8208;wound ES device is essential for the quick restoration of wounds and convenience. This work illustrates a SEB powered by body&#8208;coupled energy harvesting. The SEB continuously treats the wound with 60&#8208;Hz sinusoidal electrical potential gained from the coupling of the human body and ambient electrical waves. It is demonstrated that enough level of electrical potential can be applied to the wound, further enhanced by strong capacitive coupling arising from the use of high&#8208;permittivity poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene):CaCu3Ti4O12 (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE):CCTO) nanocomposite. The potential clinical efficacy of the SEB is illustrated by preclinical analysis of human fibroblasts and mouse wound model, thus confirming the successful expedition of wound recovery. This work suggests a new class of wearable devices to provide ES events and its potential for extension to other conventional wound care materials and device technology.

         <title>Engineering a Hierarchy of Disorder: A New Route to Synthesize High&#8208;Performance 3D Nanoporous All&#8208;Carbon Materials**</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>

Nanoporous amorphous carbon achieves an unprecedented combination of ultrahigh strength and conductivity by incorporating three amorphous sp2, sp3, and graphitic phases. The unique core&#8211;shell architecture: sp3 core for strength, sp2 shell for conductivity, surpasses existing porous materials in both strength and conductivity, opening doors for new high&#8208;performance material design.








Abstract
A new nanoporous amorphous carbon (NAC) structure that achieves both ultrahigh strength and high electrical conductivity, which are usually incompatible in porous materials is reported. By using modified spark plasma sintering, three amorphous carbon phases with different atomic bonding configurations are created. The composite consisted of an amorphous sp2&#8208;carbon matrix mixed with amorphous sp3&#8208;carbon and amorphous graphitic motif. NAC structure has an isotropic electrical conductivity of up to 12&#160;000&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1, Young's modulus of up to &#8776;5&#160;GPa, and Vickers hardness of over 900&#160;MPa. These properties are superior to those of existing conductive nanoporous materials. Direct investigation of the multiscale structure of this material through transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and machine learning&#8208;based electron tomography revealed that the origin of the remarkable material properties is the well&#8208;organized sp2/sp3 amorphous carbon phases with a core&#8211;shell&#8208;like architecture, where the sp3&#8208;rich carbon forms a resilient core surrounded by a conductive sp2&#8208;rich layer. This research not only introduces novel materials with exceptional properties but also opens new opportunities for exploring amorphous structures and designing high&#8208;performance materials.

         <title>Field&#8208;Effect Thermoelectric Hotspot in Monolayer Graphene Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Field&#8208;effect thermoelectrics in monolayer graphene transistor is reported. Spatially localized hotspot is observed at Dirac point and arises from both Joule and Peltier heating, characterized by scanning thermal microscopy and analyzed through simulation. The position of the observed Dirac hotspot can shift in the gated region, highly controllable by the gate bias.








Abstract
Graphene is a promising candidate for the thermal management of downscaled microelectronic devices owing to its exceptional electrical and thermal properties. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the intricate electrical and thermal interconversions at a nanoscale, particularly in field&#8208;effect transistors with prevalent gate operations, remains elusive. In this study, nanothermometric imaging is used to examine a current&#8208;carrying monolayer graphene channel sandwiched between hexagonal boron nitride dielectrics. It is revealed for the first time that beyond the expected Joule heating, the thermoelectric Peltier effect actively plays a significant role in generating hotspots beneath the gated region. With gate&#8208;controlled charge redistribution and a shift in the Dirac point position, an unprecedented systematic evolution of thermoelectric hotspots, underscoring their remarkable tenability is demonstrated. This study reveals the field&#8208;effect Peltier contribution in a single graphene&#8208;material channel of transistors, offering valuable insights into field&#8208;effect thermoelectrics and future on&#8208;chip energy management.

         <title>Eagle&#8208;Eye Inspired Meta&#8208;Device for Phase Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eagle's eyes, equipped with bifocals, demonstrate the ability to capture the bear, analogous to the authors&#8217; designed meta&#8208;device with two focal lengths, which enables the capture of phase information from the &#8220;transparent bear.&#8221;








Abstract
The dual&#8208;focus vision observed in eagles' eyes is an intriguing phenomenon captivates scientists since a long time. Inspired by this natural occurrence, the authors&#8217; research introduces a novel bifocal meta&#8208;device incorporating a polarized camera capable of simultaneously capturing images for two different polarizations with slightly different focal distances. This innovative approach facilitates the concurrent acquisition of underfocused and overfocused images in a single snapshot, enabling the effective extraction of quantitative phase information from the object using the transport of intensity equation. Experimental demonstrations showcase the application of quantitative phase imaging to artificial objects and human embryonic kidney cells, particularly emphasizing the meta&#8208;device's relevance in dynamic scenarios such as laser&#8208;induced ablation in human embryonic kidney cells. Moreover, it provides a solution for the quantification during the dynamic process at the cellular level. Notably, the proposed eagle&#8208;eye inspired meta&#8208;device for phase imaging (EIMPI), due to its simplicity and compact nature, holds promise for significant applications in fields such as endoscopy and headsets, where a lightweight and compact setup is essential.

         <dc:description>
Through site&#8208;selective growth of Cu on unusual phase Au nanorods, three kinds of heterophase fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Au&#8211;Cu heteronanostructures are obtained, among which fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Au&#8211;Cu JNSs exhibit the best CO2RR performance, with FEC2+ of 84.3%. It is revealed that co&#8208;exposure of 2H&#8208;Au and 2H&#8208;Cu domains in Au&#8211;Cu JNSs diversifies CO* adsorption configurations, promoting CO* spillover and subsequent C&#8211;C coupling for multi&#8208;carbon production.








Abstract
Copper (Cu) nanomaterials are a unique kind of electrocatalysts for high&#8208;value multi&#8208;carbon production in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), which holds enormous potential in attaining carbon neutrality. However, phase engineering of Cu nanomaterials remains challenging, especially for the construction of unconventional phase Cu&#8208;based asymmetric heteronanostructures. Here the site&#8208;selective growth of Cu on unusual phase gold (Au) nanorods, obtaining three kinds of heterophase fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Au&#8211;Cu heteronanostructures is reported. Significantly, the resultant fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Au&#8211;Cu Janus nanostructures (JNSs) break the symmetric growth mode of Cu on Au. In electrocatalytic CO2RR, the fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Au&#8211;Cu JNSs exhibit excellent performance in both H&#8208;type and flow cells, with Faradaic efficiencies of 55.5% and 84.3% for ethylene and multi&#8208;carbon products, respectively. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal the co&#8208;exposure of 2H&#8208;Au and 2H&#8208;Cu domains in Au&#8211;Cu JNSs diversifies the CO* adsorption configurations and promotes the CO* spillover and subsequent C&#8211;C coupling toward ethylene generation with reduced energy barriers.

         <title>Instantaneous Thermal Energy for Swift Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Unparalleled Performance in Metal&#8211;Air Batteries and Fuel Cells</title>

This research presents an innovative method, using a 2.5&#8208;min heat treatment, to create highly efficient iron single&#8208;atom catalysts supported by graphene oxide.








Abstract
Based on experimental and computational evidence, phthalocyanine (Pc) compounds in the form of quaternary&#8208;bound metal&#8208;nitrogen (N) atoms are the most effective catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the heat treatment process used in their synthesis may compromise the ideal structure, causing the agglomeration of transition metals. To overcome this issue, a novel method is developed for synthesizing iron (Fe) single&#8208;atom catalysts with ideal structures supported by thermally exfoliated graphene oxide (GO). This is achieved through a short heat treatment of only 2.5&#160;min involving FePc and N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide in the presence of GO. According to the synthesis mechanism revealed by this study, carbon monoxide acts as a strong linker between the single Fe atoms and graphene. It facilitates the formation of a structure containing oxygen species between FeN4 and graphene, which provides high activity and stability for the ORR. These catalysts possess an enormous number of active sites and exhibit enhanced activity toward the alkaline ORR. They demonstrate excellent performance when applied to real electrochemical devices, such as zinc&#8211;air batteries and anion exchange membrane fuel cells. It is expected that the instantaneous heat treatment method developed in this study will aid in the development of high&#8208;performing single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Balancing Polarization and Breakdown for High Capacitive Energy Storage by Microstructure Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Balancing polarization and breakdown by microstructure control&#8212;amorphous for breakdown, crystalline for polarization&#8212;is key to energy storage. Phase&#8208;field simulations reveal that small grains with moderate crystallinity optimize both, leading to high energy density. This approach yielded a 131 J cm&#8722;3 energy density with 81.6% efficiency in Bi3NdTi4O12 films, offering a strategy for advanced dielectric energy storage through microstructure design.








Abstract
The compromise of contradictive parameters, polarization, and breakdown strength, is necessary to achieve a high energy storage performance. The two can be tuned, regardless of material types, by controlling microstructures: amorphous states possess higher breakdown strength, while crystalline states have larger polarization. However, how to achieve a balance of amorphous and crystalline phases requires systematic and quantitative investigations. Herein, the trade&#8208;off between polarization and breakdown field is comprehensively evaluated with the evolution of microstructure, i.e., grain size and crystallinity, by phase&#8208;field simulations. The results indicate small grain size (&#8776;10&#8211;35&#160;nm) with moderate crystallinity (&#8776;60&#8211;80%) is more beneficial to maintain relatively high polarization and breakdown field simultaneously, consequently contributing to a high overall energy storage performance. Experimentally, therefore an ultrahigh energy density of 131 J cm&#8722;3 is achieved with a high efficiency of 81.6% in the microcrystal&#8208;amorphous dual&#8208;phase Bi3NdTi4O12 films. This work provides a guidance to substantially enhance dielectric energy storage by a simple and effective microstructure design.

         <title>Thermal Shock Synthesis for Loading Sub&#8208;2&#160;nm Ru Nanoclusters on Titanium Nitride as a Remarkable Electrocatalyst toward Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct dechlorination of the adsorbed RuCl3, ultrafast nucleation process, and short coalescence duration under high&#8208;temperature shock conditions give rise to Sub&#8208;2&#160;nm Ru nanocrystals (NCs) on TiN support (HTS&#8208;Ru&#8208;NCs/TiN) via the specific Ru&#8211;Ti interaction. The accelerated water dissociation kinetics at the Ru&#8211;Ti interfacial perimeters predominantly account for the encouraging electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction activity in alkaline.








Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts embracing metal entities on suitable supports are profound in catalyzing various chemical reactions, and substantial synthetic endeavors in metal&#8211;support interaction modulation are made to enhance catalytic performance. Here, it is reported the loading of sub&#8208;2&#160;nm Ru nanocrystals (NCs) on titanium nitride support (HTS&#8208;Ru&#8208;NCs/TiN) via a special Ru&#8211;Ti interaction using the high&#8208;temperature shock (HTS) method. Direct dechlorination of the adsorbed RuCl3, ultrafast nucleation process, and short coalescence duration at ultrahigh temperatures contribute to the immobilization of Ru NCs on TiN support via producing the Ru&#8211;Ti interfacial perimeter. HTS&#8208;Ru&#8208;NCs/TiN shows remarkable activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution, yielding ultralow overpotentials of 16.3 and 86.6&#160;mV to achieve 10 and 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The alkaline and anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers assembled using HTS&#8208;Ru&#8208;NCs/TiN yield 1.0&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.65 and 1.67&#160;V, respectively, which validate its applicability in the hydrogen production industry. Theoretical simulations reveal the favorable formation of Ru&#9472;O and Ti&#9472;H bonds at the interfacial perimeters between Ru NCs and TiN, which accelerates the prerequisite water dissociation kinetics for enhanced HER activity. This exemplified work motivates the design of specific interfacial perimeters via the HTS strategy to improve the performance of diverse catalysis.

Abstract
The electrical conductivity of blood is a crucial physiological parameter with diverse applications in medical diagnostics. Here, a novel approach utilizing a portable millifluidic nanogenerator lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip device for measuring blood conductivity at low frequencies, is introduced. The proposed device employs blood as a conductive substance within its built&#8208;in triboelectric nanogenerator system. The voltage generated by this blood&#8208;based nanogenerator device is analyzed to determine the electrical conductivity of the blood sample. The self&#8208;powering functionality of the device eliminates the need for complex embedded electronics and external electrodes. Experimental results using simulated body fluid and human blood plasma demonstrate the device's efficacy in detecting variations in conductivity related to changes in electrolyte concentrations. Furthermore, artificial intelligence models are used to analyze the generated voltage patterns and to estimate the blood electrical conductivity. The models exhibit high accuracy in predicting conductivity based solely on the device&#8208;generated voltage. The 3D&#8208;printed, disposable design of the device enhances portability and usability, providing a point&#8208;of&#8208;care solution for rapid blood conductivity assessment. A comparative analysis with traditional conductivity measurement methods highlights the advantages of the proposed device in terms of simplicity, portability, and adaptability for various applications beyond blood analysis.

         <title>Sub&#8208;2 nm Microstrained High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy Nanoparticles Boost Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of IrRhRhMoW high&#8208;entropy alloys with distinct local microstrain caused by the lattice distortion effect is reported for superior hydrogen electrocatalysis. This work demonstrates that a weakened hydrogen adsorption binding energy and enhanced hydroxyl adsorption energy on microstrain&#8208;modulated IrRuRhMoW HEA NPs catalyst collectively contribute to efficient hydrogen electrocatalytic performance in alkaline.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) confine multifarious elements into the same lattice, leading to intense lattice distortion effect. The lattice distortion tends to induce local microstrain at atomic level and thus affect surface adsorptions toward different adsorbates in various electrocatalytic reactions, yet remains unexplored. Herein, this work reports a class of sub&#8208;2&#160;nm IrRuRhMoW HEA nanoparticles (NPs) with distinct local microstrain induced by lattice distortion for boosting alkaline hydrogen oxidation (HOR) and evolution reactions (HER). This work demonstrates that the distortion&#8208;rich HEA catalysts with optimized electronic structure can downshift the d&#8208;band center and generate uncoordinated oxygen sites to enhance the surface oxophilicity. As a result, the IrRuRhMoW HEA NPs show a remarkable HOR kinetic current density of 8.09&#160;mA &#181;g&#8722;1PGM at 50&#160;mV versus RHE, 8.89, 22.47 times higher than those of IrRuRh NPs without internal strain and commercial Pt/C, respectively, which is the best value among all the reported non&#8208;Pt based catalysts. IrRuRhMoW HEA NPs also display great HER performances with a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 5.93 H2 s&#8722;1 at 70&#160;mV versus RHE, 4.6&#8208;fold higher than that of Pt/C catalyst, exceeding most noble metal&#8208;based catalysts. Experimental characterizations and theoretical studies collectively confirm that weakened hydrogen (Had) and enhanced hydroxyl (OHad) adsorption are achieved by simultaneously modulating the hydrogen adsorption binding energy and surface oxophilicity originated from intensified ligand effect and microstrain effect over IrRuRhMoW HEA NPs, which guarantees the remarkable performances toward HOR/HER.

         <title>In Vivo Polymer Mechanochemistry with Polynucleotides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a mechanochemically&#8208;responsive polynucleotide platform that leverages medical imaging ultrasound for the binding and release of therapeutic oligonucleotides and small molecules. It demonstrates that high molar mass, colloidal assembly and distinct mechanochemical mechanisms facilitate force&#8208;induced cargo release and subsequent activation of biological functions in vitro and in vivo, thereby pioneering novel mechanochemical strategies for sonopharmacology and sonogenetics applications. 








Abstract
Polymer mechanochemistry utilizes mechanical force to activate latent functionalities in macromolecules and widely relies on ultrasonication techniques. Fundamental constraints of frequency and power intensity have prohibited the application of the polymer mechanochemistry principles in a biomedical context up to now, although medical ultrasound is a clinically established modality. Here, a universal polynucleotide framework is presented that allows the binding and release of therapeutic oligonucleotides, both DNA&#8208; and RNA&#8208;based, as cargo by biocompatible medical imaging ultrasound. It is shown that the high molar mass, colloidal assembly, and a distinct mechanochemical mechanism enable the force&#8208;induced release of cargo and subsequent activation of biological function in vitro and in vivo. Thereby, this work introduces a platform for the exploration of biological questions and therapeutics development steered by mechanical force.

         <title>Spontaneous Supercrystal Formation During a Strain&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8211;Insulator Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a thin epitaxially strained film of a Mott insulator, a hierarchical anisotropic supercrystal is found below metal&#8211;insulator transition temperature (top). A different anisotropic structure is observed at temperatures above (bottom). An electronic anisotropy correlated with the supercrystal is discovered, switching preferential conductivity direction by 90&#176;.








Abstract
Mott metal&#8211;insulator transitions possess electronic, magnetic, and structural degrees of freedom promising next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;efficient electronics. A previously unknown, hierarchically ordered, and anisotropic supercrystal state is reported and its intrinsic formation characterized&#160;in&#8208;situ during a Mott transition in a Ca2RuO4 thin film. Machine learning&#8208;assisted X&#8208;ray nanodiffraction together with cryogenic electron microscopy reveal multi&#8208;scale periodic domain formation at and below the film transition temperature (TFilm&#160;&#8776;&#160;200&#8211;250&#160;K) and a separate anisotropic spatial structure at and above TFilm. Local resistivity measurements imply an intrinsic coupling of the supercrystal orientation to the material's anisotropic conductivity. These findings add a new degree of complexity to the physical understanding of Mott transitions, opening opportunities for designing materials with tunable electronic properties.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Drum&#8208;Type Atmospheric Water Harvester Based on Bio&#8208;Based Gels with Fast Adsorption/Desorption Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solar&#8208;driven, fast moisture adsorbing and desorbing gel (cellulose/alginate/lignin gel) exhibits a water capture rate of 1.74&#160;kg kg&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 (at 30% relative humidity) and a desorption rate of 1.98&#160;kg kg&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. The switching frequency of the developed drum&#8208;type harvester can be flexibly optimized to achieve the highest efficiency of atmospheric water harvesting within a brief time.








Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting is an attractive technology for exploiting unconventional water sources. A critical challenge is how to facilitate fast and continuous collection of potable water from air. Here, a bio&#8208;based gel (cellulose/alginate/lignin gel, CAL gel), resulting from the integration of a whole biomass&#8208;derived polymer network with lithium chloride is reported. A fast adsorption/desorption kinetics, with a water capture rate of 1.74&#160;kg kg&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 30% relative humidity and a desorption rate of 1.98&#160;kg kg&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, is simultaneously realized in one piece of CAL gel, because of its strong hygroscopicity, hydrophilic network, abundant water transport channels, photothermal conversion ability, and &#8776;200&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;thick self&#8208;supporting bulky structure caused by multicomponent synergy. A solar&#8208;driven, drum&#8208;type, tunable, and portable harvester is designed that can harvest atmospheric water within a brief time. Under outdoor conditions, the harvester with CAL gels operates 36 switches (180&#176;) per day realizes a water yield of 8.96&#160;kg kggel&#8722;1 (18.87&#160;g kgdevice&#8722;1). This portable harvester highlights the potential for fast and scalable atmospheric water harvesting in extreme environments.

&lt;p&gt;A solar-driven, fast moisture adsorbing and desorbing gel (cellulose/alginate/lignin gel) exhibits a water capture rate of 1.74&#160;kg kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (at 30% relative humidity) and a desorption rate of 1.98&#160;kg kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The switching frequency of the developed drum-type harvester can be flexibly optimized to achieve the highest efficiency of atmospheric water harvesting within a brief time.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorption-based atmospheric water harvesting is an attractive technology for exploiting unconventional water sources. A critical challenge is how to facilitate fast and continuous collection of potable water from air. Here, a bio-based gel (cellulose/alginate/lignin gel, CAL gel), resulting from the integration of a whole biomass-derived polymer network with lithium chloride is reported. A fast adsorption/desorption kinetics, with a water capture rate of 1.74&#160;kg kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 30% relative humidity and a desorption rate of 1.98&#160;kg kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, is simultaneously realized in one piece of CAL gel, because of its strong hygroscopicity, hydrophilic network, abundant water transport channels, photothermal conversion ability, and &#8776;200-&#181;m-thick self-supporting bulky structure caused by multicomponent synergy. A solar-driven, drum-type, tunable, and portable harvester is designed that can harvest atmospheric water within a brief time. Under outdoor conditions, the harvester with CAL gels operates 36 switches (180&#176;) per day realizes a water yield of 8.96&#160;kg kg&lt;sub&gt;gel&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (18.87&#160;g kg&lt;sub&gt;device&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This portable harvester highlights the potential for fast and scalable atmospheric water harvesting in extreme environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surfactant Self&#8208;Assembly Enhances Tribopositivity of Stretchable Ionic Conductors for Wearable Energy Harvesting and Motion Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surfactant self&#8208;assembled stretchable solid&#8208;state water polyurethane (WPU), which avoids the negative impact of high salt dissociation, is developed. Compared to pristine WPU, the surfactant self&#8208;assembled WPU exhibits high ionic conductivity, relative permittivity, and tribopositivity. The fabricated device shows high electric output and can be efficiently employed in wearable electronics.








Abstract
Boosting stretchability and electric output is critical for high&#8208;performance wearable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG). Herein, for the first time, a new approach for tuning the composition of surface functional groups through surfactant self&#8208;assembly to improve the tribopositivity, where the assembly increases the transferred charge density and the relative permittivity of water polyurethane (WPU). Incorporating bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI&#8722;) and alkali metal ions into a mixture of WPU and the surfactant forms a stretchable film that simultaneously functions as positive tribolayer and electrode, preventing the conventional detachment of tribolayer and electrode in long term usage. Further, the conductivity of the crosslinked film reaches 3.3 &#215; 10&#8722;3 mS cm&#8722;1 while the elongation at break reaches 362%. Moreover, the surfactant self&#8208;assembly impedes the adverse impact of the fluorine&#8208;containing groups on tribopositivity. Consequently, the charge density reaches 155 &#181;C m&#8722;2, being the highest recorded for WPU and stretchable ionic conductor based TENG. This work introduces a novel approach for boosting the output charge density while avoiding the adverse effect of ionic salts in solid conductors through a universal surfactant self&#8208;assembly strategy, which can be extended to other materials. Further, the device is used to monitor and harvest the kinetic energy of human body motion.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Curing of Liquid Crystal Thermosets Enabled by End&#8208;Groups Regulation and In Situ Monitoring by Triboelectric Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly designed end&#8208;group endows liquid crystal polyarylate thermoset with relatively mild curing condition (300&#160;&#176;C) and high curing efficiency (1&#160;min) while maintaining excellent thermomechanical properties. The chemical information extracted from the triboelectric output performance enables a new nondestructive and sensitive tool to estimate the process of curing reaction based on the variation of crosslinked networks.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance polymer is crucial for the fabrication of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) used in extreme conditions. Liquid crystal polyarylate thermosets (LCTs) demonstrate great potential as triboelectric material by virtue of exceptional comprehensive properties. However, there are only a few specific end&#8208;groups like phenylethynyl matching the LCT polycondensation temperature (above 300&#160;&#176;C). Moreover, the excellent properties of LCTs rely on the crosslinked network formed with long curing time at high temperature, restricting their further application in triboelectric material. Herein, a fast&#8208;curing LCT is designed by terminating with 4&#8208;maleimidophenol possessing appropriate reactivity. The resultant LCT (MA&#8208;LC&#8208;MA) exhibits much lower polycondensation temperature (250&#8211;270&#160;&#176;C) and curing temperature of 300&#160;&#176;C within only 1&#160;min compared to typical LCTs (cured at 370&#160;&#176;C for 1&#160;h). Furthermore, the cured MA&#8208;LC&#8208;MA retains a high glass transition temperature of 135&#160;&#176;C, storage modulus of 6&#160;MPa even at 350&#160;&#176;C, and great electrical output performance. Additionally, triboelectric measurement related to the dielectric properties that vary with crosslinked network is innovatively utilized as an analysis technique of curing progress. This work provides a new strategy to design high&#8208;performance TENGs and promotes the development of next generation thermosets in extreme conditions.

         <title>Synergistic Bulk and Surface Engineering for Expeditious and Durable Reversible Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells Air Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To expedite the electrocatalytic activity in the air electrodes with triple (O2&#8211;, H+, e&#8211;) conductivity, a facile approach of simultaneously optimizing the bulk metal&#8208;oxygen bonds and in situ forming metal oxide nano&#8208;catalysts on the surface is proposed, leading to accelerated surface and bulk ion generation and migration kinetics.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) offer the potential for high&#8208;efficiency power generation and green hydrogen production at intermediate temperatures. However, the commercial viability of R&#8208;PCECs is hampered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within conventional air electrodes operating at reduced temperatures. To address this challenge, this work introduces a novel approach based on the simultaneous optimization of bulk&#8208;phase metal&#8208;oxygen bonds and in&#8208;situ formation of a metal oxide nano&#8208;catalyst surface modification. This strategy is designed to expedite the ORR/OER electrocatalytic activity of air electrodes exhibiting triple (O2&#8722;, H+, e&#8722;) conductivity. Specifically, this engineered air electrode nanocomposite&#8208;Ba(Co0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1)0.95Ni0.05F0.1O2.9&#8208;&#948; demonstrates remarkable ORR/OER catalytic activity and exceptional durability in R&#8208;PCECs. This is evidenced by significantly improved peak power density from 626 to 996&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and highly stable reversibility over a 100&#8208;h cycling period. This research offers a rational design strategy to achieve high&#8208;performance R&#8208;PCEC air electrodes with superior operational activity and stability for efficient and sustainable energy conversion and storage.

         <title>A Zero&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Writing Artificial Nervous System Based on Biosensor Integrated on Ferroelectric Tunnel Junction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a zero&#8208;voltage&#8208;writing artificial nervous system (ZANS) that integrates a bio&#8208;source&#8208;sensing device (BSSD) for ion&#8208;based sensing and power generation with a hafnium&#8208;zirconium oxide&#8208;ferroelectric tunnel junction (HZO&#8208;FTJ) for the continuously adjustable resistance state. Moreover, by connecting it to the sciatic nerve of the rabbit's leg, precise control of the rabbit's leg muscles with zero&#8208;voltage&#8208;writing capability is successfully realized.








Abstract
The artificial nervous system proves the great potential for the emulation of complex neural signal transduction. However, a more bionic system design for bio&#8208;signal transduction still lags behind that of physical signals, and relies on additional external sources. Here, this work presents a zero&#8208;voltage&#8208;writing artificial nervous system (ZANS) that integrates a bio&#8208;source&#8208;sensing device (BSSD) for ion&#8208;based sensing and power generation with a hafnium&#8208;zirconium oxide&#8208;ferroelectric tunnel junction (HZO&#8208;FTJ) for the continuously adjustable resistance state. The BSSD can use ion bio&#8208;source as both perception and energy source, and then output voltage signals varied with the change of ion concentrations to the HZO&#8208;FTJ, which completes the zero&#8208;voltage&#8208;writing neuromorphic bio&#8208;signal modulation. In view of in/ex vivo biocompatibility, this work shows the precise muscle control of a rabbit leg by integrating the ZANS with a flexible nerve stimulation electrode. The independence on external source enhances the application potential of ZANS in robotics and prosthetics.

     alt="A Zero-Voltage-Writing Artificial Nervous System Based on Biosensor Integrated on Ferroelectric Tunnel Junction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work presents a zero-voltage-writing artificial nervous system (ZANS) that integrates a bio-source-sensing device (BSSD) for ion-based sensing and power generation with a hafnium-zirconium oxide-ferroelectric tunnel junction (HZO-FTJ) for the continuously adjustable resistance state. Moreover, by connecting it to the sciatic nerve of the rabbit's leg, precise control of the rabbit's leg muscles with zero-voltage-writing capability is successfully realized.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artificial nervous system proves the great potential for the emulation of complex neural signal transduction. However, a more bionic system design for bio-signal transduction still lags behind that of physical signals, and relies on additional external sources. Here, this work presents a zero-voltage-writing artificial nervous system (ZANS) that integrates a bio-source-sensing device (BSSD) for ion-based sensing and power generation with a hafnium-zirconium oxide-ferroelectric tunnel junction (HZO-FTJ) for the continuously adjustable resistance state. The BSSD can use ion bio-source as both perception and energy source, and then output voltage signals varied with the change of ion concentrations to the HZO-FTJ, which completes the zero-voltage-writing neuromorphic bio-signal modulation. In view of in/ex vivo biocompatibility, this work shows the precise muscle control of a rabbit leg by integrating the ZANS with a flexible nerve stimulation electrode. The independence on external source enhances the application potential of ZANS in robotics and prosthetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Adaptive Heterojunction Synaptic Transistors for Efficient Machine Vision in Harsh Lighting Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic heterojunction transistors are designed to integrate light intensity&#8208;adaptive threshold sliding and second&#8208;order adaptive metaplasticity. The unique dual adaptability enables the highlighting of 0.4% low&#8208;contrast images, and the efficient recognition can be achieved benefiting from the learning rate changes in the backpropagation process.








Abstract
Photoadaptive synaptic devices enable in&#8208;sensor processing of complex illumination scenes, while second&#8208;order adaptive synaptic plasticity improves learning efficiency by modifying the learning rate in a given environment. The integration of above adaptations in one phototransistor device will provide opportunities for developing high&#8208;efficient machine vision system. Here, a dually adaptable organic heterojunction transistor as a working unit in the system, which facilitates precise contrast enhancement and improves convergence rate under harsh lighting conditions, is reported. The photoadaptive threshold sliding originates from the bidirectional photoconductivity caused by the light intensity&#8208;dependent photogating effect. Metaplasticity is successfully implemented owing to the combination of ambipolar behavior and charge trapping effect. By utilizing the transistor array in a machine vision system, the details and edges can be highlighted in the 0.4% low&#8208;contrast images, and a high recognition accuracy of 93.8% with a significantly promoted convergence rate by about 5 times are also achieved. These results open a strategy to fully implement metaplasticity in optoelectronic devices and suggest their vision processing applications in complex lighting scenes.

         <title>Hybrid Surface Modification and Bulk Doping Enable Spent LiCoO2 Cathodes for High&#8208;Voltage Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive bulk and surface commodification strategy including bulk Mn doping, near&#8208;surface P gradient doping, and Li3PO4/CoP coating is proposed to enable spent LiCoO2 cathodes for high&#8208;voltage operation. Li+&#8208;conductive Li3PO4 and electron conductive CoP facilitate mitigation of electrode/electrolyte interfacial side reactions, Li&#8208;ion diffusion, and electron transport; thus, boosting the cycling stability and rate performance of upcycled LiCoO2 at 4.6 V.








Abstract
The emerging market demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density of energy storage devices is pushing the disposal of end&#8208;of&#8208;life LiCoO2 (LCO) to shift toward sustainable upgrading into structurally stable high&#8208;voltage cathode materials. Herein, an integrated bulk and surface commodification strategy is proposed to render spent LCO (S&#8208;LCO) to operate at high voltages, involving bulk Mn doping, near surface P gradient doping, and Li3PO4/CoP (LPO/CP) coating on the LCO surface to yield upcycled LCO (defined as MP&#8208;LCO@LPO/CP). Benefiting from hybrid surface coating with Li+&#8208;conductive Li3PO4 (LPO) and electron conductive CoP (CP) coupled with Mn and P co&#8208;doping, the optimized MP&#8208;LCO@LPO/CP cathode exhibits enhanced high&#8208;voltage performance, delivering an initial discharge capacity of 218.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C with excellent capacity retention of 80.9% (0.5 C) after 200 cycles at a cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#160;V, along with 96.3% of capacity retention over 100 cycles at 4.5&#160;V. These findings may afford meaningful construction for the upcycling of commercial S&#8208;LCO into next&#8208;generation upmarket cathode materials through the elaborate surface and bulk modification design.

         <title>Artificial Phages with Biocatalytic Spikes for Synergistically Eradicating Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Biofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial phages (Ir@Co3O4 (S)) with biocatalytic spikes are constructed for synergistically eradicating antibiotic&#8208;resistant biofilms. Benefiting from the distinctive nanospiky structures and superior biofilm microenvironment&#8208;adaptive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation capacity, the spiky Ir@Co3O4 (S) can efficiently eradicate methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilms through a synergistic &#8220;penetrate and eradicate&#8221; strategy, thus expediting wound healing without notable inflammation and toxicity.









Abstract
Antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens have become a global public health crisis, especially biofilm&#8208;induced refractory infections. Efficient, safe, and biofilm microenvironment (BME)&#8208;adaptive therapeutic strategies are urgently demanded to combat antibiotic&#8208;resistant biofilms. Here, inspired by the fascinating biological structures and functions of phages, the de novo design of a spiky Ir@Co3O4 particle is proposed to serve as an artificial phage for synergistically eradicating antibiotic&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. Benefiting from the abundant nanospikes and highly active Ir sites, the synthesized artificial phage can simultaneously achieve efficient biofilm accumulation, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) penetration, and superior BME&#8208;adaptive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, thus facilitating the in situ ROS delivery and enhancing the biofilm eradication. Moreover, metabolomics found that the artificial phage obstructs the bacterial attachment to EPS, disrupts the maintenance of the BME, and fosters the dispersion and eradication of biofilms by down&#8208;regulating the associated genes for the biosynthesis and preservation of both intra&#8208; and extracellular environments. The in vivo results demonstrate that the artificial phage can treat the biofilm&#8208;induced recalcitrant infected wounds equivalent to vancomycin. It is suggested that the design of this spiky artificial phage with synergistic &#8220;penetrate and eradicate&#8221; capability to treat antibiotic&#8208;resistant biofilms offers a new pathway for bionic and nonantibiotic disinfection.

         <title>Dynamic Cleavage&#8208;Remodeling of Covalent Organic Networks into Multidimensional Superstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of covalent organic network&#8208;based superstructures, including 0D hollow supraparticles and 2D films is shown. Based on the thermal cleavage&#8208;remodeling strategy, the reversible and controlled preparation of superstructures with multiple morphologies and species is realized and successfully demonstrates the structural excellence of the multilayered superstructures through the study of the mass transfer kinetics of iodine.








Abstract
Superstructures with complex hierarchical spatial configurations exhibit broader structural depth than single hierarchical structures and the associated broader application prospects. However, current preparation methods are greatly constrained by cumbersome steps and harsh conditions. Here, for the first time, a concise and efficient thermally responsive dynamic synthesis strategy for the preparation of multidimensional complex superstructures within soluble covalent organic networks (SCONs) with tunable morphology from 0D hollow supraparticles to 2D films is presented. Mechanism study reveals the thermally responsive dynamic &#8220;cleavage&#8208;remodeling&#8221; characteristics of SCONs, synthesized based on the unique bilayer structure of (2.2)paracyclophane, and the temperature control facilitates the process from reversible solubility to reorganization and construction of superstructures. Specifically, during the process, the oil&#8211;water&#8208;emulsion two&#8208;phase interface can be generated through droplet jetting, leading to the preparation of 0D hollow supraparticles and other bowl&#8208;like complex superstructures with high yield. Additionally, by modulating the volatility and solubility of exogenous solvents, defect&#8208;free 2D films are prepared relying on an air&#8211;liquid interface. Expanded experiments further confirm the generalizability and scalability of the proposed dynamic &#8220;cleavage&#8208;remodeling&#8221; strategy. Research on the enrichment mechanism of guest iodine highlights the superior kinetic mass transfer performance of superstructural products compared to single&#8208;hierarchical materials.

         <title>3D Laser Writing of Low&#8208;Loss Cross&#8208;Section&#8208;Variable Type&#8208;I Optical Waveguide Passive/Active Integrated Devices in Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal femtosecond laser direct&#8208;writing technique to fabricate low&#8208;loss high&#8208;gain Type&#8208;I optical waveguide in single crystals, enables precise control of waveguide shape, size, mode&#8208;field, and refractive index distribution, with high spatial resolution of &gt;700&#160;nm and positive refractive index variation of &gt;10&#8722;2, introducing new degrees of freedom to design and fabricate passive/active optical waveguide devices.








Abstract
Optical waveguides fabricated in single crystals offer crucial passive/active optical components for photonic integrated circuits. Single crystals possess inherent advantages over their amorphous counterpart, such as lower optical losses in visible&#8208;to&#8208;mid&#8208;infrared band, larger peak emission cross&#8208;section, higher doping concentration. However, the writing of Type&#8208;I positive refractive index modified waveguides in single crystals using femtosecond laser technology presents significant challenges. Herein, this work introduces a novel femtosecond laser direct writing technique that combines slit&#8208;shaping with an immersion oil objective to fabricate low&#8208;loss Type&#8208;I waveguides in single crystals. This approach allows for precise control of waveguide shape, size, mode&#8208;field, and refractive index distribution, with a spatial resolution as high as 700&#160;nm and a high positive refractive index variation on the order of 10&#8722;2, introducing new degrees of freedom to design and fabricate passive/active optical waveguide devices. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, this work successfully produces a 7&#160;mm&#8208;long circular&#8208;shaped gain waveguide (&#8776;10&#160;&#181;m in diameter) in an Er3+&#8208;doped YAG single crystal, exhibiting a propagation loss as low as 0.23&#160;dB&#160;cm&#8722;1, a net gain of &#8776;3&#160;dB and a polarization&#8208;insensitive character. The newly&#8208;developed technique is theoretically applicable to arbitrary single crystals, holding promising potential for various applications in integrated optics, optical communication, and photonic quantum circuits.

         <title>Active Fabrics With Controllable Stiffness for Robotic Assistive Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the biological protective organisms combining hard and soft phases, active fabrics consisting of architectured rigid tiles interconnected with flexible actuated fibers are developed. They achieve rapid transitions between soft compliant configurations and rigid states conformable to the body (&gt;350 times stiffness change). Applications including exosuits for tremor suppression, lifting assistance, and impact&#8208;mitigating body armors are presented.








Abstract
Assistive interfaces enable collaborative interactions between humans and robots. In contrast to traditional rigid devices, conformable fabrics with tunable mechanical properties have emerged as compelling alternatives. However, existing assistive fabrics actuated by fluidic or thermal stimuli struggle to adapt to complex body contours and are hindered by challenges such as large volumes after actuation and slow response rates. To overcome these limitations, inspiration is drawn from biological protective organisms combining hard and soft phases, and active assistive fabrics consisting of architectured rigid tiles interconnected with flexible actuated fibers are proposed. Through programmable tessellation of target body shapes into architectured tiles and controlling their interactions by the actuated fibers, the active fabrics can rapidly transition between soft compliant configurations and rigid states conformable to the body (&gt;350 times stiffness change) while minimizing the device volume after actuation. The versatility of these active fabrics is demonstrated as exosuits for tremor suppression and lifting assistance,&#160;as body armors for impact mitigation, and integration with&#160;electrothermal actuators for smart actuation with convenient folding capabilities. This work offers a practical framework for designing customizable active fabrics with shape adaptivity and controllable stiffness, suitable for applications in wearable exosuits, haptic devices, and medical rehabilitation systems.

         <title>Self&#8208;Evolving Hierarchical Hydrogel Fibers with Circadian Rhythms and Memory Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical hydrogel fibers spontaneously form through in situ hierarchy evolution, resulting in a hierarchical structure of interface fusion. Water transport occurs in the angstrom&#8208;scale channels within the fibers by direct Coulomb knock&#8208;on, similar to Newton's cradle, which serves as a master clock controlling the multi&#8208;response behaviors of the fibers.








Abstract
The fusion of hierarchical tissues at interfaces, incorporating ultrafast selective transport channels, enables efficient matter exchange and energy transfer across multiscale structures in living organisms. However, achieving these characteristics simultaneously in an artificial multimaterial system is challenging. Here, this work presents a multimaterial hydrogel fiber with a hierarchical structure of interface fusion, which forms spontaneously through in situ hierarchy evolution induced by ionic cross&#8208;linking and molecular shear flow. Water transport occurs in the angstrom&#8208;scale confined slits created by aligned cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) by direct Coulomb knock&#8208;on, resembling Newton's cradle motion. The fusion of interfaces enables high&#8208;efficiency water transport across multiscale layers, combined with Newton's cradle&#8208;like collective water motion, creating a highly sensitive negative feedback loop within the fiber. These fibers exhibit integrated behaviors of time&#8208;space perception, short&#8208;term memory and adaptive changes in shape. Additionally, they demonstrate rhythm characteristics, changing periodically in a 24&#8208;h day&#8208;night cycle. Composed of natural building blocks, these hierarchical hydrogel fibers exhibit a memristor effect similar to that of an elementary neuron, making them promising for applications in seamless on&#8208;skin and implantable bioelectronics.

         <title>Tandem Fields Facilitating Directional Carrier Migration in Van der Waals Heterojunction for Efficient Overall Piezo&#8208;Synthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezo&#8208;catalytic dual&#8208;channel H2O2 synthesis system based on 2D/2D BIO/CN van der Waals heterojunction is successfully constructed. Under the joint promotion of an interfacial electric field and robust bulk polarization field, the electron transfer rapidly follows a Z&#8208;scheme route, realizing highly efficient 2e&#8722; WOR and 2e&#8722; ORR at space&#8208;separated active sites.








Abstract
Piezo&#8208;synthesis of H2O2 utilizing sustainable mechanical energy as well as earth&#8208;abundant water and oxygen is a green, cost&#8208;effective, and promising approach. However, achieving simultaneous two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR) and two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) faces huge challenges due to insufficient synergistic active sites and slow/messy carrier transfer. Herein, a novel 2D/2D van der Waals heterojunction consisting of BiOIO3 and carbon nitride (BIO/CN) is elaborately designed for highly efficient overall H2O2 piezo&#8208;synthesis. Theoretical/experimental results reveal that a Z&#8208;scheme electron transfer is formed and facilitated by the tandem interfacial electric field and the bulk piezo&#8208;polarization field. On this basis, the carriers are efficiently separated while the oxidation/reduction capacity is preserved, thus providing the strong driving force for the 2e&#8722; WOR and 2e&#8722; ORR on BIO and CN, respectively. Furthermore, the kinetic and thermodynamic processes of WOR and ORR for H2O2 synthesis improve remarkably. Therefore, BIO/CN exhibits an excellent H2O2 yield of 259.8&#160;&#181;M within 30&#160;min in pure water and air atmosphere (without any sacrificial agents and aeration). This study provides a new idea on strategically controlling electron transfer toward high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 piezo&#8208;synthesis and expands the avenue for developing effective environmental purification materials.

         <title>Extreme Fast Charging of Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by a Molten&#8208;Salt&#8208;Derived Nanocrystal Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces a preformed inorganic nanocrystal&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase on lithium metal surface by the developed molten salt immersion approach, which balances high surface modulus and fast Li+ diffusivity. It improves the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for long&#8208;term cycling of lithium metal batteries (up to 500 cycles) under service conditions that include high loadings (up to 3.0 mAh cm&#8722;2) and extreme fast charging rates (up to 6 C).








Abstract
The extreme fast charging performance of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with a long life is an important focus in the development of next&#8208;generation battery technologies. The friable solid electrolyte interphase and dendritic lithium growth are major problems. The formation of an inorganic nanocrystal&#8208;dominant interphase produced by preimmersing the Li in molten lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide that suppresses the overgrowth of the usual interphase is reported. Its high surface modulus combined with fast Li+ diffusivity enables a reversible dendrite&#8208;proof deposition under ultrahigh&#8208;rate conditions. It gives a record&#8208;breaking cumulative plating/stripping capacity of &gt;240&#160;000 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2@30 mAh cm&#8722;2 for a symmetric cell and an extreme fast charging performance at 6 C for 500 cycles for a Li||LiCoO2 full cell with a high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity, thus expanding the use of LMBs to high&#8208;loading and power&#8208;intensive scenarios. Its usability both in roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll production and in different electrolytes indicating the scalable and industrial potential of this process for high&#8208;performance LMBs.

         <title>Intercalation&#8208;Induced Localized Conversion Reaction in h&#8208;CuSe for Ultrafast&#8208;Rechargeable and Long&#8208;Cycling Sodium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the intercalation induced localized conversion reaction mechanism in the hexagonal CuSe under the guidance of theoretical calculation and in situ techniques. High rate performance and excellent cycling stability are achieved by forming a localized anchoring phase of Cu7Se4 and adjusting the near&#8208;edge coordination state of Cu sites to stabilize the sodium storage structure.









Abstract
Cathode materials of sodium&#8208;based batteries with high specific capacity and fast charge&#8211;discharge mode, as well as ultralong reversible cycles at wide applied temperatures, are essential for future development of advanced energy storage system. Developing transition metal selenides with intercalation features provides a new strategy for realizing the above cathode materials. Herein, this work reports a storage mechanism of sodium ion in hexagonal CuSe (h&#8208;CuSe) based on the density functional theory (DFT) guidance. This work reveals that the two&#8208;dimensional ion intercalation triggers localized redox reaction in the h&#8208;CuSe bulk phase, termed intercalation&#8208;induced localized conversion (ILC) mechanism, to stabilize the sodium storage structure by forming localized Cu7Se4 transition phase and adjusting the near&#8208;edge coordination state of the Cu sites to achieve high reversible capacity and ultra&#8208;long cycling life, while allowing rapid charge&#8211;discharge cycling over a wide temperature range.

         <title>Synergistic Machine Learning Accelerated Discovery of Nanoporous Inorganic Crystals as Non&#8208;Absorbable Oral Drugs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic machine learning accelerates the discovery of high&#8208;capacity, high&#8208;selectivity, and stable inorganic nanoporous crystals as non&#8208;absorbable oral drugs (NODs). NODs can remove unwanted molecules or ions from the gastrointestinal tract of the human body without directly entering the bloodstream. NH4&#8208;form merlinoite (NH4&#8208;MER) discovered by synergistic machine learning can prevent the Na+ release from ZS&#8208;9 in the treatment of hyperkalemia.








Abstract
Machine learning (ML) has taken drug discovery to new heights, where effective ML training requires vast quantities of high&#8208;quality experimental data as input. Non&#8208;absorbable oral drugs (NODs) have unique safety advantage for chronic diseases due to their zero systemic exposure, but their empirical discovery is still time&#8208;consuming and costly. Here, a synergistic ML method, integrating small data&#8208;driven multi&#8208;layer unsupervised learning, in silico quantum&#8208;mechanical computations, and minimal wet&#8208;lab experiments is devised to identify the finest NODs from massive inorganic materials to achieve multi&#8208;objective function (high selectivity, large capacity, and stability). Based on this method, a NH4&#8208;form nanoporous zeolite with merlinoite (MER) framework (NH4&#8208;MER) is discovered for the treatment of hyperkalemia. In three different animal models, NH4&#8208;MER shows a superior safety and efficacy profile in reducing blood K+ without Na+ release, which is an unmet clinical need in chronic kidney disease and Gordon's syndrome. This work provides a synergistic ML method to accelerate the discovery of NODs and other shape&#8208;selective materials.

         <title>Broadband Negative Photoconductive Response in Carbon Nanodots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The broadband response from the negative photoconductive carbon dots (CDs)&#160;are utilized to achieve the optoelectronic logic gates and optical imaging for the first time. The large specific surface area and abundant hydrophilic groups of the mcu&#8208;CDs endow abundant sites to naturally adsorb and desorb H2O molecules, contributing to the novel negative photoconductivity effect. 








Abstract
Due to the broadband response and low selectivity of external light, negative photoconductivity (NPC) effect holds great potential applications in photoelectric devices. Herein, different photoresponsive carbon nanodots (CDs) are prepared from diverse precursors and the broadband response from the NPC CDs are utilized to achieve the optoelectronic logic gates and optical imaging for the first time. In detail, the mcu&#8208;CDs which are prepared by the microwave&#8208;assisted polymerization of citric acid and urea possess the large specific surface area and abundant hydrophilic groups as sites for the adsorption of H2O molecules and thereby present a high conductivity in dark. Meanwhile, the low affinity of mcu&#8208;CDs to H2O molecules permits the light&#8208;induced desorption of H2O molecules by heat effect and thus endow the mcu&#8208;CDs with a low conductivity under illumination. The easy absorption and desorption of H2O molecules contribute to the extraordinary NPC of mcu&#8208;CDs. With the broadband NPC response in CDs, the optoelectronic logic gates and flexible optical imaging system are established, achieving the applications of &#8220;NOR&#8221; or &#8220;NAND&#8221; logic operations and high&#8208;quality optical images. These findings unveil the unique optoelectronic properties of CDs, and have the potential to advance the applications of CDs in optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Scribed Battery Electrodes for Ultrafast Zinc&#8208;Ion Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a simple, one&#8208;step laser&#8208;scribing synthesis approach to produce a vanadium&#8208;based cathode material for zinc&#8208;ion energy storage with high specific capacity, ultrafast charging, and cycling stability. The underlying mechanism of charge storage to be the co&#8208;insertion of zinc and hydronium ions with minimal lattice change upon cycling, which facilitates the observed gains in performance, is further revealed.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn batteries are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage but are plagued by the lack of high&#8208;performance cathode materials that enable high specific capacity, ultrafast charging, and outstanding cycling stability. Here, a laser&#8208;scribed nano&#8208;vanadium oxide (LNVO) cathode is designed that can simultaneously achieve these properties. The material stores charge through Faradaic redox reactions on/near the surface at fast rates owing to the small grain size of vanadium oxide and interpenetrating 3D graphene network, displaying a surface&#8208;controlled capacity contribution (90%&#8211;98%). Multiple characterization techniques unambiguously reveal that zinc and hydronium ions co&#8208;insert with minimal lattice change upon cycling. It is demonstrated that a high specific capacity of 553 mAh g&#8722;1 is achieved at 0.1 A g&#8722;1, and an impressive 264 mAh g&#8722;1 capacity is retained at 100 A g&#8722;1 within 10 s, showing excellent rate capability. The LNVO/Zn can also reach &gt;90% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at a high rate of 30 A g&#8722;1, as well as achieving both high energy (369 Wh kg&#8722;1) and power densities (56306 W kg&#8722;1). Moreover, the LNVO cathode retains its excellent cycling performance when integrated into quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells, further demonstrating mechanical stability and its potential for practical application in wearable and grid&#8208;scale applications.

&lt;p&gt;This work introduces a simple, one-step laser-scribing synthesis approach to produce a vanadium-based cathode material for zinc-ion energy storage with high specific capacity, ultrafast charging, and cycling stability. The underlying mechanism of charge storage to be the co-insertion of zinc and hydronium ions with minimal lattice change upon cycling, which facilitates the observed gains in performance, is further revealed.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous Zn batteries are promising for large-scale energy storage but are plagued by the lack of high-performance cathode materials that enable high specific capacity, ultrafast charging, and outstanding cycling stability. Here, a laser-scribed nano-vanadium oxide (LNVO) cathode is designed that can simultaneously achieve these properties. The material stores charge through Faradaic redox reactions on/near the surface at fast rates owing to the small grain size of vanadium oxide and interpenetrating 3D graphene network, displaying a surface-controlled capacity contribution (90%&#8211;98%). Multiple characterization techniques unambiguously reveal that zinc and hydronium ions co-insert with minimal lattice change upon cycling. It is demonstrated that a high specific capacity of 553 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved at 0.1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and an impressive 264 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; capacity is retained at 100 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; within 10 s, showing excellent rate capability. The LNVO/Zn can also reach &amp;gt;90% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at a high rate of 30 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as achieving both high energy (369 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and power densities (56306 W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Moreover, the LNVO cathode retains its excellent cycling performance when integrated into quasi-solid-state pouch cells, further demonstrating mechanical stability and its potential for practical application in wearable and grid-scale applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Black Ultrathin Single&#8208;Crystalline Flakes of CuVP2S6 and CuCrP2S6 for Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Black materials of CuVP2S6 and CuCrP2S6, with a narrow bandgap of &#8776;1.0&#160;eV, are developed as the new photocatalysts, which display high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) activity, far exceeding current layered metal phospho&#8211;sulfides and other materials. They even show&#160; near&#8208;infrared&#8208;driven PHE rates of 0.66 and 0.20&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, respectively.








Abstract
The development of new near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive photocatalysts is a fascinating and challenging approach to acquire high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) performance. Herein, near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive black CuVP2S6 and CuCrP2S6 flakes, as well as CuInP2S6 flakes, are designed and constructed for PHE. Atom&#8208;resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy images and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure evidence the formation of ultrathin single&#8208;crystalline sheet&#8208;like structure of CuVP2S6 and CuCrP2S6. The synthetic CuVP2S6 and CuCrP2S6, with a narrow bandgap of &#8776;1.0&#160;eV, shows the high light&#8208;absorption edge exceeding 1100&#160;nm. Moreover, through the femtosecond&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy, CuCrP2S6 displays the efficient charge transfer and long charge lifetime (18318.1&#160;ps), which is nearly 3 and 29 times longer than that of CuVP2S6 and CuInP2S6, respectively. In addition, CuCrP2S6, with the appropriate d&#8208;band and p&#8208;band, is thermodynamically favorable for the H+ adsorption and H2 desorption by contrast with CuVP2S6 and CuInP2S6. As a result, CuCrP2S6 exhibits high PHE rates of 9.12 and 0.66&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 under simulated sunlight and near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, respectively, far exceeding other layered metal phospho&#8211;sulfides. This work offers a distinctive perspective for the development of new near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive photocatalysts.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Synthesis of High&#8208;Loading Single Metallic Atom Catalysts by a Metal Coordination Route</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a novel and robust metal coordination route is proposed to synthesize single metallic atom catalysts. Such strategy can achieve double records of large&#8208;scale production (3.565 kg) and single metallic atom loading (16.03 mol%) at one batch. Moreover, the obtained catalysts show efficient photocatalytic activity toward CO2 reduction to formic acid.








Abstract
Single atom catalyst (SAC) is one of the most efficient and versatile catalysts with well&#8208;defined active sites. However, its facile and large&#8208;scale preparation, the prerequisite of industrial applications, has been very challenging. This dilemma originates&#160;from the Gibbs&#8211;Thomson effect, which renders it rather difficult to achieve high single atom loading (&lt; 3 mol%). Further, most synthesizing procedures are quite&#160;complex, resulting in significant mass loss and thus low yields. Herein, a novel metal coordination route is developed to address these issues simultaneously, which is realized owing to the rapid complexation between ligands (e.g., biuret) and metal ions in aqueous solutions and subsequent in situ polymerization of the formed complexes to yield SACs. The whole preparation process involves only one heating step operated in air without any special protecting atmospheres, showing general applicability for diverse transition metals. Take Cu SAC for an example, a record yield of up to 3.565&#160;kg in one pot and an ultrahigh metal loading 16.03 mol% on carbon nitride (Cu/CN) are approached. The as&#8208;prepared SACs are demonstrated to possess high activity, outstanding selectivity, and robust cyclicity for CO2 photoreduction to HCOOH. This research explores a robust route toward cost&#8208;effective, massive production of SACs for potential industrial applications.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Fabrication of Stable Silicon Anode in Air for Sulfide Solid State Batteries via Ionic&#8208;Electronic Dual Conductive Binder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon&#8208;based sulfide solid&#8208;state batteries have received extensive attention around the world due to their low cost and high energy density. In this work, an ionic&#8211;electronic dual conductive binder for the fabrication of robust silicon anode under ambient air conditions in the absence of high&#8208;cost and air&#8208;sensitive sulfide solid&#8208;state electrolyte for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries is reported.








Abstract
The construction of a continuous ionic/electronic pathway is critical for Si&#8208;based sulfide all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) with the advantages of high&#8208;energy density and high&#8208;cycle stability. However, a significant impediment arises from the parasitic reaction occurring between the ionic sulfide solid&#8208;state electrolyte and electronic carbon additive, posing a formidable challenge. Additionally, the fabrication of electrodes necessitates stringent operational conditions, further limiting practical applicability. Herein, an ionic&#8211;electronic dual conductive binder for the fabrication of robust silicon anode under ambient air conditions in the absence of high&#8208;cost and air&#8208;sensitive sulfide solid&#8208;state electrolyte for ASSBs is reported. This binder incorporates in situ reduced silver nanoparticles into a high&#8208;strength polymer rich in ether bonds, establishing a conductive pathway for lithium ions and electrons. With the binder&#8208;composited Si anode, the half&#8208;cell exhibits a remarkable capacity of 1906.9&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and stable cycling for 500 cycles at a current density of 2&#160;C (4.4&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) under a low stack pressure of 5&#160;MPa. The full cell using Ni0.9Co0.075Mn0.025O2 (NCM90) exhibits a remark cycling stability within 2000 cycles at 5&#160;C (8&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2). This work presents an inspired design of functional binders for large&#8208;scale manufacture and mild operation in a low&#8208;cost way for Si anodes in ASSBs.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Ultralow Voltage Organic Transistors With Sharp Switching for Adaptive Visual Perception</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired synaptic transistor based on organic crystal&#8211;electret stacks is developed, which presents visual adaption with highly localized modulation and over 98.2% recognition accuracy. By manipulating the charge dynamics of the trapping centers, organic transistors can operate below 1&#160;V with record high on/off ratio close to 108 and sharp switching of a subthreshold swing of 59.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1.








Abstract
Neuromorphic visual systems can emulate biological retinal systems to perceive visual information under different levels of illumination, making them have considerable potential for future intelligent vehicles and vision automation. However, the complex circuits and high operating voltages of conventional artificial vision systems present great challenges for device integration and power consumption. Here, bioinspired synaptic transistors based on organic single crystal phototransistors are reported, which exhibit excitation and inhibition synaptic plasticity with time&#8208;varying. By manipulating the charge dynamics of the trapping centers of organic crystal&#8211;electret vertical stacks, organic transistors can operate below 1&#160;V with record high on/off ratios close to 108 and sharp switching with a subthreshold swing of 59.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1. Moreover, the approach offers visual adaptation with highly localized modulation and over 98.2% recognition accuracy under different illumination levels. These bioinspired visual adaptation transistors offer great potential for simplifying the circuitry of artificial vision systems and will contribute to the development of machine vision applications.

         <title>3D Nanoprinting of Heterogeneous Metal Oxides with High Shape Fidelity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a 3D nanoprinting method for various metal oxides with high shape fidelity. This method enables 3D nanoprinting and heterogeneous integration of metal oxides with water&#8208;soluble precursor salts, addressing issues of limited material applicability, serious&#160;shape distortion, and challenges of heterogeneous integration in the field of metal oxide 3D microfabrication.








Abstract
3D nanoprinting can significantly enhance the performance of sensors, batteries, optoelectronic/microelectronic devices, etc. However, current 3D nanoprinting methods for metal oxides are suffering from three key issues including limited material applicability, serious shape distortion, and the difficulty of heterogeneous integration. This paper discovers a mechanism in which imidazole and acrylic acid synergistically coordinate with metal ions in water. Using the mechanism, this work develops a series of metal ion synergistic coordination water&#8208;soluble (MISCWS) resins for 3D nanoprinting of various metal oxides, including MnO2, Cr2O3, Co3O4, and ZnO, as well as heterogeneous structures of MnO2/NiO, Cr2O3/Al2O3, and ZnO/MgO. Besides, the synergistic coordination effect results in a 2.54&#8208;fold increase in inorganic mass fraction within the polymer, compared with previous works, which effectively mitigates the shape distortion of metal oxide microstructures. Based on this method, this work also demonstrates a 3D ZnO microsensor with a high sensitivity (1.113 million at 200&#160;ppm NO2), surpassing the conventional 2D ZnO sensors by tenfold. The method yields high&#8208;fidelity 3D structures of heterogeneous metal oxides with nanoscale resolution, paving the way for applications such as sensing, micro&#8208;optics, energy storage, and microsystems.

         <title>Interface Design beyond Epitaxy: Oxide Heterostructures Comprising Symmetry&#8208;Forbidden Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work showcases a breakthrough in fabricating atomically sharp interfaces between 3D oxide materials with completely different crystal lattice symmetries. These interfaces show a hitherto unknown interfacial reconstruction dictated by the moir&#233; patterns provided by abutting crystals of different symmetries. This novel category of interfaces between 3D materials vastly expands the space of interfaces available for research and applications.








Abstract
Epitaxial growth of thin&#8208;film heterostructures is generally considered the most successful procedure to obtain interfaces of excellent structural and electronic quality between 3D materials. However, these interfaces can only join material systems with crystal lattices of matching symmetries and lattice constants. This article presents a novel category of interfaces, the fabrication of which is membrane&#8208;based and does not require epitaxial growth. These interfaces therefore overcome the limitations imposed by epitaxy. Leveraging the additional degrees of freedom gained, atomically clean interfaces are demonstrated between threefold symmetric sapphire and fourfold symmetric SrTiO3. Atomic&#8208;resolution imaging reveals structurally well&#8208;defined interfaces with a novel moir&#233;&#8208;type reconstruction.

         <dc:description>
An artificial intelligence agent for enhancing organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) performance by combining generative pre&#8208;trained transformer 4 (GPT&#8208;4) with advanced machine learning algorithms is presented. It efficiently extracts OFET experimental data from extensive literature and gives intelligent suggestions for OFET fabrication. This work showcases the application of large language models in organic optoelectronics, enhancing the development process in this field.









Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) have attracted widespread attention recently, however, their application in specialized scientific fields still requires deep adaptation. Here, an artificial intelligence (AI) agent for organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) is designed by integrating the generative pre&#8208;trained transformer 4 (GPT&#8208;4)&#160;model with well&#8208;trained machine learning (ML) algorithms. It can efficiently extract the experimental parameters of OFETs from scientific literature and reshape them into a structured database, achieving precision and recall rates both exceeding 92%. Combined with well&#8208;trained ML models, this AI agent can further provide targeted guidance and suggestions for device design. With prompt engineering and human&#8208;in&#8208;loop strategies, the agent extracts sufficient information of 709 OFETs from 277 research articles across different publishers and gathers them into a standardized database containing more than 10&#160;000 device parameters. Using this database, a ML model based on Extreme Gradient Boosting is trained for device performance judgment. Combined with the interpretation of the high&#8208;precision model, the agent has provided a feasible optimization scheme that has tripled the charge transport properties of 2,6&#8208;diphenyldithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene OFETs. This work is an effective practice of LLMs in the field of organic optoelectronic devices and expands the research paradigm of organic optoelectronic materials and devices.

         <title>Bioinspired Adaptive Microdrugs Enhance the Chemotherapy of Malignant Glioma: Beyond Their Nanodrugs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired adaptive microdrugs can efficiently cross blood&#8211;brain barrier/blood&#8211;brain tumor barrier when endowed with good adaptive deformation capacity. Different from the traditional concept, these adaptive microdrugs are more efficient than their nanodrugs in bringing drugs into the glioblastoma tissues, allowing efficient accumulation, deep penetration, and cellular internalization, thus greatly enhancing the antitumor efficacy of malignant glioma.








Abstract
Solid nanoparticle&#8208;mediated drug delivery systems are usually confined to nanoscale due to the enhanced permeability and retention effect. However, they remain a great challenge for malignant glioma chemotherapy because of poor drug delivery efficiency and insufficient tumor penetration resulting from the blood&#8211;brain barrier/blood&#8211;brain tumor barrier (BBB/BBTB). Inspired by biological microparticles (e.g., cells) with excellent adaptive deformation, it is demonstrated that the adaptive microdrugs (even up to 3.0&#160;&#181;m in size) are more efficient than their nanodrugs (less than 200&#160;nm in size) to cross BBB/BBTB and penetrate into tumor tissues, achieving highly efficient chemotherapy of malignant glioma. The distinct delivery of the adaptive microdrugs is mainly attributed to the enhanced interfacial binding and endocytosis via adaptive deformation. As expected, the obtained adaptive microdrugs exhibit enhanced accumulation, deep penetration, and cellular internalization into tumor tissues in comparison with nanodrugs, significantly improving the survival rate of glioblastoma mice. It is believed that the bioinspired adaptive microdrugs enable them to efficiently cross physiological barriers and deeply penetrate tumor tissues for drug delivery, providing an avenue for the treatment of solid tumors.

&lt;p&gt;Bioinspired adaptive microdrugs can efficiently cross blood&#8211;brain barrier/blood&#8211;brain tumor barrier when endowed with good adaptive deformation capacity. Different from the traditional concept, these adaptive microdrugs are more efficient than their nanodrugs in bringing drugs into the glioblastoma tissues, allowing efficient accumulation, deep penetration, and cellular internalization, thus greatly enhancing the antitumor efficacy of malignant glioma.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery systems are usually confined to nanoscale due to the enhanced permeability and retention effect. However, they remain a great challenge for malignant glioma chemotherapy because of poor drug delivery efficiency and insufficient tumor penetration resulting from the blood&#8211;brain barrier/blood&#8211;brain tumor barrier (BBB/BBTB). Inspired by biological microparticles (e.g., cells) with excellent adaptive deformation, it is demonstrated that the adaptive microdrugs (even up to 3.0&#160;&#181;m in size) are more efficient than their nanodrugs (less than 200&#160;nm in size) to cross BBB/BBTB and penetrate into tumor tissues, achieving highly efficient chemotherapy of malignant glioma. The distinct delivery of the adaptive microdrugs is mainly attributed to the enhanced interfacial binding and endocytosis via adaptive deformation. As expected, the obtained adaptive microdrugs exhibit enhanced accumulation, deep penetration, and cellular internalization into tumor tissues in comparison with nanodrugs, significantly improving the survival rate of glioblastoma mice. It is believed that the bioinspired adaptive microdrugs enable them to efficiently cross physiological barriers and deeply penetrate tumor tissues for drug delivery, providing an avenue for the treatment of solid tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Transition Metal Phosphorus Trichalcogenides for Rapid Sodium Ion Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The entropy&#8208;induced strain soliton boundaries (SSBs) and aperiodic stacking together with corresponding electric field distribution within FeMnNiVZnPS3 are atomically resolved. The correlation of such unique atomic/electronic structures and the sodium ion diffusion dynamics inside high&#8208;entropy FeMnNiVZnPS3 is established. These insights are expected to be extended to a wide range of high&#8208;entropy systems.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy strategies are regarded as a powerful means to enhance performance in energy storage fields. The improved properties are invariably ascribed to entropy stabilization or synergistic cocktail effect. Therefore, the manifested properties in such multicomponent materials are usually unpredictable. Elucidating the precise correlations between atomic structures and properties remains a challenge in high&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs). Herein, atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy annular dark field (STEM&#8208;ADF) imaging and four dimensions (4D)&#8208;STEM are combined to directly visualize atomic&#8208;scale structural and electric information in high&#8208;entropy FeMnNiVZnPS3. Aperiodic stacking is found in FeMnNiVZnPS3 accompanied by high&#8208;density strain soliton boundaries (SSBs). Theoretical calculation suggests that the formation of such structures is attributed to the imbalanced stress of distinct metal&#8208;sulfur bonds in FeMnNiVZnPS3. Interestingly, the electric field concentrates along the two sides of SSBs and gradually diminishes toward the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) plane to generate a unique electric field gradient, strongly promoting the ion&#8208;diffusion rate. Accordingly, high&#8208;entropy FeMnNiVZnPS3 demonstrates superior ion&#8208;diffusion coefficients of 10&#8722;9.7&#8208;10&#8722;8.3 cm2 s&#8722;1 and high&#8208;rate performance (311.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 30 A g&#8722;1). This work provides an alternative way for the atomic&#8208;scale understanding and design of sophisticated HEMs, paving the way for property engineering in multi&#8208;component materials.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Solvating Electrolyte Enables Mechanically Stable and Inorganic&#8208;Rich Cathode Electrolyte Interphase for High&#8208;Performing Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries are promising alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries but limited by the sophisticated interfacial chemistry at the cathode/electrolyte interface. Herein, an electrolyte design strategy is proposed with the optimized coordination environment to form an ultrathin and mechanically stable cathode electrolyte interphase, which is beneficial to the electrochemical performance of potassium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI) is crucial for the reversibility of rechargeable batteries, yet receives less attention compared to solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI). The prevalent weakly&#8208;solvating electrolyte is usually proposed from the standing point of obtaining robust SEI, however, the resultant weak ion&#8208;solvent interaction gives rise to excessive free solvents and forms thick CEI with high kinetic barriers, which is disadvantageous for interfacial stability at the high working voltage. Herein, a highly&#8208;solvating electrolyte is reported to immobilize free solvents by generating stable ternary complexes and facilitate the growth of homogeneous and ultrathin CEI to boost the electrochemical performances of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). Through time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, It is revealed that the deliberately coordinated complexes are the key to forming mechanically stable and inorganic&#8208;rich CEI with superior diffusion kinetics for high&#8208;performing PIBs. Coupling with a K0.5MnO2 cathode and a soft carbon (SC) anode, a high energy density (202.3&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1) is achieved with an exceptional cycle lifespan (92.5% capacity retention after 500 cycles) in a SC||K0.5MnO2 full cell, setting new performance benchmarks for PIBs.

         <title>Targeted SERS Imaging and Intraoperative Real&#8208;Time Elimination of Microscopic Tumors for Improved Breast&#8208;Conserving Surgery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) surgical strategy is reported for guiding the breast&#8208;conserving surgery and intraoperative real&#8208;time elimination of microscopic tumor foci in a HER2+ breast tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model. This strategy is demonstrated with remarkable outcome improvement of the breast&#8208;conserving surgery without local recurrence and delivers a 100% tumor&#8208;free survival after the treatment with the SERS surgical strategy.








Abstract
Breast&#8208;conserving surgery is the favorable option for breast cancer patients owing to its advantages of less aggressiveness and better cosmetic outcomes over mastectomy. However, it often suffers from postsurgical lethal recurrence due to the incomplete removal of microscopic tumors. Here, a surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) surgical strategy is reported for precise delineation of tumor margins and intraoperative real&#8208;time elimination of microscopic tumor foci, which is capable of complete surgical removal of breast tumors and significantly improve the outcomes of breast&#8208;conserving surgery without local tumor recurrence. The technique is chiefly based on the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)&#8208;targeting SERS probes with integrated multifunctionalities of ultrahigh sensitive detection, significant HER2 expression suppression, cell proliferation inhibition, and superior photothermal ablation. In a HER2+ breast tumor mouse model, the remarkable capability of the SERS surgical strategy for complete removal of HER2+ breast tumors through SERS&#8208;guided surgical resection and intraoperative real&#8208;time photothermal elimination is demonstrated. The results show complete eradiation of HER2+ breast tumors without local recurrence, consequently delivering a 100% tumor&#8208;free survival. Expectedly, this SERS surgical strategy holds great promise for clinical treatment of HER2+ breast cancer with improved patients&#8217; survival.

         <title>Precisely Controlling Polymer Acceptors with Weak Intramolecular Charge Transfer Effect and Superior Coplanarity for Efficient Indoor All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with over 27% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a successful design strategy of medium&#8208;bandgap polymer acceptor, PYFO&#8208;V, is presented for indoor all&#8208;polymer solar cell operation. By the synergy of alkoxy chains and vinylene spacers onto Y&#8208;series polymer acceptors, PYFO&#8208;V exhibits blue&#8208;shifted absorption and upshifted energy levels. The binary devices realize an impressive efficiency of 27.1% under indoor illumination with great photostability, beneficial for the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things application.









Abstract
Indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) are garnering increasing attention from both the academic and industrial communities due to the pressing demand of the ecosystem of Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things. All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs), emerging as a sub&#8208;type of organic photovoltaics, with the merits of great film&#8208;forming properties, remarkable morphological and light stability, hold great promise to simultaneously achieve high efficiency and long&#8208;term operation in IPV's application. However, the dearth of polymer acceptors with medium&#8208;bandgap has impeded the rapid development of indoor all&#8208;PSCs. Herein, a highly efficient medium&#8208;bandgap polymer acceptor (PYFO&#8208;V) is reported through the synergistic effects of side chain engineering and linkage modulation and applied for indoor all&#8208;PSCs operation. As a result, the PM6:PYFO&#8208;V&#8208;based indoor all&#8208;PSC yields the highest efficiency of 27.1% under LED light condition, marking the highest value for reported binary indoor all&#8208;PSCs to date. More importantly, the blade&#8208;coated devices using non&#8208;halogenated solvent (o&#8208;xylene) maintain an efficiency of over 23%, demonstrating the potential for industry&#8208;scale fabrication. This work not only highlights the importance of fine&#8208;tuning intramolecular charge transfer effect and intrachain coplanarity in developing high&#8208;performance medium&#8208;bandgap polymer acceptors but also provides a highly efficient strategy for indoor all&#8208;PSC application.

All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), emerging as a sub-type of organic photovoltaics, with the merits of great film-forming properties, remarkable morphological and light stability, hold great promise to simultaneously achieve high efficiency and long-term operation in IPV's application. However, the dearth of polymer acceptors with medium-bandgap has impeded the rapid development of indoor all-PSCs. Herein, a highly efficient medium-bandgap polymer acceptor (PYFO-V) is reported through the synergistic effects of side chain engineering and linkage modulation and applied for indoor all-PSCs operation. As a result, the PM6:PYFO-V-based indoor all-PSC yields the highest efficiency of 27.1% under LED light condition, marking the highest value for reported binary indoor all-PSCs to date. More importantly, the blade-coated devices using non-halogenated solvent (&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-xylene) maintain an efficiency of over 23%, demonstrating the potential for industry-scale fabrication. This work not only highlights the importance of fine-tuning intramolecular charge transfer effect and intrachain coplanarity in developing high-performance medium-bandgap polymer acceptors but also provides a highly efficient strategy for indoor all-PSC application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exciton Dissociation into Charge Carriers in Porphyrinic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Light&#8208;Assisted Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>

Porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks with regulated metal&#8208;oxygen clusters are reported for light&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries. The enhanced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal cluster charge transfer drives exciton dissociation into charge carriers and ensures reduced singlet oxygen and prolonged carrier lifetime for Li&#8208;O2 batteries with low overvoltages and stable cycling.








Abstract
Light&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries exhibit a high round&#8208;trip efficiency attributable to the assistance of light&#8208;generated electrons and holes in oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Nonetheless, the excitonic effect arising from Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes impedes carrier separation, thus hindering efficient utilization of photo&#8208;energy. Herein, porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks with (Fe2Ni)O(COO)6 clusters are used as photocathodes to accelerate exciton dissociation into charge carriers for light&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries. The coupling of Ni 3d and Fe 3d orbitals boosts ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal cluster charge transfer, and hence drives exciton dissociation and activates O2 for superoxide (&#8226;O2&#8722;) radicals, rather than singlet oxygen (1O2) under photoexcitation. These enable the light&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries with a low total overvoltage of 0.28&#160;V and round&#8208;trip efficiency of 92% under light irradiation of 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This work highlights the excitonic effect in photoelectrochemical processes and provides insights into photocathode design for light&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries.

         <title>Inhibiting the Jahn&#8211;Teller Effect of Manganese Hexacyanoferrate via Ni and Cu Codoping for Advanced Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>

The nickel&#8208; and copper&#8208;doped manganese&#8208;based Prussian blue cathode undergoes a reversible phase transition from monoclinic to cubic phase during the charge and discharge process, which exhibits excellent cycling stability as cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Manganese (Mn)&#8208;based Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are of great interest as a prospective cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high redox potential, easy synthesis, and low cost. However, the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect and low electrical conductivity of Mn&#8208;based PBA cause poor structure stability and unsatisfactory performance during the cycling. Herein, a novel nickel&#8208; and copper&#8208;codoped K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode is developed via a simple coprecipitation strategy. The doping elements improve the electrical conductivity of Mn&#8208;based PBA by reducing the bandgap, as well as suppress the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect by stabilizing the framework, as verified by the density functional theory calculations. Simultaneously, the substitution of sodium with potassium in the lattice is beneficial for filling vacancies in the PBA framework, leading to higher average operating voltages and superior structural stability. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared Mn&#8208;based cathode exhibits excellent reversible capacity (116.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.01 A g&#8722;1) and superior cycling stability (81.8% capacity retention over 500 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1). This work provides a profitable doping strategy to inhibit the Jahn&#8211;Teller structural deformation for designing stable cathode material of SIBs.

         <title>Aqueous Electrolyte With Weak Hydrogen Bonds for Four&#8208;Electron Zinc&#8211;Iodine Battery Operates in a Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first four&#8208;electron zinc&#8211;iodine batteries with wide&#8208;temperature range (&#8722;40&#8201;&#160;&#176;C to 40&#160;&#8201;&#176;C) are successfully fabricated using polyethylene glycol (PEG 200) as a co&#8208;solvent in 2 m ZnCl2 aqueous solution. The hybrid electrolyte substantially reduces water activity to restrain the I+ hydrolysis, facilitating I&#8722;/I2/I+ redox kinetics, mitigating I3&#8722; formation, and smoothening Zn deposition.








Abstract
In the pursuit of high&#8208;performance energy storage systems, four&#8208;electron zinc&#8211;iodine aqueous batteries (4eZIBs) with successive I&#8722;/I2/I+ redox couples are appealing for their potential to deliver high energy density and resource abundance. However, susceptibility of positive valence I+ to hydrolysis and instability of Zn plating/stripping in conventional aqueous electrolyte pose significant challenges. In response, polyethylene glycol (PEG 200) is introduced as co&#8208;solvent in 2 m ZnCl2 aqueous solution to design a wide temperature electrolyte. Through a comprehensive investigation combining spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical simulations, it is elucidated that PEG disrupts the intrinsic strong H&#8208;bonds of water by global weak PEG&#8211;H2O interaction, which strengthens the O&#9472;H covalent bond of water and intensifies the coordination with Zn2+. This synergistic effect substantially reduces water activity to restrain the I+ hydrolysis, facilitating I&#8722;/I2/I+ redox kinetics, mitigating I3&#8722; formation and smoothening Zn deposition. The 4eZIBs in the optimized hybrid electrolyte not only deliver superior cyclability with a low fading rate of 0.0009% per cycle over 20&#160;000 cycles and a close&#8208;to&#8208;unit coulombic efficiency but also exhibit stable performance in a wide temperature range from 40&#160;&#176;C to &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. This study offers valuable insights into the rational design of electrolytes for 4eZIBs.

         <title>Mechanochemically Robust LiCoO2 with Ultrahigh Capacity and Prolonged Cyclability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance LCO&#160;cathode is developed with a gradient disordering structure design, enabling it to reach the capacity limit (up to 93% of Li utilization) while maintaining high cyclability and rate capability. Comprehensive analysis reveals this innovative structure fundamentally addresses the anisotropic lattice strain issue and exhibits remarkable fatigue resistance, even under harsh operating voltages.








Abstract
Pushing intercalation&#8208;type cathode materials to their theoretical capacity often suffers from fragile Li&#8208;deficient frameworks and severe lattice strain, leading to mechanical failure issues within the crystal structure and fast capacity fading. This is particularly pronounced in layered oxide cathodes because the intrinsic nature of their structures is susceptible to structural degradation with excessive Li extraction, which remains unsolved yet despite attempts involving elemental doping and surface coating strategies. Herein, a mechanochemical strengthening strategy is developed through a gradient disordering structure to address these challenges and push the LiCoO2 (LCO) layered cathode approaching the capacity limit (256&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, up to 93% of Li utilization). This innovative approach also demonstrates exceptional cyclability and rate capability, as validated in practical Ah&#8208;level pouch full cells, surpassing the current performance benchmarks. Comprehensive characterizations with multiscale X&#8208;ray, electron diffraction, and imaging techniques unveil that the gradient disordering structure notably diminishes the anisotropic lattice strain and exhibits high fatigue resistance, even under extreme delithiation states and harsh operating voltages. Consequently, this designed LCO cathode impedes the growth and propagation of particle cracks, and mitigates irreversible phase transitions. This work sheds light on promising directions toward next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery materials through structural chemistry design.

Comprehensive analysis reveals this innovative structure fundamentally addresses the anisotropic lattice strain issue and exhibits remarkable fatigue resistance, even under harsh operating voltages.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pushing intercalation-type cathode materials to their theoretical capacity often suffers from fragile Li-deficient frameworks and severe lattice strain, leading to mechanical failure issues within the crystal structure and fast capacity fading. This is particularly pronounced in layered oxide cathodes because the intrinsic nature of their structures is susceptible to structural degradation with excessive Li extraction, which remains unsolved yet despite attempts involving elemental doping and surface coating strategies. Herein, a mechanochemical strengthening strategy is developed through a gradient disordering structure to address these challenges and push the LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (LCO) layered cathode approaching the capacity limit (256&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, up to 93% of Li utilization). This innovative approach also demonstrates exceptional cyclability and rate capability, as validated in practical Ah-level pouch full cells, surpassing the current performance benchmarks. Comprehensive characterizations with multiscale X-ray, electron diffraction, and imaging techniques unveil that the gradient disordering structure notably diminishes the anisotropic lattice strain and exhibits high fatigue resistance, even under extreme delithiation states and harsh operating voltages. Consequently, this designed LCO cathode impedes the growth and propagation of particle cracks, and mitigates irreversible phase transitions. This work sheds light on promising directions toward next-generation high-energy-density battery materials through structural chemistry design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precisely Constructing Orbital&#8208;Coupled Fe&#9472;Co Dual&#8208;atom Sites for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Efficiency Zn&#8211;Air/Iodide Hybrid Batteries</title>

The iodide/iodate redox and precisely engineered Fe&#8211;Co dual&#8208;atom catalyst (FeCo&#8208;DACs) are introduced in Zn&#8211;air batteries to solve the high charging voltages and low energy efficiency. The precisely constructed FeCo&#8208;DACs with strongly coupled d&#8208;orbitals exhibit excellent catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction/evolution reaction and iodide/iodate redox by mitigating overly strong adsorption of intermediates at the active sites.








Abstract
Rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) are promising for energy storage and conversion. However, the high charging voltage and low energy efficiency hinder their commercialization. Herein, these challenges are addressed by employing precisely constructed multifunctional Fe&#8211;Co diatomic site catalysts (FeCo&#8208;DACs) and integrating iodide/iodate redox into ZABs to create Zinc&#8211;air/iodide hybrid batteries (ZAIHBs) with highly efficient multifunctional catalyst. The strong coupling between the 3d orbitals of Fe and Co weakens the excessively strong binding strength between active sites and intermediates, enhancing the catalytic activities for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction and iodide/iodate redox. Consequently, FeCo&#8208;DACs exhibit outstanding bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity with a small potential gap (&#916;E&#160;=&#160;0.66&#160;V) and outstanding stability. Moreover, an outstanding catalytic performance toward iodide/iodate redox is obtained. Therefore, FeCo&#8208;DAC&#8208;based ZAIHBs exhibit high energy efficiency of up to 75% at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and excellent cycling stability (72% after 500&#160;h). This research offers critical insights into the rational design of DACs and paves the way for high&#8208;energy efficiency energy storage devices.

         <title>A Thermo&#8208;Responsive MOFs for X&#8208;Ray Scintillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy toward designing thermo&#8208;responsive scintillators based on lanthanide metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) is developed through integrating various radio&#8208;luminescent functional building units and utilizing the energy transfer reasonably. The resulting ratiometric X&#8208;ray excited luminescent thermometer with the self&#8208;calibration function, high sensitivity, excellent luminescence stability, and visible temperature response, is reported for the first time.








Abstract
Thermo&#8208;responsive smart materials have aroused extensive interest due to the particular significance of temperature sensing. Although various photoluminescent materials are explored in thermal detection, it is not applicable enough in X&#8208;ray radiation environment where the accuracy and reliability will be influenced. Here, a strategy is proposed by introducing the concept of radio&#8208;luminescent functional building units (RBUs) to construct thermo&#8208;responsive lanthanide metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) scintillators for self&#8208;calibrating thermometry. The rational designs of RBUs (including organic ligand and Tb3+/Eu3+) with appropriate energy levels lead to high&#8208;performance radio&#8208;luminescence. Ln&#8208;MOFs scintillators exhibit perfect linear response to X&#8208;ray, presenting low dose rate detection limit (min &#8776;156.1 nGyairs&#8208;1). Self&#8208;calibrating detection based on ratiometric XEL intensities is achieved with good absolute and relative sensitivities of 6.74 and 8.1%K&#8208;1, respectively. High relative light yield (max &#8776;39000 photons MeV&#8722;1), imaging spatial resolution (max &#8776;18 lp&#160;mm&#8208;1), irradiation stability (intensity &#8776;100% at 368 K in total dose up to 215 Gyair), and giant color transformation visualization benefit the applications, especially the in situ thermo&#8208;responsive X&#8208;ray imaging. Such strategy provides a promising way to develop the novel smart photonic materials with excellent scintillator performances.

         <title>An Equalized Flow Velocity Strategy for Perovskite Colloidal Particles in Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular encapsulation structure is form colloidal particles and glycerol monostearate in perovskite precursor inks ensuring their consistent response to shear forces. The uniform size of colloidal particles ensures consistent solute deposition during the printing process. The flexible perovskite solar cells achieve a stabilized power conversion efficiency of 24.45% (1.01 cm2) and 15.87% (100 cm2) with minor efficiency discrepancy.








Abstract
The non&#8208;uniform distribution of colloidal particles in perovskite precursor results in an imbalanced response to the shear force during flexible printing process. Herein, it is observed that the continuous disordered migration occurring in perovskite inks significantly contributes to the enlargement of colloidal particles size and diminishes the crystallization activity of the inks. Therefore, a molecular encapsulation architecture by glycerol monostearate to mitigate colloidal particles collisions in the precursor ink, while simultaneously homogenizing the size distribution of perovskite colloids to minimize their diffusion disparities, is devised. The utilization of colloidal particles with a molecular encapsulation structure enables the achievement of uniform deposition during the printing process, thereby effectively balancing the crystallization rate and phase transition in the film and facilitating homogeneous crystallization of perovskite films. The large&#8208;area flexible perovskite device (1.01 cm2 and 100 cm2) fabricated through printing processes, achieves an efficiency of 24.45% and 15.87%, respectively, and manifests superior environmental stability, maintaining an initial efficiency of 91% after being stored in atmospheric ambiences for 150 days (unencapsulated). This work demonstrates that the dynamic evolution process of colloidal particles in both the precursor ink and printing process represents a crucial stride toward achieving uniform crystallization of perovskite films.

         <title>Invoking Interfacial Engineering Boosts Structural Stability Empowering Exceptional Cyclability of Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Se&#8208;NCM811//FeSe2//Fe2O3 self&#8208;assembled electric field activates and improves interfacial charge transfer and coupling. Furthermore, Se2&#8722; selectively adsorbs within oxygen vacancies to form O&#9472;TM&#9472;Se bonds, while FeSe2 reacts with oxygen to form Fe2O3 and SeO2. The Fe2O3 coating mitigates hydrofluoric acid erosion and acts as an electrostatic shield layer, effectively stabilizing lattice oxygen and suppressing structural distortion.








Abstract
The cycling stability of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 under high voltages is hindered by the occurrence of hybrid anion&#8208; and cation&#8208;redox processes, leading to oxygen escape and uncontrolled phase collapse. In this study, an interfacial engineering strategy involving a straightforward mechanical ball milling and low&#8208;temperature calcination, employing a Se&#8208;doped and FeSe2&amp;Fe2O3&#8208;modified approach is proposed to design a stable Ni&#8208;rich cathode. Se2&#8722; are selectively adsorbed within oxygen vacancies to form O&#9472;TM&#9472;Se bond, effectively stabilizing lattice oxygen, and preventing structural distortion. Simultaneously, the Se&#8208;NCM811//FeSe2//Fe2O3 self&#8208;assembled electric field is activated, improving interfacial charge transfer and coupling. Furthermore, FeSe2 accelerates Li+ diffusion and reacts with oxygen to form Fe2O3 and SeO2. The Fe2O3 coating mitigates hydrofluoric acid erosion and acts as an electrostatic shield layer, limiting the outward migration of oxygen anions. Impressively, the modified materials exhibit significantly improved electrochemical performance, with a capacity retention of 79.7% after 500 cycles at 1C under 4.5&#160;V. Furthermore, it provides an extraordinary capacity retention of 94.6% in 3&#8211;4.25&#160;V after 550 cycles in pouch&#8208;type full battery. This dual&#8208;modification approach demonstrates its feasibility and opens new perspective for the development of stable lithium&#8208;ion batteries operating at high voltages.

The Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; coating mitigates hydrofluoric acid erosion and acts as an electrostatic shield layer, effectively stabilizing lattice oxygen and suppressing structural distortion.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cycling stability of LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under high voltages is hindered by the occurrence of hybrid anion- and cation-redox processes, leading to oxygen escape and uncontrolled phase collapse. In this study, an interfacial engineering strategy involving a straightforward mechanical ball milling and low-temperature calcination, employing a Se-doped and FeSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;amp;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-modified approach is proposed to design a stable Ni-rich cathode. Se&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; are selectively adsorbed within oxygen vacancies to form O&lt;i&gt;&#9472;&lt;/i&gt;TM&lt;i&gt;&#9472;&lt;/i&gt;Se bond, effectively stabilizing lattice oxygen, and preventing structural distortion. Simultaneously, the Se-NCM811//FeSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;//Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; self-assembled electric field is activated, improving interfacial charge transfer and coupling. Furthermore, FeSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; accelerates Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion and reacts with oxygen to form Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and SeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; coating mitigates hydrofluoric acid erosion and acts as an electrostatic shield layer, limiting the outward migration of oxygen anions. Impressively, the modified materials exhibit significantly improved electrochemical performance, with a capacity retention of 79.7% after 500 cycles at 1C under 4.5&#160;V. Furthermore, it provides an extraordinary capacity retention of 94.6% in 3&#8211;4.25&#160;V after 550 cycles in pouch-type full battery. This dual-modification approach demonstrates its feasibility and opens new perspective for the development of stable lithium-ion batteries operating at high voltages.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Porous Polypyrrolidines for Highly Efficient Recovery of Precious Metals through Reductive Adsorption Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly porous poly&#8208;pyrrolidines (e.g. BIT&#8208;POP&#8208;17) with isolated alkene linkers can recover precious metal ions such as Au3+ very efficiently. The high adsorption capacity toward Au3+ exceeds the theoretical values, as a reductive adsorption mechanism works through the synergistic interplay of redox&#8208;active N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;pyrrolidine subunit and flexible porous backbone with hierarchical pores.








Abstract
The recycling and utilization of precious metals have emerged as a critical research focus in advancing the development of the circular economy. Among numerous methods for recovering precious metals such as gold, adsorbents with both high adsorption selectivity and capacity have become key technologies. This article incorporated the N&#8208;phenylpyrrolidine into a flexible porous polynorbornene backbone to create a class of distinctive porous organic polymers, named BIT&#8208;POP&#8208;14&#8211;BIT&#8208;POP&#8208;17. Through a reductive capture mechanism, the reductive adsorption sites of N&#8208;phenylpyrrolidine coordinate selectively with precious metals, the reduced metal is captured by the hierarchically porous polymers with flexible backbone. This approach leads to remarkable gold recovery efficiency, achieving a record of 2321&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1 at ambient conditions, and 3020&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1 under UV light, surpassing the theoretical limit. The porous polymers are filled in a column for a continuous uptake of gold from waste printed circuit boards (PCBs), showing recovery efficiency toward gold as high as 95% after 84&#160;h. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on designing novel adsorbents for precious metal recovery, providing inspiration for researchers to explore novel adsorption modes and contribute to the advancement of the circular economy.

         <title>Ultrafast Interfacial Self&#8208;Assembly toward Bioderived Polyester COF Membranes with Microstructure Optimization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strengthening monomer transfer and constructing perfect membrane via positive electrostatic field strategy are presented. A positive electrostatic field strategy arises from the flying behavior of spiders in nature. Spiders can fly because negatively charged spider silk is attracted to the positive charge of ionosphere. A positive electrostatic field is constructed, as it is hoped that monomers can &#8220;fly&#8221; like spiders.








Abstract
The precise manipulation of the microstructure (pore size, free volume distribution, and connectivity of the free&#8208;volume elements), thickness, and mechanical characteristics of membranes holds paramount significance in facilitating the effective utilization of self&#8208;standing membranes. In this contribution, the synthesis of two innovative ester&#8208;linked covalent&#8211;organic framework (COF) membranes is first reported, which are generated through the selection of plant&#8208;derived ellagic acid and quercetin phenolic monomers in conjunction with terephthaloyl chloride as a building block. The optimization of the microstructure of these two COF membranes is systematically achieved through the application of three different interfacial electric field systems: electric neutrality, positive electricity, and negative electricity. It is observed that the positively charged system facilitates a record increase in the rate of membrane formation, resulting in a denser membrane with a uniform pore size and enhanced flexibility. In addition, a correlation is identified wherein an increase in the alkyl chain length of the surfactants leads to a more uniform pore size and a decrease in the molecular weight cutoff of the COF membrane. The resulting COF membrane exhibits an unprecedented combination of high water permeance, superior sieving capability, robust mechanical strength, chemical robustness for promising membrane&#8208;based separation science and technology.

         <title>Inhibiting Demetalation of Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C via Mn Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn acts as an electron donor to reduce the oxidation state of Fe by increasing the electron density at the Fe&#9472;N4 site, thereby strengthening the Fe&#9472;N bond and inhibiting the electrochemical dissolution of Fe. As a result, FeMn&#9472;N&#9472;C exhibits excellent discharge performance and stability in Zn&#8208;air batteries.








Abstract
Demetalation caused by the electrochemical dissolution of metallic Fe atoms is a major challenge for the practical application of Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C catalysts. Herein, an efficient single metallic Mn active site is constructed to improve the strength of the Fe&#9472;N bond, inhibiting the demetalation effect of Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C. Mn acts as an electron donor inducing more delocalized electrons to reduce the oxidation state of Fe by increasing the electron density, thereby enhancing the Fe&#9472;N bond and inhibiting the electrochemical dissolution of Fe. The oxygen reduction reaction pathway for the dissociation of Fe&#9472;Mn dual sites can overcome the high energy barriers to direct O&#9472;O bond dissociation and modulate the electronic states of Fe&#9472;N4 sites. The resulting FeMn&#9472;N&#9472;C exhibits excellent ORR activity with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92&#160;V in alkaline electrolytes. FeMn&#9472;N&#9472;C as a cathode catalyst for Zn&#8208;air batteries has a cycle stability of 700&#160;h at 25&#160;&#176;C and a long cycle stability of more than 210&#160;h under extremely cold conditions at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. These findings contribute to the development of efficient and stable metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon catalysts for various energy devices.

         <title>Coupling Antisite Defect and Lattice Tensile Stimulates Facile Isotropic Li&#8208;Ion Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work employs ultrafast nonequilibrium high&#8208;temperature shock technology to controllably introduce Li&#8211;Fe antisite defects and lattice strain into the lattice of LiFePO4. The unique multiscale coupling structure promotes isotropic 2D interchannel Li+ hopping, leading to excellent fast charging performance and cycling stability. The new mechanism of Li+ diffusion kinetics accelerated by multiscale coupling can guide the design of high&#8208;rate electrodes.








Abstract
Despite widely used as a commercial cathode, the anisotropic 1D channel hopping of lithium ions along the [010] direction in LiFePO4 prevents its application in fast charging conditions. Herein, an ultrafast nonequilibrium high&#8208;temperature shock technology is employed to controllably introduce the Li&#8211;Fe antisite defects and tensile strain into the lattice of LiFePO4. This design makes the study of the effect of the strain field on the performance further extended from the theoretical calculation to the experimental perspective. The existence of Li&#8211;Fe antisite defects makes it feasible for Li+ to move from the 4a site of the edge&#8208;sharing octahedra across the ab plane to 4c site of corner&#8208;sharing octahedra, producing a new diffusion channel different from [010]. Meanwhile, the presence of a tensile strain field reduces the energy barrier of the new 2D diffusion path. In the combination of electrochemical experiments and first&#8208;principles calculations, the unique multiscale coupling structure of Li&#8211;Fe antisite defects and lattice strain promotes isotropic 2D interchannel Li+ hopping, leading to excellent fast charging performance and cycling stability (high&#8208;capacity retention of 84.4% after 2000 cycles at 10 C). The new mechanism of Li+ diffusion kinetics accelerated by multiscale coupling can guide the design of high&#8208;rate electrodes.

The new mechanism of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion kinetics accelerated by multiscale coupling can guide the design of high-rate electrodes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite widely used as a commercial cathode, the anisotropic 1D channel hopping of lithium ions along the [010] direction in LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; prevents its application in fast charging conditions. Herein, an ultrafast nonequilibrium high-temperature shock technology is employed to controllably introduce the Li&#8211;Fe antisite defects and tensile strain into the lattice of LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. This design makes the study of the effect of the strain field on the performance further extended from the theoretical calculation to the experimental perspective. The existence of Li&#8211;Fe antisite defects makes it feasible for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to move from the 4a site of the edge-sharing octahedra across the &lt;i&gt;ab&lt;/i&gt; plane to 4c site of corner-sharing octahedra, producing a new diffusion channel different from [010]. Meanwhile, the presence of a tensile strain field reduces the energy barrier of the new 2D diffusion path. In the combination of electrochemical experiments and first-principles calculations, the unique multiscale coupling structure of Li&#8211;Fe antisite defects and lattice strain promotes isotropic 2D interchannel Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; hopping, leading to excellent fast charging performance and cycling stability (high-capacity retention of 84.4% after 2000 cycles at 10 C). The new mechanism of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion kinetics accelerated by multiscale coupling can guide the design of high-rate electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aerogel&#8208;Involved Triple&#8208;State Gels Resemble Natural Living Leaves in Structure and Multi&#8208;Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aerogel&#8208;evolved artificial leaf with the same structural and functional features as natural living leaves is successfully synthesized by in situ embedding hydrophobic silica aerogel microparticles in PVA hydrogel matrix in the presence of hygroscopic salt and chlorophyllin copper sodium. The as&#8208;prepared living leaves may represent a significant advancement in the field of bionic science, and open up new possibilities for the development and application of bionic engineering in the future.








Abstract
Natural plant leaves with multiple functions, for example, spectral features, transpiration, photosynthesis, etc., have played a significant role in the ecosystem, and artificial synthesis of plant leaves with multiple functions of natural ones is still a great challenge. Herein, this work presents an aerogel&#8208;involved living leaf (AL), most similar to natural ones so far, by embedding super&#8208;hydrophobic SiO2 aerogel microparticles in polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel in the presence of hygroscopic salt and chlorophyllin copper sodium to form solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;vapor triple&#8208;state gel. The AL shows a high spectral similarity with all sampled 15 species of natural leaves and exhibits &#8776;4&#8211;7 times transpiration speed higher than natural leaves. More importantly, AL can achieve several times higher photosynthesis than natural leaves without the energy provided by the respiratory action of natural ones. This work demonstrates the feasibility of creating ALs with natural leaf&#8208;like triple&#8208;state gel structures and multiple functions, opening up new avenues for energy conversion, environmental engineering, and biomimetic applications.

         <title>Multiphase Symbiotic Engineered Elastic Ceramic&#8208;Carbon Aerogels with Advanced Thermal Protection in Extreme Oxidative Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiphase sequence and multiscale structural engineering strategy is proposed to obtain elastic mullite&#8208;carbon hybrid nanofibrous aerogels, achieving extraordinary thermomechanical stability up to 1600&#160;&#176;C in oxidative environments and low thermal conductivity (50.58&#160;mW m&#8211;1 K&#8211;1 at 300 &#176;C). This innovation provides a new thermal protection material system for future space exploration.








Abstract
Elastic aerogels can dissipate aerodynamic forces and thermal stresses by reversible slipping or deforming to avoid sudden failure caused by stress concentration, making them the most promising candidates for thermal protection in aerospace applications. However, existing elastic aerogels face difficulties achieving reliable protection above 1500&#160;&#176;C in aerobic environments due to their poor thermomechanical stability and significantly increased thermal conductivity at elevated temperatures. Here, a multiphase sequence and multiscale structural engineering strategy is proposed to synthesize mullite&#8208;carbon hybrid nanofibrous aerogels. The heterogeneous symbiotic effect between components simultaneously inhibits ceramic crystalline coarsening and carbon thermal etching, thus ensuring the thermal stability of the nanofiber building blocks. Efficient load transfer and high interfacial thermal resistance at crystalline&#8208;amorphous phase boundaries on the microscopic scale, coupled with mesoscale lamellar cellular and locally closed&#8208;pore structures, achieve rapid stress dissipation and thermal energy attenuation in aerogels. This robust thermal protection material system is compatible with ultralight density (30&#160;mg cm&#8211;3), reversible compression strain of 60%, extraordinary thermomechanical stability (up to 1600&#160;&#176;C in oxidative environments), and ultralow thermal conductivity (50.58&#160;mW m&#8211;1 K&#8211;1 at 300 &#176;C), offering new options and possibilities to cope with the harsh operating environments faced by space exploration.

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Reconfiguration Induced Multifunctional Triple&#8208;Gradient Artificial Interfacial Layer toward Long&#8208;Life Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step in situ self&#8208;reconfiguration strategy is demonstrated to induce triple&#8208;gradient (PDDA&#8208;TFSI)&#8208;Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#183;H2O&#8208;Sn (PT&#8208;ZHC&#8208;Sn) artificial interface on the Zn anode surface. The triple&#8208;gradient interface consists of the top layer PT with cation confinement and H2O inhibition, the dense interlayer ZHC with Zn2+ conduction and electron shielding, and the bottom Znophilic layer Sn. The resulting PT&#8208;ZHC&#8208;Sn@Zn symmetric cell achieves an ultra&#8208;long lifetime over 6500&#160;h.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries&#160;featuring with intrinsic safety and low cost are highly desirable for large&#8208;scale energy storage, but the unstable Zn&#8208;metal anode resulting from uncontrollable dendrite growth and grievous hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) shortens their cycle life. Herein, a feasible in situ self&#8208;reconfiguration strategy is developed to generate triple&#8208;gradient poly(diallyldimethylammonium) bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PDDA&#8208;TFSI)&#8208;Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#183;H2O&#8208;Sn (PT&#8208;ZHC&#8208;Sn) artificial layer. The resulting triple&#8208;gradient interface consists of the spherical top layer PT with cation confinement and H2O inhibition, the dense intermediate layer ZHC nanosheet with Zn2+ conduction and electron shielding, and the bottom layer Znophilic Sn metal. The well&#8208;designed triple&#8208;gradient artificial interfacial layer synergistically facilitates rapid Zn2+ diffusion to regulate uniform Zn deposition and accelerates the desolvation process while suppressing HER. Consequently, the PT&#8208;ZHC&#8208;Sn@Zn symmetric cell achieves an ultralong lifespan over 6500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 0.5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, a full battery coupling with MnO2 cathode exhibits a 17.2% increase in capacity retention compared with bare Zn anode after 1000 cycles. The in situ self&#8208;reconfiguration strategy is also applied to prepare triple&#8208;gradient PT&#8208;ZHC&#8208;In, and the assembled Zn//Cu cell operates steadily for over 8400&#160;h while maintaining Coulombic efficiency of 99.6%. This work paves the way to designing multicomponent gradient interface for stable Zn&#8208;metal anodes.

         <title>Thiosalicylic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Mediated Coordination Structure of Nickel Center via Thermodynamic Modulation for Aqueous Ni&#8211;Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study is based on a dual&#8208;ligand synthesis strategy to design nickel&#8208;based complexes with structural changes through thermodynamic modulation. Thiols induce electron&#8208;rich nickel structures around the competitive coordination between the host/guest molecules, thus increasing the electron density of the central atom. The work provides a new perspective on coordination transformations and offers ideas for the design of functionally rich nanomaterials.








Abstract
Uniquely functional nanocomplexes with rich coordination environments are critical in energy storage. However, the construction of structurally versatile nanocomplexes remains challenging. In this study, a nickel&#8208;based complex with structural variations is designed via thermodynamic modulation using a dual&#8208;ligand synthesis strategy. A nickel&#8208;based nanomaterial (NiSA&#8208;SSA&#8208;160) with a large specific surface area is synthesized around the competing coordination of the host and guest molecules that differ in terms of the chemical properties of the O and S elements. Concurrently, the coordination environment of NiSA&#8208;SSA&#8208;160 is investigated via X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. The thiol functional groups synergistically induced an electron&#8208;rich Ni structure, thus increasing the electron density of the central atom. The electrochemical performance of an assembled NiSA&#8208;SSA&#8208;160//Zn@CC battery is shown to improve significantly, with a maximum energy density of 0.54 mWh cm&#8722;2 and a peak power density of 49.49&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This study provides a new perspective regarding coordination transformations and offers an idea for the design of functionally rich nanomaterials.

&lt;p&gt;This study is based on a dual-ligand synthesis strategy to design nickel-based complexes with structural changes through thermodynamic modulation. Thiols induce electron-rich nickel structures around the competitive coordination between the host/guest molecules, thus increasing the electron density of the central atom. The work provides a new perspective on coordination transformations and offers ideas for the design of functionally rich nanomaterials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uniquely functional nanocomplexes with rich coordination environments are critical in energy storage. However, the construction of structurally versatile nanocomplexes remains challenging. In this study, a nickel-based complex with structural variations is designed via thermodynamic modulation using a dual-ligand synthesis strategy. A nickel-based nanomaterial (NiSA-SSA-160) with a large specific surface area is synthesized around the competing coordination of the host and guest molecules that differ in terms of the chemical properties of the O and S elements. Concurrently, the coordination environment of NiSA-SSA-160 is investigated via X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. The thiol functional groups synergistically induced an electron-rich Ni structure, thus increasing the electron density of the central atom. The electrochemical performance of an assembled NiSA-SSA-160//Zn@CC battery is shown to improve significantly, with a maximum energy density of 0.54 mWh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a peak power density of 49.49&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This study provides a new perspective regarding coordination transformations and offers an idea for the design of functionally rich nanomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient and Robust Dynamic Crosslinking for Compatibilizing Immiscible Mixed Plastics through In Situ Generated Singlet Nitrenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;aromatic sulfonyl azide crosslinkers decompose at typical polymer melt&#8208;processing temperatures, forming reactive singlet nitrene intermediates for dynamic covalent crosslinking via direct C&#9472;H insertion. This solvent&#8208;free, melt&#8208;extrusion process efficiently installs dynamic siloxane crosslinks in polymer blends, reducing phase separation and enhancing mechanical performance, providing a robust and practical method for compatibilizing mixed plastics.








Abstract
Creating a sustainable economy for plastics demands the exploration of new strategies for efficient management of mixed plastic waste. The inherent incompatibility of different plastics poses a major challenge in plastic mechanical recycling, resulting in phase&#8208;separated materials with inferior mechanical properties. Here, this study presents a robust and efficient dynamic crosslinking chemistry that effectively compatibilizes mixed plastics. Composed of aromatic sulfonyl azides, the dynamic crosslinker shows high thermal stability and generates singlet nitrene species in situ during solvent&#8208;free melt&#8208;extrusion, effectively promoting C&#9472;H insertion across diverse plastics. This new method demonstrates successful compatibilization of binary polymer blends and model mixed plastics, enhancing mechanical performance and improving phase morphology. It holds promise for managing mixed plastic waste, supporting a more sustainable lifecycle for plastics.

         <title>Plasmonic Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Response S&#8208;Scheme ZnO/CuInS2 Photocatalyst for H2O2 Production Coupled with Glycerin Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ZnO/CuInS2 heterojunction facilitates interfacial charge transfer, enriching carrier concentration in CuInS2. This amplifies localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and enhances near&#8208;infrared (NIR) response that are crucial for solar fuel synthesis. Through H2O2 production and glycerin oxidation, this innovation underscores the significance of NIR utilization, advancing solar energy harvesting technologies.








Abstract
Solar fuel synthesis is intriguing because solar energy is abundant and this method compensates for its intermittency. However, most photocatalysts can only absorb UV&#8208;to&#8208;visible light, while near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light remains unexploited. Surprisingly, the charge transfer between ZnO and CuInS2 quantum dots (QDs) can transform a NIR&#8208;inactive ZnO into a NIR&#8208;active composite. This strong response is attributed to the increased concentration of free charge carriers in the p&#8208;type semiconductor at the interface after the charge migration between ZnO and CuInS2, enhancing the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect and the NIR response of CuInS2. As a paradigm, this ZnO/CuInS2 heterojunction is used for H2O2 production coupled with glycerin oxidation and demonstrates supreme performance, corroborating the importance of NIR response and efficient charge transfer. Mechanistic studies through contact potential difference (CPD), Hall effect test, and finite element method (FEM) calculation allow for the direct correlation between the NIR response and charge transfer. This approach bypasses the general light response issues, thereby stepping forward to the ambitious goal of harnessing the entire solar spectrum.

         <title>Flat&#8208;Knit, Flexible, Textile Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a lightweight, flexible metasurface platform based on flat&#8208;knit textiles and operating in the cm&#8208;wave spectral range. By using a colorwork knitting approach called float&#8208;jacquard knitting to directly integrate an array of resonant metallic antennas into a textile, two textile devices are realized, a metasurface lens and a metasurface vortex&#8208;beam generator.








Abstract
Lightweight, low&#8208;cost metasurfaces and reflectarrays that are easy to stow and deploy are desirable for many terrestrial and space&#8208;based communications and sensing applications. This work demonstrates a lightweight, flexible metasurface platform based on flat&#8208;knit textiles operating in the cm&#8208;wave spectral range. By using a colorwork knitting approach called float&#8208;jacquard knitting to directly integrate an array of resonant metallic antennas into a textile, two textile reflectarray devices, a metasurface lens (metalens), and a vortex&#8208;beam generator are realized. Operating as a receiving antenna, the metalens focuses a collimated normal&#8208;incidence beam to a diffraction&#8208;limited, off&#8208;broadside focal spot. Operating as a transmitting antenna, the metalens converts the divergent emission from a horn antenna into a collimated beam with peak measured directivity, gain, and efficiency of 21.30, 15.30, and &#8722;6.00 dB (25.12%), respectively. The vortex&#8208;beam generating metasurface produces a focused vortex beam with a topological charge of m&#160;=&#160;1 over a wide frequency range of 4.1&#8211;5.8&#160;GHz. Strong specular reflection is observed for the textile reflectarrays, caused by wavy yarn floats on the backside of the float&#8208;jacquard textiles. This work demonstrates a novel approach for the scalable production of flexible metasurfaces by leveraging commercially available yarns and well&#8208;established knitting machinery and techniques.

         <title>An Engineered Nanoplatform with Tropism Toward Irradiated Glioblastoma Augments Its Radioimmunotherapy Efficacy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To meet the challenges of inadequate efficacy and severe immune&#8208;related adverse events in immune checkpoint blockade therapy of glioblastomas, a biomimetic nanoplatform that combines radiation&#8208;mediated tropism and radiosensitization is tailored to deliver immune checkpoint blockers with radiation&#8208;responsive release. The current study provides a promising strategy for high&#8208;efficient and low&#8208;toxic radio&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Combining radiotherapy with immune checkpoint blockade therapy offers a promising approach to treat glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), yet challenges such as limited effectiveness and immune&#8208;related adverse events (irAEs) persist. These issues are largely due to the failure in targeting immunomodulators directly to the tumor microenvironment. To address this, a biomimetic nanoplatform that combines a genetically modified mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) membrane with a bioactive nanoparticle core for chemokine&#8208;directed radioimmunotherapy of GBM is developed. The CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)&#8208;overexpressing MSC membrane acts as a tactical tentacle to achieve radiation&#8208;induced tropism toward the abundant chemokine (CC motif)&#160;ligand 2 (CCL2) in irradiated gliomas. The nanoparticle core, comprising diselenide&#8208;bridged mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) and PD&#8208;L1 antibodies (&#945;PD&#8208;L1), enables X&#8208;ray&#8208;responsive drug release and radiosensitization. In two murine models with orthotopic GBM tumors, this nanoplatform reinvigorated immunogenic cell death, and augmented the efficacy and specificity of GBM radioimmunotherapy, with reduced occurrence of irAEs. This study suggests a promising radiation&#8208;induced tropism strategy for targeted drug delivery, and presents a potent nanoplatform that enhances the efficacy and safety of radio&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Polarized Solar&#8208;Blind Ultraviolet Organic Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance polarization&#8208;sensitive solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet photodetectors, with a dichroic ratio close to 4.26, are demonstrated. Stable and efficient detection of polarized light is attributed to the intrinsic anisotropy of the transition dipole moment in the bc crystal plane. Finally, high&#8208;contrast polarimetric imaging and anti&#8208;interference imaging are successfully demonstrated based on photodetectors, highlighting the potential of organic semiconductors for polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance polarization&#8208;sensitive ultraviolet photodetectors is crucial for their application in military remote sensing, detection, bio&#8208;inspired navigation, and machine vision. However, the significant absorption in the visible light range severely limits the application of polarization&#8208;sensitive ultraviolet photodetectors, such as high&#8208;quality anti&#8208;interference imaging. Here, based on a wide&#8208;bandgap organic semiconductor single crystal (trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(5&#8208;phenyldithieno[2,3&#8208;b:3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethene, BPTTE), high&#8208;performance polarization&#8208;sensitive solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet photodetectors with a dichroic ratio close to 4.26 are demonstrated. The strong anisotropy of 2D grown BPTTE single crystals in molecular vibration and optical absorption is characterized by various techniques. Under voltage modulation, stable and efficient detection of polarized light is demonstrated, attributed to the intrinsic anisotropy of transition dipole moment in the bc crystal plane, rather than other factors. Finally, high&#8208;contrast polarimetric imaging and anti&#8208;interference imaging are successfully demonstrated based on BPTTE single crystal photodetectors, highlighting the potential of organic semiconductors for polarization&#8208;sensitive solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet photodetectors.

Atmospheric Water Harvester
In article number 2403876, Lin Dai, Chenyu Li, Wenshuai Chen, Chuanling Si, and co&#8208;workers report a solar&#8208;powered gel that can rapidly adsorb and release moisture, created by integrating a whole biomass&#8208;derived polymer network with lithium chloride. Next, a drum&#8208;type, tunable, and portable harvester is assembled that can collect atmospheric water within a brief time. This approach provides new insights for fast atmospheric water harvesting in extreme environments.

Energy Harvesting
This novel &#8220;Twistron energy cell harvester&#8221; (TECH) produces electrical energy from mechanical contraction. In vivo implantation of TECH onto the left ventricular surface in a porcine model continuously generates electrical energy from cardiac contraction. The generated electrical energy is used for direct pacing of the heart as documented by electrophysiology mapping. This energy can potentially be used for medical implants. More details can be found in article number 2313688 by Seon Jeong Kim and co&#8208;workers.

Hydrogel Microneedles
The hydrogel microneedle continuous ketone monitoring (HMN&#8208;CKM) sensor is a skin&#8208;compatible patch designed to alert patients with diabetes at the onset of diabetic ketoacidosis. It leverages the catechol&#8208;quinone chemistry of dopamine to monitor ketone bodies in interstitial fluid, while dopamine also serves as the crosslinking agent for the HMN patch. More details can be found in article number 2402009, Amin GhavamiNejad, Mahla Poudineh, and co&#8208;workers.

Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts
This image depicts the key step in the synthesis process of our innovative FeN4&#8208;O&#8208;graphene catalyst for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction. During the thermal decomposition of DMF, CO is formed and combines with FePc to create the FeN4&#8208;OC structure. The FeN4&#8208;OC molecules selectively and strongly bind to the defects in graphene, forming the FeN4&#8208;O&#8208;Graphene structure. More details can be found in article number 2403273 by , Hyung&#8208;Kyu Lim, Pil Kim, Sung Jong Yoo, and co&#8208;workers.

Percutaneous ablation is minimally invasive and offers numerous advantages over traditional surgery, such as shorter recovery times, reduced hospital stays, and decreased healthcare costs. Intra&#8208;procedural imaging during ablation also allows precise visualization of the treated tissue while minimizing injury to the surrounding normal tissues, reducing the risk of complications. Here, the mechanisms of tissue ablation and innovative energy delivery systems are explored, highlighting recent advancements that have reshaped the landscape of clinical practice. Current clinical challenges related to tissue ablation are also discussed, underlining unmet clinical needs for more advanced material&#8208;based approaches to improve the delivery of energy and pharmacology&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Photochromic Carbon Nanomaterials: An Emerging Class of Light&#8208;Driven Hybrid Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
When carbon nanomaterials are functionalized by photochromic molecules, the resultant hybrids exhibit either new or improved properties and functions that are attractive for diverse device applications. This review summarizes the fabrication methods, properties, and various applications of photochromic carbon nanomaterials.








Abstract
Photochromic molecules have remarkable potential in memory and optical devices, as well as in driving and manipulating molecular motors or actuators and many other systems using light. When photochromic molecules are introduced into carbon nanomaterials (CNMs), the resulting hybrids provide unique advantages and create new functions that can be employed in specific applications and devices. This review highlights the recent developments in diverse photochromic CNMs. Photochromic molecules and CNMs are also introduced. The fundamentals of different photochromic CNMs are discussed, including design principles and the types of interactions between CNMs and photochromic molecules via covalent interactions and non&#8208;covalent bonding such as &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking, amphiphilic, electrostatic, and hydrogen bonding. Then the properties of photochromic CNMs, e.g., in photopatterning, fluorescence modulation, actuation, and photoinduced surface&#8208;relief gratings, and their applications in energy storage (solar thermal fuels, photothermal batteries, and supercapacitors), nanoelectronics (transistors, molecular junctions, photo&#8208;switchable conductance, and photoinduced electron transfer), sensors, and bioimaging are highlighted. Finally, an outlook on the challenges and opportunities in the future of photochromic CNMs is presented. This review discusses a vibrant interdisciplinary research field and is expected to stimulate further developments in nanoscience, advanced nanotechnology, intelligently responsive materials, and devices.

         <title>Fluid Unidirectional Transport Induced by Structure and Ambient Elements across Porous Materials: From Principles to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces wetting phenomena observed on natural biological surfaces or porous structures. Subsequently, it offers an overview of diverse principles and potential applications in this field, emphasizing various physical and chemical structural designs and ambient elements. Applications encompass moisture&#8208;wicking fabric, sensors, skincare, fog collection, oil&#8211;water separation, electrochemistry, liquid&#8208;based gating, and solar evaporators.








Abstract
Spontaneous or nonspontaneous unidirectional fluid transport across multidimension can occur under specific structural designs and ambient elements for porous materials. While existing reviews have extensively summarized unidirectional fluid transport on surfaces, there is an absence of literature summarizing fluid's unidirectional transport across porous materials. This review introduces wetting phenomena observed on natural biological surfaces or porous structures. Subsequently, it offers an overview of diverse principles and potential applications in this field, emphasizing various physical and chemical structural designs (surface energy, capillary size, topographic curvature) and ambient elements (underwater, under oil, pressure, and solar energy). Applications encompass moisture&#8208;wicking fabric, sensors, skincare, fog collection, oil&#8211;water separation, electrochemistry, liquid&#8208;based gating, and solar evaporators. Additionally, significant principles and formulas from various studies are compelled to offer readers valuable references. Simultaneously, potential advantages and challenges are critically assessed in these applications and the perspectives are presented.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review emphasizes the significance of heterointerfaces, which present new opportunities for enhanced capacity and rapid mass transfer dynamics in energy storage electrodes, attributed to the localized &#8220;space charge effect&#8221;. Fresh insights into fundamental principles, working mechanisms, dynamic evolution mechanisms, and feasible design strategies governing heterointerfaces are systematically discussed.








Abstract
Heterogeneous electrode materials possess abundant heterointerfaces with a localized &#8220;space charge effect&#8221;, which enhances capacity output and accelerates mass/charge transfer dynamics in energy storage devices (ESDs). These promising features open new possibilities for demanding applications such as electric vehicles, grid energy storage, and portable electronics. However, the fundamental principles and working mechanisms that govern heterointerfaces are not yet fully understood, impeding the rational design of electrode materials. In this study, the heterointerface evolution during charging and discharging process as well as the intricate interaction between heterointerfaces and charge/mass transport phenomena, is systematically discussed. Guidelines along with feasible strategies for engineering structural heterointerfaces to address specific challenges encountered in various application scenarios, are also provided. This review offers innovative solutions for the development of heterogeneous electrode materials, enabling more efficient energy storage beyond conventional electrochemistry. Furthermore, it provides fresh insights into the advancement of clean energy conversion and storage technologies. This review contributes to the knowledge and understanding of heterointerfaces, paving the way for the design and optimization of next&#8208;generation energy storage materials for a sustainable future.

Abstract
Citrate&#8208;based biodegradable polymers have emerged as a distinctive biomaterial platform with tremendous potential for diverse medical applications. By harnessing their versatile chemistry, these polymers exhibit a wide range of material and bioactive properties, enabling them to regulate cell metabolism and stem cell differentiation through energy metabolism, metabonegenesis, angiogenesis, and immunomodulation. Moreover, the recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance of the biodegradable poly(octamethylene citrate) (POC)/hydroxyapatite&#8208;based orthopedic fixation devices represents a translational research milestone for biomaterial science. POC joins a short list of biodegradable synthetic polymers that have ever been authorized by the FDA for use in humans. The clinical success of POC has sparked enthusiasm and accelerated the development of next&#8208;generation citrate&#8208;based biomaterials. This review presents a comprehensive, forward&#8208;thinking discussion on the pivotal role of citrate chemistry and metabolism in various tissue regeneration and on the development of functional citrate&#8208;based metabotissugenic biomaterials for regenerative engineering applications.

         <title>Toward Circular Energy: Exploring Direct Regeneration for Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Sustainability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recycling is crucial for enhancing the sustainability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, alleviating raw material shortages, and reducing carbon emissions. Replenishing lithium at the molecular level can restore its properties and prevent repetitive construction of degraded cathode materials. However, future batteries must also meet sustainability requirements while maintaining exceptional electrochemical performance. Direct upcycling offers an innovative approach to transform battery materials.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) are rapidly developing into attractive energy storage technologies. As LIBs gradually enter retirement, their sustainability is starting to come into focus. The utilization of recycled spent LIBs as raw materials for battery manufacturing is imperative for resource and environmental sustainability. The sustainability of spent LIBs depends on the recycling process, whereby the cycling of battery materials must be maximized while minimizing waste emissions and energy consumption. Although LIB recycling technologies (hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy) have been commercialized on a large scale, they have unavoidable limitations. They are incompatible with circular economy principles because they require toxic chemicals, emit hazardous substances, and consume large amounts of energy. The direct regeneration of degraded electrode materials from spent LIBs is a viable alternative to traditional recycling technologies and is a nondestructive repair technology. Furthermore, direct regeneration offers advantages such as maximization of the value of recycled electrode materials, use of sustainable, nontoxic reagents, high potential profitability, and significant application potential. Therefore, this review aims to investigate the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art direct LIB regeneration technologies that can be extended to large&#8208;scale applications.

&lt;p&gt;Recycling is crucial for enhancing the sustainability of lithium-ion batteries, alleviating raw material shortages, and reducing carbon emissions. Replenishing lithium at the molecular level can restore its properties and prevent repetitive construction of degraded cathode materials. However, future batteries must also meet sustainability requirements while maintaining exceptional electrochemical performance. Direct upcycling offers an innovative approach to transform battery materials.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Recent Progress of Fluorinated Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated conjugated polymers, as a thriving field for organic electronics, have received wide&#8208;spread attention. This review summarizes the fluorination strategies of building blocks in conjugated polymers and synthetic methods of fluorinated conjugated polymers. Besides, the applications of fluorinated polymer semiconductors with superior device performances, especially in organic field&#8208;effect transistors, organic solar cells, organic electrochemical transistors, and thermoelectrics, are also introduced.








Abstract
In recent years, conjugated polymers have received widespread attention due to their characteristic advantages of light weight, favorable solution processability, and structural modifiability. Among various conjugated polymers, fluorinated ones have developed rapidly to achieve high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type or ambipolar polymeric semiconductors. The uniqueness of fluorinated conjugated polymers contains the high coplanarity of their structures, lower frontier molecular orbital energy levels, and strong nonbonding interactions. In this review, first the fluorinated building blocks, including fluorinated benzene and thiophene rings, fluorinated B&#8592;N bridged units, and fluoroalkyl side chains are summarized. Subsequently, different synthetic methods of fluorinated conjugated polymers are described, with a special focus on their respective advantages and disadvantages. Then, with these numerous fluorinated structures and appropriate synthetic methods bear in mind, the properties and applications of the fluorinated conjugated polymers, such as cyclopentadithiophene&#8208;, amide&#8208;, and imide&#8208;based polymers, and B&#8592;N embedded polymers, are systematically discussed. The introduction of fluorine atoms can further enhance the electron&#8208;deficiency of the backbone, influencing the charge carrier transport performance. The promising fluorinated conjugated polymers are applied widely in organic field&#8208;effect transistors, organic solar cells, organic thermoelectric devices, and other organic opto&#8208;electric devices. Finally, the outlook on the challenges and future development of fluorinated conjugated polymers is systematically discussed.

         <title>Chemically Programmed Hydrogels for Spatiotemporal Modulation of the Cardiac Pathological Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically programmed responsive polymer networks, intelligent micro/nanoplatforms, and biological therapeutic cues contribute to the formation of precisely targeted, spatiotemporally controllable, and on&#8208;demand feedback microenvironment&#8208;modulated hydrogels. Chemically programmed strategies are used to construct oxygen&#8208;generating, antioxidant, anti&#8208;inflammatory, provascular, and electrointegrated hydrogels for spatiotemporal modulation of the cardiac pathological microenvironment.








Abstract
After myocardial infarction (MI), sustained ischemic events induce pathological microenvironments characterized by ischemia&#8208;hypoxia, oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, matrix remodeling, and fibrous scarring. Conventional clinical therapies lack spatially targeted and temporally responsive modulation of the infarct microenvironment, leading to limited myocardial repair. Engineered hydrogels have a chemically programmed toolbox for minimally invasive localization of the pathological microenvironment and personalized responsive modulation over different pathological periods. Chemically programmed strategies for crosslinking interactions, interfacial binding, and topological microstructures in hydrogels enable minimally invasive implantation and in situ integration tailored to the myocardium. This enhances substance exchange and signal interactions within the infarcted microenvironment. Programmed responsive polymer networks, intelligent micro/nanoplatforms, and biological therapeutic cues contribute to the formation of microenvironment&#8208;modulated hydrogels with precise targeting, spatiotemporal control, and on&#8208;demand feedback. Therefore, this review summarizes the features of the MI microenvironment and chemically programmed schemes for hydrogels to conform, integrate, and modulate the cardiac pathological microenvironment. Chemically programmed strategies for oxygen&#8208;generating, antioxidant, anti&#8208;inflammatory, provascular, and electrointegrated hydrogels to stimulate iterative and translational cardiac tissue engineering are discussed.

         <title>Integration Construction of Hybrid Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multidimensional construction of platinum (Pt)&#8208;nanocarbon integrated catalysts enhances the catalytic activity and stability through the joint promotion of abundant active sites, multisite tandem catalysis, optimized oxygen adsorption, reinforced anchoring effect, and robust metal&#8208;support interaction,&#160;while considering both bulk and local mass transport to ensure long&#8208;lasting operation of the fuel cells.








Abstract
There is notable progress in the development of efficient oxygen reduction electrocatalysts, which are crucial components of fuel cells. However, these superior activities are limited by imbalanced mass transport and cannot be fully reflected in actual fuel cell applications. Herein, the design concepts and development tracks of platinum (Pt)&#8208;nanocarbon hybrid catalysts, aiming to enhance the performance of both cathodic electrocatalysts and fuel cells, are presented. This review commences with an introduction to Pt/C catalysts, highlighting the diverse architectures developed to date, with particular emphasis on heteroatom modification and microstructure construction of functionalized nanocarbons based on integrated design concepts. This discussion encompasses the structural evolution, property enhancement, and catalytic mechanisms of Pt/C&#8208;based catalysts, including rational preparation recipes, superior activity, strong stability, robust metal&#8208;support interactions, adsorption regulation, synergistic pathways, confinement strategies, ionomer optimization, mass transport permission, multidimensional construction, and reactor upgrading. Furthermore, this review explores the low&#8208;barrier or barrier&#8208;free mass exchange interfaces and channels achieved through the impressive multidimensional construction of Pt&#8208;nanocarbon integrated catalysts, with the goal of optimizing fuel cell efficiency. In conclusion, this review outlines the challenges associated with Pt&#8208;nanocarbon integrated catalysts and provides perspectives on the future development trends of fuel cells and beyond.

A comprehensive review on the progress of intestinal delivery of probiotics for the diagnosis and therapy of various diseases is provided from the aspects of definition, type, action mechanism, encapsulation strategy, therapeutic application, and synthetic biology for probiotics. The current limitations and future research directions in the intestinal delivery of probiotics are also discussed.








Abstract
Probiotics with diverse and crucial properties and functions have attracted broad interest from many researchers, who adopt intestinal delivery of probiotics to modulate the gut microbiota. However, the major problems faced for the therapeutic applications of probiotics are the viability and colonization of probiotics during their processing, oral intake, and subsequent delivery to the gut. The challenges of simple oral delivery (stability, controllability, targeting, etc.) have greatly limited the use of probiotics in clinical therapies. Nanotechnology can endow the probiotics to be delivered to the intestine with improved survival rate and increased resistance to the adverse environment. Additionally, the progress in synthetic biology has created new opportunities for efficiently and purposefully designing and manipulating the probiotics. In this article, a brief overview of the types of probiotics for intestinal delivery, the current progress of different probiotic encapsulation strategies, including the chemical, physical, and genetic strategies and their combinations, and the emerging single&#8208;cell encapsulation strategies using nanocoating methods, is presented. The action mechanisms of probiotics that are responsible for eliciting beneficial effects are also briefly discussed. Finally, the therapeutic applications of engineered probiotics are discussed, and the future trends toward developing engineered probiotics with advanced features and improved health benefits are proposed.

         <title>Mechanisms of the Accelerated Li+ Conduction in MOF&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Polymer Electrolytes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;depth summary of the mechanism of accelerated Li+ conduction in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes is presented in terms of polymers, MOF, MOF/polymer interface, and solid&#8208;state electrolyte/Li interfaces. In addition, the understanding of the ionic conduction mechanisms is further deepened by summarizing advanced characterisation tools, theoretical calculations, and simulations.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) for lithium metal batteries have garnered considerable interests owing to their low cost, flexibility, lightweight, and favorable interfacial compatibility with battery electrodes. Their soft mechanical nature compared to solid inorganic electrolytes give them a large advantage to be used in low pressure solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, which can avoid the cost and weight of the pressure cages. However, the application of SPEs is hindered by their relatively low ionic conductivity. In addressing this limitation, enormous efforts are devoted to the experimental investigation and theoretical calculations/simulation of new polymer classes. Recently, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been shown to be effective in enhancing ion transport in SPEs. However, the mechanisms in enhancing Li+ conductivity have rarely been systematically and comprehensively analyzed. Therefore, this review provides an in&#8208;depth summary of the mechanisms of MOF&#8208;enhanced Li+ transport in MOF&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes (MSPEs) in terms of polymer, MOF, MOF/polymer interface, and solid electrolyte interface aspects, respectively. Moreover, the understanding of Li+ conduction mechanisms through employing advanced characterization tools, theoretical calculations, and simulations are also reviewed in this review. Finally, the main challenges in developing MSPEs are deeply analyzed and the corresponding future research directions are also proposed.

         <title>Rational Modulation of Interface Microenvironment and Design of the Flow Electrolyzer for COx Electroreduction to Alcohol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the current status of microenvironment regulation of catalytic reaction interface, flow electrolyzers design, and the flow electrolyzers derived stepwise approaches for COxRR to alcohol, aiming to provide new insights into the production of alcohols via COxRR.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction of COx (including CO2 and CO) into value&#8208;added fuels and chemicals, particularly multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) alcohols, presents a significant opportunity to close the manmade carbon cycle and support sustainable energy systems. The catalytic performance of electrochemical reduction reactions of CO2 and CO (COxRR)&#160;is strongly correlated with the local microenvironments, the flow electrolyzer, and the catalysis approaches with flow electrolyzers, which contribute to the kinetic and thermodynamic landscape of the reaction, ultimately determining the efficiency and selectivity of the COxRR toward desired reduction products. However, controllable microenvironment construction, rationally designed flow electrolyzers, and matchable flow electrolyzers derived catalysis approaches chosen for improving COxRR&#8208;to&#8208;alcohol performance still face challenges. Building upon the foundation laid by previous research, this review article will provide an in&#8208;depth summary of the regulation of the catalytic reaction interface microenvironment, the design of flow electrolyzers, and the development of derived stepwise catalysis approaches with the flow electrolyzers, which provide a comprehensive and strategic approach to enhancing the COxRR process for alcohol production, offering valuable insights and innovative solutions that can significantly impact the field of COxRR conversion to alcohol and contribute to the development of more sustainable chemical production methods.

         <title>Supported IrO2 Nanocatalyst with Multilayered Structure for Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a supported IrO2 nanocatalyst with a tri&#8208;layered structure, dubbed IrO2@TaOx@TaB that is composed of ultrasmall IrO2 nanoparticles anchored on TaOx overlayer of TaB nanorods, is reported. The IrO2@TaOx@TaB can be used to fabricate a low&#8208;iridium&#8208;loading anode catalyst layer while maintaining excellent activity and stability in a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer.








Abstract
The design of a low&#8208;iridium&#8208;loading anode catalyst layer with high activity and durability is a key challenge for a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Here, the synthesis of a novel supported IrO2 nanocatalyst with a tri&#8208;layered structure, dubbed IrO2@TaOx@TaB that is composed of ultrasmall IrO2 nanoparticles anchored on amorphous TaOx overlayer of TaB nanorods is reported. The composite electrocatalyst shows great activity and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid, thanks to its dual&#8208;interface structural feature. The electronic interaction in IrO2/TaOx interface can regulate the coverage of surface hydroxyl groups, the Ir3+/ Ir4+ ratio, and the redox peak potential of IrO2 for enhancing OER activity, while the dense TaOx overlayer can prevent further oxidation of TaB substrate and stabilize the IrO2 catalytic layers for improving structural stability during OER. The IrO2@TaOx@TaB can be used to fabricate an anode catalyst layer of PEMWE with an iridium&#8208;loading as low as 0.26&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2. The low&#8208;iridium&#8208;loading PEMWE delivers high current densities at low cell voltages (e.g., 3.9&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2@2.0 V), and gives excellent activity retention for more than 1500&#160;h at 2.0&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 current density.

         <title>Unraveling the Solution Aggregation Structures and Processing Resiliency of High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Photovoltaic Blends</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The temperature&#8208;dependent solution aggregation behavior of high&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaic blends is thoroughly investigated by complementary scattering techniques. The direct quantitative relationships established between multiscale solution structural parameters (Kuhn length of polymer aggregates, L1, and the percentage of acceptors distributed within polymer aggregates, &#1060;) and device performance provide valuable optimization guidelines for the preparation of high&#8208;performance organic electronic devices.








Abstract
The solution aggregation structure of conjugated polymers is crucial to the morphology and resultant optoelectronic properties of organic electronics and is of considerable interest in the field. Precise characterizations of the solution aggregation structures of organic photovoltaic (OPV) blends and their temperature&#8208;dependent variations remain challenging. In this work, the temperature&#8208;dependent solution aggregation structures of three representative high&#8208;efficiency OPV blends using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray/neutron scattering are systematically probed. Three cases of solution processing resiliency are elucidated in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OPV blends. The exceptional processing resiliency of high&#8208;efficiency PBQx&#8208;TF blends can be attributed to the minimal changes in the multiscale solution aggregation structure at elevated temperatures. Importantly, a new parameter, the percentage of acceptors distributed within polymer aggregates (&#1060;), for the first time in OPV blend solution, establishes a direct correlation between &#1060; and performance is quantified. The device performance is well correlated with the Kuhn length of the cylinder related to polymer aggregates L1 at the small scale and the &#1060; at the large scale. Optimal device performance is achieved with L1 at &#8776;30&#160;nm and &#1060; within the range of 60&#160;&#177;&#160;5%. This study represents a significant advancement in the aggregation structure research of organic electronics.

The exceptional processing resiliency of high-efficiency PBQx-TF blends can be attributed to the minimal changes in the multiscale solution aggregation structure at elevated temperatures. Importantly, a new parameter, the percentage of acceptors distributed within polymer aggregates (&lt;i&gt;&#1060;&lt;/i&gt;), for the first time in OPV blend solution, establishes a direct correlation between &lt;i&gt;&#1060;&lt;/i&gt; and performance is quantified. The device performance is well correlated with the Kuhn length of the cylinder related to polymer aggregates &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at the small scale and the &lt;i&gt;&#1060;&lt;/i&gt; at the large scale. Optimal device performance is achieved with &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at &#8776;30&#160;nm and &lt;i&gt;&#1060;&lt;/i&gt; within the range of 60&#160;&#177;&#160;5%. This study represents a significant advancement in the aggregation structure research of organic electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Potential Water Collection From Air by Chloride Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study explores metal chloride perovskites as a novel class of sorbent materials for atmospheric water harvesting. These materials effectively adsorb water vapor through delicate bonds with water molecules and reversible reactions involving hydrate intermediates. This design locks hygroscopic A&#8208;site ions within a stable [PbCl3] sublattice, forming perovskite crystals, making them promising candidates for atmospheric water harvesting applications.








Abstract
Directly capturing water from the air has become a compelling strategy to secure water resources. Yet, challenges persist with sorption&#8208;based hygroscopic materials, such as inadequate water adsorption efficiency, material degradation post&#8208;adsorption, and the need for energy input during water collection. This study introduces an alternative category of sorbent materials potentially for atmospheric water harvesting&#8212;metal chloride perovskites&#8212;that exhibit spontaneous water vapor adsorption and liquid water collection. This water uptake capability stems from the uncoordinated polar ions that form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, while the cubic lattice imparts a solid framework ensuring structural stability and inhibiting hydrolysis. The methylammonium lead chloride perovskite pellets exhibit efficient water collection performance, with a record absorption rate of 0.841 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and a total water collection of 3.675 L m&#8722;2 within a 7&#8208;h cycle. This initiative attempts to provide a new material class candidate for the potential application of passive atmospheric water harvesting.

         <title>Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Through Decoupling of Colloidal Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of &#8242;QD&#8208;in&#8208;organic solid solution&#8217; as an emissive layer in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes achieves deep&#8208;blue emission by mitigating particle interactions that typically lead to a spectral redshift in the film. This approach results in a &#8776;7 nm blueshifted emission, with a deep&#8208;blue color coordinate of CIEy &lt; 0.06, along with a notable external quantum efficiency of 6.2%.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have exceptional color purity but designs that emit deep&#8208;blue color with high efficiency have not been fully achieved and become more difficult in the thin film of confined perovskite colloidal quantum dots (PeQDs) due to particle interaction. Here it is demonstrated that electronic coupling and energy transfer in PeQDs induce redshift in the emission by PeQD film, and consequently hinder deep&#8208;blue emission. To achieve deep&#8208;blue emission by avoiding electronic coupling and energy transfer, a QD&#8208;in&#8208;organic solid solution is introduced to physically separate the QDs in the film. This physical separation of QDs reduces the interaction between them yielding a blueshift of &#8776;7&#160;nm in the emission spectrum. Moreover, using a hole&#8208;transporting organic molecule with a deep&#8208;lying highest occupied molecular orbital (&#8776;6.0&#160;eV) as the organic matrix, the formation of exciplex emission is suppressed. As a result, an unprecedently high maximum external quantum efficiency of 6.2% at 462&#160;nm from QD&#8208;in&#8208;organic solid solution film in PeLEDs is achieved, which satisfies the deep&#8208;blue color coordinates of CIEy &lt;&#160;0.06. This work suggests an important material strategy to deepen blue emission without reducing the particle size to &lt;&#8776;4&#160;nm.

         <title>Salt&#8208;Assisted Recovery of Sodium Metal Anodes for High&#8208;Rate Capability Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an alkali salt&#8208;assisted assembly&#8208;polymerization strategy to recover Na activity and reinforce solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase that consists of inner O&#8211;Si&#8211;O networks and outer hydrophobic epoxides. In consequence, the modified Na anodes can not only achieve their electrochemical recovery, but also withstand moisture air attacking and high current&#8208;density cycling.








Abstract
Rechargeable sodium metal batteries are considered to be one of the most promising high energy density and cost&#8208;effective electrochemical energy storage systems. However, their practicality is constrained by the high reactivity of sodium metal anodes that readily brings about excessive accumulation of inactive Na species on the surface, either by chemical reactions with oxygen and moisture during electrode handling or through electrochemical processes with electrolytes during battery operation. Herein, this paper reports on an alkali, salt&#8208;assisted, assembly&#8208;polymerization strategy to recover Na activity and to reinforce the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) of sodium metal anodes. To achieve this, an alkali&#8208;reactive coupling agent 3&#8208;glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) is applied to convert inactive Na species into Si&#8211;O&#8211;Na coordination with a self&#8208;assembly GPTMS layer that consists of inner O&#8211;Si&#8211;O networks and outer hydrophobic epoxides. As a result, the electrochemical activity of Na metal anodes can be fully recovered and the robust GPTMS&#8208;derived SEI layer ensures high capacity and long&#8208;term cycling under an ultrahigh rate of 30 C (93.1 mAh g&#8722;1, 94.8% after 3000 cycles). This novel process provides surface engineering clues on designing high power density and cost&#8208;effective alkaline metal batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Yet Sustainable Triboelectric Nanogenerator Based on Sulfur&#8208;Rich Polymer Composite with MXene Segregated Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elemental sulfur&#160;generated from petroleum refining as a huge waste&#160;is upcycled to sulfur&#8208;rich polymer (SRP)&#160;and this new polymer is applied to construct a sustainable and high&#8208;performance triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). TENG output performance is maximized by introducing MXene segregated&#160;structure integrated sulfur&#8208;rich polymer/MXene composite. This TENG demonstrated 8.4 times higher peak power density than that of the previous record from SRP&#8208;based TENGs.









Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) typically employ fluoropolymers, highly negative chargeable materials in triboelectric series. However, many researchers nowadays are concerned about environmental pollution caused by poly&#8208;and per&#8208;fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) due to their critical immunotoxicity as fluoropolymers are likely to release PFAS into the ecosystem during their life cycle. Herein, a sulfur&#8208;rich polymer (SRP)/MXene composite, offering high&#8208;performance yet sustainable TENG is developed. Value&#8208;addition of sulfur into SRP&#8208;based TENG has huge advantages since sulfur is abundant waste from petroleum refining and possesses the highest electron affinity (&#8722;200&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1) among polymerizable atoms. MXene segregated structure is introduced into SRP to achieve homogeneous distribution without electrical percolation by utilizing below 0.5&#160;wt% of MXene, resulting in a significantly enhanced dielectric constant without a drastic increase of dielectric loss. Due to homogeneous MXene distribution, SRP/MXene composite&#8208;based TENG demonstrates 2.9 times and 19.5 times enhances peak voltage and peak current compared to previous SRP&#8208;based TENGs. Additionally, it exhibits reusability without critical reduction of modulus and TENG performance due to dynamically exchangeable disulfide bonds. Finally, after the corona discharging and scaling&#8208;up process to a 4&#8208;inch wafer size, SRP/MXene composite&#8208;based TENG exhibits an 8.4 times improvement in peak power density, reaching 3.80&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 compared to previous SRP&#8208;based TENGs.

         <title>Regulating Surface Metal Abundance via Lattice&#8208;Matched Coordination for Versatile and Environmentally&#8208;Viable Sn&#8208;Pb Alloying Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice&#8208;matched coordination of Sn&#8208;Pb alloying perovskites by cobweb&#8208;like quadrangular macrocyclic porphyrin chelators beneficially regulates the surface metal abundance for versatile construction of high&#8208;efficiency single&#8208;junction and tandem solar cells with extended lifespan and minimized toxic Pb leakage.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap Sn&#8208;Pb alloying perovskites showcased great potential in constructing multiple&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with efficiencies approaching or exceeding the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit. However, the uncontrollable surface metal abundance (Sn2+ and Pb2+ ions) hinders their efficiency and versatility in different device structures. Additionally, the undesired Pb distribution mainly at the buried interface accelerates the Pb leakage when devices are damaged. In this work, a novel strategy is presented to modulate crystallization kinetics and surface metal abundance of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites using a cobweb&#8208;like quadrangular macrocyclic porphyrin material, which features a molecular size compatible with the perovskite lattice and robustly coordinates with Pb2+ ions, thus immobilizing them and increasing surface Pb abundance by 61%. This modulation reduces toxic Pb leakage rates by 24&#8208;fold, with only &#8764;23 ppb Pb in water after severely damaged PSCs are immersed in water for 150 h.This strategy can also enhance chemical homogeneity, reduce trap density, release tensile strain and optimize carrier dynamics of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites and relevant devices. Encouragingly, the power conversion efficiency (PCEs) of 23.28% for single&#8208;junction, full&#8208;stack devices and 21.34% for hole transport layer&#8208;free Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs are achieved.Notably, the related monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell also achieves a PCE of 27.03% with outstanding photostability.

         <title>Regulating the Double&#8208;Way Traffic of Cations and Anions in Ambipolar Polymer Cathodes for High&#8208;Performing Aluminum Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bipolar donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type conjugated polymer cathodes with the co&#8208;storage of AlCl4&#8722; and AlCl2+ are designed for aluminum dual&#8208;ion batteries. The regulated double&#8208;way traffic of cation and anion charge carriers through optimal donor/acceptor match enables the resultant polymer cathode to show a high capacity of 205&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, fast kinetics, and function efficiently at high mass loadings, i.e., 100 mg cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The strong Coulombic interactions between Al3+ and traditional inorganic crystalline cathodes present a significant obstacle in developing high&#8208;performance rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) that hold promise for safe and sustainable stationary energy storage. While accommodating chloroaluminate ions (AlCl4&#8722;, AlCl2+, etc.) in redox&#8208;active organic compounds offers a promising solution for RABs, the issues of dissolution and low ionic/electronic conductivities plague the development of organic cathodes. Herein, electron donors are synthetically connected with acceptors to create crosslinked, bipolar&#8208;conjugated polymer cathodes. These cathodes exhibit overlapped redox potential ranges for both donors and acceptors in highly concentrated AlCl3&#8208;based ionic liquid electrolytes. This approach strategically enables on&#8208;site doping of the polymer backbones during redox reactions involving both donor and acceptor units, thereby enhancing the electron/ion transfer kinetics within the resultant polymer cathodes. Based on the optimal donor/acceptor combination, the bipolar polymer cathodes can deliver a high specific capacity of 205&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 by leveraging the co&#8208;storage of AlCl4&#8722; and AlCl2+. The electrodes exhibit excellent rate performance, a stable cycle life of 60&#160;000 cycles, and function efficiently at high mass loadings, i.e., 100&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, and at low temperatures, i.e., &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C. The findings exemplify the exploration of high&#8208;performing conjugated polymer cathodes for RABs through rational structural design.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Thin WS2 Kirigami for Bidirectional Polarization Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art WS2 nano&#8208;kirigami structures with various layer combinations and stacking configurations are synthesized by space&#8208;confined chemical vapor deposition method. With this obtained special stacking structure and unique etching channel, the metasurface is specially designed and integrated to achieve a photodetector with bidirectional polarization&#8208;sensitive detection capability in the infrared spectrum.








Abstract
The assembly and patterning engineering in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials hold importance for chip&#8208;level designs incorporating multifunctional detectors. At present, the patterning and stacking methods of 2D materials inevitably introduce impurity instability and functional limitations. Here, the space&#8208;confined chemical vapor deposition method is employed to achieve state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art kirigami structures of self&#8208;assembled WS2, featuring various layer combinations and stacking configurations. With this technique as a foundation, the WS2 nano&#8208;kirigami is integrated with metasurface design, achieving a photodetector with bidirectional polarization&#8208;sensitive detection capability in the infrared spectrum. Nano&#8208;kirigami can eliminate some of the uncontrollable factors in the processing of 2D material devices, providing a freely designed platform for chip&#8208;level multifunctional detection across multiple modules.

         <title>Intrinsic Out&#8208;Of&#8208;Plane and In&#8208;Plane Ferroelectricity in 2D AgCrS2 with High Curie Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D AgCrS2 with superior ferroelectricity and high Curie temperature are synthesized in large&#8208;scale via chemical vapor deposition growth. The AgCrS2 nanosheet possesses a non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure which endows it with prominent out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane ferroelectric properties, and thus realizing the ferroelectric memory application in AgCrS2 devices. This work opens new prospects for exploring 2D ferroelectrics and accompanying various ferroelectric functional devices.








Abstract
2D ferroelectric materials have attracted extensive research interest due to potential applications in nonvolatile memory, nanoelectronics and optoelectronics. However, the available 2D ferroelectric materials are scarce and most of them are limited by the uncontrollable preparation. Herein, a novel 2D ferroelectric material AgCrS2 is reported that are controllably synthesized in large&#8208;scale via salt&#8208;assist chemical vapor deposition growth. By tuning the growth temperature from 800 to 900&#160;&#176;C, the thickness of AgCrS2 nanosheets can be precisely modulated from 2.1 to 40&#160;nm. Structural and nonlinear optical characterizations demonstrate that AgCrS2 nanosheet crystallizes in a non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure with high crystallinity and remarkable air stability. As a result, AgCrS2 of various thicknesses display robust ferroelectric polarization in both in&#8208;plane (IP) and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OOP)&#160;directions with strong intercorrelation and high ferroelectric phase transition temperature (682 K). Theoretical calculations suggest that the ferroelectricity in AgCrS2 originates from the displacement of Ag atoms in AgS4 tetrahedrons, which changes the dipole moment alignment. Moreover, ferroelectric switching is demonstrated in both lateral and vertical AgCrS2 devices, which exhibit exotic nonvolatile memory behavior with distinct high and low resistance states. This study expands the scope of 2D ferroelectric materials and facilitates the ferroelectric&#8208;based nonvolatile memory applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Osteochondral repair remains a substantial yet elusive challenge, despite decades of efforts on surgical and tissue engineering approaches. This review introduces the frontier trend of cell&#8208;free, scaffold&#8208;assisted modality for in situ osteochondral regeneration. Recent research advances in scaffold&#8208;based engineering are systematically discussed, tailoring a design paradigm evolving from biodegradability to inadaptability, with future directions toward precision medicine and smart healthcare.

Abstract
Over the decades, the management of osteochondral lesions remains a significant yet unmet medical challenge without curative solutions to date. Owing to the complex nature of osteochondral units with multi&#8208;tissues and multicellularity, and inherently divergent cellular turnover capacities, current clinical practices often fall short of robust and satisfactory repair efficacy. Alternative strategies, particularly tissue engineering assisted with biomaterial scaffolds, achieve considerable advances, with the emerging pursuit of a more cost&#8208;effective approach of in situ osteochondral regeneration, as evolving toward cell&#8208;free modalities. By leveraging endogenous cell sources and innate regenerative potential facilitated with instructive scaffolds, promising results are anticipated and being evidenced. Accordingly, a paradigm shift is occurring in scaffold development, from biodegradable and biocompatible to bioadaptable in spatiotemporal control. Hence, this review summarizes the ongoing progress in deploying bioadaptable criteria for scaffold&#8208;based engineering in endogenous osteochondral repair, with emphases on precise control over the scaffolding material, degradation, structure and biomechanics, and surface and biointerfacial characteristics, alongside their distinguished impact on the outcomes. Future outlooks of a highlight on advanced, frontier materials, technologies, and tools tailoring precision medicine and smart healthcare are provided, which potentially paves the path toward the ultimate goal of complete osteochondral regeneration with function restoration.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Exchange Doping of Semiconducting Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion&#8208;exchange doping of semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with small and large bandgaps using AuCl3 as the p&#8208;dopant with a range of electrolyte anions of different sizes is demonstrated. Larger anion size correlates with higher electrical conductivity, which is explained with the reduced depth of the impurity band formed at high doping densities.








Abstract
Semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are a promising thermoelectric material with high power factors after chemical p&#8208; or n&#8208;doping. Understanding the impact of dopant counterions on charge transport and thermoelectric properties of nanotube networks is essential to further optimize doping methods and to develop better dopants. This work utilizes ion&#8208;exchange doping to systematically vary the size of counterions in thin films of small and large diameter, polymer&#8208;sorted semiconducting SWCNTs with AuCl3 as the initial p&#8208;dopant and investigates the impact of ion size on conductivity, Seebeck coefficients, and power factors. Larger anions are found to correlate with higher electrical conductivities and improved doping stability, while no significant effect on the power factors is found. Importantly, the effect of counterion size on the thermoelectric properties of dense SWCNT networks is not obscured by morphological changes upon doping. The observed trends of carrier mobilities and Seebeck coefficients can be explained by a random resistor model for the nanotube network that accounts for overlapping Coulomb potentials leading to the formation of an impurity band whose depth depends on the carrier density and counterion size. These insights can be applied more broadly to understand the thermoelectric properties of doped percolating disordered systems, including semiconducting polymers.

         <title>A Fully Integrated Conformal Wearable Ultrasound Patch for Continuous Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a portable, wearable ultrasound system for continuous sonodynamic therapy. The integration of a multiplexed ultrasonic patch array possesses ability to accurately focus on lesion sites and produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), ultimately driving the extinction of tumor tissue from the inside out. This study provides a promising approach to noninvasively, continuously, and efficiently treat deep tumors.








Abstract
Cancer treatment is a continuous process, that the current therapy cannot meet the requirement well, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Wearable ultrasound device has the potential for continuous sonodynamic therapy due to its portability. However, the miniaturization of ultrasonic probe, system integration of device, and the strategy of continuous treatment are still urgent issues to be addressed. Herein, a portable wearable antitumor system is introduced, which utilizes a custom&#8208;developed multiplexed ultrasonic patch array (CWUS Patch) to accurately focus ultrasound on the lesion site and controllably stimulate sonosensitizer to produce a large amount of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). The system enables dynamic control of the ultrasound patches and allows real&#8208;time adjustments to optimize their performance in various applications, providing greater flexibility and precision in healthcare technology. Furthermore, the excellent penetration property of ultrasound into tumor tissues that induce synchronous apoptosis of tumor cells from the inside out is verified through a mouse model of breast cancer. This fully integrated conformal wearable ultrasound system provides a promising approach to noninvasively, continuously, and efficiently treat deep tumors.

         <title>A Multiferroic Spin&#8208;Crossover Molecular Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first molecular multiferroic crystal of Fe(II) spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) complex is successfully designed to show the coexistence of ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, and SCO behavior. It exhibits a 222F2 type ferroelectric/ferroelastic phase transition accompanied by spatial symmetry breaking and a spin transition involving d orbital breaking.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) ferroelectrics with dual&#8208;function switches have attracted great attention for significant magnetoelectric application prospects. However, the multiferroic crystals with SCO features have rarely been reported. Herein, a molecular multiferroic Fe(II) crystalline complex [FeII(C8&#8208;F&#8208;pbh)2] (1&#8208;F, C8&#8208;F&#8208;pbh = (1Z,N'E)&#8208;3&#8208;F&#8208;4&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethylene)&#8208;benzo&#8208;hydrazonate) showing the coexistence of ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, and SCO behavior is presented for the first time. By H/F substitution, the low phase transition temperature (270&#160;K) of the non&#8208;fluorinated parent compound is significantly increased to 318&#160;K in 1&#8208;F, which exhibits a spatial symmetry breaking 222F2 type ferroelectric phase transition with clear room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity. Besides, 1&#8208;F also displays a spin transition between high&#8208; and low&#8208;spin states, accompanied by the d&#8208;orbital breaking within the t2g4eg2 and t2g6eg&#176; configuration change of octahedrally coordinated FeII center. Moreover, the 222F2 type ferroelectric phase transition is also a ferroelastic one, verified by the ferroelectric domains reversal and the evolution of ferroelastic domains.

&lt;p&gt;The first molecular multiferroic crystal of Fe(II) spin-crossover (SCO) complex is successfully designed to show the coexistence of ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, and SCO behavior. It exhibits a 222F2 type ferroelectric/ferroelastic phase transition accompanied by spatial symmetry breaking and a spin transition involving &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; orbital breaking.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin-crossover (SCO) ferroelectrics with dual-function switches have attracted great attention for significant magnetoelectric application prospects. However, the multiferroic crystals with SCO features have rarely been reported. Herein, a molecular multiferroic Fe(II) crystalline complex [Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-F-pbh)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1-F&lt;/b&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-F-pbh = (1&lt;i&gt;Z,N'E&lt;/i&gt;)-3-F-4-(octyloxy)-&lt;i&gt;N&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;-(pyridin-2-ylmethylene)-benzo-hydrazonate) showing the coexistence of ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, and SCO behavior is presented for the first time. By H/F substitution, the low phase transition temperature (270&#160;K) of the non-fluorinated parent compound is significantly increased to 318&#160;K in &lt;b&gt;1-F&lt;/b&gt;, which exhibits a spatial symmetry breaking 222F2 type ferroelectric phase transition with clear room-temperature ferroelectricity. Besides, &lt;b&gt;1-F&lt;/b&gt; also displays a spin transition between high- and low-spin states, accompanied by the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-orbital breaking within the t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&#176; configuration change of octahedrally coordinated Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; center. Moreover, the 222F2 type ferroelectric phase transition is also a ferroelastic one, verified by the ferroelectric domains reversal and the evolution of ferroelastic domains. To the knowledge, &lt;b&gt;1-F&lt;/b&gt; is the first multiferroic SCO molecular crystal. This unprecedented finding sheds light on the exploration of molecular multistability materials for future smart devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reorganizing Helmholtz Adsorption Plane Enables Sodium Layered&#8208;Oxide Cathode beyond High Oxidation Limits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The configuration of the Helmholtz absorption plane plays an important role in manipulating the structure, composition, distribution, and properties of the derived cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the layered&#8208;oxide cathode. By rearranging the complex and structure of the Helmholtz absorption plane, an anion&#8208;tuned stable CEI can be dynamically constructed to resist attack from high&#8208;oxidation states, thus facilitating long&#8208;term durability.








Abstract
Sodium layered&#8208;oxides (NaxTMO2) sustain severe interfacial stability issues when subjected to battery applications. Particularly at high potential, the oxidation limits including transition metal dissolution and solid electrolyte interphase reformation are intertwined upon the cathode, resulting in poor cycle ability. Herein, by rearranging the complex and structure of the Helmholtz absorption plane adjacent to NaxTMO2 cathodes, the mechanism of constructing stable cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) to push up oxidation limits is clarified. The strong absorbent fluorinated anions replace the solvents into the inner Helmholtz plane, thereby reorganizing the Helmholtz absorption structure and spontaneously inducing anion&#8208;dominated interphase to envelop more active sites for layered oxides. More importantly, such multi&#8208;component CEI proves effective for the long&#8208;term durability of a series of manganese&#8208;based oxide cathodes, which achieves a 1500&#8208;cycles lifetime against high oxidation voltage limit beyond 4.3&#160;V. This work unravels the key role of breaking high&#8208;oxidation limits in attaining higher energy density of layered&#8208;oxide systems.

         <title>Advancing Superconductivity with Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of superconducting materials with high transition temperatures (TC) has sparked intense interest. Efforts have been focused on interfaces of materials, including superconductivity induced at non&#8208;superconducting material interfaces or augmenting TC at the interface between superconducting/non&#8208;superconducting materials. This review explores interfacial and interface&#8208;enhanced superconductivity, and propelling superconductivity research toward practical, high&#8208;temperature applications.








Abstract
The development of superconducting materials has attracted significant attention not only for their improved performance, such as high transition temperature (TC), but also for the exploration of their underlying physical mechanisms. Recently, considerable efforts have been focused on interfaces of materials, a distinct category capable of inducing superconductivity at non&#8208;superconducting material interfaces or augmenting the TC at the interface between a superconducting material and a non&#8208;superconducting material. Here, two distinct types of interfaces along with their unique characteristics are reviewed: interfacial superconductivity and interface&#8208;enhanced superconductivity, with a focus on the crucial factors and potential mechanisms responsible for enhancing superconducting performance. A series of materials systems is discussed, encompassing both historical developments and recent progress from the perspectives of technical innovations and the exploration of new material classes. The overarching goal is to illuminate pathways toward achieving high TC, expanding the potential of superconducting parameters across interfaces, and propelling superconductivity research toward practical, high&#8208;temperature applications.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Catalytic NO/O2 Gas&#8208;Releasing Nanozyme for Radiotherapy Sensitization through Vascular Normalization and Hypoxia Relief</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiotherapy (RT) stands as a cornerstone treatment for nearly all types of cancers, but it is significantly challenged by tumor hypoxia and subsequent radioresistance. This work introduces a pioneering prosthetic&#8208;Arginine coassembled nanozyme system, HRRu&#8208;HFn, designed to counteract these challenges by directly delivering nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen (O2) to the tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT), essential for treating various cancers, faces challenges from tumor hypoxia, which induces radioresistance. A tumor&#8208;targeted &#8220;prosthetic&#8208;Arginine&#8221; coassembled nanozyme system, engineered to catalytically generate nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen (O2) in the tumor microenvironment (TME), overcoming hypoxia and enhancing radiosensitivity is presented. This system integrates the prosthetic heme of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and catalase (CAT) with NO&#8208;donating Fmoc&#8208;protected Arginine and Ru3+ ions, creating HRRu nanozymes that merge NOS and CAT functionalities. Surface modification with human heavy chain ferritin (HFn) improves the targeting ability of nanozymes (HRRu&#8208;HFn) to tumor tissues. In the TME, strategic arginine incorporation within the nanozyme allows autonomous O2 and NO release, triggered by endogenous hydrogen peroxide, elevating NO and O2 levels to normalize vasculature and improve blood perfusion, thus mitigating hypoxia. Employing the intrinsic O2&#8208;transporting ability of heme, HRRu&#8208;HFn nanozymes also deliver O2 directly to the tumor site. Utilizing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma as a tumor model, the studies reveal that the synergistic functions of NO and O2 production, alongside targeted delivery, enable the HRRu&#8208;HFn nanozymes to combat tumor hypoxia and potentiate radiotherapy. This HRRu&#8208;HFn nanozyme based approach holds the potential to reduce the radiation dose required and minimize side effects associated with conventional radiotherapy.

         <title>Emergence of Interfacial Magnetism in Strongly&#8208;Correlated Nickelate&#8208;Titanate Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superlattice pairing of strongly&#8208;correlated LaNiO3 and LaTiO3 triggers interfacial electron transfer from LaTiO3 to LaNiO3, leading to emergent antiferromagnetic order with high magnon energy and exchange interactions at the LaNiO3/LaTiO3 interface. The quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensionality of this interface magnetism opens its potential utilizations in spintronic devices, and makes it resemble the precursor states of superconducting cuprates and nickelates.








Abstract
Strongly&#8208;correlated transition&#8208;metal oxides are widely known for their various exotic phenomena. This is exemplified by rare&#8208;earth nickelates such as LaNiO3, which possess intimate interconnections between their electronic, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom. Their properties can be further enhanced by pairing them in hybrid heterostructures, which can lead to hidden phases and emergent phenomena. An important example is the LaNiO3/LaTiO3 superlattice, where an interlayer electron transfer has been observed from LaTiO3 into LaNiO3 leading to a high&#8208;spin state. However, macroscopic emergence of magnetic order associated with this high&#8208;spin state has so far not been observed. Here, by using muon spin rotation, x&#8208;ray absorption, and resonant inelastic x&#8208;ray scattering, direct evidence of an emergent antiferromagnetic order with high magnon energy and exchange interactions at the LaNiO3/LaTiO3 interface is presented. As the magnetism is purely interfacial, a single LaNiO3/LaTiO3 interface can essentially behave as an atomically thin strongly&#8208;correlated quasi&#8208;2D antiferromagnet, potentially allowing its technological utilization in advanced spintronic devices. Furthermore, its strong quasi&#8208;2D magnetic correlations, orbitally&#8208;polarized planar ligand holes, and layered superlattice design make its electronic, magnetic, and lattice configurations resemble the precursor states of superconducting cuprates and nickelates, but with an S&#8594;1 spin state instead.

         <title>A High Capacity Gas Diffusion Electrode for Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capacity of lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries is limited by the mass transport of O2 throughout the porous positive electrode. Here it is shown that by replacing the binder in the electrode with a polymer that can transport O2, it is possible to reach energy densities that significantly exceed Li&#8208;ion batteries and previously reported Li&#8211;O2 cells.








Abstract
The very high theoretical specific energy of the lithium&#8211;air (Li&#8211;O2) battery (3500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) compared with other batteries makes it potentially attractive, especially for the electrification of flight. While progress has been made in realizing the Li&#8211;air battery, several challenges remain. One such challenge is achieving a high capacity to store charge at the positive electrode at practical current densities, without which Li&#8211;air batteries will not outperform lithium&#8208;ion. The capacity is limited by the mass transport of O2 throughout the porous carbon positive electrode. Here it is shown that by replacing the binder in the electrode by a polymer with the intrinsic ability to transport O2, it is possible to reach capacities as high as 31 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a 300&#160;&#181;m thick electrode. This corresponds to a positive electrode energy density of 2650&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and specific energy of 1716&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, exceeding significantly Li&#8208;ion batteries and previously reported Li&#8211;O2 cells. Due to the enhanced oxygen diffusion imparted by the gas diffusion polymer, Li2O2 (the product of O2 reduction on discharge) fills a greater volume fraction of the electrode and is more homogeneously distributed.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Activated Probiotics Vesicles Coating for Titanium Implant Infections Through Bacterial Cuproptosis&#8208;Like Death and Immunoregulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Researchers develop an innovative coating for titanium implants that combats infections and promotes healing. By combining ultrasound&#8208;activated metal&#8208;organic frameworks and probiotics, the coating triggers bacterial death and immune responses, enhancing antibacterial and bone regeneration effects. This method shows promise for preventing implant&#8208;related infections and promoting recovery, representing a significant advancement in medical implants.








Abstract
Implant&#8208;associated infections (IAIs) are the main cause of prosthetic implant failure. Bacterial biofilms prevent antibiotic penetration, and the unique metabolic conditions in hypoxic biofilm microenvironment may limit the efficacy of conventional antibiotic treatment. Escaping survival bacteria may not be continually eradicated, resulting in the recurrence of IAIs. Herein, a sonosensitive metal&#8208;organic framework of Cu&#8208;TCPP (tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin) nanosheets and tinidazole doped probiotic&#8208;derived membrane vesicles (OMVs) with high&#8208;penetration sonodynamic therapy (SDT), bacterial metabolic state interference, and bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death to eradicate IAIs is proposed. The Cu&#8208;TCPP can convert O2 to toxic 1O2 through SDT in the normoxic conditions, enhancing the hypoxic microenvironment and activating the antibacterial activity of tinidazole. The released Cu(II) under ultrasound can be converted to Cu(I) by exogenous poly(tannic acid) (pTA) and endogenous glutathione. The disruption of the bacterial membrane by SDT can enhance the Cu(I) transporter activity. Transcriptomics indicate that the SDT&#8208;enhanced Cu(I) overload and hypoxia&#8208;activated therapy hinder the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), leading to bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death. Moreover, the OMVs&#8208;activated therapy can polarize macrophages to a M2&#8208;like phenotype and facilitate bone repair. The sonodynamic biofilm microenvironment modulation strategy, whereby the hypoxia&#8208;enhanced microenvironment is potentiated to synergize SDT with OMVs&#8208;activated therapy, provides an effective strategy for antibacterial and osteogenesis performance.

         <title>Regulation of Electron Delocalization Region in 2D Heteroligand&#8208;Based Copper&#8208;Organic Framework to Enhance NH4+$ \rm {NH_{4}}{^+}$ Charge Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heteroligand&#8208;based 2D &#960;&#8208;d conjugated copper&#8208;organic framework has been synthesized by a simple solvothermal method. Benefitting from the effective regulation of electron delocalization by heteroligand and the inherent hydrogen bond cage mechanism between ammonium ions, the as&#8208;prepared heteroligand&#8208;based 2D copper&#8208;organic framework as cathode can realize high&#8208;performance ammonium ion storage in sustainable aqueous ammonium ion batteries.








Abstract
The rechargeable aqueous ammonium ion battery shows great potential in low&#8208;cost energy storage system because of its long life and environmental friendliness. However, most inorganic host materials used in ammonium ion batteries are still limited by slow diffusion kinetics. Herein, it is identified that a 2D heteroligand&#8208;based copper&#8208;organic framework featuring numerous ammonium ion adsorption site in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated periodic skeleton supplies multiple accessible redox&#8208;active sites for high&#8208;performance ammonium storage. Benefitting from the effective regulation of electron delocalization by heteroligand and the inherent hydrogen bond cage mechanism between ammonium ions, the resultant full battery delivers a large specific energy density of 211.84&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, and it can be stably operated for 12000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 for over 80 days. This explanatory understanding provides a new idea for the rational design of high&#8208;performance MOF&#8208;based ammonium ion battery cathode materials for efficient energy storage and conversion in the future.

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Manganese Halides for Advanced Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the latest advancements in the development of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid manganese(II) halides as efficient light&#8208;emitting materials, which covers from their fundamental physicochemical properties to advanced optoelectronic applications, with an emphasis on the structural and functionality design especially for light&#8208;emitting diodes and X&#8208;ray scintillators. Current challenges and future efforts toward this active research field are envisioned.








Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid manganese(II) halides (OIMnHs) have garnered tremendous interest across a wide array of research fields owing to their outstanding optical properties, abundant structural diversity, low&#8208;cost solution processibility, and low toxicity, which make them extremely suitable for use as a new class of luminescent materials for various optoelectronic applications. Over the past years, a plethora of OIMnHs with different structural dimensionalities and multifunctionalities such as efficient photoluminescence (PL), radioluminescence, circularly polarized luminescence, and mechanoluminescence have been newly created by judicious screening of the organic cations and inorganic Mn(II) polyhedra. Specifically, through precise molecular and structural engineering, a series of OIMnHs with near&#8208;unity PL quantum yields, high anti&#8208;thermal quenching properties, and excellent stability in harsh conditions have been devised and explored for applications in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), X&#8208;ray scintillators, multimodal anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and fluorescent sensing. In this review, the latest advancements in the development of OIMnHs as efficient light&#8208;emitting materials are summarized, which&#160;covers from their fundamental physicochemical properties to advanced optoelectronic applications, with an emphasis on the structural and functionality design especially for LEDs and X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. Current challenges and future efforts to unlock the potentials of these promising materials are also envisioned.

All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) have attracted intense interest due to their high theoretical energy density and intrinsic safety. However, constructing durable lithium (Li) metal anodes with high cycling efficiency in ASSLSBs remains challenging due to poor interface stability. Here, a compositionally stable, self&#8208;lithiated tin (Sn)&#8208;carbon (C) composite interlayer (LSCI) between Li anode and solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE), capable of homogenizing Li&#8208;ion transport across the interlayer, mitigating decomposition of SSE, and enhancing electrochemical/structural stability of interface, is developed for ASSLSBs. The LSCI&#8208;mediated Li metal anode enables stable Li plating/stripping over 7000&#160;h without Li dendrite penetration. The ASSLSBs equipped with LSCI thus exhibit excellent cycling stability of over 300 cycles (capacity retention of &#8776;80%) under low applied pressure (&lt;8&#160;MPa) and demonstrate improved rate capability even at 3C. The enhanced electrochemical performance and corresponding insights of the designed LSCI broaden the spectrum of advanced interlayers for interface manipulation, advancing the practical application of ASSLSBs.

         <title>Shape Memory Polymers with Patternable Recovery Onset Regulated by Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A shape memory hydrogel with a photo&#8208;patterned onset time of autonomous shape recovery is prepared. Via introducing photo&#8208;responsive nitrocinnamate groups, thermally induced reversible microphase separation of the material is adjusted, which is responsible for the tunable recovery onset. Consequently, multi&#8208;shape morphing without any external stimulation can be realized, greatly extending the versatility of shape memory polymers.








Abstract
Shape memory polymers (SMPs) show attractive prospects in emerging fields such as soft robots and biomedical devices. Although their typical trigger&#8208;responsive character offers the essential shape&#8208;changing controllability, having to access external stimulation is a major bottleneck toward many applications. Recently emerged autonomous SMPs exhibit unique stimuli&#8208;free shape&#8208;shifting behavior with its controllability achieved via a delayed and programmable recovery onset. Achieving multi&#8208;shape morphing in an arbitrary fashion, however, is infeasible. In this work, a molecular design that allows to spatio&#8208;temporally define the recovery onset of an autonomous shape memory hydrogel (SMH) is reported. By introducing nitrocinnamate groups onto an SMH, its crosslinking density can be adjusted by light. This affects greatly the phase separation kinetics, which is the basis for the autonomous shape memory behavior. Consequently, the recovery onset can be regulated between 0 to 85&#160;min. With masked light, multiple recovery onsets in an arbitrarily defined pattern which correspondingly enable multi&#8208;shape morphing can be realized. This ability to achieve highly sophisticated morphing without relying on any external stimulation greatly extends the versatility of SMPs.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Defect&#8208;Controlled Diffusion in van der Waals Gaps</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
W atom diffusion at van der Waals (vdW) interfaces (BN/WSe2, BN/BN), and on BN surfaces using scanning transmission electron microscopy is visualized. Diffusion is in all cases is governed by intermittent trapping at electron beam&#8208;generated defect sites, suggesting processes that are highly tunable and sensitive to crystal quality. This enables direct visualization of atomic interactions and materials inside vdW heterostructures.








Abstract
Diffusion processes govern fundamental phenomena such as phase transformations, doping, and intercalation in van der Waals (vdW) bonded materials. Here, the diffusion dynamics of W atoms by visualizing the motion of individual atoms at three different vdW interfaces: hexagonal boron nitride (BN)/vacuum, BN/BN, and BN/WSe2, by recording scanning transmission electron microscopy movies is quantified. Supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is inferred that in all cases diffusion is governed by intermittent trapping at electron beam&#8208;generated defect sites. This leads to diffusion properties that depend strongly on the number of defects. These results suggest that diffusion and intercalation processes in vdW materials are highly tunable and sensitive to crystal quality. The demonstration of imaging, with high spatial and temporal resolution, of layers and individual atoms inside vdW heterostructures offers possibilities for direct visualization of diffusion and atomic interactions, as well as for experiments exploring atomic structures, their in situ modification, and electrical property measurements of active devices combined with atomic resolution&#160;imaging.

         <title>Bifunctional Oxygen&#8208;Defect Bismuth Catalyst toward Concerted Production of H2O2 with over 150% Cell Faradaic Efficiency in Continuously Flowing Paired&#8208;Electrosynthesis System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional oxygen&#8208;defect bismuth catalyst, obtained through the in situ electrochemical reconstruction of Bi&#8208;MOF nanorods, is applied as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for both anodic water oxidation reaction and cathodic oxygen reduction reaction, which is capable of promoting a novel continuously flowing paired&#8208;electrosynthesis system for large&#8208;scale and cost&#8208;effective production of H2O2 with over 150% cell Faradaic efficiency.








Abstract
The electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from O2 or H2O via the two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR) or water oxidation (2e&#8722; WOR) reaction provides a green and sustainable alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process. Herein, a paired&#8208;electrosynthesis tactic is reported for concerted H2O2 production at a high rate by coupling the 2e&#8722; ORR and 2e&#8722; WOR, in which the bifunctional oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched Bi2O3 nanorods (Ov&#8208;Bi2O3&#8208;EO), obtained through electrochemically oxidative reconstruction of Bi&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Bi&#8208;MOF) nanorod precursor, are used as both efficient anodic and cathodic electrocatalysts, achieving concurrent H2O2 production at both electrodes with high Faradaic efficiencies. Specifically, the coupled 2e&#8722; ORR//2e&#8722; WOR electrolysis system based on such distinctive oxygen&#8208;defect Bi catalyst displays excellent performance for the paired&#8208;electrosynthesis of H2O2, delivering a remarkable cell Faradaic efficiency of 154.8% and an ultrahigh H2O2 production rate of 4.3 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. Experiments combined with theoretical analysis reveal the crucial role of oxygen vacancies in optimizing the adsorption of intermediates associated with the selective two&#8208;electron reaction pathways, thereby improving the activity and selectivity of the 2e&#8722; reaction processes at both electrodes. This work establishes a new paradigm for developing advanced electrocatalysts and designing novel paired&#8208;electrolysis systems for scalable and sustainable H2O2 electrosynthesis.

         <title>Enhancing the Electrical Conductivity and Long&#8208;Term Stability of PEDOT:PSS Electrodes through Sequential Treatment with Nitric Acid and Cesium Chloride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conductivity of sub&#8208;20&#8208;nm thin poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) films is improved by treating them sequentially with HNO3 and CsCl. The resulting layers show enhanced crystallinity with electrical conductivity of up to 5500 S cm&#8722;1, with 85% of this value being retained after 270 d of storage in ambient air at room temperature without being encapsulated.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is an important polymeric conductor used extensively in organic flexible, wearable, and stretchable optoelectronics. However, further enhancing its conductivity and long&#8208;term stability while maintaining its superb mechanical properties remains challenging. Here, a novel post&#8208;treatment approach to enhance the electrical properties and stability of sub&#8208;20&#8208;nm&#8208;thin PEDOT:PSS films processed from solution is introduced. The approach involves a sequential post&#8208;treatment with HNO3 and CsCl, resulting in a remarkable enhancement of the electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films to over 5500 S cm&#8722;1, along with improved carrier mobility. The post&#8208;treated films exhibit remarkable air stability, retaining over 85% of their initial conductivity even after 270 days of storage. Various characterization techniques, including X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Hall effect measurements, and grazing incidence wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering, coupled with density functional theory calculations, provide insights into the structural changes and interactions responsible for these improvements. To demonstrate the potential for practical applications, the ultrathin PEDOT:PSS films are connected to an inorganic light&#8208;emitting diode with a battery, showcasing their suitability as transparent electrodes. This work presents a promising approach for enhancing the electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS while offering a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms that can guide further advances.

The approach involves a sequential post-treatment with HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CsCl, resulting in a remarkable enhancement of the electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films to over 5500 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, along with improved carrier mobility. The post-treated films exhibit remarkable air stability, retaining over 85% of their initial conductivity even after 270 days of storage. Various characterization techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Hall effect measurements, and grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering, coupled with density functional theory calculations, provide insights into the structural changes and interactions responsible for these improvements. To demonstrate the potential for practical applications, the ultrathin PEDOT:PSS films are connected to an inorganic light-emitting diode with a battery, showcasing their suitability as transparent electrodes. This work presents a promising approach for enhancing the electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS while offering a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms that can guide further advances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sodiophilic Substrate Induces NaF&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interface for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly porous 3D framework with abundant sodiophilic active sites can effectively uniform electric field distribution and reduce nucleation energy barriers. The synergistic interaction between the optimized interfacial solvation structure and the robust NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface layer contributes to a dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anode, significantly prolonging the lifespan of sodium metal batteries.








Abstract
3D substrate with abundant sodiophilic active sites holds promise for implementing dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anodes and high&#8208;performance sodium batteries. However, the heightened electrode/electrolyte side reactions stemming from high specific surface area still hinder electrode structure stability and cycling reversibility, particularly under high current densities. Herein, the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) component is regulated and detrimental side reactions are restrained through the uniform loading of Na&#8211;Sn alloy onto a porous 3D nanofiber framework (NaSn&#8208;PCNF). The strong interaction between Na&#8211;Sn alloy and PF6&#8722; anions facilitates the dissociation of sodium salts and releases more free sodium ions for effective charge transfer. Simultaneously, the modulations of the interfacial electrolyte solvation structure and the construction of a high NaF content SEI layer stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface. NaSn&#8208;PCNF symmetrical battery demonstrates stable cycling for over 600 h with an ultralow overpotential of 24.5&#160;mV under harsh condition of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the full cells and pouch cells exhibit accelerated reaction kinetics and splendid capacity retention, providing valuable insights into the development of advanced Na substrates for high&#8208;energy sodium metal batteries.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Free Upcycling of Poly(Ethylene Terephthalate) Waste to Biodegradable Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optimal approach without the need for additional catalysts or solvents for the upcycling of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) waste is reported. Specifically, bio&#8208;based hydrogenated dimer acids are found to directly convert PET bottles into biodegradable copolyesters suitable for agricultural mulch films. This work provides an environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective strategy for the large&#8208;scale upgrading and reprocessing of PET waste.








Abstract
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is an important polymer with annual output second only to polyethylene. Due to its low biodegradability, a large amount of PET is recycled for sustainable development. However, current strategies for PET recycling are limited by low added value or small product scale. It is urgent to make a breakthrough on the principle of PET macromolecular reaction and efficiently prepare products with high added value and wide applications. Here, the catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free synthesis of biodegradable plastics are reported through novel carboxyl&#8208;ester transesterification between PET waste and bio&#8208;based hydrogenated dimer acid (HDA), which can directly substitute some terephthalic acid (TPA) units in PET chain by HDA unit. This macromolecular reaction can be facilely carried out on current equipment in the polyester industry without any additional catalyst and solvent, thus enabling low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale production. Furthermore, the product semi&#8208;bio&#8208;based copolyester shows excellent mechanical properties, regulable flexibility and good biodegradability, which is expected to substitute poly(butylene adipate&#8208;co&#8208;terephthalate) (PBAT) plastic as high value&#8208;added biodegradable materials. This work provides an environmental&#8208;friendly and economic strategy for the large&#8208;scale upcycling of PET waste.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Quantum Reconfiguration of Oxyhydroxides for Photoanodes with 4.24% Efficiency and Stability Beyond 250 Hours</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting attracts significant interest in converting solar energy into clean hydrogen fuels. A light&#8208;accelerated atomic reconfiguration of NiFe oxyhydroxides&#8208;alloy heterostructure based on NiFe nanofilm is engineered as a catalytic&#8208;protective layer for photoanodes, reporting a record ABPE value of 4.24% in buried homojunction&#8208;free photoanodes and stability over 250 h with above 88% retention of the initial current density.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is attracting significant research interest in addressing sustainable development goals in renewable energy. Current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, however, cannot provide photoanodes with simultaneously high efficiency and long&#8208;lasting lifetime. Here, large&#8208;scale NiFe oxyhydroxides&#8208;alloy hybridized co&#8208;catalyst layer that exhibits an applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (ABPE) of 4.24% in buried homojunction&#8208;free photoanodes and stability over 250 h is reported. These performances represent an increase over the present highest&#8208;performing technology by 408% in stability and the most stable competitor by over 330% in efficiency. These results originate from a previously unexplored mechanism of light&#8208;induced atomic reconfiguration, which rapidly self&#8208;generates a catalytic&#8208;protective amorphous/crystalline heterostructure at low biases. This mechanism provides active sites for reaction and insulates the photoanode from performance degradation. Photon&#8208;generated NiFe oxyhydroxides are more than 200% higher than the quantity that pure electrocatalysis would otherwise induce, overcoming the threshold for an efficient water oxidation reaction in the device. While of immediate interest in the industry of water splitting, the light&#8208;induced NiFe oxyhydroxides&#8208;alloy co&#8208;catalyst developed in this work provides a general strategy to enhance further the performances and stability of PEC devices for a vast panorama of chemical reactions, ranging from biomass valorization to organic waste degradation, and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.

         <title>Calcium Hexacyanoferrate (III) Nanocatalyst Enables Redox Homeostasis for Autism Spectrum Disorder Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a multifaced neurodevelopmental disorder with considerable heterogeneity. Oxidative stress is a critical pathological feature of ASD, contributing to neuronal damage and inflammation due to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS). Herein a pioneering intervention, calcium hexacyanoferrate (III) nanocatalysts (CaH NCs), a distinct catalytic nanoenzyme designed for ASD treatment is unveiled. By mitigating oxidative stress, impeding cellular apoptosis, and fostering an anti&#8208;inflammatory environment within the neural milieu, CaH NCs play a pivotal role in alleviating autism&#8208;like behaviors in animal models of ASD.








Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a multifaced neurodevelopmental disorder with considerable heterogeneity, in which over&#8208;generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce a cascade of pathological changes, including cellular apoptosis and inflammatory responses. Given the complex etiology of ASD, no effective treatment is available for ASD. In this work, a specific catalytic nanoenzyme, calcium hexacyanoferrate (III) nanocatalysts (CaH NCs), is designed and engineered for efficient ASD treatment. CaH NCs can mimic the activities of natural enzymes including superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, which mitigates intracellular excessive ROS and regulates redox equilibrium. These CaH NCs modulate mitochondrial membrane potential, elevate B&#8208;cell lymphoma&#8208;2 levels, and suppress pro&#8208;apoptotic proteins, including Caspase&#8208;3 and B&#8208;cell lymphoma&#8208;2&#8208;associated X, thus effectively reducing cellular apoptosis. Importantly, CaH NCs alleviate inflammation by upregulating anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokine interleukin&#8208;10 and downregulating pro&#8208;inflammatory factors, resulting in attenuated activation of microglial and astrocytic and subsequent reduction in neuroinflammation. Subsequently, CaH NCs enhance social abilities, decrease anxiety levels, ameliorate repetitive behaviors, and improve learning and memory in ASD animal models through inflammation regulation and apoptosis inhibition. The CaH NCs in managing and preventing ASD represents a paradigm shift in autism treatment, paving the alternative but efficient way for clinical interventions in neurological conditions.

         <title>Advanced Anti&#8208;Icing Strategies and Technologies by Macrostructured Photothermal Storage Superhydrophobic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective reviews the cutting&#8208;edge progress of superhydrophobic surfaces in anti&#8208;icing and proposes a unique concept of smart surfaces, termed the macrostructured photothermal storage superhydrophobic (MPSS) surfaces, for all&#8208;day efficient anti&#8208;icing. The MPSS surfaces integrate the functions of macrostructured superhydrophobic surfaces, photothermal materials, and energy storage materials, and shall be applied in diverse anti&#8208;icing scenarios.








Abstract
Water is the source of life and civilization, but water icing causes catastrophic damage to human life and diverse industrial processes. Currently, superhydrophobic surfaces (inspired by the lotus effect) aided anti&#8208;icing attracts intensive attention due to their energy&#8208;free property. Here, recent advances in anti&#8208;icing by design and functionalization of superhydrophobic surfaces are reviewed. The mechanisms and advantages of conventional, macrostructured, and photothermal superhydrophobic surfaces are introduced in turn. Conventional superhydrophobic surfaces, as well as macrostructured ones, easily lose the icephobic property under extreme conditions, while photothermal superhydrophobic surfaces strongly rely on solar illumination. To address the above issues, a potentially smart strategy is found by developing macrostructured photothermal storage superhydrophobic (MPSS) surfaces, which integrate the functions of macrostructured superhydrophobic materials, photothermal materials, and phase change materials (PCMs), and are expected to achieve all&#8208;day anti&#8208;icing in various fields. Finally, the latest achievements in developing MPSS surfaces, showcasing their immense potential, are highlighted. Besides, the perspectives on the future development of MPSS surfaces are provided and the problems that need to be solved in their practical applications are proposed.

         <title>Reprograming Clots for In Vivo Chemical Targeting in Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a novel targeting strategy for traumatic brain injury, R. Kandell, J. Wu, and E. Kwon utilize in vivo click chemistry to reprogram the fibrin clot for secondary targeting of intravenously delivered nanomaterials. Strained cyclooctynes are engineered on the clot for subsequent capture and retention of circulating azide&#8208;modified materials, including a small molecule, 8&#8208;arm PEG nanomaterial, and therapeutic antioxidant protein.








Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a critical public health concern, yet there are no therapeutics available to improve long&#8208;term outcomes. Drug delivery to TBI remains a challenge due to the blood&#8208;brain barrier and increased intracranial pressure. In this work, a chemical targeting approach to improve delivery of materials to the injured brain, is developed. It is hypothesized that the provisional fibrin matrix can be harnessed as an injury&#8208;specific scaffold that can be targeted by materials via click chemistry. To accomplish this, the brain clot is engineered in situ by delivering fibrinogen modified with strained cyclooctyne (SCO) moieties, which incorporated into the injury lesion and is retained there for days. Improved intra&#8208;injury capture and retention of diverse, clickable azide&#8208;materials including a small molecule azide&#8208;dye, 40&#160;kDa azide&#8208;PEG nanomaterial, and a therapeutic azide&#8208;protein in multiple dosing regimens is subsequently observed. To demonstrate therapeutic translation of this approach, a reduction in reactive oxygen species levels in the injured brain after delivery of the antioxidant catalase, is achieved. Further, colocalization between azide and SCO&#8208;fibrinogen is specific to the brain over off&#8208;target organs. Taken together, a chemical targeting strategy leveraging endogenous clot formation is established which can be applied to improve therapeutic delivery after TBI.

         <title>Stable n&#8208;Type Perylene Derivative Ladder Polymer with Antiambipolarity for Electrically Reconfigurable Organic Logic Gates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;type, &#960;&#8208;extended poly(benzimidazoanthradiisoquinolinedione) ladder polymer with good backbone planarity, predominant edge&#8208;on packing, and porous structure exhibits excellent mixed ionic&#8208;electronic transport properties and enables high&#8208;performing organic electrochemical transistor (OECT). Additionally, the OECT shows stable reversible antiambipolar characteristics. Electrically reconfigurable logic gates, with the dynamic capability of realizing AND, NOR, OR, and NAND gates are accomplished with this single polymer.









Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are one of the promising building blocks to realize next&#8208;generation bioelectronics. To date, however, the performance and signal processing capabilities of these devices remain limited by their stability and speed. Herein, the authors demonstrate stable and fast n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors based on a side&#8208;chain&#8208;free ladder polymer, poly(benzimidazoanthradiisoquinolinedione). The device demonstrated fast normalized transient speed of 0.56 &#177; 0.17 ms&#160;um&#8722;2 and excellent long&#8208;term stability in aqueous electrolytes, with no significant drop in its doping current after 50&#8239;000 successive doping/dedoping cycles and 2&#8208;month storage at ambient conditions. These unique characteristics make this polymer especially suitable for bioelectronics, such as being used as a pull&#8208;down channel in a complementary inverter for long&#8208;term stable detection of electrophysiological signals. Moreover, the developed device shows a reversible anti&#8208;ambipolar behavior, enabling reconfigurable electronics to be realized using a single material. These results go beyond the conventional OECT and demonstrate the potential of OECTs to exhibit dynamically configurable functionalities for next&#8208;generation reconfigurable electronics.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Functionalized Microgels as Artificial Antigen&#8208;Presenting Cells to Regulate Expansion of T Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microgels are fabricated as artificial antigen&#8208;presenting cells (aAPCs) to present stimulatory ligands specifically on the surface. Surface&#8208;specific functionalization is achieved via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer coatings, forming a thin but dense polymer layer on the surface. Microgels modified with appropriate ligands promote polyclonal and antigen&#8208;specific T cell expansion and regulate T cell phenotype and function.








Abstract
Artificial antigen&#8208;presenting cells (aAPCs) are currently used to manufacture T cells for adoptive therapy in cancer treatment, but a readily tunable and modular system can enable both rapid T cell expansion and control over T cell phenotype. Here, it is shown that microgels with tailored surface biochemical properties can serve as aAPCs to mediate T cell activation and expansion. Surface functionalization of microgels is achieved via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer coating using oppositely charged polymers, forming a thin but dense polymer layer on the surface. This facile and versatile approach is compatible with a variety of coating polymers and allows efficient and flexible surface&#8208;specific conjugation of defined peptides or proteins. The authors demonstrate that tethering appropriate stimulatory ligands on the microgel surface efficiently activates T cells for polyclonal and antigen&#8208;specific expansion. The expansion, phenotype, and functional outcome of primary mouse and human T cells can be regulated by modulating the concentration, ratio, and distribution of stimulatory ligands presented on microgel surfaces as well as the stiffness and viscoelasticity of the microgels.

         <title>Visualizing the Internal Nanocrystallinity of Calcite Due to Nonclassical Crystallization by 3D Coherent X&#8208;Ray Diffraction Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcite particles are synthesized using two approaches and their 3D internal crystalline structure is characterized using coherent X&#8208;ray imaging. A defects&#8217; analysis reveals the existence of multiple domains for the samples synthesized under nonequilibrium conditions with the presence of null electron density regions, while the particles synthesized under near&#8208;equilibrium conditions show a much less defective structure.








Abstract
The internal crystallinity of calcite is investigated for samples synthesized using two approaches: precipitation from solution and the ammonium carbonate diffusion method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses reveal that the calcite products precipitated using both approaches have a well&#8208;defined rhombohedron shape, consistent with the euhedral crystal habit of the mineral. The internal structure of these calcite crystals is characterized using Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) to determine the 3D electron density and the atomic displacement field. BCDI reconstructions for crystals synthesized using the ammonium carbonate diffusion approach have the expected euhedral shape, with internal strain fields and few internal defects. In contrast, the crystals synthesized by precipitation from solution have very complex external shapes and defective internal structures, presenting null electron density regions and pronounced displacement field distributions. These heterogeneities are interpreted as multiple crystalline domains, created by a nonclassical crystallization mechanism, where smaller nanoparticles coalescence into the final euhedral particles. The combined use of SEM, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and BCDI allows for structurally differentiating calcite crystals grown with different approaches, opening new opportunities to understand how grain boundaries and internal defects alter calcite reactivity.

Magnetic navigation systems (MNS) facilitate minimally invasive procedures but face cost and infrastructure constraints. The Navion, a portable electromagnetic system, addresses these issues by generating a large magnetic field and is easily deployable in hospitals. It aids in the adoption of magnetically responsive medical devices, demonstrated through in vitro and in vivo experiments navigating various microstructures and catheters for medical procedures.








Abstract
Magnetic navigation systems are used to precisely manipulate magnetically responsive materials enabling the realization of new minimally invasive procedures using magnetic medical devices. Their widespread applicability has been constrained by high infrastructure demands and costs. The study reports on a portable electromagnetic navigation system, the Navion, which is capable of generating a large magnetic field over a large workspace. The system is easy to install in hospital operating rooms and transportable through health care facilities, aiding in the widespread adoption of magnetically responsive medical devices. First, the design and implementation approach for the system are introduced and its performance is characterized. Next, in vitro navigation of different microrobot structures is demonstrated using magnetic field gradients and rotating magnetic fields. Spherical permanent magnets, electroplated cylindrical microrobots, microparticle swarms, and magnetic composite bacteria&#8208;inspired helical structures are investigated. The navigation of magnetic catheters is also demonstrated in two challenging endovascular tasks: 1) an angiography procedure and 2) deep navigation within the circle of Willis. Catheter navigation is demonstrated in a porcine model in vivo to perform an angiography under magnetic guidance.</dc:description>

         <title>Microneedle&#8208;Mediated Delivery of Immunomodulators Restores Immune Privilege in Hair Follicles and Reverses Immune&#8208;Mediated Alopecia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alopecia areata is a condition characterized by hair loss due to autoimmunity. Expansion of endogenous regulatory T cells (Tregs) at the site of antigen encounter can restore the skin immune balance. Here, a hydrogel microneedle is utilized to amplify Tregs in a murine model of alopecia leading to sustained hair regrowth without engendering peripheral immunosuppression. This approach could reshape the landscape of autoimmune skin disease management.








Abstract
Disorders in the regulatory arm of the adaptive immune system result in autoimmune&#8208;mediated diseases. While systemic immunosuppression is the prevailing approach to manage them, it fails to achieve long&#8208;lasting remission due to concomitant suppression of the regulatory arm and carries the risk of heightened susceptibility to infections and malignancies. Alopecia areata is a condition characterized by localized hair loss due to autoimmunity. The accessibility of the skin allows&#160;local rather than systemic intervention to avoid broad immunosuppression. It is hypothesized that the expansion of endogenous regulatory T cells (Tregs) at the site of antigen encounter can restore the immune balance and generate a long&#8208;lasting tolerogenic response. A hydrogel microneedle (MN) patch is therefore utilized for delivery of CCL22, a Treg&#8208;chemoattractant, and IL&#8208;2, a Treg&#160;survival factor to amplify them. In an immune&#8208;mediated murine model of alopecia, local bolstering of Treg&#160;numbers is shown, leading to sustained hair regrowth and attenuation of inflammatory pathways. In a humanized skin transplant mouse model, expansion of Tregs within human skin is confirmed without engendering peripheral immunosuppression. The patch offers high&#8208;loading capacity and shelf&#8208;life stability for prospective clinical translation. By harmonizing immune responses locally, the aim is to reshape the landscape of autoimmune skin disease management.

         <title>Antiferroelectric Ceramics for Energy&#8208;Efficient Capacitors by Theory&#8208;Guided Discovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;perfect charge&#8211;discharge energy efficiency, 98.2%, is observed in a PbZrO3&#8208;based antiferroelectric ceramic. The compositions with such compatible antiferroelectric&#8211;ferroelectric phase transitions are discovered by theory&#8208;guided high&#8208;throughput synthesis. The almost eliminated electric hysteresis is a result of minimized lattice mismatch strain at the interface during phase transition. The highly energy&#8208;efficient capacitor also exhibits 80 times enhancement in service lifetime.








Abstract
Antiferroelectric ceramics, via the electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced antiferroelectric (AFE)&#8211;ferroelectric (FE) phase transitions, show great promise for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density capacitors. Yet, currently, only 70&#8211;80% energy release is found during a charge&#8211;discharge cycle. Here, for PbZrO3&#8208;based oxides, geometric nonlinear theory of martensitic phase transitions is applied (first used to guide supercompatible shape&#8208;memory alloys) to predict the reversibility of the AFE&#8211;FE transition by using density&#8208;functional theory to assess AFE/FE interfacial lattice&#8208;mismatch strain that assures ultralow electric hysteresis and extended fatigue lifetime. A good correlation of mismatch strain with electric hysteresis, hence, with energy efficiency of AFE capacitors is observed. Guided by theory, high&#8208;throughput material search is conducted and AFE compositions with a near&#8208;perfect charge&#8211;discharge energy efficiency (98.2%), i.e., near&#8208;zero hysteresis are discovered. And the fatigue life of the capacitor reaches 79.5 million charge&#8211;discharge cycles, a factor of 80 enhancement over AFE ceramics with large electric hysteresis.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Engineering Enables Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Exhibiting BT.2020 Color Gamut</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, an effective approach is proposed to design deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence&#160;molecules based on hybrid long&#8208; and short&#8208;range charge&#8208;transfer by incorporating multiple donor moieties into organoboron multiple resonance acceptors. The resulting molecule exhibits deep&#8208;blue emission, narrow spectra, and high reverse intersystem crossing&#160;rate. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode fabricated with the designed molecule records maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.8% with the Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage&#160;coordinates of (0.163, 0.046).








Abstract
Organic luminescent materials that exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) can convert non&#8208;emissive triplet excitons into emissive singlet states through a reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. Therefore, they have tremendous potential for applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, with the development of ultra&#8208;high definition 4K/8K display technologies, designing efficient deep&#8208;blue TADF materials to achieve the Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates fulfilling BT.2020 remains a significant challenge. Here, an effective approach is proposed to design deep&#8208;blue TADF molecules based on hybrid long&#8208; and short&#8208;range charge&#8208;transfer by incorporation of multiple donor moieties into organoboron multiple resonance acceptors. The resulting TADF molecule exhibits deep&#8208;blue emission at 414&#160;nm with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29&#160;nm, together with a thousand&#8208;fold increase in RISC rate. OLEDs based on the champion material achieve a record maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.8% with CIE coordinates of (0.163, 0.046), approaching the coordinates of the BT.2020 blue standard. Moreover, TADF&#8208;assisted fluorescence devices employing the designed material as a sensitizer exhibit an exceptional EQE of 33.1%. This work thus provides a blueprint for future development of efficient deep&#8208;blue TADF emitters, representing an important milestone towards meeting the blue color gamut standard of BT.2020.

         <title>Wearable Coaxially&#8208;Shielded Metamaterial for Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drawing inspiration from commercial coaxial cable, a wireless, flexible, lightweight, and cheap metamaterial with an internal coaxially&#8208;shielded structure, confining electric field within while possessing a predominant magnetic response for magnetic resonance imaging is constructed. The metamaterial is capable of achieving a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio comparable to or surpass that of commercial receive coil arrays in some aspects.








Abstract
Recent advancements in metamaterials have yielded the possibility of a wireless solution to improve signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Unlike traditional closely packed local coil arrays with rigid designs and numerous components, these lightweight, cost&#8208;effective metamaterials eliminate the need for radio frequency cabling, baluns, adapters, and interfaces. However, their clinical adoption is limited by their low sensitivity, bulky physical footprint, and limited, specific use cases. Herein, a wearable metamaterial developed using commercially available coaxial cable, designed for a 3.0&#160;T MRI system is introduced. This metamaterial inherits the coaxially&#8208;shielded structure of its constituent cable, confining the electric field within and mitigating coupling to its surroundings. This ensures safer clinical adoption, lower signal loss, and resistance to frequency shifts. Weighing only 50&#160;g, the metamaterial maximizes its sensitivity by conforming to the anatomical region of interest. MRI images acquired using this metamaterial with various pulse sequences achieve an SNR comparable or even surpass that of a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 16&#8208;channel knee coil. This work introduces a novel paradigm for constructing metamaterials in the MRI environment, paving the way for the development of next&#8208;generation wireless MRI technology.

         <title>Temperature Dependence of Relativistic Valence Band Splitting Induced by an Altermagnetic Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Altermagnets exhibit momentum&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;split states providing new opportunities for spin electronic devices. Through temperature&#8208;dependent angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and disordered local moment calculations, it is demonstrated that the relativistic valence band splitting of the prototypical MnTe altermagnet is of magnetic origin. This is attributed to a novel relativistic spin&#8208;splitting phenomenon concurrent with the establishment of the altermagnetic order below the N&#233;el temperature.








Abstract
Altermagnetic (AM) materials exhibit non&#8208;relativistic, momentum&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;split states, ushering in new opportunities for spin electronic devices. While the characteristics of spin&#8208;splitting are documented within the framework of the non&#8208;relativistic spin group symmetry, there is limited exploration of the inclusion of relativistic symmetry and its impact on the emergence of a novel spin&#8208;splitting in the band structure. This study delves into the intricate relativistic electronic structure of an AM material, &#945;&#8722;MnTe. Employing temperature&#8208;dependent angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy across the AM phase transition, the emergence of a relativistic valence band splitting concurrent with the establishment of magnetic order is elucidated. This discovery is validated through disordered local moment calculations, modeling the influence of magnetic order on the electronic structure and confirming the magnetic origin of the observed splitting. The temperature&#8208;dependent splitting is ascribed to the advent of relativistic spin&#8208;splitting resulting from the strengthening of AM order in &#945;&#8722;MnTe as the temperature decreases. This sheds light on a previously unexplored facet of this intriguing material.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Crack Formation on DNA Film via Organic Solvent&#8208;Induced Dehydration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orientation control is possible for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in a hydrated state, and this affects to create cracks induced by drying. A method is for controlled crack generation in oriented DNA films by inducing mechanical fractures through organic solvent&#8208;induced dehydration (OSID). The straightforward approach devised for aligning cracks has the potential for use in various patterning applications.








Abstract
Crack is found on the soil when severe drought comes, which inspires the idea to rationalize patterning applications using dried deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) film. DNA is one of the massively produced biomaterials in nature, showing the lyotropic liquid crystal (LC) phase in highly concentrated conditions. DNA nanostructures in the hydrated condition can be orientation controlled, which can be extended to make dryinginduced cracks. The controlled crack generation in oriented DNA films by inducing mechanical fracture through organic solvent&#8208;induced dehydration (OSID) using tetrahydrofuran (THF) is explored. The corresponding simulations show a strong correlation between the long axis of DNA due to the shrinkage during the dehydration and in the direction of crack propagation. The cracks are controlled by simple brushing and a 3D printing method. This facile way of aligning cracks will be used in potential patterning applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Ceramics Enhanced Droplet Electricity Generator for Energy Harvesting and Bacterial Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper presents a novel method to enhance output of droplet electricity generator (DEG) by high entropy ceramics. Further development is made in expanding the application scope of high&#8208;output DEG, not only enhancing energy harvesting efficiency but also promoting the development of single&#8208;droplet&#8208;electricity&#8208;generator&#8208;based biosensors.









Abstract
The droplet electricity generator (DEG) is a solid&#8211;liquid triboelectric nanogenerator with transistor&#8208;inspired bulk effect, which is regarded as an effective strategy for raindrop energy harvesting. However, further enhancement of DEG output voltage is necessary to enable its widespread applications. Here, high&#8208;entropy ceramics are integrated into the design of DEG intermediate layer for the first time, achieving a high output voltage of 525 V. High&#8208;entropy ceramics have colossal dielectric constant, which can help to reduce the triboelectric charge decay for DEG. Furthermore, the effect of factors on DEG output performance when employing high&#8208;entropy ceramics as the intermediate layer is extensively analyzed, and the underlying mechanisms and mathematical models are explored. Finally, the enhanced output voltage of DEG not only facilitates faster energy harvesting but also develops a novel method for rapid bacterial detection. This work successfully integrates high&#8208;entropy ceramics into DEG design, significantly enhances the output voltage, and offers a novel direction for DEG development.

         <title>Enhanced Oxygen Evolution and Zinc&#8208;Air Battery Performance via Electronic Spin Modulation in Heterostructured Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic spin modulation by magnetic heterojunctions facilitates spin&#8208;selected charge transport, optimizes the reaction kinetics, and decreases the energy barrier to the evolution of oxygen, without the need for an external magnetic field.








Abstract
Beyond optimizing electronic energy levels, the modulation of the electronic spin configuration is an effective strategy, often overlooked, to boost activity and selectivity in a range of catalytic reactions, including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This electronic spin modulation is frequently accomplished using external magnetic fields, which makes it impractical for real applications. Herein, spin modulation is achieved by engineering Ni/MnFe2O4 heterojunctions, whose surface is reconstructed into NiOOH/MnFeOOH during the OER. NiOOH/MnFeOOH shows a high spin state of Ni, which regulates the OH&#8722; and O2 adsorption energy and enables spin alignment of oxygen intermediates. As a result, NiOOH/MnFeOOH electrocatalysts provide excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 261 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Besides, rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries based on Ni/MnFe2O4 show a high open circuit potential of 1.56 V and excellent stability for more than 1000 cycles. This outstanding performance is rationalized using density functional theory calculations, which show that the optimal spin state of both Ni active sites and oxygen intermediates facilitates spin&#8208;selected charge transport, optimizes the reaction kinetics, and decreases the energy barrier to the evolution of oxygen. This study provides valuable insight into spin polarization modulation by heterojunctions enabling the design of next&#8208;generation OER catalysts with boosted performance.

         <title>Endothermic Charge Separation Occurs Spontaneously in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptor/Polymer Bulk Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endothermic charge separation is found to occur spontaneously in a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA)&#8208;based bulk heterostructure (PM6:Y6), which can be driven by entropy. This process can produce free carriers even with a small interfacial energy level offset, which can contribute to the high performance found in recent NFA organic photovoltaics.








Abstract
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) based on non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have achieved a power conversion efficiency close to 20%. These NFA OPVs can generate free carriers efficiently despite a very small energy level offset at the donor/acceptor interface. Why these NFAs can enable efficient charge separation (CS) with low energy losses remains an open question. Here, the CS process in the PM6:Y6 bulk heterojunction is probed by time&#8208;resolved two&#8208;photon photoemission spectroscopy. It is found that the CS, the conversion from bound charge transfer (CT) excitons to free carriers, is an endothermic process with an enthalpy barrier of 0.15&#160;eV. The CS can occur spontaneously despite being an endothermic process, which implies that it is driven by entropy. It is further argued that the morphology of the PM6:Y6 film and the anisotropic electron delocalization restrict the electron and hole wavefunctions within the CT exciton such that they can primarily contact each other through point&#8208;like junctions. This configuration can maximize the entropic driving force.

         <title>Elevating Charge Transport Layer for Stable Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique nanostructure of elevated hole transport layer between the perovskite grains is introduced to effectively inhibit ion migration in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes, achieving a record operational half&#8208;lifetime of 256 and 1774 h under current densities of 100 and 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#65292; respectively.








Abstract
Ion migration is a major factor affecting the long term stability of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), which limits their commercialization potential. The accumulation of excess halide ions at the grain boundaries of perovskite films is a primary cause of ion migration in these devices. Here, it is demonstrated that the channels of ion migrations can be effectively impeded by elevating the hole transport layer between the perovskite grain boundaries, resulting in highly stable perovskite LEDs. The unique structure is achieved by reducing the wettability of the perovskites, which prevents infiltration of the upper hole&#8208;transporting layer into the spaces of perovskite grain boundaries. Consequently, nanosized gaps are formed between the excess halide ions and the hole transport layer, effectively suppressing ion migration. With this structure, perovskite LEDs with operational half&#8208;lifetimes of 256 and 1774 h under current densities of 100 and 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 respectively are achieved. These lifetimes surpass those of organic LEDs at high brightness. It is further found that this approach can be extended to various perovskite LEDs, showing great promise for promoting perovskite LEDs toward commercial applications.

         <title>Bioinspired Superhydrophobic All&#8208;In&#8208;One Coating for Adaptive Thermoregulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the longitudinal gradient and surface structure of the lotus leaf, this study presents an all&#8208;in&#8208;one coating that integrates superhydrophobicity, thermal&#8208;responsive sunlight reflectivity, and high infrared emission through a simple one&#8208;step process. The coating enables automatic transitions between radiative cooling and solar warming, preventing overcooling and contamination, offering a novel approach for large&#8208;scale production of smart thermoregulatory coatings.








Abstract
The development of scalable and passive coatings that can adapt to seasonal temperature changes while maintaining superhydrophobic self&#8208;cleaning functions is crucial for their practical applications. However, the incorporation of passive cooling and heating functions with conflicting optical properties in a superhydrophobic coating is still challenging. Herein, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one coating inspired by the hierarchical structure of a lotus leaf that combines surface wettability, optical structure, and temperature self&#8208;adaptation is obtained through a simple one&#8208;step phase separation process. This coating exhibits an asymmetrical gradient structure with surface&#8208;embedded hydrophobic SiO2 particles and subsurface thermochromic microcapsules within vertically distributed hierarchical porous structures. Moreover, the coating imparts superhydrophobicity, high infrared emission, and thermo&#8208;switchable sunlight reflectivity, enabling autonomous transitions between radiative cooling and solar warming. The all&#8208;in&#8208;one coating prevents contamination and over&#8208;cooling caused by traditional radiative cooling materials, opening up new prospects for the large&#8208;scale manufacturing of intelligent thermoregulatory coatings.

The cloaking system integrates with a perception&#8208;decision&#8208;control&#8208;execution operation loop, which mainly contains external sensors, high&#8208;performance metasurfaces, and hybrid inverse optimization strategy.

Abstract
A crucial aspect in shielding a variety of advanced electronic devices from electromagnetic detection involves controlling the flow of electromagnetic waves, akin to invisibility cloaks. Decades ago, the exploration of transformation optics heralded the dawn of modern invisibility cloaks, which has stimulated immense interest across various physical scenarios. However, most prior research is simplified to low&#8208;dimensional and stationary hidden objects, limiting their practical applicability in a dynamically changing world. This study develops a 3D large&#8208;scale intelligent cloak capable of remaining undetectable even in non&#8208;stationary conditions. By employing thousand&#8208;level reconfigurable full&#8208;polarization metasurfaces, this work has achieved an exceptionally high degree of freedom in sculpting the scattering waves as desired. Serving as the core computational unit, a hybrid inverse design enables the cloaked vehicle to respond in real&#8208;time, with a rapid reaction time of just 70&#160;ms. These experiments integrate the cloaked vehicle with a perception&#8208;decision&#8208;control&#8208;execution system and evaluate its performance under random static positions and dynamic travelling trajectories, achieving a background scattering matching degree of up to 93.3%. These findings establish a general paradigm for the next generation of intelligent meta&#8208;devices in real&#8208;world settings, potentially paving the way for an era of &#8220;Electromagnetic Internet of Things.&#8221;

         <title>Neutrophil Extracellular Traps&#8208;Inhibiting and Fouling&#8208;Resistant Polysulfoxides Potently Prevent Postoperative Adhesion, Tumor Recurrence, and Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wang and colleagues have crafted and evaluated a sulfoxide&#8208;containing homopolymer, PMeSEA, distinguished by its pronounced fouling resistance and the capability to inhibit neutrophil extracellular traps. These properties endow PMeSEA with the inherent capacity to simultaneously prevent a spectrum of postoperative complications, including postoperative adhesion, tumor recurrence, and metastasis.








Abstract
Peritoneal metastasis (PM) is considered one of the most dreaded forms of cancer metastases for both patients and physicians. Aggressive cytoreductive surgery (CRS) is the primary treatment for peritoneal metastasis. Unfortunately, this intensive treatment frequently causes clinical complications, such as postoperative recurrence, metastasis, and adhesion formation. Emerging evidence suggests that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) released by inflammatory neutrophils contribute to these complications. Effective NET&#8208;targeting strategies thus show considerable potential in counteracting these complications but remain challenging. Here, one type of sulfoxide&#8208;containing homopolymer, PMeSEA, with potent fouling&#8208;resistant and NET&#8208;inhibiting capabilities, is synthesized and screened. Hydrating sulfoxide groups endow PMeSEA with superior nonfouling ability, significantly inhibiting protein/cell adhesion. Besides, the polysulfoxides can be selectively oxidized by ClO&#8722; which is required to stabilize the NETs rather than H2O2, and ClO&#8722; scavenging effectively inhibits NETs formation without disturbing redox homeostasis in tumor cells and quiescent neutrophils. As a result, PMeSEA potently prevents postoperative adhesions, significantly suppresses peritoneal metastasis, and shows synergetic antitumor activity with chemotherapeutic 5&#8208;Fluorouracil. Moreover, coupling CRS with PMeSEA potently inhibits CRS&#8208;induced tumor metastatic relapse and postoperative adhesions. Notably, PMeSEA exhibits low in vivo acute and subacute toxicities, implying significant potential for clinical postoperative adjuvant treatment.

     alt="Neutrophil Extracellular Traps-Inhibiting and Fouling-Resistant Polysulfoxides Potently Prevent Postoperative Adhesion, Tumor Recurrence, and Metastasis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang and colleagues have crafted and evaluated a sulfoxide-containing homopolymer, PMeSEA, distinguished by its pronounced fouling resistance and the capability to inhibit neutrophil extracellular traps. These properties endow PMeSEA with the inherent capacity to simultaneously prevent a spectrum of postoperative complications, including postoperative adhesion, tumor recurrence, and metastasis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peritoneal metastasis (PM) is considered one of the most dreaded forms of cancer metastases for both patients and physicians. Aggressive cytoreductive surgery (CRS) is the primary treatment for peritoneal metastasis. Unfortunately, this intensive treatment frequently causes clinical complications, such as postoperative recurrence, metastasis, and adhesion formation. Emerging evidence suggests that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) released by inflammatory neutrophils contribute to these complications. Effective NET-targeting strategies thus show considerable potential in counteracting these complications but remain challenging. Here, one type of sulfoxide-containing homopolymer, PMeSEA, with potent fouling-resistant and NET-inhibiting capabilities, is synthesized and screened. Hydrating sulfoxide groups endow PMeSEA with superior nonfouling ability, significantly inhibiting protein/cell adhesion. Besides, the polysulfoxides can be selectively oxidized by ClO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; which is required to stabilize the NETs rather than H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ClO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; scavenging effectively inhibits NETs formation without disturbing redox homeostasis in tumor cells and quiescent neutrophils. As a result, PMeSEA potently prevents postoperative adhesions, significantly suppresses peritoneal metastasis, and shows synergetic antitumor activity with chemotherapeutic 5-Fluorouracil. Moreover, coupling CRS with PMeSEA potently inhibits CRS-induced tumor metastatic relapse and postoperative adhesions. Notably, PMeSEA exhibits low in vivo acute and subacute toxicities, implying significant potential for clinical postoperative adjuvant treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Realization of Fine&#8208;Tuning the Lattice Thermal Conductivity and Anharmonicity in Layered Semiconductors via Entropy Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;range mixing entropy engineering is realized in a series of layered semiconductors. Dominating Umklapp three&#8208;phonon scattering process mechanism is revealed by the linear &#954;&#8208;T&#8722;1 behavior. Fine tuning of lattice thermal conductivity is achieved with an almost linear &#916;Smix dependence. The slope of the &#954;&#8208;T&#8722;1 curve reduces with increasing &#916;Smix, revealing a linear response to the reduced Gr&#252;neisen parameter.








Abstract
Entropy engineering is widely proven to be effective in achieving ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity for well&#8208;performed thermoelectric and heat management applications. However, no strong correlation between entropy and lattice thermal conductivity is found until now, and the fine&#8208;tuning of thermal conductivity continuously via entropy&#8208;engineering in a wide entropy range is still lacking. Here, a series of high&#8208;entropy layered semiconductors, Ni1&#8722;x(Fe0.25Co0.25Mn0.25Zn0.25)xPS3, where 0 &#8804; x &lt; 1, with low mass/size disorder is designed. High&#8208;purity samples with mixing configuration entropy of metal atomic site in a wide range of 0&#8211;1.61R are achieved. Umklapp phonon&#8208;phonon scattering is found to be the dominating phonon scattering mechanism, as revealed by the linear T&#8722;1 dependence of thermal conductivity. Meanwhile, fine tuning of the lattice thermal conductivity via continuous entropy engineering at metal atomic sites is achieved, in an almost linear dependence in middle&#8208;/high&#8208; entropy range. Moreover, the slope of the &#954;&#160;&#8208; T&#8722;1 curve reduces with the increase in entropy, and a linear response of the reduced Gr&#252;neisen parameter is revealed. This work provides an entropy engineering strategy by choosing multiple metal elements with low mass/size disorder to achieve the fine tuning of the lattice thermal conductivity and the anharmonic effect.

         <title>Enabling Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Charged Near&#8208;Infrared Persistent Luminescence in Organics by Intermolecular Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controllable hour&#8208;level near&#8208;infrared (NIR) persistent luminescence is achieved by incorporating intermolecular charge transfer and trap states into a typical host&#8208;guest organic system. The constructed host&#8208;guest system allows for charge separation under visible light and efficient light&#8208;energy storage at room temperature by trap states, thus enabling a new triple&#8208;mode NIR anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information storage technology.








Abstract
Visible light is a universal and user&#8208;friendly excitation source; however, its use to generate persistent luminescence (PersL) in materials remains a huge challenge. Herein, the concept of intermolecular charge transfer (xCT) is applied in typical host&#8211;guest molecular systems, which allows for a much lower energy requirement for charge separation, thus enabling efficient charging of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) PersL in organics by visible light (425&#8211;700&#160;nm). Importantly, NIR PersL in organics occurs via the trapping of electrons from charge&#8208;transfer aggregates (CTAs) into constructed trap states with trap depths of 0.63&#8211;1.17&#160;eV, followed by the detrapping of these electrons by thermal stimulation, resulting in a unique light&#8208;storage effect and long&#8208;lasting emission up to 4.6 h at room temperature. The xCT absorption range is modulated by changing the electron&#8208;donating ability of a series of acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;b]pyrazine&#8208;8,9&#8208;dicarbonitrile&#8208;based CTAs, and the organic PersL is tuned from 681 to 722&#160;nm. This study on xCT interaction&#8208;induced NIR PersL in organic materials provides a major step forward in understanding the underlying luminescence mechanism of organic semiconductors and these findings are expected to promote their applications in optoelectronics, energy storage, and medical diagnosis.

Abstract
Wearable epidermic electronics assembled from conductive hydrogels are attracting various research attention for their seamless integration with human body for conformally real&#8208;time health monitoring, clinical diagnostics and medical treatment, and human&#8208;interactive sensing. Nevertheless, it remains a tremendous challenge to simultaneously achieve conformally bioadhesive epidermic electronics with remarkable self&#8208;adhesiveness, reliable ultraviolet (UV) protection ability, and admirable sensing performance for high&#8208;fidelity epidermal electrophysiological signals monitoring, along with timely photothermal therapeutic performances after medical diagnostic sensing, as well as efficient antibacterial activity and reliable hemostatic effect for potential medical therapy.

Moreover, a smart sign language gesture recognition platform based on collected electromyogram (EMG) signals is designed for hassle&#8208;free communication with hearing&#8208;impaired people with the help of advanced machine learning algorithms. Meanwhile, the bioadhesive MXene hydrogel possesses reliable antibacterial capability, excellent biocompatibility, and effective hemostasis properties for promising bacterial&#8208;infected wound bleeding.

Abstract
The integration of advanced functions and diverse practical applications calls for multifunctional liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs); however, the structure&#8208;intrinsic luminescence and excellent mechanical properties of LCEs have not yet been explored. In this study, clusteroluminescence (CL)&#8208;based LCEs (CL&#8208;LCEs) are successfully fabricated without depending on large conjugated structures, thereby avoiding redundant organic synthesis and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. The experimental and theoretical results reveal that secondary amine (&#8211;NH&#8211;) and imine (&#8211;C&#160;=&#160;N&#8211;) groups play vital roles in determining the presence of fluorescence in CL&#8208;LCEs. Based on the above observation, the strategy universalization and a molecular library for constructing CL&#8208;LCEs are further demonstrated. Meanwhile, the dynamic bond of imine bonds endows the CL&#8208;LCE system with rapid self&#8208;healing under mild conditions (70&#160;&#176;C in 10&#160;min), excellent stretchability, and adaptive programmable characteristics. Furthermore, the self&#8208;luminescent performance enables visual detection of the self&#8208;healing process. Finally, CL&#8208;based information storage and anticounterfeiting are successfully realized and their applications in fiber actuators and fluorescent textiles are demonstrated. The distinctive luminescence and dynamic chemistry presented in this work has significant implications in elucidating the mechanism of CL and providing new strategies for the rational design of novel multifunctional LCE materials.

         <title>SHG Assisted Mixed&#8208;Phases Anatomizing in a Molecular Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an advanced molecular ferroelectric with amalgamation of two symmetric phases (phase &#945; and phase &#947;). The mixing profile, as unveiled by Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) polarimetry, is predominantly at the nanoscale, as opposed to mixed grains. The transition process between the two symmetric phases is facilitated through the application of an external electrical field.








Abstract
Anatomizing mixed&#8208;phases, referring to analyzing the mixing profiles and quantifying the phases&#8217; proportions in a material, which is of great significance in the genuine applications. Here, by using second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG)&#160;polarimetry and piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) techniques, this work elucidates the contributions and distributions of two different symmetric phases mixed in an archetype monoaxial molecular ferroelectric, diisopropylammonium chloride (DIPACl). The two competing phases are preferred in thermodynamics or kinetic process respectively, and this work evidences the switching behavior between the two competing phases facilitated by an external electrical field as opposed to a heating process. This research contributes novel insights into phase engineering in the field of molecular ferroelectrics and is poised to serve as a potent analytical tool for subsequent applications.

         <title>3D Directional Assembly of Liquid Crystal Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Femtosecond laser direct writing technology enables high&#8208;resolution, single&#8208;step programmable 3D assembly of liquid crystal (LC)&#160;molecules. This method utilizes the light field directly to assemble LC molecules in 3D space without additional alignment. In the field of molecular directional assembly, this technology is anticipated to overcome weak intermolecular interactions and facilitate the assembly of molecules into long&#8208;range ordered structures.








Abstract
The precise construction of hierarchically long&#8208;range ordered structures using molecules as fundamental building blocks can fully harness their anisotropy and potential. However, the 3D, high&#8208;precision, and single&#8208;step directional assembly of molecules is a long&#8208;pending challenge. Here, a 3D directional molecular assembly strategy via femtosecond laser direct writing (FsLDW) is proposed and the feasibility of this approach using liquid crystal (LC) molecules as an illustrative example is demonstrated. The physical mechanism for femtosecond (fs) laser&#8208;induced assembly of LC molecules is investigated, and precise 3D arbitrary assembly of LC molecules is achieved by defining the discretized laser scanning pathway. Additionally, an LC&#8208;based Fresnel zone plate array with polarization selection and colorization imaging functions is fabricated to further illustrate the potential of this method. This study not only introduces a 3D high&#8208;resolution alignment method for LC&#8208;based functional devices but also establishes a universal protocol for the precise 3D directional assembly of anisotropic molecules.

         <title>Anisotropic 2D van der Waals Magnets Hosting 1D Spin Chains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic chains of atoms (&#8220;1D magnets&#8221;) have intriguing properties that illuminate fundamental principles in many&#8208;body physics while also promising applications in magnonics and spintronics. This article describes AgCrP2S6 and its family, layered crystals that host magnetic chains, focusing on their highly anisotropic properties and the additional degrees of freedom that can arise from patterning or stacking to engineer the structure.








Abstract
The exploration of 1D magnetism, frequently portrayed as spin chains, constitutes an actively pursued research field that illuminates fundamental principles in many&#8208;body problems and applications in magnonics and spintronics. The inherent reduction in dimensionality often leads to robust spin fluctuations, impacting magnetic ordering and resulting in novel magnetic phenomena. Here, structural, magnetic, and optical properties of highly anisotropic 2D van der Waals antiferromagnets that uniquely host spin chains are explored. First&#8208;principle calculations reveal that the weakest interaction is interchain, leading to essentially 1D magnetic behavior in each layer. With the additional degree of freedom arising from its anisotropic structure, the structure is engineered by alloying, varying the 1D spin chain lengths using electron beam irradiation, or twisting for localized patterning, and spin textures are calculated, predicting robust stability of the antiferromagnetic ordering. Comparing with other spin chain magnets, these materials are anticipated to bring fresh perspectives on harvesting low&#8208;dimensional magnetism.

         <title>Interfacially Enhanced Superconductivity in Fe(Te,Se)/Bi4Te3 Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seeking to understand new routes to control exotic topological superconductors, it is reported that superconductivity can be controlled at an atomically precise, epitaxial interface with the topological insulator Bi4Te3 in comparison to Bi2Te3. This finding, at the clean, low&#8208;Se&#8208;doping regime may be critical for emerging applications in quantum information science.








Abstract
Realizing topological superconductivity by integrating high&#8208;transition&#8208;temperature (TC) superconductors with topological insulators can open new paths for quantum computing applications. Here, a new approach is reported for increasing the superconducting transition temperature (TConset)$( {T_{\mathrm{C}}^{{\mathrm{onset}}}} )$ by interfacing the unconventional superconductor Fe(Te,Se) with the topological insulator Bi&#8211;Te system in the low&#8208;Se doping regime, near where superconductivity vanishes in the bulk. The critical finding is that the TConset$T_{\mathrm{C}}^{{\mathrm{onset}}}$ of Fe(Te,Se) increases from nominally non&#8208;superconducting to as high as 12.5&#160;K when Bi2Te3 is replaced with the topological phase Bi4Te3. Interfacing Fe(Te,Se) with Bi4Te3 is also found to be critical for stabilizing superconductivity in monolayer films where TConset$T_{\mathrm{C}}^{{\mathrm{onset}}}$ can be as high as 6&#160;K. Measurements of the electronic and crystalline structure of the Bi4Te3 layer reveal that a large electron transfer, epitaxial strain, and novel chemical reduction processes are critical factors for the enhancement of superconductivity. This novel route for enhancing TC in an important epitaxial system provides new insight on the nature of interfacial superconductivity and a platform to identify and utilize new electronic phases.

         <title>Directed Surface Reconstruction of Fe Modified Co2VO4 Spinel Oxides for Water Oxidation Catalysts Experiencing Self&#8208;Terminating Surface Deterioration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Fe modified Co2VO4 spinel oxide is elaborately designed as high&#8208;performance OER electrocatalyst. With structural flexibility and directed generation of alkali&#8208;resistance surface restructuring layer, the trade&#8208;off between activity and stability of transition metal catalysts is perfectly addressed, and consequently, this catalyst can sustain an alkaline OER operation for 600 h at 500 mA cm&#8722;2 with almost no activity decay.








Abstract
Affordable highly efficient catalysts for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) play pivotal roles in green hydrogen production via water electrolysis. Regarding the non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts, considerable efforts are made to decipher the cation leaching and surface reconstruction; yet, little attention is focused on correlating them with catalytical activity and stability. Herein, in situ reconstruction of Fe&#8208;modified Co2VO4 precursor catalyst to form a highly active (Fe,V)&#8208;doped CoOOH phase for OER is reported, during which partial leaching of V accelerates the surface reconstruction and the V reserved in the reconstructed CoOOH layer in the form of alkali&#8208;resistant V2O3 serves for dynamic charge compensation and prevention of excessive loss of lattice oxygen and Co dissolution. Fe substitution facilitates Co pre&#8208;oxidation and endows the catalysts with structural flexibility by elevating O 2p band level; hence, encouraging participation of lattice oxygen in OER. The optimized Co2Fe0.25V0.75O4 electrode can afford current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm&#8722;2 at low overpotentials of 205 and 320 mV, respectively, with satisfactory stability over 600 h. By coupling with Pt/C cathode, the assembled alkaline electrolyzer can deliver 500 mA cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 1.798 V, better than that of commercial RuO2 (+) || Pt/C (&#8722;).

         <title>Ultrauniform Plating of Lithium on 10&#8208;nm&#8208;Scale Ordered Carbon Grids for Long Lifespan Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring the structure of Li plating substrate at a scale down to 10&#160;nm is achieved by decorating graphene with ordered carbon grids. Unlike the situation on flat reduced graphene oxide, where isolated Li nuclei are observed, the nucleation of Li is intrinsically inhibited on such a textile substrate with characteristic size below the thermodynamic critical nucleation size of Li. The continuous, dense, and planar plating on such a carbon thus significantly improves the cycling stability of Li metal anode.








Abstract
Tailorable lithium (Li) nucleation and uniform early&#8208;stage plating is essential for long&#8208;lifespan Li metal batteries. Among factors influencing the early plating of Li anode, the substrate is critical, but a fine control of the substrate structure on a scale of &#8776;10&#160;nm has been rarely achieved. Herein, a carbon consisting of ordered grids is prepared, as a model to investigate the effect of substrate structure on the Li nucleation. In contrast to the individual spherical Li nuclei formed on the flat graphene, an ultrauniform and nuclei&#8208;free Li plating is obtained on the ordered carbon with a grid size smaller than the thermodynamical critical radius of Li nucleation (&#8776;26&#160;nm). Simultaneously, an inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase is promoted by the cross&#8208;sectional carbon layers of such ordered grids which are exposed to the electrolyte. Consequently, the carbon grids with a grid size of &#8776;10&#160;nm show a favorable cycling stability for more than 1100 cycles measured at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a half cell. With LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 as cathode, the assembled full cell with a cathode capacity of 3 mAh cm&#8722;2 and a negative/positive ratio of 1.67 demonstrates a stable cycling for over 130 cycles with a capacity retention of 88%.

         <title>Thermal Runaway Mechanism in Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Full Cells of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: The Role of Multidirectional Crosstalk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work addresses the fundamental causes of thermal runaway in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, particularly in LiNi0.88Co0.1Al0.02O2/graphite full cells, a significant challenge for the electric vehicle industry. By employing synchrotron&#8208;based high&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray diffraction, mass spectrometry, and calorimetry, the intermediates that establish a self&#8208;amplifying positive feedback loop are comprehensively identified through multidirectional crosstalk.








Abstract
Crosstalk, the exchange of chemical species between battery electrodes, significantly accelerates thermal runaway (TR) of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. To date, the understanding of their main mechanisms has centered on single&#8208;directional crosstalk of oxygen (O2) gas from the cathode to the anode, underestimating the exothermic reactions during TR. However, the role of multidirectional crosstalk in steering additional exothermic reactions is yet to be elucidated due to the difficulties of correlative in situ analyses of full cells. Herein, the way in which such crosstalk triggers self&#8208;amplifying feedback is elucidated that dramatically exacerbates TR within enclosed full cells, by employing synchrotron&#8208;based high&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray diffraction, mass spectrometry, and calorimetry. These findings reveal that ethylene (C2H4) gas generated at the anode promotes O2 evolution at the cathode. This O2 then returns to the anode, further promoting additional C2H4 formation and creating a self&#8208;amplifying loop, thereby intensifying TR. Furthermore, CO2, traditionally viewed as an extinguishing gas, engages in the crosstalk by interacting with lithium at the anode to form Li2CO3, thereby accelerating TR beyond prior expectations. These insights have led to develop an anode coating that impedes the formation of C2H4 and O2, to effectively mitigate TR.

         <title>Singular Hall Response from a Correlated Ferromagnetic Flat Nodal&#8208;Line Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A singular Hall response arising from a unique band structure of flat topological nodal lines in combination with electron correlation in a layered room&#8208;temperature ferromagnet, Fe3GaTe2 is reported. Exceptionally high anomalous Hall conductivity violating the conventional scaling, resistivity upturn at low temperatures, and a large Sommerfeld coefficient of Fe3GaTe2 imply heavy fermion features in the ferromagnetic topological material.








Abstract
Topological quantum phases are largely understood in weakly correlated systems, which have identified various quantum phenomena, such as the spin Hall effect, protected transport of helical fermions, and topological superconductivity. Robust ferromagnetic order in correlated topological materials particularly attracts attention, as it can provide a versatile platform for novel quantum devices. Here, a singular Hall response arising from a unique band structure of flat topological nodal lines in combination with electron correlation in a van der Waals ferromagnetic semimetal, Fe3GaTe2, with a high Curie temperature of Tc = 347 K is reported. High anomalous Hall conductivity violating the conventional scaling, resistivity upturn at low temperature, and a large Sommerfeld coefficient are observed in Fe3GaTe2, which implies heavy fermion features in this ferromagnetic topological material. The scanning tunneling microscopy, circular dichroism in angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations support the original electronic features of the material. Thus, low&#8208;dimensional Fe3GaTe2 with electronic correlation, topology, and room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic order appears to be a promising candidate for robust quantum devices.

         <title>Tailoring the Electrochemical Responses of MOF&#8208;74 Via Dual&#8208;Defect Engineering for Superior Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;defects engineering of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is performed to manipulate the electrochemical response. Using&#160;salicylic acid and cobalt doping for defect introduction, the modified MOF exhibits 4.4 times the discharging capacity of the original, resulting in a superior cathode for Ni&#8211;Zn batteries. The comprehensive investigations provide critical insights into the electrochemical reconfiguration mechanism.








Abstract
Rationally designed defects in a crystal can confer unique properties. This study showcases a novel dual&#8208;defects engineering strategy to tailor the electrochemical response of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials used for electrochemical energy storage. Salicylic acid (SA) is identified as an effective modulator to control MOF&#8208;74 growth and induce structural defects, and cobalt cation doping is adopted for introducing a second type of defect. The resulting dual&#8208;defects engineered bimetallic MOF exhibits a discharging capacity of 218.6 mAh g&#8722;1, 4.4 times that of the pristine MOF&#8208;74, and significantly improved cycling stability. Moreover, the engineered MOF&#8208;74(Ni0.675Co0.325)&#8208;8//Zn aqueous battery shows top energy/power density performances for Ni&#8211;Zn batteries (266.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, 17.22&#160;kW kg&#8722;1). Comprehensive investigations reveal that engineered defects modify the local coordination environment and promote the in situ electrochemical reconfiguration during operation to significantly boost the electrochemical activity. This work suggests that rational tailoring of the defects within the MOF crystal is an effective strategy to manipulate the coordination environment of the metal centers and the corresponding electrochemical reconfiguration for electrochemical applications.

         <title>A Naturally Inspired Extrusion&#8208;Based Microfluidic Approach for Manufacturing Tailorable Magnetic Soft Continuum Microrobotic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, microfluidics is leveraged to precisely control reaction&#8208;diffusion (RD) processes for generating multifunctional and compartmentalized alginate&#8208;based microfibers. This nature&#8208;inspired RD process allows for producing sophisticated fibers acting as magnetic soft continuum robots. The method allows for tailoring the stiffness and magnetic responsiveness of the microfibers via customizing the geometry, degree of cross&#8208;linking, and spatial localization of magnetic nanoparticles.








Abstract
Soft materials play a crucial role in small&#8208;scale robotic applications by closely mimicking the complex motion and morphing behavior of organisms. However, conventional fabrication methods face challenges in creating highly integrated small&#8208;scale soft devices. In this study, microfluidics is leveraged to precisely control reaction&#8208;diffusion (RD) processes to generate multifunctional and compartmentalized calcium&#8208;cross&#8208;linkable alginate&#8208;based microfibers. Under RD conditions, sophisticated alginate&#8208;based fibers are produced for magnetic soft continuum robotics applications with customizable features, such as geometry (compact or hollow), degree of cross&#8208;linking, and the precise localization of magnetic nanoparticles (inside the core, surrounding the fiber, or on one side). This fine control allows for tuning the stiffness and magnetic responsiveness of the microfibers. Additionally, chemically cleavable regions within the fibers enable disassembly into smaller robotic units or roll&#8208;up structures under a rotating magnetic field. These findings demonstrate the versatility of microfluidics in processing highly integrated small&#8208;scale devices.

         <title>Unzippable Siamese Nanoparticles for Programmed Two&#8208;Stage Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detachable Siamese nanoparticles (SIANPs) are programmed to separate in responding to abundant extracellular adenosine triphosphate in the tumor microenvironment, conferring two&#8208;pronged delivery of epigenetic drugs and immune modulators to tumor cells and myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), respectively. SIANP treatment prevents MDSC induction driven by epigenetic drugs, enabling epigenetic therapy in solid tumors such as breast and colorectal cancers.








Abstract
Epigenetic drugs (epi&#8208;drugs) can destruct cancer cells and initiate both innate and adaptive immunity, yet they have achieved very limited success in solid tumors so far, partly attributing to their concurrent induction of the myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cell (MDSC) population. Here, dissociable Siamese nanoparticles (SIANPs) are developed for tumor cell&#8208;targeted delivery of epi&#8208;drug CM&#8208;272 and MDSC&#8208;targeted delivery of small molecule inhibitor Ibrutinib. The SIANPs are assembled via interparticle DNA annealing and detached via tumor microenvironment&#8208;triggered strand separation. Such binary regulation induces endogenous retrovirus expression and immunogenic cell death in tumor cells while restraining the immunosuppressive effects of MDSCs, and synergistically promotes dendritic cell maturation and CD8+ T cell activation for tumor inhibition. Significantly, immune microenvironment remodeling via SIANPs further overcomes tumor resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. This study represents a two&#8208;pronged approach for orchestrating immune responses, and paves a new way for employing epi&#8208;drugs in cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Promotion of Probabilistic Bit Generation in Mott Devices by Embedded Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Randomness of p&#8208;bit streams generated via the pump&#8211;probe pulse inputs can be increased by the deliberate incorporation of metal nanoparticles (NPs), which influence the transient dynamics of switchable domains in VO2 Mott switches. The study presents a novel strategy that exploits nanoscale phase control to maximize the generation of nondeterministic information sources for energy&#8208;efficient probabilistic computing hardware.








Abstract
Considerable attention has been drawn to the use of volatile two&#8208;terminal devices relying on the Mott transition for the stochastic generation of probabilistic bits (p&#8208;bits) in emerging probabilistic computing. To improve randomness and endurance of bit streams provided by these devices, delicate control of the transient evolution of switchable domains is required to enhance stochastic p&#8208;bit generation. Herein, it is demonstrated that the randomness of p&#8208;bit streams generated via the consecutive pulse inputs of pump&#8211;probe protocols can be increased by the deliberate incorporation of metal nanoparticles (NPs), which influence the transient dynamics of the nanoscale metallic phase in VO2 Mott switches. Among the vertically stacked Pt&#8208;NP&#8208;containing VO2 threshold switches, those with higher Pt NP density show a considerably wider range of p&#8208;bit operation (e.g., up to &#8776;300% increase in &#916;Vprobe upon going from (Pt NP/VO2)0 to (Pt NP/VO2)11) and can therefore be operated under the conditions of high speed (400 kbit s&#8722;1), low power consumption (14 nJ per bit), and high stability (&gt;105&#160;200 bits) for p&#8208;bit generation. Thus, the study presents a novel strategy that exploits nanoscale phase control to maximize the generation of nondeterministic information sources for energy&#8208;efficient probabilistic computing hardware.

         <title>3D Printed Room Temperature Phosphorescence Materials Enabled by Edible Natural Konjac Glucomannan</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ingenious design strategy is developed to construct sophisticated 3D room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) architectures with high fidelity and mechanical strength via direct ink writing&#8208;based 3D printing and freeze&#8208;drying. Konjac glucomannan with decent rheological properties can anchor arylboronic acid chromophores with various &#960; conjugations via B&#9472;O covalent bonds in pure water to afford 3D&#8208;printable inks.








Abstract
Shaping room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials into 3D bodies is important for stereoscopic optoelectronic displays but remains challenging due to their poor processability and mechanical properties. Here, konjac glucomannan (KGM) is employed to anchor arylboronic acids with various &#960; conjugations via a facile B&#9472;O covalent reaction to afford printable inks, using which full&#8208;color high&#8208;fidelity 3D RTP objects with high mechanical strength can be obtained via direct ink writing&#8208;based 3D printing and freeze&#8208;drying. The doubly rigid structure supplied by the synergy of hydrogen bonding and B&#9472;O covalent bonding can protect the triplet excitons; thus, the prepared 3D RTP object shows a striking lifetime of 2.14 s. The printed counterparts are successfully used for 3D anti&#8208;counterfeiting and can be recycled and reprinted nondestructively by dissolving in water. This success expands the scope of printable 3D luminescent materials, providing an eco&#8208;friendly platform for the additive manufacturing of sophisticated 3D RTP architectures.

&lt;p&gt;An ingenious design strategy is developed to construct sophisticated 3D room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) architectures with high fidelity and mechanical strength via direct ink writing-based 3D printing and freeze-drying. Konjac glucomannan with decent rheological properties can anchor arylboronic acid chromophores with various &#960; conjugations via B&#9472;O covalent bonds in pure water to afford 3D-printable inks.

         <title>Cultivating High&#8208;Performance Flexible All&#8208;in&#8208;One Supercapacitors With 3D Network Through Continuous Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible all&#8208;in&#8208;one supercapacitor is cultivated through a continuous biosynthesis, harnessing uninterrupted 3D network during the growth of bacterial cellulose. The design establishes a seamless electrode&#8211;separator&#8211;electrode structure and facilitates stress transfer within and between layers. Thereby, the supercapacitor demonstrates remarkable shear and bending resistance, presenting a promising approach for the integrated development of high&#8208;performance flexible power sources.








Abstract
Flexible supercapacitors can potentially power next&#8208;generation flexible electronics. However, the mechanical and electrochemical stability of flexible supercapacitors under different flexible conditions is limited by the weak bonding between adjacent layers, posing a significant hindrance to their practical applicability. Herein, based on the uninterrupted 3D network during the growth of bacterial cellulose (BC), a flexible all&#8208;in&#8208;one supercapacitor is cultivated through a continuous biosynthesis process. This strategy ensures the continuity of the 3D network of BC throughout the material, thereby forming a continuous electrode&#8211;separator&#8211;electrode structure. Benefitting from this bioinspired structure, the all&#8208;in&#8208;one supercapacitor not only achieves a high areal capacitance (3.79 F cm&#8722;2) of electrodes but also demonstrates the integration of high tensile strength (2.15&#160;MPa), high shear strength (more than 54.6&#160;kPa), and high bending resistance, indicating a novel pathway toward high&#8208;performance flexible power sources.

         <title>Enhanced Infrared Vision by Nonlinear Up&#8208;Conversion in Nonlocal Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imaging of short&#8208;wave infrared (IR) light has essential applications in surveillance and autonomous navigation. However, it typically relies on complex cameras that incorporate narrow&#8208;band semiconductors. This research demonstrates IR imaging using nonlinear up&#8208;conversion to the visible with an ultra&#8208;compact, high&#8208;quality&#8208;factor lithium niobate metasurface. Despite the strong metasurface nonlocality, the method produces high&#8208;quality images with efficient conversion and high resolution.








Abstract
The ability to detect and image short&#8208;wave infrared light has important applications in surveillance, autonomous navigation, and biological imaging. However, the current infrared imaging technologies often pose challenges due to large footprint, large thermal noise and inability to augment infrared and visible imaging. Here, infrared imaging is demonstrated by nonlinear up&#8208;conversion to the visible in an ultra&#8208;compact, high&#8208;quality&#8208;factor lithium niobate resonant metasurface. Images with high conversion efficiency and resolution quality are obtained despite the strong nonlocality of the metasurface. The possibility of edge&#8208;detection image processing augmented with direct up&#8208;conversion imaging for advanced night vision applications is further&#160;shown.

         <title>Superconductivity in Freestanding Infinite&#8208;Layer Nickelate Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work reports the synthesis of the superconducting freestanding La0.8Sr0.2NiO2 membranes (Tczero=10.6K${T}_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{zero}}\ =\ 10.6\mathrm{K}$), emphasizing the crucial roles of the interface engineering in the precursor phase film growth and the quick transfer process in achieving superconductivity. This work offers a new versatile platform for investigating superconductivity in nickelates, such as the pairing symmetry via constructing Josephson tunneling junctions and higher Tc values via high&#8208;pressure experiments.








Abstract
The observation of superconductivity in infinite&#8208;layer nickelates has attracted significant attention due to its potential as a new platform for exploring high&#8208;Tc superconductivity. However, thus far, superconductivity has only been observed in epitaxial thin films, which limits the manipulation capabilities and modulation methods compared to two&#8208;dimensional exfoliated materials. Given the exceptionally giant strain tunability and stacking capability of freestanding membranes, separating superconducting nickelates from the as&#8208;grown substrate is a novel way to engineer the superconductivity and uncover the underlying physics. Herein, this work reports the synthesis of the superconducting freestanding La0.8Sr0.2NiO2 membranes (Tczero=10.6K${T}_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{zero}}\ =\ 10.6\ \mathrm{K}$), emphasizing the crucial roles of the interface engineering in the precursor phase film growth and the quick transfer process in achieving superconductivity.

         <title>Heterostructures via a Solution&#8208;Based Anion Exchange in Microcrystalline 2D Layered Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work outlines solution&#8208;based processes to obtain in&#8208;plane heterojunctions in two&#8208;dimensional layered perovskites with different halide composition. The obtained microcrystalline heterostructures have a core&#8208;shell architecture with distinctly different optical properties in the different crystal phases. This work elucidates the underlying reaction mechanisms that depend strongly on the exchange route, leading either to vacancy&#8208;assisted diffusion, or dissolution&#8208;recrystallization processes.








Abstract
Layered perovskites consist of stacks of inorganic semiconducting metal&#8208;halide octahedra lattices sandwiched between organic layers with typically dielectric behavior. The in&#8208;plane confinement of electrical carriers in such two&#8208;dimensional metal halide perovskites drives a large range of appealing electronic properties, such as strong exciton binding, anisotropic charge diffusion, and polarization&#8208;directionality. Heterostructures provide additional control on carrier diffusion and localization, and in&#8208;plane heterojunctions are interesting because of the associated high charge mobility. Here, this work demonstrates a versatile solution&#8208;based approach to fabricate in&#8208;plane heterostructures with different halide composition in two&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;halide perovskite microcrystals. This leads to spatially separated halide phases with different band gap and light emission. Interestingly, the composition of the exchanged phase and the morphology of the phase boundary depends on the exchange route, which can be related to the preferred localization of the halides at the equatorial or axial octahedra positions that either leads to dissolution and recrystallization of the octahedra lattice (for bromide to iodide), or allows for ion diffusion within the lattice (for iodide to bromide). These detailed insights on the ion exchange processes in layered perovskites will stimulate the development of heterostructures that can be tailored for different applications such as photocatalysis, energy storage, and light emission.

         <title>Immunoregulatory Engineering of Semiconducting Charge&#8208;Reversal Nanoantioxidant for Ameliorating Cancer Radioimmunotheranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile X&#8208;ray theranostic nano&#8208;antioxidant (XTN) is developed to prevent normal tissues from oxidative damage and induce systematic and robust anticancer immunity. In the bilateral 4T1 tumor model, XTN plus radiotherapy (RT) remarkably boosts the abscopal effect and induce durable immunological memory against tumor growth.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) is a crucial clinical modality for cancer. However, nonselectivity, toxicity to normal tissues, and radio&#8208;resistance severely limit RT applications. This study develops a versatile X&#8208;ray theranostic nano&#8208;antioxidant (XTN) to prevent normal tissues from oxidative damage and induce systematic and robust anticancer immunity. XTN owns NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic (PA) imaging properties for precise discrimination of the tumor margin through, thereby improving the accuracy of RT. Additionally, XTN is a nano&#8208;antioxidant to enhance the cell viability of normal cells after irradiation. Most importantly, XTN scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the TME to preserve the stimulatory activity of released high mobility group protein B1 to dendritic cells (DCs) and recover T cells&#8217; immune function. Meanwhile, XTN achieves charge&#8208;reversal specifically releasing an immunomodulator (demethylcantharidin, DMC) in the acidic TME. Moreover, the specifically released DMC inhibits protein phosphatase&#8208;2A activity and reduces regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation. In the bilateral 4T1 tumor model, XTN&#8208;mediated radioimmunotherapy remarkably boosts a systemic antitumor immune response and induces durable immunological memory against tumor growth.

         <title>Linearly Polarized Broadband Emission and Multiwavelength Lasing in Solution&#8208;Processed Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, by adjusting the structural polarization and energy transfer in quantum dots, linearly polarized broadband emission and multiwavelength lasers in the visible and near&#8208;infrared wavelength ranges are demonstrated by incorporating Er3+&#8208;doped Cs2Ag0.4Na0.6In0.98Bi0.02Cl6 double perovskite quantum dots into solution&#8208;processable silica structure. This work offers a promising light source for future photonic integrated circuits targeted at high&#8208;capacity optical applications.








Abstract
A miniature laser with linear polarization is a long sought&#8208;after component of photonic integrated circuits. In particular, for multiwavelength polarization lasers, it supports simultaneous access to multiple, widely varying laser wavelengths in a small spatial region, which is of great significance for advancing applications such as optical computing, optical storage, and optical sensing. However, there is a trade&#8208;off between the size of small&#8208;scale lasers and laser performance, and multiwavelength co&#8208;gain of laser media and multicavity micromachining in the process of laser miniaturization remain as significant challenges. Herein, room&#8208;temperature linearly polarized multiwavelength lasers in the visible and near&#8208;infrared wavelength ranges are demonstrated, by fabricating random cavities scattered with silica in an Er&#8208;doped Cs2Ag0.4Na0.6In0.98Bi0.02Cl6 double&#8208;perovskite quantum dots gain membrane. By regulating the local symmetry and enabling effective energy transfer in nanocrystals, multiwavelength lasers with ultralow thresholds are achieved at room temperature. The maximum degree of polarization reaches 0.89. With their advantages in terms of miniaturization, ultralow power consumption, and adaptability for integration, these lasers offer a prospective light source for future photonic integrated circuits aimed at high&#8208;capacity optical applications.

         <title>Lead Isolation and Capture in Perovskite Photovoltaics toward Eco&#8208;Friendly Commercialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes the concept of an all&#8208;round detoxification strategy of&#8201; &#8220;lead isolation and capture&#8221; on perovskite solar cells (PSCs) for the first time, and the adequate in vivo experiments in mice reveal that this material has significant inhibitory effect on the toxicity of perovskite. This strategy can further enhance the device performance, achieving an impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.19%.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are developed rapidly in efficiency and stability in recent years, which can compete with silicon solar cells. However, an important obstacle to the commercialization of PSCs is the toxicity of lead ions (Pb2+) from water&#8208;soluble perovskites. The entry of free Pb2+ into organisms can cause severe harm to humans, such as blood lead poisoning, organ failure, etc. Therefore, this work reports a &#8220;lead isolation&#8208;capture&#8221; dual detoxification strategy with calcium disodium edetate (EDTA Na&#8208;Ca), which can inhibit lead leakage from PSCs under extreme conditions. More importantly, leaked lead exists in a nontoxic aggregation state chelated by EDTA. For the first time, in vivo experiments are conducted in mice to systematically prove that this material has a significant inhibitory effect on the toxicity of perovskites. In addition, this strategy can further enhance device performance, enabling the optimized devices to achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.19%. This innovative strategy is a major breakthrough in the research on the prevention of lead toxicity in PSCs.

         <title>Room Temperature Reduction of Nitrogen Oxide on Iron Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mimicking a natural enzyme, a sustainable, reducible iron MOF is able to selectively decompose NO
and NO2 into N2 and O2 in ambient conditions, without any reducing agent. This contributes to solve a long&#8208;standing problem in air purification and emissions control, opens new perspectives in heterogeneous catalysis and bridges the gap between homogeneous, enzymatic and heterogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
Nitrogen oxides represent one of the main threats for the environment. Despite decades of intensive research efforts, a sustainable solution for NOx removal under environmental conditions is still undefined. Using theoretical modelling, material design, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art investigation methods and mimicking enzymes, it is found that selected porous hybrid iron(II/III) based MOF material are able to decompose NOx, at room temperature, in the presence of water and oxygen, into N2 and O2 and without reducing agents. This paves the way to the development of new highly sustainable heterogeneous catalysts to improve air quality.

         <title>Structurally Tunable Donor&#8722;Bridge&#8722;Fluorophore Architecture Enables Highly Efficient and Concentration&#8208;Independent Narrowband Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatial confinement strategy, denoted as donor&#8722;bridge&#8722;fluorophore architecture, has been proposed to construct highly efficient and concentration&#8208;independent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on B&#8211;N&#8208;containing multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials. The final established compound BN&#8208;PCz&#8208;TPA&#8208;based devices exhibit maximum external quantum efficiency of 36.3% at 10&#160;wt% doping concentrations and remain 32.5% at 20&#160;wt% doping concentration with almost unchanged spectray.








Abstract
Luminescent materials with narrowband emission have extraordinary significance for developing ultrahigh&#8208;definition display. B&#8211;N&#8208;containing multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials are strong contenders. However, their device performances pervasively encounter detrimental aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect that is highly vulnerable to doping concentration, complicating device fabrication. Therefore, constructing highly efficient and concentration&#8208;independent MR&#8208;TADF emitters is of pragmatic importance for improving device controllability and reproducibility, simplifying manufacturing procedures, and conserving production costs.

&lt;p&gt;A spatial confinement strategy, denoted as donor&#8722;bridge&#8722;fluorophore architecture, has been proposed to construct highly efficient and concentration-independent organic light-emitting diodes based on B&#8211;N-containing multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials. The final established compound BN-PCz-TPA-based devices exhibit maximum external quantum efficiency of 36.3% at 10&#160;wt% doping concentrations and remain 32.5% at 20&#160;wt% doping concentration with almost unchanged spectray.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luminescent materials with narrowband emission have extraordinary significance for developing ultrahigh-definition display. B&#8211;N-containing multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) materials are strong contenders. However, their device performances pervasively encounter detrimental aggregation-caused quenching effect that is highly vulnerable to doping concentration, complicating device fabrication. Therefore, constructing highly efficient and concentration-independent MR-TADF emitters is of pragmatic importance for improving device controllability and reproducibility, simplifying manufacturing procedures, and conserving production costs. Here, by systematic arrangement of donor triphenylamine and fluorophore BNCz on distinct bridges, a spatial confinement strategy has been developed with a donor&#8722;bridge&#8722;fluorophore architecture. Structurally fine modulation and progressive evolution to construct molecular entities with congested steric hindrance effect that can suppress intermolecular interactions without substantially affecting the luminescence tone of fluorophore BNCz, resulting in highly efficient and concentration-independent narrowband emitters; through isomer engineering, two isomers BN-PCz-TPA and TPA-PCz-BN with different crystal stacking patterns are synthesized by altering the connection mode between triphenylamine and BNCz. As a result, BN-PCz-TPA-based device showcases maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.3% with narrow full-width at half-maximum of 27 nm at 10 wt% doping concentration. Even at 20 wt% doping concentration, the maximum EQE remains at 32.5% and the emission spectrum is almost unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling the Role of Cationic Pyridine Sites in Covalent Triazine Framework for Boosting Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The abundant cationic pyridine sites of cationic pyridine&#8208;rich covalent triazine framework (CCTF&#8208;TPMB)&#160;can not only significantly suppress the leakage and shuttle of I2 species (I&#8722;, I3&#8722;, and I5&#8722;) and the occurrence of side reactions on the Zn anode, but also accelerate the conversion reaction of I2 species, enabling good reversibility, high electrochemical activity, and fast reaction kinetics for I2 loaded CCTF&#8208;TPMB cathode based Zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (ZIBs) are gaining attention as energy storage devices due to their high energy density, low&#8208;cost, and inherent safety. However, the poor cycling performance of these batteries always arises from the severe leakage and shuttle effect of polyiodides (I3&#8211; and I5&#8211;). Herein, a novel cationic pyridine&#8208;rich covalent triazine framework (CCTF&#8208;TPMB) is developed to capture and confine iodine (I2) species via strong electrostatic interaction, making it an attractive host for I2 in ZIBs. The as&#8208;fabricated ZIBs with I2 loaded CCTF&#8208;TPMB (I2@CCTF&#8208;TPMB) cathode achieve a large specific capacity of 243&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 and an exceptionally stable cyclic performance, retaining 93.9% of its capacity over 30&#160;000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. The excellent electrochemical performance of the ZIBs can be attributed to the pyridine&#8208;rich cationic sites of CCTF&#8208;TPMB, which effectively suppress the leakage and shuttle of polyiodides, while also accelerating the conversion reaction of I2 species. Combined in situ Raman and UV&#8211;vis analysis, along with theoretical calculations, clearly reveal the critical role played by pyridine&#8208;rich cationic sites in boosting the ZIBs performances. This work opens up a promising pathway for designing advanced I2 cathode materials toward next&#8208;generation ZIBs and beyond.

         <title>Single Dispersion of Fe(H2O)2&#8208;Based Polyoxometalate on Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Biomimetic CH4 Photooxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined Fe single&#8208;site catalyst is constructed by uniformly dispersing nanosized molecular cluster on the polymeric carbon nitride support. The well&#8208;defined (WO)4&#8208;Fea(H2O)2 site can not only act as active site for dramatically boosting methane&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion, but also serves as the model with precise structure for the investigating enzyme&#8208;like catalytic mechanism.








Abstract
Direct methane conversion to value&#8208;added oxygenates under mild conditions with in&#8208;depth mechanism investigation has attracted wide interest. Inspired by methane monooxygenase, the K9Na2Fe(H2O)2{[&#947;&#8208;SiW9O34Fe(H2O)]}2&#183;25H2O polyoxometalate (Fe&#8208;POM) with well&#8208;defined Fe(H2O)2 sites is synthesized to clarify the key role of Fe species and their microenvironment toward CH4 photooxidation. The Fe&#8208;POM can efficiently drive the conversion of CH4 to HCOOH with a yield of 1570.0&#160;&#181;mol gPOM&#8722;1 and 95.8% selectivity at ambient conditions, much superior to that of [Fe(H2O)SiW11O39]5&#8722; with Fe(H2O) active site, [Fe2SiW10O38(OH)]214&#8722; and [P8W48O184Fe16(OH)28(H2O)4]20&#8722; with multinuclear Fe&#8722;OH&#8722;Fe active sites. Single&#8208;dispersion of Fe&#8208;POM on polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) is facilely achieved to provide single&#8208;cluster functionalized PCN with well&#8208;defined Fe(H2O)2 site, the HCOOH yield can be improved to 5981.3&#160;&#181;mol gPOM&#8722;1. Systemic investigations demonstrate that the (WO)4&#8722;Fe(H2O)2 can supply Fe&#9552;O active center for C&#8722;H activation via forming (WO)4&#8722;Fea&#8722;Ot&#183;&#183;&#183;CH4 intermediate, similar to that for CH4 oxidation in the monooxygenase. This work highlights a promising and facile strategy for single dispersion of &#8776;1&#8211;2 &#197; metal center with precise coordination microenvironment by uniformly anchoring nanoscale molecular clusters, which provides a well&#8208;defined model for in&#8208;depth mechanism research.

         <title>Fast Photoactuation and Environmental Response of Humidity&#8208;Sensitive pDAP&#8208;Silicon Nanocantilevers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocantilevers are made using FIB milling on plasma pDAP&#8208;coated Si nanomembranes. Photoactuation originates in reversible sorption of atmospheric water vapor by the responsive pDAP layer. Rapid photothermal heating leads to the pDAP contraction and cantilever deflection within ms timescales. The straightening is spontaneous, albeit fast, due to the efficient heat dissipation through Si, leading to water absorption and pDAP expansion.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;responsive nanomembranes are a new class of advanced materials that can be harnessed in complex architectures for micro and nano&#8208;manipulators, artificial muscles, energy harvesting, soft robotics, and sensors. The design and fabrication of responsive membranes must meet such challenges as trade&#8208;offs between responsiveness and mechanical durability, volumetric low&#8208;cost production ensuring low environmental impact, and compatibility with standard technologies or biological systems This work demonstrates the fabrication of multi&#8208;responsive, mechanically robust poly(1,3&#8208;diaminopropane) (pDAP) nanomembranes and their application in fast photoactuators. The pDAP films are developed using a plasma&#8208;assisted polymerization technique that offers large&#8208;scale production and versatility of potential industrial relevance. The pDAP layers exhibit high elasticity with the Young's modulus of &#8776;7 GPa and remarkable mechanical durability across 20&#8211;80&#160;&#176;C temperatures. Notably, pDAP membranes reveal immediate and reversible contraction triggered by light, rising temperature, or reducing relative humidity underpinned by a reversible water sorption mechanism. These features enable the fabrication of photoactuators composed of pDAP&#8208;coated Si nanocantilevers, demonstrating ms timescale response to light, tens of &#181;m deflections, and robust performance up to kHz frequencies. These results advance fundamental research on multi&#8208;responsive nanomembranes and hold the potential to boost versatile applications in light&#8208;to&#8208;motion conversion and sensing toward the industrial level.

Notably, pDAP membranes reveal immediate and reversible contraction triggered by light, rising temperature, or reducing relative humidity underpinned by a reversible water sorption mechanism. These features enable the fabrication of photoactuators composed of pDAP-coated Si nanocantilevers, demonstrating ms timescale response to light, tens of &#181;m deflections, and robust performance up to kHz frequencies. These results advance fundamental research on multi-responsive nanomembranes and hold the potential to boost versatile applications in light-to-motion conversion and sensing toward the industrial level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Electroplating Ruthenium Precursor on the Surface Oxidized Nickel Foam for Efficient and Stable Bifunctional Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>

Nanoparticle based catalysts of Ru&#8211;Ni(OH)2 with a tuned valence state overcome the thermodynamic instability of Ru active sites. The synergistic modulation of tailored valence state, coordination environment, and electronic property results in fast kinetics for both the OER and HER.








Abstract
Water electrolysis to produce hydrogen (H2) using renewable energy is one of the most promising candidates for realizing carbon neutrality, but its reaction kinetics is hindered by sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Ruthenium (Ru) in its high&#8208;valence state (oxide) provides one of the most active OER sites and is less costly, but thermodynamically unstable. The strong interaction between Ru nanoparticles (NPs) and nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) is leveraged to directly form Ru&#8211;Ni(OH)2 on the surface of a porous nickel foam (NF) electrode via spontaneous galvanic replacement reaction. The formation of Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Ni bonds at the interface of the Ru NPs and Ni(OH)2 (Ru&#8211;Ni(OH)2) on the surface oxidized NF significantly enhance stability of the Ru&#8211;Ni(OH)2/NF electrode. In addition to OER, the catalyst is active enough for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As a result, it is able to deliver overpotentials of 228 and 15&#160;mV to reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for OER and HER, respectively. An industry&#8208;scale evaluation using Ru&#8211;Ni(OH)2/NF as both OER and HER electrodes demonstrates a high current density of 1500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (OER: 410&#160;mV; HER: 240&#160;mV), surpassing commercial RuO2 (OER: 600&#160;mV) and Pt/C based performance (HER: 265&#160;mV).

         <title>A Rotating Cathode with Periodical Changes in Electrolyte Layer Thickness for High&#8208;Rate Li&#8210;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is generally believed that the rate performance of Li&#8210;O2 batteries (LOBs) is limited by the slow mass transfer. To this end, a new type of LOB with a rotating cathode has been designed to decouple the maximum transfer rate of Li+ and O2, and consequently, the rate performance of LOBs has been significantly improved.








Abstract
Li&#8211;O2 batteries (LOBs) possess the highest theoretical gravimetric energy density among all types of secondary batteries, but they are still far from practical applications. The poor rate performance resulting from the slow mass transfer is one of the primary obstacles in LOBs. To solve this issue, a rotating cathode with periodic changes in the electrolyte layer thickness is designed, decoupling the maximum transfer rate of Li+ and O2. During rotation, the thinner electrolyte layer on the cathode facilitates the O2 transfer, and the thicker electrolyte layer enhances the Li+ transfer. As a result, the rotating cathode enables the LOBs to undergo 58 cycles at 2.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and discharge stably even at a high current density of 7.5 mA cm&#8722;2. Besides, it also makes the batteries exhibit a large discharge capacity of 6.8 mAh cm&#8722;2, and the capacity decay is much slower with increasing current density. Notably, this rotating electrode holds great promise for utilization in other electrochemical cells involving gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid triple&#8208;phase interfaces, suggesting a viable approach to enhance the mass transfer in such systems.

         <title>Handedness&#8208;Inverted and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Circularly Polarized Luminescent Nano/Micromaterials Through Pathway&#8208;Dependent Chiral Supramolecular Polymorphism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Handedness&#8208;inverted circularly polarized luminescent nano/micromaterials from the same monomers in the same concentrations and the same solvent have been prepared through a pathway&#8208;dependent chiral supramolecular polymorphism approach for the first time, which display multistimuli responsive and ON&#8211;OFF switching abilities.








Abstract
The precise manipulation of supramolecular polymorphs has been widely applied to control the morphologies and functions of self&#8208;assemblies, but is rarely utilized for the fabrication of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials with tailored properties. Here, this work reports that an amphiphilic naphthalene&#8208;histidine compound (NIHis) readily self&#8208;assembled into distinct chiral nanostructures through pathway&#8208;dependent supramolecular polymorphism, which shows opposite and multistimuli responsive CPL signals. Specifically, NIHis display assembly&#8208;induced CPL from the polymorphic keto tautomer, which become predominant during enol&#8208;keto tautomerization shifting controlled by a bulk solvent effect. Interestingly, chiral polymorphs of nanofiber and microbelt with inverted CPL signals can be prepared from the same NIHis monomer in exactly the same solvent compositions and concentrations by only changing the temperature. The tunable CPL performance of the solid microbelts is realized under multi external physical or chemical stimuli including grinding, acid fuming, and heating. In particular, an emission color and CPL on&#8211;off switch based on the microbelt polymorph by reversible heating&#8211;cooling protocol is developed. This work brings a new approach for developing smart CPL materials via supramolecular polymorphism engineering.

         <title>Achieving Exceptional Volumetric Desalination Capacity Using Compact MoS2 Nanolaminates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 nanolaminates with compact architecture achieved high capacitance up to &#8764;277.5 F cm&#8722;3 under scan rate of 1000 mV s&#8722;1. The electrode demonstrates an exceptional volumetric desalination capacity of 65.1 mgNaCl cm&#8722;3 in capacitive deionization. Theoretical analysis reveals 1T&#697; phase is thermodynamically preferable over 2H phase, and ion hydration, channel confinement also play critical role in ion adsorption.








Abstract
Capacitive deionization (CDI) has emerged as a promising technology for freshwater recovery from low&#8208;salinity brackish water. It is still inapplicable in specific scenarios (e.g., households, islands, or offshore platforms) due to too low volumetric adsorption capacities. In this study, a high&#8208;density semi&#8208;metallic molybdenum disulfide (1T&#697;&#8208;MoS2) electrode with compact architecture obtained by restacking of exfoliated nanosheets, which achieve high capacitance up to &#8776;277.5&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3 under an ultrahigh scan rate of 1000&#160;mV&#160;s&#8722;1 with a lower charge&#8208;transfer resistance and nearly tenfold higher electrochemical active surface area than the 2H&#8208;MoS2 electrode, is reported. Furthermore, 1T&#697;&#8208;MoS2 electrode demonstrates exceptional volumetric desalination capacity of 65.1&#160;mgNaCl&#160;cm&#8722;3 in CDI experiments. Ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) reveal that the cation storage mechanism with the dynamic expansion of 1T&#697;&#8208;MoS2 interlayer to accommodate cations such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, which in turn enhances the capacity. Theoretical analysis unveils that 1T&#697; phase is thermodynamically preferable over 2H phase, the ion hydration and channel confinement also play critical role in enhancing ion adsorption. Overall, this work provides a new method to design compact 2D&#8208;layered nanolaminates with high&#8208;volumetric performance for CDI desalination.

Ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) reveal that the cation storage mechanism with the dynamic expansion of 1T&#697;-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interlayer to accommodate cations such as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which in turn enhances the capacity. Theoretical analysis unveils that 1T&#697; phase is thermodynamically preferable over 2H phase, the ion hydration and channel confinement also play critical role in enhancing ion adsorption. Overall, this work provides a new method to design compact 2D-layered nanolaminates with high-volumetric performance for CDI desalination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;Conductive and Patternable 40&#160;nm&#8208;Thick Polymer Film for Reliable Emotion Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin (40&#160;nm) polymer film comprising photolithographic poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) and graphene (PLPG) is developed as a patternable and compliant bioelectrode. Finite element analysis is adopted to optimize electrode structure for better stress dissipation ability. PLPG demonstrates excellent performance in motion artifact&#8208;less electrophysiological sensing. Integrating facial electromyogram with machine learning algorithms, a high emotion recognition accuracy is achieved.








Abstract
Understanding psychology is an important task in modern society which helps predict human behavior and provide feedback accordingly. Monitoring of weak psychological and emotional changes requires bioelectronic devices to be stretchable and compliant for unobtrusive and high&#8208;fidelity signal acquisition. Thin conductive polymer film is regarded as an ideal interface; however, it is very challenging to simultaneously balance mechanical robustness and opto&#8208;electrical property. Here, a 40&#160;nm&#8208;thick film based on photolithographic double&#8208;network conductive polymer mediated by graphene layer is reported, which concurrently enables stretchability, conductivity, and conformability. Photolithographic polymer and graphene endow the film photopatternability, enhance stress dissipation capability, as well as improve opto&#8208;electrical conductivity (4458 S cm&#8722;1@&gt;90% transparency) through molecular rearrangement by &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction, electrostatic interaction, and hydrogen bonding. The film is further applied onto corrugated facial skin, the subtle electromyogram is monitored, and machine learning algorithm is performed to understand complex emotions, indicating the outstanding ability for stretchable and compliant bioelectronics.

         <title>Bistable Electrochromic Ionogels via Supramolecular Interactions for Energy&#8208;Efficient Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy leveraging supramolecular interactions is proposed for designing bistable electrochromic materials, facilitating reversible color transitions, stabilizing the colored structure, and enabling spatial confinement to inhibit diffusion for bistable electrochromism. Utilizing biobased building blocks, reusable ITO electrodes, and ionogel functional layers, this approach achieves a flexible, energy&#8208;efficient, low&#8208;cost, and sustainable EC displays with excellent bistability.








Abstract
Bistable electrochromic (EC) materials and systems offer significant potential for building decarbonization through their optical modulation and energy efficiency. However, challenges such as limited design strategies and bottlenecks in cost, fabrication, and color have hindered the full commercialization of energy&#8208;saving EC windows and displays, with few materials achieving true bistability. Herein, a novel strategy for designing bistable electrochromic materials is proposed by leveraging supramolecular interactions. These interactions facilitate reversible color transitions, stabilize the colored structure, and enable spatial confinement to inhibit diffusion, thereby achieving bistable electrochromism. The mechanisms and materials underlying these unconventional electrochromic systems are substantiated through detailed characterization. This strategy enables the preparation of low&#8208;cost and sustainable transparent electrochromic displays with high performance. Notably, the display information remains clearly visible for more than 2 h without consuming energy. Involving biomass materials and removable device structures also enhances the sustainability and scalability of EC technology applications and development. These results demonstrate the crucial role of supramolecular chemistry in the development of cutting&#8208;edge materials for applications such as energy&#8208;saving smart windows.

         <title>Rapid&#8208;Response Water&#8208;Shrink Films with High Output Work Density Based on Polyethylene Oxide and &#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin for Autonomous Wound Closure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel water&#8208;shrink film (WS film) with supercontraction, constructed by poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin, is demonstrated. Upon wetting, this film rapidly contracts, generating substantial contraction stress and a high output work density. Water&#8208;shrink tapes, based on this supercontractile film, autonomously close the bleeding wound, offering an innovative approach for self&#8208;treatment, especially in urgent self&#8208;care scenarios.








Abstract
Conventional wound closure methods, including sutures and tissue adhesives, present significant challenges for self&#8208;care treatment, particularly in the context of bleeding wounds. Existing stimuli&#8208;responsive contractile materials designed for autonomous wound closure frequently lack sufficient output work density to generate the force needed to bring the wound edges into proximity or necessitate stimuli that are not compatible with the human body. Here, semi&#8208;transparent, flexible, and water&#8208;responsive shrinkable films, composed of poly(ethylene oxide) and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin, are reported. These films exhibit remarkable stability under ambient conditions and demonstrate significant contraction (&#8776;50%) within 6 s upon exposure to water, generating substantial contractile stress (up to 6&#160;MPa) and output work density (&#8776;1028&#160;kJ m&#8722;3), which is 100 times larger than that of conventional hydrogel and 25 times larger than that of skeletal muscles. Remarkably, upon hydration, these films are capable of lifting objects 10&#160;000 times their own weight. Leveraging this technology, water&#8208;shrink tapes, which, upon contact with water, effectively constrict human skin and autonomously close bleeding wounds in animal models within 10 seconds, are developed further. This work offers a novel approach to skin wound management, showing significant potential for emergency and self&#8208;care scenarios.

         <title>Accelerated Discovery of (TiZrHf)x(NbTa)1&#8722;x High&#8208;Entropy Alloys With Superior Thermal Stability and a New Crystallization Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work performs a high&#8208;throughput investigation of the thermal stability of (TiZrHf)x(NbTa)1&#8722;x&#160;high&#8208;entropy alloys based on combinatorial magnetron co&#8208;sputtering, vacuum annealing, and synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques, observing superior phase and grain size stability than previously reported nanocrystalline counterparts. The effect of composition on thermal stability is evaluated and a new crystallization mechanism is revealed.








Abstract
Nanocrystalline (nc) metals are generally strong yet thermally unstable, rendering them difficult to process and unsuitable for use, particularly at elevated temperatures. Nc multicomponent and high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are found to offer enhanced thermal stability but only in a few empirically discovered systems out of a vast compositional space. In response, this work develops a combinatorial strategy to accelerate the discovery of nc&#8208;(TiZrHf)x(NbTa)1&#8722;x alloy library with distinct thermal stability, in terms of phases and grain sizes. Based on synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and electron microscopy characterizations, a phase transition is observed from amorphous&#8211;crystalline nanocomposites to a body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) phase upon annealing. With increased NbTa content (decreased x value), the system tends to achieve thermally stable dual bcc phases upon annealing; in contrast, alloys with increased TiZrHf content (x &gt; 0.6) maintain a single&#8208;composition nanocomposite state, impeding crystallization and grain growth. This investigation not only broadens the understanding of thermal stability but also delves into the onset of crystallization in HEA systems.

         <title>2D Graphene Oxide Films Expand Functionality of Photonic Chips</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By harnessing the unique property changes induced by photothermal effects in 2D graphene oxide (GO) films, three novel functionalities beyond the capability of photonic integrated circuits are demonstrated, including all&#8208;optical control and tuning, optical power limiting, and nonreciprocal light transmission. The experimental results are theoretically analyzed, reflecting intriguing insights into the physics of 2D GO films.








Abstract
On&#8208;chip integration of 2D materials with unique structures and properties endow integrated devices with new functionalities and improved performance. With high flexibility in ways to modify its properties and compatibility with integrated platforms, graphene oxide (GO) is an exceptionally attractive 2D material for hybrid integrated photonic chips. Here, by harnessing unique property changes induced by photothermal effects in 2D GO films, novel functionalities beyond the capability of photonic integrated circuits are demonstrated. These include all&#8208;optical control and tuning, optical power limiting, and nonreciprocal light transmission. The 2D layered GO films are integrated onto photonic chips with precise control of their thickness and size. Benefitting from the broadband optical response of 2D GO films, all three functionalities feature a very wide operational optical bandwidth. By fitting the experimental results with theory, the changes in GO film properties induced by the photothermal effects are analyzed, revealing interesting insights about the physics of 2D GO films. These results highlight the versatility of 2D GO films in implementing new functions for integrated photonic devices for a wide range of applications.

         <title>Surface Reconstruction for Efficient NiOx&#8208;Based Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A record efficiency of 25.64% is achieved for NiOx&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cell via a surface reconstruction strategy utilized lead chelation (LC) molecules. The LC molecules target passivates the undesirable defects while avoids the adverse clustering in local areas on perovskite surface during the surface reconstruction process, thereby maximizing the passivation effect.








Abstract
Functional agents are verified to efficiently enhance device performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) through surface engineering. However, the influence of intrinsic characteristics of molecules on final device performance is overlooked. Here, a surface reconstruction strategy is developed to enhance the efficiency of inverted PSCs by mitigating the adverse effects of lead chelation (LC) molecules. Bathocuproine (BCP) is chosen as the representative of LC molecules for its easy accessibility and outstanding optoelectronic properties. During this strategy, BCP molecules on perovskite surface are first dissolved in solvents and then captured specially by undercoordinated Pb2+ ions, preventing adverse n&#8208;type doping by the molecules themselves. In this case, the BCP molecule exhibits outstanding passivation effect on perovskite surface, which leads to an obviously increased open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC). Therefore, a record power conversion efficiency of 25.64% for NiOx&#8208;based inverted PSCs is achieved, maintaining over 80% of initial efficiency after exposure to ambient condition for &#8776;1500 h.

         <title>Carbon Dots&#8208;Inked Paper with Single/Two&#8208;Photon Excited Dual&#8208;Mode Thermochromic Afterglow for Advanced Dynamic Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermochromic afterglow (TCAG) in carbon dots&#8208;inked paper (CDs@Paper) is achieved by tuning the temperature&#8208;dependent dual&#8208;mode afterglow of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). The TCAG properties of CDs@Paper are leveraged to design a multidimensional color code containing color and temperature information for advanced dynamic information encryption. And the two&#8208;photon afterglow is first reported in CDs materials.








Abstract
Achieving thermochromic afterglow (TCAG) in a single material for advanced information encryption remains a significant challenge. Herein, TCAG in carbon dots (CDs)&#8208;inked paper (CDs@Paper) is achieved by tuning the temperature&#8208;dependent dual&#8208;mode afterglow of room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). The CDs are synthesized through thermal treatment of levofloxacin in melting boric acid with postpurification via dialysis. CDs@Paper exhibit both TCAG and excitation&#8208;dependent afterglow color properties. The TCAG of CDs@Paper exhibits dynamic color changes from blue at high temperatures to yellow at low temperatures by adjusting the proportion of the temperature&#8208;dependent TADF and phosphorescence. Notably, two&#8208;photon afterglow in CDs&#8208;based afterglow materials and time&#8208;dependent two&#8208;photon afterglow colors are achieved for the first time. Moreover, leveraging the opposite emission responses of phosphorescence and TADF to temperature, CDs@Paper demonstrate TCAG with temperature&#8208;sensing capabilities across a wide temperature range. Furthermore, a CDs@Paper&#8208;based 3D code containing color and temperature information is successfully developed for advanced dynamic information encryption.

         <title>Pt1.8Pd0.2CuGa Intermetallic Nanocatalysts with Enhanced Methanol Oxidation Performance for Efficient Hybrid Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quaternary Pt1.8Pd0.2CuGa intermetallic nanoparticle electrocatalyst is designed, which shows outstanding performance for the methanol oxidation reaction in alkaline&#8211;saline water. Stable energy&#8208;saving hybrid seawater electrolysis is further demonstrated, using the prepared Pt1.8Pd0.2CuGa nanoparticles to catalyze the anodic methanol oxidation coupled with the cathodic hydrogen evolution, which completely circumvents the interfering chlorine evolution.








Abstract
Seawater electrolysis is a potentially cost&#8208;effective approach to green hydrogen production, but it currently faces substantial challenges for its high energy consumption and the interference of chlorine evolution reaction (ClER). Replacing the energy&#8208;demanding oxygen evolution reaction with methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) represents a promising alternative, as MOR occurs at a significantly low anodic potential, which cannot only reduce the voltage needed for electrolysis but also completely circumvents ClER. To this end, developing high&#8208;performance MOR catalysts is a key. Herein, a novel quaternary Pt1.8Pd0.2CuGa/C intermetallic nanoparticle (i&#8208;NP) catalyst is reported, which shows a high mass activity (11.13 A mgPGM&#8722;1), a large specific activity (18.13&#160;mA cmPGM&#8722;2), and outstanding stability toward alkaline MOR. Advanced characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that the introduction of atomically distributed Pd in Pt2CuGa intermetallic markedly promotes the oxidation of key reaction intermediates by enriching electron concentration around Pt sites, resulting in weak adsorption of carbon&#8208;containing intermediates and favorable adsorption of synergistic OH&#8722; groups near Pd sites. MOR&#8208;assisted seawater electrolysis is demonstrated, which continuously operates under 1.23&#160;V for 240&#160;h in simulated seawater and 120&#160;h in natural seawater without notable degradation.

         <title>Giant Iontronic Flexoelectricity in Soft Hydrogels Induced by Tunable Biomimetic Ion Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant iontronic flexoelectricity of soft hydrogels is reported induced by the ion polarization of cations and anions with different transfer rates under bending deformations, achieving flexoelectric coefficient much higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art flexoelectric materials.








Abstract
Flexoelectricity features the strain gradient&#8208;induced mechanoelectric conversion using materials not limited by their crystalline symmetry, but state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art flexoelectric materials exhibit very small flexoelectric coefficients and are too brittle to withstand large deformations. Here, inspired by the ion polarization in living organisms, this paper reports the giant iontronic flexoelectricity of soft hydrogels where the ion polarization is attributed to the different transfer rates of cations and anions under bending deformations. The flexoelectricity is found to be easily regulated by the types of anion&#8211;cation pairs and polymer networks in the hydrogel. A polyacrylamide hydrogel with 1&#160;m NaCl achieves a record&#8208;high flexoelectric coefficient of &#8776;1160 &#181;C m&#8722;1, which can even be improved to &#8776;2340 &#181;C m&#8722;1 by synergizing with the effects of ion pairs and extra polycation chains. Furthermore, the hydrogel as flexoelectric materials can withstand larger bending deformations to obtain higher polarization charges owing to its intrinsic low modulus and high elasticity. A soft flexoelectric sensor is then demonstrated for object recognition by robotic hands. The findings greatly broaden the flexoelectricity to soft, biomimetic, and biocompatible materials and applications.

&lt;p&gt;Giant iontronic flexoelectricity of soft hydrogels is reported induced by the ion polarization of cations and anions with different transfer rates under bending deformations, achieving flexoelectric coefficient much higher than state-of-the-art flexoelectric materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexoelectricity features the strain gradient-induced mechanoelectric conversion using materials not limited by their crystalline symmetry, but state-of-the-art flexoelectric materials exhibit very small flexoelectric coefficients and are too brittle to withstand large deformations. Here, inspired by the ion polarization in living organisms, this paper reports the giant iontronic flexoelectricity of soft hydrogels where the ion polarization is attributed to the different transfer rates of cations and anions under bending deformations. The flexoelectricity is found to be easily regulated by the types of anion&#8211;cation pairs and polymer networks in the hydrogel. A polyacrylamide hydrogel with 1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; NaCl achieves a record-high flexoelectric coefficient of &#8776;1160 &#181;C m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which can even be improved to &#8776;2340 &#181;C m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; by synergizing with the effects of ion pairs and extra polycation chains. Furthermore, the hydrogel as flexoelectric materials can withstand larger bending deformations to obtain higher polarization charges owing to its intrinsic low modulus and high elasticity.

         <title>Molecule Crowding Strategy in Polymer Electrolytes Inducing Stable Interfaces for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecule crowding effect caused by 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5&#160;leads to the abundant anions are forcing into the Li+ coordinated sheath to form anion&#8208;rich coordinated structure, which weakens the Li+ coordination and consequently boosts the Li+ transport. The confined anions decomposed at electrode/electrolyte interfaces to forming stable SEI and CEI, which achieve uniform lithium deposition, prevent electrolytes' continuous degradation, and suppress transition&#8208;metal crosstalk.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries with polymer electrolytes suffer from electrolyte decomposition and lithium dendrites because of the unstable electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Herein, a molecule crowding strategy is proposed to modulate the Li+ coordinated structure, thus in situ constructing the stable interfaces. Since 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 possesses superior compatibility with polymer and electrostatic repulsion for anion of lithium salt, the anions are forced to crowd into a Li+ coordinated structure to weaken the Li+ coordination with polymer and boost the Li+ transport. The coordinated anions prior decompose to form LiF&#8208;rich, thin, and tough interfacial passivation layers for stabilizing the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Thus, the symmetric Li&#8211;Li cell can stably operate over 4360&#160;h, the LiFePO4||Li full battery presents 97.18% capacity retention in 700 cycles at 2&#160;C, and the NCM811||Li full battery possesses the capacity retention of 83.17% after 300 cycles. The assembled pouch cell shows excellent flexibility (stand for folding over 2000 times) and stability (89.42% capacity retention after 400 cycles). This work provides a promising strategy to regulate interfacial chemistry by modulating the ion environment to accommodate the interfacial issues and will inspire more effective approaches to general interface issues for polymer electrolytes.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Array via Liquid Metal Nanoreactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The liquid metal nanoreactor strategy is proposed for realizing high&#8208;entropy alloy arrays. The coalescence nature endowed by the tendency to decrease surface energy constructed the basis of the nanoreactor to provide a confined reaction environment for the nucleation and growth of multiple elements, thus forming a single particle within each patterned feature.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) nanostructures arranged into well&#8208;defined configurations hold great potential for accelerating the development of electronics, photonics, catalysis, and device integration. However, the random nucleation induced by the disparity in physicochemical properties of multiple elements makes it challenging to achieve single&#8208;particle synthesis at the patterned preset sites in the high&#8208;entropy scenario. Herein, the liquid metal nanoreactor strategy is proposed to realize the construction of HEA arrays. The coalescence of the liquid metal driven by the tendency to decrease surface energy provides a restricted environment for the nucleation and growth to form single HEA particles at the preset locations, which can be regarded as a self&#8208;confinement reaction. Liquid metal endowing a low diffusion energy barrier on the substrate and a high diffusivity of the alloy system can dynamically promote the aggregation process. As a result, the HEA array is prepared with elements up to eleven and possesses uniform periodicity, which exhibits excellent holography response in a broad spectrum. This work injects new vitality into the construction of HEA nanopatterns and provides an excellent platform for propelling their fundamental research and applications.

         <title>Intrinsic Elastomer with Remarkable Dielectric Constant via Elastification of Relaxor Ferroelectric Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the slight cross&#8208;linking of relaxor ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;ter&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;ter&#8208;chlorofluoroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CFE)), intrinsic elastomer with a remarkable dielectric constant of 54.2 at 100 Hz is obtained. Notably, the dielectric constant of the elastomer nearly doubles that of pristine P)(VDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CFE), and surpasses all reported intrinsic elastomers, suggesting that the slight cross&#8208;linking of relaxor ferroelectric polymers can effectively enhance the dielectric constants in intrinsic elastomers.








Abstract
High&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant elastomers always play a critical role in the development of wearable electronics for actuation, energy storage, and sensing; therefore, there is an urgent need for effective strategies to enhance dielectric constants. The present methods mainly involve adding inorganic or conductive fillers to the polymer elastomers, however, the addition of fillers causes a series of problems, such as large dielectric loss, increased modulus, and deteriorating interface conditions. Here, the elastification of relaxor ferroelectric polymers is investigated through slight cross&#8208;linking, aiming to obtain intrinsic elastomers with high&#8208;dielectric constants. By cross&#8208;linking of the relaxor ferroelectric polymer poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;ter&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;ter&#8208;chlorofluoroethylene) with a long soft chain cross&#8208;linker, a relaxor ferroelectric elastomer with an enhanced dielectric constant is obtained, twice that of the pristine relaxor ferroelectric polymer and surpassing all reported intrinsic elastomers. This elastomer maintains its high&#8208;dielectric constant over a wide temperature range and exhibits robust mechanical fatigue resistance, chemical stability, and thermal stability. Moreover, the ferroelectricity of the elastomer remains stable under strains up to 80%. This study offers a simple and effective way to enhance the dielectric constant of intrinsic elastomers, thus facilitating advancements in soft robots, biosensors, and wearable electronics.

         <title>Photosensitizer&#8208;Amplified Antimicrobial Materials for Broad&#8208;Spectrum Ablation of Resistant Pathogens in Ocular Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of photodynamic therapy agents combining nonphotosensitive and photosensitive benzodiazoles and their modular integration into peptide sequences for broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity is presented. Chemical optimization leads to PEP3 with strong phototoxicity against Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria as well as fungi, including MDR pathogens, biofilms, and ex vivo porcine models of microbial keratitis.








Abstract
The emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens and the scarcity of new potent antibiotics and antifungals are one of the biggest threats to human health. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) combines light and photosensitizers to kill drug&#8208;resistant pathogens; however, there are limited materials that can effectively ablate different classes of infective pathogens. In the present work, a new class of benzodiazole&#8208;paired materials is designed as highly potent PDT agents with broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity upon illumination with nontoxic light. The results mechanistically demonstrate that the energy transfer and electron transfer between nonphotosensitive and photosensitive benzodiazole moieties embedded within pathogen&#8208;binding peptide sequences result in increased singlet oxygen generation and enhanced phototoxicity. Chemical optimization renders PEP3 as a novel PDT agent with remarkable activity against MDR bacteria and fungi as well as pathogens at different stages of development (e.g., biofilms, spores, and fungal hyphae), which also prove effective in an ex vivo porcine model of microbial keratitis. The chemical modularity of this strategy and its general compatibility with peptide&#8208;based targeting agents will accelerate the design of highly photosensitive materials for antimicrobial PDT.

         <title>Constructing an Interlaced Catalytic Surface via Fluorine&#8208;Doped Bimetallic Oxides for Oxygen Electrode Processes in Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural and catalytic factors of the oxygen electrode, culminating in the design of fluorine&#8208;doped bimetallic cobalt&#8208;nickel oxide (CoNiO2&#8211;xFx/CC) featuring an interlaced catalytic surface and a corncob&#8208;like structure, are meticulously balanced. Benefiting from its unique structural configuration and catalytic mechanism, the designed material significantly enhances the electrochemical performance of Li&#8211;O2 batteries across various aspects.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries, renowned for their high theoretical energy density, have garnered significant interest as prime candidates for future electric device development. However, their actual capacity is often unsatisfactory due to the passivation of active sites by solid&#8208;phase discharge products. Optimizing the growth and storage of these products is a crucial step in advancing Li&#8211;O2 batteries. Here, a fluorine&#8208;doped bimetallic cobalt&#8208;nickel oxide (CoNiO2&#8211;xFx/CC) with an interlaced catalytic surface (ICS) and a corncob&#8208;like structure is proposed as an oxygen electrode. Unlike conventional oxide electrodes with a &#8220;single adsorption catalytic mechanism,&#8221; the ICS of CoNiO2&#8722;xFx/CC offers a &#8220;competitive adsorption catalytic mechanism,&#8221; where oxygen sites facilitate oxygen conversion while fluorine sites contribute to the growth of Li2O2. This results in a change in Li2O2 morphology from a surface film to toroidal particles, effectively preventing&#160;the burial of active sites. Additionally, the unique open architecture aids in the capture and release of oxygen and the formation of well&#8208;contacted Li2O2/electrode interfaces, which benefits the complete decomposition of Li2O2 products. Consequently, the Li&#8211;O2 battery with a CoNiO2&#8722;xFx/CC cathode demonstrates a high specific capacity of up to 30923 mAh g&#8722;1 and a lifespan exceeding 580 cycles, surpassing most reported metal oxide&#8208;based cathodes.

         <title>Visual Eosin Y&#8208;Based Photosensitization Sensing Systems for Ultrasensitive Detection of Diclofenac with Single&#8208;Atom Co&#9472;N2O2 Site&#8208;Immobilized g&#8208;C3N4 Nanosheets</title>

Single&#8208;atom Co&#9472;N2O2 site&#8208;immobilized g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets are used to successfully establish a novel, visually striking, ultrahigh sensitive, and selective photosensitive detection system for colorless diclofenac with dye eosin Y for the first time.








Abstract
It is highly desired to develop a visual sensing system for ultrasensitive detection of colorless diclofenac (DCF), yet with a significant challenge. Herein, a novel dye&#8208;based photosensitization sensing system has been successfully developed for detecting DCF for the first time, in which the used dye eosin Y (DeY) can strongly absorb visible light and then be decolorized obviously by transferring photogenerated electrons to g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets (CN), while the built single&#8208;atomic Co&#9472;N2O2 sites on CN by boron&#8208;oxygen connection can competitively adsorb DCF to impede the photosensitization decoloration of DeY. This system exhibits a broad detection range from 8&#160;ng&#160;L&#8722;1 to 2 mg&#160;L&#8722;1 with 535&#160;nm light, an exceptionally low detection limit (3.5&#160;ng&#160;L&#8722;1), and remarkable selectivity. Through the time&#8208;resolved, in situ technologies, and theoretical calculations, the decolorization of DeY is attributed to the disruption of DeY's conjugated structure caused by the triplet excited state electron transfer from DeY to CN, meanwhile, the adsorbed oxygen facilitates the charge transfer process. The preferential adsorption of DCF mainly depends on the strong interactions between the as&#8208;constructed single&#8208;atom Co and Cl in DCF. This study opens an innovative light&#8208;driven sensing system by combining dye and single&#8208;atom metal/nanomaterial for visually intuitive detection of environmental pollutants.

         <title>Novel Palladium Hydride Surface Enabling Simultaneous Bacterial Killing and Osteogenic Formation through Proton Capturing and Activation of Antioxidant System in Immune Microenvironments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium hydride (PdHx) film, fabricated on titanium implants, exhibits a lattice capable of capturing protons within the bacterial microenvironment, consequently inducing bacterial death. Furthermore, it mimics human antioxidant systems, reshaping the osteogenic immune microenvironment and promoting osteogenesis.








Abstract
Achieving bacterial killing and osteogenic formation on an implant surface rarely occurs. In this study, a novel surface design&#8211;a palladium hydride (PdHx) film that enables these two distinct features to coexist is introduced. The PdHx lattice captures protons in the extracellular microenvironment of bacteria, disrupting their normal metabolic activities, such as ATP synthesis, nutrient co&#8208;transport, and oxidative stress. This disruption leads to significant bacterial death, as evidenced by RNA sequence analysis. Additionally, the unique enzymatic activity and hydrogen&#8208;loading properties of PdHx activate the human antioxidant system, resulting in the rapid clearance of reactive oxygen species. This process reshapes the osteogenic immune microenvironment, promoting accelerated osteogenesis. These findings reveal that the downregulation of the NOD&#8208;like receptor signaling pathway is critical for activating immune cells toward M2 phenotype polarization. This novel surface design provides new strategies for modifying implant coatings to simultaneously prevent bacterial infection, reduce inflammation, and enhance tissue regeneration, making it a noteworthy contribution to the field of advanced materials.

         <title>Toward 1D Transport in 3D Materials: SOC&#8208;Induced Charge&#8208;Transport Anisotropy in Sm3ZrBi5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) mechanistically induces 1D charge transport in the bulk, 3D structure Ln3ZrPn5 (Ln = La, Sm; Pn = Sb, Bi). Anisotropic charge transport measurements and electronic structure calculations demonstrate how the anisotropic 3D Fermi Surface of the antimonide is dimensionally reduced to 1D sheets of electron density in the bismuthides.








Abstract
1D charge transport offers great insight into strongly correlated physics, such as Luttinger liquids, electronic instabilities, and superconductivity. Although 1D charge transport is observed in nanomaterials and quantum wires, examples in bulk crystalline solids remain elusive. In this work, it is demonstrated that spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) can act as a mechanism to induce quasi&#8208;1D charge transport in the Ln3MPn5 (Ln = lanthanide; M = transition metal; Pn = Pnictide) family. From three example compounds, La3ZrSb5, La3ZrBi5, and Sm3ZrBi5, density functional theory calculations with SOC included show a quasi&#8208;1D Fermi surface in the bismuthide compounds, but an anisotropic 3D Fermi surface in the antimonide structure. By performing anisotropic charge transport measurements on La3ZrSb5, La3ZrBi5, and Sm3ZrBi5, it is demonstrated that SOC starkly affects their anisotropic resistivity ratios (ARR) at low temperatures, with an ARR of &#8776;4 in the antimonide compared to &#8776;9.5 and &#8776;22 (&#8776;32 after magnetic ordering) in La3ZrBi5 and Sm3ZrBi5, respectively. This report demonstrates the utility of spin&#8208;orbit coupling to induce quasi&#8208;low&#8208;dimensional Fermi surfaces in anisotropic crystal structures, and provides a template for examining other&#160;systems.

By performing anisotropic charge transport measurements on La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ZrSb&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ZrBi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, and Sm&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ZrBi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, it is demonstrated that SOC starkly affects their anisotropic resistivity ratios (ARR) at low temperatures, with an ARR of &#8776;4 in the antimonide compared to &#8776;9.5 and &#8776;22 (&#8776;32 after magnetic ordering) in La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ZrBi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and Sm&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ZrBi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. This report demonstrates the utility of spin-orbit coupling to induce quasi-low-dimensional Fermi surfaces in anisotropic crystal structures, and provides a template for examining other&#160;systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Protocell Flow Reactors for Enzyme and Whole&#8208;Cell Mediated Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protocell continuous flow reactors consisting of a densely packed array of enzyme&#8208; or bacteria&#8208;containing membranized coacervate vesicles are constructed and used for the spatiotemporal processing of biochemical and whole&#8208;cell mediated catalysis. The engineering of continuous flow reactors based on cell&#8208;like microscale agents offers opportunities in the development of green and sustainable industrial bioprocessing.








Abstract
The design and construction of continuous flow biochemical reactors comprising immobilized biocatalysts have generated great interest in the efficient synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals. Living cells use compartmentalization and reaction&#8208;diffusion processes for spatiotemporal regulation of biocatalytic reactions, and implementing these strategies into continuous flow reactors can offer new opportunities in reactor design and application. Herein, the fabrication of protocell&#8208;based continuous flow reactors for enzyme and whole&#8208;cell mediated biocatalysis is demonstrated. Semipermeable membranized coacervate vesicles are employed as model protocells that spontaneously sequester enzymes or accumulate living bacteria to produce embodied microreactors capable of single&#8208; or multiple&#8208;step catalytic reactions. By packing millions of the enzyme/bacteria&#8208;containing coacervate vesicles in a glass column, a facile, cost&#8208;effective, and modular methodology capable of performing oxidoreductase, peroxidase and lipolytic reactions, enzyme&#8208;mediated L&#8208;DOPA synthesis, and whole&#8208;cell glycolysis under continuous flow conditions, is demonstrated. It is shown that the protocell&#8208;nested enzymes and bacterial cells exhibit enhanced activities and stability under deleterious operating conditions compared with their non&#8208;encapsulated counterparts. These results provide a step toward the engineering of continuous flow reactors based on cell&#8208;like microscale agents and offer opportunities in the development of green and sustainable industrial bioprocessing.

         <title>Symmetry Evolution Induced 2D Pt Single Atom Catalyst with High Density for Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uses salt&#8208;assisted methods to adjust the tetrahedral coordination in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks &#8208; 8 (ZIF&#8208;8) to planar tetragonal coordination without changing the ligand. In the carbonization process, to maintain the 2D morphology, the five&#8208;membered ring undergoes reconstruction to form a six&#8208;membered ring, introducing defects. These defects result in highly loaded Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts with high hydrogen oxidation reaction activity after electrodeposition.








Abstract
The performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts is greatly influenced by the chemical environment surrounding the central atom. Here, a salt&#8208;assisted method is employed to transform the tetrahedral coordination structure of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks &#8208; 8 (ZIF&#8208;8)&#160;into a planar square coordination structure without altering the ligands. During the subsequent carbonization process, concurrent with the evaporation of zinc atoms, the structure of the nitrogen and carbon carriers (NC carriers) undergoes a transition from five&#8208;membered rings to six&#8208;membered rings to preserve the 2D structure. This transition results in the generation of additional defect sites on the 2D&#8208;NC substrates. Hence, the Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts with planar square coordination symmetries can be precisely prepared via electrodeposition (denoted as 2D&#8208;Pt SAC). The Pt loading of 2D&#8208;Pt SAC is 0.49 &#177; 0.03 &#181;g cm&#8722;2, higher than that of 3D&#8208;Pt SAC (0.37 &#177; 0.04 &#181;g cm&#8722;2). In the context of the hydrogen oxidation reaction electrocatalysis, under an overpotential of 50 mV, these single&#8208;atom catalysts with 2D coordination exhibit mass activities of 2396 A gPt&#8722;1 (32 times higher than commercial Pt/C catalyst, 2 times higher than 3D&#8208;PtNC).

         <title>Planar Chlorination Engineering: A Strategy of Completely Breaking the Geometric Symmetry of Fe&#8208;N4 Site for Boosting Oxygen Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The planar chlorination engineering of Fe&#8208;N4 site is successfully designed by &#8220;NaCl&#8208;co&#8208;pyrolysis&#8221; strategy, which completely breaks the geometric symmetry of Fe&#8208;N4 site. The Fe&#8208;N4/CNCl catalyst exhibits higher catalytic activities for both oxygen electroreduction and Zn&#8208;air battery test than traditional Fe&#8208;N4 catalyst, revealing the enormous potential of planar chlorination engineering in electrocatalysis, energy storage, and conversion devices.








Abstract
Introducing asymmetric elements and breaking the geometric symmetry of traditional metal&#8208;N4 site for boosting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are meaningful and challenging. Herein, the planar chlorination engineering of Fe&#8208;N4 site is first proposed for remarkably improving the ORR activity. The Fe&#8208;N4/CNCl catalyst with broken symmetry exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.917&#160;V versus RHE, 49 and 72&#160;mV higher than those of traditional Fe&#8208;N4/CN and commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalysts. The Fe&#8208;N4/CNCl catalyst also has excellent stability for 25&#160;000 cycles and good methanol tolerance ability. For Zn&#8208;air battery test, the Fe&#8208;N4/CNCl catalyst has the maximum power density of 228&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and outstanding stability during 150&#160;h charge&#8211;discharge test, as the promising substitute of Pt&#8208;based catalysts in energy storage and conversion devices. The density functional theory calculation demonstrates that the adjacent C&#9472;Cl bond effectively breaks the symmetry of Fe&#8208;N4 site, downward shifts the d&#8208;band center of Fe, facilitates the reduction and release of OH*, and remarkably lowers the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step. This work reveals the enormous potential of planar chlorination engineering for boosting the ORR activity of traditional metal&#8208;N4 site by thoroughly breaking their geometric symmetry.

         <title>Treefrog&#8208;Inspired Flexible Electrode with High Permeability, Stable Adhesion, and Robust Durability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The challenges of instable adhesion, low impedance, and robust durability that hinder the long&#8208;term application of in vitro bioelectrodes. Inspired by treefrog web and bird's beak, through the optimization design, a web&#8208;like electrode, which can solve these complex integrated challenges, is proposed. Proposed electrode has the most balanced mechanical, electrical, and electrode properties of typical electrodes reported in recent years.









Abstract
Long&#8208;term continuous monitoring (LTCM) of physiological electrical signals is an effective means for detecting several cardiovascular diseases. However, the integrated challenges of stable adhesion, low impedance, and robust durability under different skin conditions significantly hinder the application of flexible electrodes in LTCM. This paper proposes a structured electrode inspired by the treefrog web, comprising dispersed pillars at the bottom and asymmetric cone holes at the top. Attachment structures with a dispersed pillar improve the contact stability (adhesion increases 2.79/13.16 times in dry/wet conditions compared to an electrode without structure). Improved permeable duct structure provides high permeability (12 times compared to cotton). Due to high adhesion and permeability, the electrode's durability is 40 times larger than commercial Ag/AgCl electrodes. The treefrog web&#8208;like electrode has great advantages in permeability, adhesion, and durability, resulting in prospects for application in physiological electrical signal detection and a new design idea for LTCM wearable dry electrodes.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Rational Design of Si&#9472;Rhodamine as Cathepsin&#8208;pH&#8208;Activated Probe for Accurate Fluorescence Navigation</title>

         <dc:description>
The development of machine learning has dramatically revolutionized the process of material discovery. Here, the desired xanthene dyes are rational designed through machine learning and dual&#8208;locked probe for precise imaging of complex hepatocellular carcinoma is constructed. These results not only affirm the validity of the model but also guide the design of novel probes with practical applications.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance fluorescent probes stand as indispensable tools in fluorescence&#8208;guided imaging, and are crucial for precise delineation of focal tissue while minimizing unnecessary removal of healthy tissue. Herein, machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted strategy to investigate the current available xanthene dyes is first proposed, and a quantitative prediction model to guide the rational synthesis of novel fluorescent molecules with the desired pH responsivity is constructed. Two novel Si&#9472;rhodamine derivatives are successfully achieved and the cathepsin/pH sequentially activated probe Si&#9472;rhodamine&#9472;cathepsin&#8208;pH (SiR&#9472;CTS&#8208;pH) is constructed. The results reveal that SiR&#9472;CTS&#8208;pH exhibits higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of fluorescence imaging, compared to single pH or cathepsin&#8208;activated probe. Moreover, SiR&#9472;CTS&#8208;pH shows strong differentiation abilities for tumor cells and tissues and accurately discriminates the complex hepatocellular carcinoma tissues from normal ones, indicating its significant application potential in clinical practice. Therefore, the continuous development of xanthene dyes and the rational design of superior fluorescent molecules through machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted model broaden the path and provide more advanced methods to researchers.

         <title>Hierarchical Chiral Calcium Silicate Hydrate Films Promote Vascularization for Tendon&#8208;to&#8208;Bone Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium silicate hydrate films with levorotatory chirality promote endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis by activating integrin receptors and mechanosensitive ion channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 4. This process enhances vascularization at the enthesis and eventually promotes tendon&#8208;to&#8208;bone healing in rat rotator cuff tear models, underscoring the potential of chiral biomaterials for tissue regeneration via revascularization.








Abstract
Revascularization after rotator cuff repair is crucial for tendon&#8208;to&#8208;bone healing. The chirality of materials has been reported to influence their performance in tissue repair. However, data on the use of chiral structures to optimize biomaterials as a revascularization strategy remain scarce. Here, calcium silicate hydrate (CSO) films with hierarchical chirality on the atomic to micrometer scale are developed. Interestingly, levorotatory CSO (L&#8208;CSO) films promote the migration and angiogenesis of endothelial cells, whereas dextral and racemic CSO films do not induce the same effects. Molecular analysis demonstrates that L&#8208;chirality can be recognized by integrin receptors and leads to the formation of focal adhesion, which activates mechanosensitive ion channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 to conduct Ca2+ influx. Consequently, the phosphorylation of serum response factor is biased by Ca2+ influx to promote the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 signaling pathway, resulting in enhanced angiogenesis. After implanted in a rat rotator cuff tear model, L&#8208;CSO films strongly enhance vascularization at the enthesis, promoting collagen maturation, increasing bone and fibrocartilage formation, and eventually improving the biomechanical strength. This study reveals the mechanism through which chirality influences angiogenesis in endothelial cells and provides a critical theoretical foundation for the clinical application of chiral biomaterials.

         <title>A Cable&#8208;Stayed Honeycomb Superstructure to Improve the Stability of Li&#8208;Rich Materials via Inhibiting Interlaminar Lattice Strain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cable&#8208;stayed honeycomb superstructure is constructed by inducing high Li/Ni disorder in Li&#8208;rich cathode materials. The short&#8208;range order of the honeycomb superstructure is confirmed by the neutron pair distribution function. Benefiting from the high voltage stability and a superior crystal cell evolution mechanism of the cable&#8208;stayed superstructure, excellent cycle performance of the Li&#8208;rich/Si&#8208;C full cell is achieved.








Abstract
In layered Li&#8208;rich materials, over stoichiometric Li forms an ordered occupation of LiTM6 in transition metal (TM)&#160;layer, showing a honeycomb superstructure along [001] direction. At the atomic scale, the instability of the superstructure at high voltage is the root cause of problems such as capacity/voltage decay of Li&#8208;rich materials. Here a Li&#8208;rich material with a high Li/Ni disorder is reported, these interlayer Ni atoms locate above the honeycomb superstructure and share adjacent O coordination with honeycomb TM. These Ni&#9472;O bonds act as cable&#8208;stayed bridge to the honeycomb plane, and improve the high&#8208;voltage stability. The cable&#8208;stayed honeycomb superstructure is confirmed by in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction to have a unique cell evolution mechanism that it can alleviate interlaminar lattice strain by promoting in&#8208;plane expansion along a&#8208;axis and inhibiting c&#8208;axis stretching. Electrochemical tests also demonstrate significantly improved long cycle performance after 500 cycles (86% for Li&#8208;rich/Li half cell and 82% for Li&#8208;rich/Si&#8208;C full cell) and reduced irreversible oxygen release. This work proves the feasibility of achieving outstanding stability of lithium&#8208;rich materials through superstructure regulation and provides new insights for the development of the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes.

         <title>Full&#8208;Space Electric Field in Mo&#8208;Decorated Zn2In2S5 Polarization Photocatalyst for Oriented Charge Flow and Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting the challenge of inadequate charge kinetics within the photocatalyst, this work has induced a sophisticated full&#8208;space electric field in an atomically dispersed Mo cluster&#8208;decorated Zn2In2S5, resulting in a substantial boost in charge separation efficiency and a streamlined charge flow, thereby paving the way for a highly&#8208;efficient artificial photosynthesis process.








Abstract
Integration of photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution with oxidative organic synthesis presents a highly attractive strategy for the simultaneous production of clean H2 fuel and high&#8208;value chemicals. However, the sluggish dynamics of photogenerated charge carriers across the photocatalysts result in low photoconversion efficiency, hindering the wide applications of such a technology. Herein, this work overcomes this limitation by inducing the full&#8208;space electric field via charge polarization engineering on a Mo cluster&#8208;decorated Zn2In2S5 (Mo&#8208;Zn2In2S5) photocatalyst. Specifically, this full&#8208;space electric field arises from a cascade of the bulk electric field (BEF) and local surface electric field (LSEF), triggering the oriented migration of photogenerated electrons from [Zn&#8211;S] regions to [In&#8211;S] regions and eventually to Mo cluster sites, ensuring efficient separation of bulk and surface charge carriers. Moreover, the surface Mo clusters induce a tip enhancement effect to optimize charge transfer behavior by augmenting electrons and proton concentration around the active sites on the basal plane of Zn2In2S5. Notably, the optimized Mo1.5&#8208;Zn2In2S5 catalyst achieves exceptional H2 and benzaldehyde production rates of 34.35 and 45.31&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively, outperforming pristine ZnIn2S4 by 3.83&#8208; and 4.15&#8208;fold. These findings mark a significant stride in steering charge flow for enhanced photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Unconventional Band Structure via Combined Molecular Orbital and Lattice Symmetries in a Surface&#8208;Confined Metallated Graphdiyne Sheet</title>

ToC Figure illustrates the emergence of unconventional band structure in mesoscopically (&#8776;1 &#181;m) ordered metallated&#8208;graphdiyne single sheet due to combined frontier molecular orbital and lattice symmetries.








Abstract
Graphyne (GY) and graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based monolayers represent the next generation 2D carbon&#8208;rich materials with tunable structures and properties surpassing those of graphene. However, the detection of band formation in atomically thin GY/GDY analogues has been challenging, as both long&#8208;range order and atomic precision have to be fulfilled in the system. The present&#160;work reports direct evidence of band formation in on&#8208;surface synthesized metallated Ag&#8208;GDY sheets with mesoscopic (&#8776;1&#160;&#181;m) regularity. Employing scanning tunneling and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopies, energy&#8208;dependent transitions of real&#8208;space electronic states above the Fermi level and formation of the valence band are respectively observed. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations corroborate the observations and reveal that doubly degenerate frontier molecular orbitals on a honeycomb lattice give rise to flat, Dirac and Kagome bands close to the Fermi level. DFT modeling also indicates an intrinsic band gap for the pristine sheet material, which is retained for a bilayer with h&#8208;BN, whereas adsorption&#8208;induced in&#8208;gap electronic states evolve at the synthesis platform with Ag&#8208;GDY decorating the (111) facet of silver. These results illustrate the tremendous potential for engineering novel band structures via molecular orbital and lattice symmetries in atomically precise 2D carbon materials.

         <title>Gradient Doping Enables an Extraordinary Efficiency in Thermoelectric PbTe1&#8722;xIx</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gradient doping is realized in PbTe1&#8722;xIx using a vertical gradient solidification technique, enabling a spatial gradient in carrier concentration that optimizes zT at each portion of the device under its operating temperature. Such a gradient doping results in an extraordinary device efficiency of &#8776;14% at a &#916;T of &#8776;500&#160;K, corresponding to a &#8776;40% improvement as compared to homogeneous doping.








Abstract
The conversion efficiency of thermoelectric generators that have to be operated under a temperature difference (&#916;T) is mainly determined by material's dimensionless figure of merit (zT). However, maximization of zT at each temperature requires an optimization of carrier concentration (nopt) which strongly depends on the temperature and band parameters. Commonly utilized strategy of chemical doping usually enables a homogeneous carrier concentration throughout the material, leading the maximal zT to be achievable only within a narrow temperature range. In this work, a gradiently doping is successfully realized in PbTe1&#8722;xIx using a vertical gradient solidification technique, enabling a spatial gradient in carrier concentration that correspondingly optimizes zT at each portion of the material under its operating temperature. Such a gradient doping results in an extraordinary device efficiency of &#8776;14% at a &#916;T of &#8776;500&#160;K, corresponding to a &#8776;40% improvement as compared to that of homogeneous doping. Since directional solidification technique commonly enables gradient dopant concentrations in semiconductors, the resultant gradient carrier concentration is illustrated here as an effective approach for advancing thermoelectrics.

         <title>Brain Delivery of Protein Therapeutics by Cell Matrix&#8208;Inspired Biomimetic Nanocarrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell matrix&#8208;inspired biomimetic nanocarrier for intracerebral delivery of protein therapeutics. It transports diverse proteins across the blood&#8211;brain barrier. It facilitates rapid intracellular delivery and release of catalase via macropinocytosis&#8208;activated membrane fusion, resulting in improved spatial learning and memory in traumatic brain injury mice, and enhances motor function and prolongs survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mice.








Abstract
Protein therapeutics are anticipated to offer significant treatment options for central nervous system (CNS) diseases. However, the majority of proteins are unable to traverse the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and reach their CNS target sites. Inspired by the natural environment of active proteins, the cell matrix components hyaluronic acid (HA) and protamine (PRTM) are used to self&#8208;assemble with proteins to form a protein&#8208;loaded biomimetic core and then incorporated into ApoE3&#8208;reconstituted high&#8208;density lipoprotein (rHDL) to form a protein&#8208;loaded biomimetic nanocarrier (Protein&#8208;HA&#8208;PRTM&#8208;rHDL). This cell matrix&#8208;inspired biomimetic nanocarrier facilitates the penetration of protein therapeutics across the BBB and enables their access to intracellular target sites. Specifically, CAT&#8208;HA&#8208;PRTM&#8208;rHDL facilitates rapid intracellular delivery and release of catalase (CAT) via macropinocytosis&#8208;activated membrane fusion, resulting in improved spatial learning and memory in traumatic brain injury (TBI) model mice (significantly reduces the latency of TBI mice and doubles the number of crossing platforms), and enhances motor function and prolongs survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) model mice (extended the median survival of ALS mice by more than 10 days). Collectively, this cell matrix&#8208;inspired nanoplatform enables the efficient CNS delivery of protein therapeutics and provides a novel approach for the treatment of CNS diseases.

         <title>Intranasal Delivery of Near&#8208;Infrared and Magnetic Dual&#8208;Response Nanospheres to Rapidly Produce Antidepressant&#8208;Like and Cognitive Enhancement Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>

Inspired from snuff bottle, a nasal delivery system with the combination of iron supplementation and a peripheral D2 receptor antagonist is developed for dopamine receptors upregulation which can solve a variety of mental disorders (such as depression, anxiety, and addiction) and improve cognition of patients.








Abstract
Restricted by synaptic plasticity, dopamine receptor (DR) upregulation takes a long time to work. Moreover, the impact of the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) on delivery efficiency restricts the development of drugs. Taking inspiration from snuff bottles, a convenient, fast&#8208;acting, and nonaddictive nasal drug delivery system has been developed to rapidly reshape the balance of synaptic transmitters. This optical and magnetic response system called CFs@DP, comprised of carbonized MIL&#8208;100 (Fe) frameworks (CFs) and domperidone (DP), which can enter the brain via nasal administration. Under dual stimulation of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation and catecholamine&#8208;induced complexation, CFs@DP disintegrates to release iron ions and DP, causing upregulation of the dopamine type 1 (D1), type 2 (D2) receptors, and brain&#8208;derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to achieve a therapeutic effect. In vivo experiments demonstrate that the DR density of mice (postnatal day 50&#8211;60) increased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HPC) after 10 days of therapy, resulting in antidepressant&#8208;like and cognitive enhancement effects. Interestingly, the cognitive enhancement effect of CFs@DP is even working in noniron deficiency (normal fed) mice, making it a promising candidate for application in enhancing learning ability.

And these parameters have significant impacts on lithium metal reversibility and corrosion. Solvents with high dipole moments are more likely to adsorb onto lithium metal surfaces, which also influence the solid electrolyte interphase.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) must have both long cycle life and calendar life to be commercially viable. However, &#8220;trial and error&#8221; methodologies remain prevalent in contemporary research endeavors to identify favorable electrolytes. Here, a guiding principle for the selection of solvents for LMBs is proposed, which aims to achieve high Coulombic efficiency while minimizing the corrosion. For the first time, this study reveals that the dipole moment and orientation of solvent molecules have significant impacts on lithium metal reversibility and corrosion. Solvents with high dipole moments are more likely to adsorb onto lithium metal surfaces, which also influence the solid electrolyte interphase. Using this principle, the use of LiNO3 is demonstrated as the sole salt in LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Li cells can achieve excellent cycling stability. Overall, this work bridges the molecular structure of solvents to the reversibility and corrosion of lithium metal, and these concepts can be extended to other metal&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Perovskite Solar Cells with &gt; 25% Efficiency: Unveiling the Hidden Bottom Surface of Perovskite Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the often&#8208;overlooked PbI2 residual and its detailed impact on device performance are thoroughly investigated. Leveraging effective PbI2 management and precise regulation of the perovskite crystallization process, the champion devices achieve a PCE of 25.06% with long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
While significant efforts in surface engineering have been devoted to the conversion process of lead iodide (PbI2) into perovskite and top surface engineering of perovskite layer with remarkable progress, the exploration of residual PbI2 clusters and the hidden bottom surface on perovskite layer have been limited. In this work, a new strategy involving 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium acetate (BMIMAc) ionic liquid (IL) additives is developed and it is found that both the cations and the anions in ILs can interact with the perovskite components, thereby regulating the crystallization process and diminishing the residue PbI2 clusters as well as filling vacancies. The introduction of BMIMAc ILs induces the formation of a uniform porous PbI2 film, facilitating better penetration of the second&#8208;step organic salt and fostering a more extensive interaction between PbI2 and the organic salt. Surprisingly, the oversized residual PbI2 clusters at the bottom surface of the perovskite layer completely diminish. In addition, advanced depth analysis techniques including depth&#8208;resolved grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) and bottom thinning technology are employed for a comprehensive understanding of the reduction in residual PbI2. Leveraging effective PbI2 management and regulation of the perovskite crystallization process, the champion devices achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.06% with long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Air&#8208;Processed Perovskite Solar Cells with &gt;25% Efficiency and High Stability Enabled by Crystallization Modulation and Holistic Passivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic semiconductor nanoparticles with good dispersion in perovskite inks are facilely synthesized. The addition of these NPs into perovskite inks can effectively facilitate charge extraction and passivate the defects in the holistic perovskite films. The air&#8208;processed perovskite solar cells based on indene&#8208;C60 biadduct nanoparticles realize a high power conversion efficiency of 25.1% and improved stability.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors (e.g., PCBM and IDIC) frequently serve as interface passivants for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to their beneficial passivation effects on perovskite interfaces. However, their passivation to the interiors of perovskite films is greatly limited by their poor solubility in polar solvents and compatibility issues. Here the facile synthesis of organic semiconductor nanoparticle (NP) passivants that readily disperse in perovskite inks is reported. Adding these NPs into perovskite inks not only modulates perovskite crystallization, improves film quality and conductivity, but also achieves holistic bulk film passivation. Consequently, blade&#8208;coated p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs with ICBA NPs achieve an impressive efficiency of 25.1% (independently certified as 25.0%), the highest reported value for air&#8208;processed PSCs irrespective of fabrication methods or device structures. This work develops a novel approach for effective and holistic perovskite passivation by converting conventional passivants to perovskite&#8208;compatible NPs, paving the way for more efficient and stable perovskite solar devices.

         <title>Adhesive Zwitterionic Poly(ionic liquid) with Unprecedented Organic Solvent Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a zwitterionic poly(ionic liquid) (ZPIL) adhesive, known for its exceptional resistance to organic solvents and recyclability. Utilizing electrostatic dipole&#8211;dipole interactions, ZPIL maintains strong adhesion across various substrates and withstands prolonged exposure to organic solvents. This breakthrough addresses key challenges in adhesive technology, offering significant potential for industrial applications in plastics, coatings, and adhesives.








Abstract
The resistance of adhesives to organic solvents is of paramount importance in diverse industries. Unfortunately, many currently available adhesives exhibit either weak intermolecular chain interactions, resulting in insufficient resistance to organic solvents, or possess a permanent covalent crosslinked network, impeding recyclability. This study introduces an innovative approach to address this challenge by formulating zwitterionic poly(ionic liquid) (ZPIL) derivatives with robust dipole&#8211;dipole interactions, incorporating sulfonic anions and imidazolium cations. Due to its unique dynamic and electrostatic self&#8208;crosslinking structure, the ZPIL exhibits significant adhesion to various substrates and demonstrates excellent recyclability even after multiple adhesion tests. Significantly, ZPIL exhibits exceptional adhesion stability across diverse nonpolar and polar organic solvents, including ionic liquids, distinguishing itself from nonionic polymers and conventional poly(ionic liquid)s. Its adhesive performance remains minimally affected even after prolonged exposure to soaking conditions. The study presents a promising solution for the design of highly organic solvent&#8208;resistant materials for plastics, coatings, and adhesives.

         <title>Neutral Cyanine: Ultra&#8208;Stable NIR&#8208;II Merocyanines for Highly Efficient Bioimaging and Tumor&#8208;Targeted Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;II emissive neutral merocyanine dye is developed based on the clinically used ionic indocyanine green, exhibiting maintained strong near&#8208;infrared absorption, improved photostability, enhanced photothermal performance, bright NIR&#8208;II emission, and specific tumor accumulation. The mCy890 NPs are successfully utilized for efficient in vivo NIR&#8208;II fluorescence bioimaging and cancer phototheranostics.









Abstract
Fluorescence imaging (FLI)&#8208;guided phototheranostics using emission from the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window show significant potential for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Clinical imaging&#8208;used polymethine ionic indocyanine green (ICG) dye is widely adopted for NIR fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) research due to its exceptional photophysical properties. However, ICG has limitations such as poor photostability, low photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE), short&#8208;wavelength emission peak, and liver&#8208;targeting issues, which restrict its wider use. In this study, two ionic ICG derivatives are transformed into neutral merocyanines (mCy) to achieve much&#8208;enhanced performance for NIR&#8208;II cancer phototheranostics. Initial designs of two ionic dyes show similar drawbacks as ICG in terms of poor photostability and low photothermal performance. One of the modified neutral molecules, mCy890, shows significantly improved stability, an emission peak over 1000&#160;nm, and a high photothermal PCE of 51%, all considerably outperform ICG. In vivo studies demonstrate that nanoparticles of the mCy890 can effectively accumulate at the tumor sites for cancer photothermal therapy guided by NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging. This research provides valuable insights into the development of neutral merocyanines for enhanced cancer phototheranostics.

Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries
In article number 2402024, Jongwoo Lim and co&#8208;workers explore the fundamental causes of temperature surges during thermal runaway in lithium&#8208;ion battery full cells. The article identifies intermediates that create a self&#8208;amplifying loop via multidirectional crosstalk between the battery electrodes. The cover image depicts this crosstalk, illustrating how ethylene gas from the anode and oxygen gas from the cathode trigger thermal runaway.

Wearable Coaxially&#8208;Shielded Metamaterial
Drawing inspiration from commercial coaxial cable, Xia Zhu, Ke Wu, Stephan W. Anderson, and Xin Zhang construct a wireless, flexible, lightweight, and cheap metamaterial with an internal coaxially&#8208;shielded structure, confining electric field within while possessing a predominant magnetic response for magnetic resonance imaging. The metamaterial is capable of achieving a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio comparable to or surpass that of commercial receive coil arrays in some aspects. More details can be found in article number 2313692.

Highways for Spins
The spins efficiently move on the highways formed by two topological nodal lines in Fe3GaTe2. The brighter, upward, and large arrows indicate the presence of strongly correlated states that can preserve the spins traveling on the highways. In the cover image, Yeongkwan Kim, Myung Joon Han, Heejun Yang, and co&#8208;workers express the flat nodal lines in Fe3GaTe2 by the two straight ways for spins, and the spins' moving on the highways is observed as exceptionally the high anomalous Hall effect in Fe3GaTe2. More details can be found in article number 2402040.

Electromagnetic Navigation Systems for Minimally Invasive Surgery
Magnetic navigation systems (MNSs) are used to precisely manipulate magnetically responsive materials enabling the realization of new minimally invasive procedures. Widespread adoption is currently limited by the size and limits of the current generation of MNSs. In article number 2310701, Simone Gervasoni, Salvador Pan&#233;, Bradley J. Nelson, and co&#8208;workers present a new generation of a human&#8208;scale mobile eMNS, capable of manipulating tethered robotic catheters and untethered magnetic microrobots.

Quantum Materials
Integrating topological materials and high temperature superconductors is critical for new applications. However, merging materials at atomically sharp interfaces presents distinct materials challenges. In article 2401809, Robert G. Moore, Matthew Brahlek, and co&#8208;workers show an unconventional way to enhance superconductivity at epitaxial interfaces between the Bi&#8208;Te topological insulators and Fe(Se,Te), which highlights unusual properties while moving a step closer to the generation of new quantum technologies.

On&#8208;Demand Crack Formation
In article number 2314374, Dong Ki Yoon, Seunghwa Ryu, Soon Mo Park, and their colleagues present a simple method for creating aligned cracks via organic solvent&#8208;induced dehydration on DNA liquid crystal films. The directional fractures result from the anisotropic volume shrinkage of DNA polymers, and this will provide a new platform for patterning applications.

         <title>Visualizing Dynamic Single Atom Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many heterogeneous catalytic processes are key to developing sustainable products and energy. Visualization and analysis of dynamic single atom catalysis provide insights into the processes. The example shows in&#160;situ ESTEM&#8208;HAADF observations of carbon supported platinum catalysts important for fuel cells, revealing single atoms, atom clusters and multiple phases at 400&#160;&#176;C in hydrogen gas. The scale bar is 5&#160;nm.








Abstract
Many industrial chemical processes, including for producing fuels, foods, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and environmental controls, employ heterogeneous solid state catalysts at elevated temperatures in gas or liquid environments. Dynamic reactions at the atomic level play a critical role in catalyst stability and functionality. In situ visualization and analysis of atomic&#8208;scale processes in real time under controlled reaction environments can provide important insights into practical frameworks to improve catalytic processes and materials. This review focuses on innovative real time in situ electron microscopy (EM)&#160;methods, including recent progress in analytical in&#160;situ environmental (scanning) transmission EM (E(STEM), incorporating environmental scanning TEM (ESTEM) and environmental transmission EM (ETEM), with single atom resolution for visualizing and analysing dynamic single atom catalysis under controlled flowing gas reaction environments. ESTEM studies of single atom dynamics of reactions, and of sintering deactivation, contribute to a better&#8208;informed understanding of the yield and stability of catalyst operations. Advances in in situ technologies, including gas and liquid sample holders, nanotomography, and higher voltages, as well as challenges and opportunities in tracking reacting atoms, are highlighted. The findings show that the understanding and application of fundamental processes in catalysis can be improved, with valuable economic, environmental, and societal benefits.

         <title>Breaking the pH Limitation of Nanozymes: Mechanisms, Methods, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic activity of nanozymes is often pH dependent with elusive mechanism. In this review, the pH&#8208;dependent activities of peroxidase&#8208;like, oxidase&#8208;like, and catalase&#8208;like nanozymes are systematically summarized. Moreover, the inner pH&#8208;dependent mechanisms, methods to break through the limitation of catalytic pH, and applications of pH&#8208;independent nanozymes are comprehensively discussed.








Abstract
Although nanozymes have drawn great attention over the past decade, the activities of peroxidase&#8208;like, oxidase&#8208;like, and catalase&#8208;like nanozymes are often pH dependent with elusive mechanism, which largely restricts their application. Therefore, a systematical discussion on the pH&#8208;related catalytic mechanisms of nanozymes together with the methods to overcome this limitation is in need. In this review, various nanozymes exhibiting pH&#8208;dependent catalytic activities are collected and the root causes for their pH dependence are comprehensively analyzed. Subsequently, regulatory concepts including catalytic environment reconstruction and direct catalytic activity improvement to break this pH restriction are summarized. Moreover, applications of pH&#8208;independent nanozymes in sensing, disease therapy, and pollutant degradation are overviewed. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities on the development of pH&#8208;independent nanozymes are suggested. It is anticipated that this review will promote the further design of pH&#8208;independent nanozymes and broaden their application range with higher efficiency.

         <title>4D Printing for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reviews four&#8208;dimensional (4D) (bio&#8208;)printing, highlighting its application in biomedical engineering for developing medical devices (e.g., stents, microneedles (MNs), and implants). It further explores smart biomaterials, external stimuli, and design strategies essential for the success of 4D printing. Additionally, it discusses future research directions, including in vivo tissue regeneration and machine learning&#8208;based modeling to predict the behavior of 4D printed constructs.








Abstract
4D (bio&#8208;)printing endows 3D printed (bio&#8208;)materials with multiple functionalities and dynamic properties. 4D printed materials have been recently used in biomedical engineering for the design and fabrication of biomedical devices, such as stents, occluders, microneedles, smart 3D&#8208;cell engineered microenvironments, drug delivery systems, wound closures, and implantable medical devices. However, the success of 4D printing relies on the rational design of 4D printed objects, the selection of smart materials, and the availability of appropriate types of external (multi&#8208;)stimuli. Here, this work first highlights the different types of smart materials, external stimuli, and design strategies used in 4D (bio&#8208;)printing. Then, it presents a critical review of the biomedical applications of 4D printing and discusses the future directions of biomedical research in this exciting area, including in vivo tissue regeneration studies, the implementation of multiple materials with reversible shape memory behaviors, the creation of fast shape&#8208;transformation responses, the ability to operate at the microscale, untethered activation and control, and the application of (machine learning&#8208;based) modeling approaches to predict the structure&#8211;property and design&#8211;shape transformation relationships of 4D (bio)printed constructs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4D (bio-)printing endows 3D printed (bio-)materials with multiple functionalities and dynamic properties. 4D printed materials have been recently used in biomedical engineering for the design and fabrication of biomedical devices, such as stents, occluders, microneedles, smart 3D-cell engineered microenvironments, drug delivery systems, wound closures, and implantable medical devices. However, the success of 4D printing relies on the rational design of 4D printed objects, the selection of smart materials, and the availability of appropriate types of external (multi-)stimuli. Here, this work first highlights the different types of smart materials, external stimuli, and design strategies used in 4D (bio-)printing. Then, it presents a critical review of the biomedical applications of 4D printing and discusses the future directions of biomedical research in this exciting area, including in vivo tissue regeneration studies, the implementation of multiple materials with reversible shape memory behaviors, the creation of fast shape-transformation responses, the ability to operate at the microscale, untethered activation and control, and the application of (machine learning-based) modeling approaches to predict the structure&#8211;property and design&#8211;shape transformation relationships of 4D (bio)printed constructs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Critical Review of Cu&#8208;Based Hole Transport Materials for Perovskite Solar Cells: From Theoretical Insights to Experimental Validation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;based binary oxides and chalcogenides face narrow bandgap issues. The &#8220;chemical modulation of the valence band&#8221; strategy creates ternary oxides with low mobility and ternary chalcogenides with high mobility but band alignment mismatch with perovskites. Cu&#8208;based halides are good hole&#8208;transporters but unstable. Single&#8208;anion types have limitations; composite anion compounds and mixed&#8208;cation chalcogenides are promising for future research.








Abstract
Despite the remarkable efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), long&#8208;term stability remains the primary barrier to their commercialization. The prospect of enhancing stability by substituting organic transport layers with suitable inorganic compounds, particularly Cu&#8208;based inorganic hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs), holds promise due to their high valence band maximum (VBM) aligning with perovskite characteristics. This review assesses the advantages and disadvantages of these five types of Cu&#8208;based HTMs. Although Cu&#8208;based binary oxides and chalcogenides face narrow bandgap issues, the &#8220;chemical modulation of the valence band&#8221; (CMVB) strategy has successfully broadened the bandgap for Cu&#8208;based ternary oxides and chalcogenides. However, Cu&#8208;based ternary oxides encounter challenges with low mobility, and Cu&#8208;based ternary chalcogenides face mismatches in VBM alignment with perovskites. Cu&#8208;based binary halides, especially CuI, exhibit excellent properties such as wider bandgap, high mobility, and defect tolerance, but their stability remains a concern. These limitations of single anion compounds are insightfully discussed, offering solutions from the perspective of practical application. Future research can focus on Cu&#8208;based composite anion compounds, which merge the advantages of single anion compounds. Additionally, mixed&#8208;cation chalcogenides such as CuxM1&#8722;xS enable the customization of HTM properties by selecting and adjusting the proportions of cation M.

The current application status and future development directions and challenges of e&#8208;skin in the field of health monitoring are discussed.








Abstract
Electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), a skin&#8208;like wearable electronic device, holds great promise in the fields of telemedicine and personalized healthcare because of its good flexibility, biocompatibility, skin conformability, and sensing performance. E&#8208;skin can monitor various health indicators of the human body in real time and over the long term, including physical indicators (exercise, respiration, blood pressure, etc.) and chemical indicators (saliva, sweat, urine, etc.). In recent years, the development of various materials, analysis, and manufacturing technologies has promoted significant development of e&#8208;skin, laying the foundation for the application of next&#8208;generation wearable medical technologies and devices. Herein, the properties required for e&#8208;skin health monitoring devices to achieve long&#8208;term and precise monitoring and summarize several detectable indicators in the health monitoring field are discussed. Subsequently, the applications of integrated e&#8208;skin health monitoring systems are reviewed. Finally, current challenges and future development directions in this field are discussed. This review is expected to generate great interest and inspiration for the development and improvement of e&#8208;skin and health monitoring systems.

         <title>Toward Durable CO2 Electroreduction with Cu&#8208;Based Catalysts via Understanding Their Deactivation Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review article, factors contributing to the gradual loss of performance in copper&#8208;based, ambient temperature CO2 electrochemical reduction systems are summarized into generalized deactivation modes that are applicable to other systems. Fundamental principles and mitigation strategies to each deactivation mode are discussed based on recent in situ/operando characterization studies in structure&#8208; and composition&#8208;activity relationship.








Abstract
The technology of CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ER) provides a means to convert CO2, a waste greenhouse gas, into value&#8208;added chemicals. Copper is the most studied element that is capable of catalyzing CO2ER to obtain multicarbon products, such as ethylene, ethanol, acetate, etc., at an appreciable rate. Under the operating condition of CO2ER, the catalytic performance of Cu decays because of several factors that alters the surface properties of Cu. In this review, these factors that cause the degradation of Cu&#8208;based CO2ER catalysts are categorized into generalized deactivation modes, that are applicable to all electrocatalytic systems. The fundamental principles of each deactivation mode and the associated effects of each on Cu&#8208;based catalysts are discussed in detail. Structure&#8208; and composition&#8208;activity relationship developed from recent in situ/operando characterization studies are presented as evidence of related deactivation modes in operation. With the aim to address these deactivation modes, catalyst design and reaction environment engineering rationales are suggested. Finally, perspectives and remarks built upon the recent advances in CO2ER are provided in attempts to improve the durability of CO2ER catalysts.

         <title>What Matters for the Charge Transport of 2D Perovskites?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review first comprehensively analyzes the factors influencing the charge transport properties of 2D perovskites from four key aspects. It then consolidates and compares the common transport testing methods for 2D perovskites, followed by investigating strategies to enhance charge transport properties from a compositional approach.








Abstract
Compared to 3D perovskites, 2D perovskites exhibit excellent stability, structural diversity, and tunable bandgaps, making them highly promising for applications in solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and photodetectors. However, the trade&#8208;off for worse charge transport is a critical issue that needs to be addressed. This comprehensive review first discusses the structure of 3D and 2D metal halide perovskites, then summarizes the significant factors influencing charge transport in detail and provides a brief overview of the testing methods. Subsequently, various strategies to improve the charge transport are presented, including tuning A&#8242;&#8208;site organic spacer cations, A&#8208;site cations, B&#8208;site metal cations, and X&#8208;site halide ions. Finally, an outlook on the future development of improving the 2D perovskites&#8217; charge transport is discussed.

         <title>Beyond Lipids: Exploring Advances in Polymeric Gene Delivery in the Lipid Nanoparticles Era</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent surge in lipid popularity, driven by approval of lipid nanoparticle vaccines, overshadows polymers as gene delivery vectors. Nonetheless, polymeric systems are advancing in clinical trials, with multiple early&#8208;stage companies actively developing them. This review highlights advances in polymer design for gene delivery via polyplexes and covalent polymer&#8208;nucleic acid conjugates, and briefly covers novel computational techniques for improved design.








Abstract
The recent success of gene therapy during the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has underscored the importance of effective and safe delivery systems. Complementing lipid&#8208;based delivery systems, polymers present a promising alternative for gene delivery. Significant advances have been made in the recent past, with multiple clinical trials progressing beyond phase I and several companies actively working on polymeric delivery systems which provides assurance that polymeric carriers can soon achieve clinical translation. The massive advantage of structural tunability and vast chemical space of polymers is being actively leveraged to mitigate shortcomings of traditional polycationic polymers and improve the translatability of delivery systems.

&lt;p&gt;The recent surge in lipid popularity, driven by approval of lipid nanoparticle vaccines, overshadows polymers as gene delivery vectors. Nonetheless, polymeric systems are advancing in clinical trials, with multiple early-stage companies actively developing them. This review highlights advances in polymer design for gene delivery via polyplexes and covalent polymer-nucleic acid conjugates, and briefly covers novel computational techniques for improved design.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent success of gene therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of effective and safe delivery systems. Complementing lipid-based delivery systems, polymers present a promising alternative for gene delivery. Significant advances have been made in the recent past, with multiple clinical trials progressing beyond phase I and several companies actively working on polymeric delivery systems which provides assurance that polymeric carriers can soon achieve clinical translation. The massive advantage of structural tunability and vast chemical space of polymers is being actively leveraged to mitigate shortcomings of traditional polycationic polymers and improve the translatability of delivery systems. Tailored polymeric approaches for diverse nucleic acids and for specific subcellular targets are now being designed to improve therapeutic efficacy. This review describes the recent advances in polymer design for improved gene delivery by polyplexes and covalent polymer-nucleic acid conjugates. The review also offers a brief note on novel computational techniques for improved polymer design. The review concludes with an overview of the current state of polymeric gene therapies in the clinic as well as future directions on their translation to the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transparent Recombination Layers Design and Rational Characterizations for Efficient Two&#8208;Terminal Perovskite&#8208;Based Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent recombination layers for two&#8208;terminal perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells are reviewed, including their fundamental functions, photophysical mechanisms, working principles, requirements, and characterization methods. Existing challenges and future perspectives for research in this promising field are also presented.








Abstract
Two&#8208;terminal (2T) perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells (TSCs) arouse burgeoning interest in breaking the Shockley&#8211;Queisser (S&#8211;Q) limit of single&#8208;junction solar cells by combining two subcells with different bandgaps. However, the highest certified efficiency of 2T perovskite&#8208;based TSCs (33.9%) lags behind the theoretical limit (42&#8211;43%). A vital challenge limiting the development of 2T perovskite&#8208;based TSCs is the transparent recombination layers/interconnecting layers (RLs) design between two subcells. To improve the performance of 2T perovskite&#8208;based TSCs, RLs simultaneously fulfill the optical loss, contact resistance, carrier mobility, stress management, and conformal coverage requirements. In this review, the definition, functions, and requirements of RLs in 2T perovskite&#8208;based TSCs are presented. The insightful characterization methods applicable to RLs, which are inspiring for further research on the RLs both in 2T perovskite&#8208;based two&#8208;junction and multi&#8208;junction TSCs, are also highlighted. Finally, the key factors that currently limit the performance enhancement of RLs and the future directions that should be continuously focused on are summarized.

         <title>Advances in Mixed Tin&#8208;Lead Narrow&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites for Single&#8208;Junction and All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the development of tin&#8208;lead perovskites and their applications in single&#8208;junction and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. The fundamental structural and optoelectronic properties of tin&#8208;lead perovskites and the recent advances with various approaches covering additives, solvents, interfaces, perovskite growth, and charge transport materials are discussed. The challenges and strategies for further development are also provided.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic metal&#8208;halide perovskites have received great attention for photovoltaic (PV) applications owing to their superior optoelectronic properties and the unprecedented performance development. For single&#8208;junction PV devices, although lead (Pb)&#8208;based perovskite solar cells have achieved 26.1% efficiency, the mixed tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites offer more ideal bandgap tuning capability to enable an even higher performance. The Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite (with a bandgap tuned to &#8776;1.2&#160;eV) is also attractive as the bottom subcell for a tandem configuration to further surpass the Shockley&#8211;Queisser radiative limit for the single&#8208;junction devices. The performance of the all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells has gained rapid development and achieved a certified efficiency up to 29.1%. In this article, the properties and recent development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mixed Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites and their application in single&#8208;junction and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells are reviewed. Recent advances in various approaches covering additives, solvents, interfaces, and perovskite growth are highlighted. The authors also provide the perspective and outlook on the challenges and strategies for further development of mixed Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites in both efficiency and stability for PV applications.

         <title>Engineering Mesoscale T Cell Receptor Clustering by Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Play Nanotools</title>

Abstract
T&#160;cell receptor (TCR) clustering and formation of an immune synapse are crucial for TCR signaling. However, limited information is available about these dynamic assemblies and their connection to transmembrane signaling. Here, we controlled TCR clustering via plug&#8208;and&#8208;play nanotools based on an engineered irreversible conjugation pair and a peptide&#8208;loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecule to compare receptor assembly in a ligand (pMHC)&#8208;induced or ligand&#8208;independent manner. A streptavidin&#8208;binding peptide displayed in both tools enabled their anchoring in streptavidin&#8208;pre&#8208;structured matrices. Strikingly, pMHC&#8208;induced clustering in the confined regions exhibited higher density and dynamics than the ligand&#8208;free approach, indicating that the size and architecture of the pMHC ligand influences TCR assembly. Our approach enables the control of membrane receptor clustering with high specificity and provide the possibility to explore different modalities of receptor activation.

         <title>Atomic Confinement Empowered CoZn Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Nanotubes for H2O2 Production in Sequential Dual&#8208;Cathode Electro&#8208;Fenton Process</title>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are flourishing in various fields because of their 100% atomic utilization. However, their uncontrollable selectivity, poor stability and vulnerable inactivation remain critical challenges. According to theoretical predictions and experiments, a heteronuclear CoZn dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom confined in N/O&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanotube reactors (CoZnSA@CNTs) was synthesized via a spatial confinement growth strategy. CoZnSA@CNTs exhibited superior performance for H2O2 electrosynthesis over the entire pH range due to dual&#8208;confinement of the atomic sites and O2 molecule. CoZnSA@CNTs was favorable for H2O2 production mainly because the synergy of adjacent atomic sites, defect&#8208;rich feature and nanotube reactor promoted O2 enrichment and enhanced H2O2 reactivity/selectivity. The H2O2 selectivity reached nearly 100% in a range of 0.2 &#8764; 0.65&#160;V versus RHE and the yield achieved 7.50&#160;M gcat&#8722;1 with CoZnSA@CNTs/carbon fiber felt, which exceeded most of the reported SACs in H&#8208;type cells. The obtained H2O2 was converted directly to sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate in a safe way for H2O2 storage/transportation. The sequential dual&#8208;cathode electron&#8208;Fenton process promoted the formation of reactive oxygen species (&#8226;OH, 1O2 and &#8226;O2&#8722;) by activating the in&#8208;situ generated H2O2, enabling accelerated degradation of various pollutants and Cr(VI) detoxification in actual wastewater. This work proposes a promising confinement strategy for catalyst design and selectivity regulation of complex reactions.

         <title>Cu/CuxO/Graphdiyne Tandem Catalyst for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction reaction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to ammonia (NH3) is a feasible way to achieve artificial nitrogen cycle. However, the low yield rate and poor selectivity towards NH3 product is a technical challenge. Here we present a graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based tandem catalyst featuring Cu/CuxO nanoparticles anchored to GDY support (termed Cu/CuxO/GDY) for efficient electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction. We achieve a high NH3 yield rate of 25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 (25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) with a Faradaic efficiency of 99.8% at an applied potential of &#8208;0.8&#160;V versus RHE using the designed catalyst. These performance metrics outperform most reported NO3&#8722; to NH3 catalysts in the alkaline media. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory reveal that the NO3&#8722; preferentially attacks Cu/CuxO, and the GDY can effectively catalyze the reduction of NO2&#8722; to NH3. This work highlights the efficacy of GDY as a new class of tandem catalysts for the artificial nitrogen cycle and provides powerful guidelines for the design of tandem electrocatalysts.

         <title>Nanoengineering&#8208;Enhanced Capillary Cooling Achieves Sustained Thermal Protection for Ultra&#8208;High Heat Flux and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extreme thermal conditions with heat flux densities exceeding 1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2 or temperatures reaching up to 1000 &#176;C are prevalent in various situations. However, the ability of thermal protection either depends on specialized materials or is currently limited with existing cooling schemes. Herein, we propose an innovative cooling scheme that relies on evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow enhanced by nanoengineering&#8208;designed porous structures with common materials. Experimentally&#8208;obtained capillary flow cooling curve identifies critical heat flux corresponding to evaporation&#8208;driven flow stage, where coolants cool the surface and subsequent vapor impedes heat transfer from thermal boundaries. Nanoengineering provides opportunities for enhanced capillary flow, which proves to endow bronze, TC4, and Al2O3 with thermal protection ability 50%&#8722;180% higher than that without nanoengineering&#8208;designed. Our scheme achieves critical heat flux up to 2.0&#8208;3.1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2, and performs thermal dissipation capacity almost twice higher than inherent latent heat of coolant. Furthermore, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, our scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;heat&#8208;flux environments and paves the way for the development of lightweight, long&#8208;lasting, and large&#8208;scale solutions for thermal protection.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inspired by intriguing color changeable ability of natural animals, the design and fabrication of artificial mechanochromic materials capable of changing colors upon stretching or pressing have attracted intense scientific interest. Liquid crystal (LC) is a self&#8208;organized soft matter with anisotropic molecular alignment. Due to the sensitivity to various external stimulations, LC has been considered as an emerging and appealing responsive building block to construct intelligent materials and advanced devices. Recently, mechanochromic LC materials have becoming a hot topic in multi fields from flexible artificial skins to visualized sensors and smart biomimetic devices. In this review, the recent progress of mechanochromic LCs is comprehensively summarized. Firstly, the mechanism and functionalities of mechanochromic LC is introduced, followed by preparation of various functional materials based on mechanochromic LCs. Then the applications of mechanochromic LCs are provided. Finally, the conclusion and outlooks of this field is given. This overview is hoped to provide inspiration in fabrication of advanced functional soft materials for scientists and engineers from multidisciplines including materials science, elastomers, chemistry and physical science.

         <title>A Topological Parametric Phonon Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological bosonic systems have recently aroused intense interests in exploring exotic phenomena that have no counterparts in electronic systems. The squeezed bosonic interaction in these systems is particularly interesting, because it can modify the vacuum fluctuations of topological states, drive them into instabilities, and lead to topological parametric oscillators. However, these phenomena remain experimentally elusive because of limited nonlinearities in most existing topological bosonic systems. Here, a topological parametric phonon oscillator is experimentally realized based on a nonlinear nanoelectromechanical Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity with strong squeezed interaction. Specifically, the Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity is parametrically driven to provide phase&#8208;sensitive amplification for topological phonons, leading to the observation of coherent parametric phonon oscillation above the threshold. Additionally, it is confirmed that the random frequency variation caused by fabrication disorders can be suppressed effectively by increasing the cavity size, while the free spectral range reduces at a much slower rate, which benefit the realization of large&#8208;area single&#8208;mode lasers. Our results represent an important advance in experimental investigations of topological physics with large bosonic nonlinearities and parametric gain.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated DNA Nanotechnology in 3D: Structural Library by Templated Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
DNA double helices containing metal&#8208;mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs have been constructed from Ag+ and Hg2+ ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials has been impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, we explore the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self&#8208;assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination. We employed the tensegrity triangle to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X&#8208;ray diffraction and elucidated generalized design rules for mmDNA construction. We uncovered two binding modes: N3&#8208;dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5&#8208;position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations showed additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.
