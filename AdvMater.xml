         <title>Synthetic High&#8208;Density Lipoprotein Mimicking Nanodiscs with Pt(IV) Prodrug Enable Tumor Targeting and cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway Activation for Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

A synthetic high&#8208;density lipoprotein (sHDL) nanodisc, referred as sHDL@Pt, is engineered to load a Pt(IV) prodrug (C2&#8208;Pt(IV)&#8208;C12), activating the innate immune system through the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Using near&#8208;infrared II fluorescence imaging and single photon emission computed tomography imaging technology, it is found that sHDL@Pt can be effectively accumulated in tumor sites.








Abstract
Cisplatin is a first&#8208;line, broad&#8208;spectrum anti&#8208;tumor drug used to treat various types of cancer. However, immune&#8208;suppressive tumor microenvironments (TME) are often induced by cisplatin. Here, a first synthetic high&#8208;density lipoprotein (sHDL) nanodisc, referred as sHDL@Pt, is engineered to load a Pt(IV) prodrug (C2&#8208;Pt(IV)&#8208;C12), inducing a 2.2&#8208;fold increase in dsDNA release compared to cisplatin. This further activates the innate immune system through the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Using near&#8208;infrared II fluorescence imaging and single photon emission computed tomography imaging technology, it is found that sHDL@Pt can be effectively accumulated in tumor sites. The sHDL@Pt can induce severe DNA damage, which subsequently results in a more pronounced activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, further promoting dendritic cell maturation and T cell proliferation, triggering strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, and inhibiting tumor growth. This work introduces a novel approach for delivering Pt(IV) prodrug that effectively initiates and activates innate immunity through the activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Free Photoelectrochemical System for Scalable Solar&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Peroxide Production via Molecularly Engineered Conjugated Polycarbazole Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a molecularly engineered conjugated polycarbazole framework that enables efficient, stable, and bias&#8208;free photoelectrochemical synthesis of H2O2. Scaled to a 1 m2 panel reactor operating under natural sunlight, the system achieves a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.10%, setting a new benchmark as the largest and most efficient solar&#8208;driven PEC system for H2O2 production demonstrated to date.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) synthesis emerges as a promising pathway to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), reimagining the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone method. However, scaling PEC systems from laboratory&#8208;scale prototypes to practical large&#8208;area installations remains a significant scientific and engineering challenge, primarily due to limited catalytic selectivity at photoelectrode surfaces and rapid performance degradation during upscaling. This study presents a modular, bias&#8208;free PEC system designed for scalable solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production. Conjugated polycarbazole frameworks (CPFs) containing rationally designed diacetylene and anthraquinone moieties functions as molecularly precise catalytic layers, enabling concurrent two&#8208;electron pathways at both the photoanode and photocathode. The resulting photoanode and photocathode deliver faradaic efficiencies of 94.08% and 95.50%, respectively, for H2O2 production. Integrating these photoelectrodes into a 1 cm2 unbiased tandem PEC device achieves a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency of 2.11%. More importantly, scaling these devices to a 1 m2 membrane&#8208;free PEC panel reactor via a modular assembly strategy yields an average SCC efficiency of 1.10% under natural sunlight, representing the largest reported solar&#8208;driven PEC system for H2O2 production to date. This study bridges the gap between laboratory&#8208;scale experimentation and real&#8208;world applications, providing a scalable framework for decentralized, solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production.

         <title>Tandem Organic Solar Cells with 21.5% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A narrow bandgap acceptor, BTA&#8208;4F, featuring a 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2H&#8208;benzotriazole central core, is fabricated to construct the rear sub&#8208;cell of tandem organic solar cells (OSCs). By fine&#8208;tuning the optical field distribution in the BAT&#8208;4F&#8208;based tandem OSC, a power conversion efficiency of 21.5% is achieved (certified as 21.2%), respectively, which marks the arrival of 21% era in the field of OSCs.2









Abstract
Tandem organic solar cells (OSCs) offer a promising strategy for enhancing light utilization and reducing energy loss, presenting significant potential in achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Herein, a narrow bandgap acceptor, BTA&#8208;4F, featuring a 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2H&#8208;benzotriazole (BTA) central core, is fabricated, which is designed for the rear sub&#8208;cell of tandem OSCs. Systematic characterizations demonstrate that incorporating strong electron donating groups BTA into central core unit can narrow the bandgap and enhance the electroluminescence external quantum efficiency. These improvements lead to increased current density and reduced voltage loss of single junction OSCs under AM 1.5G illumination and real incident light of the rear sub&#8208;cell. Inspiringly, BTA&#8208;4F&#8208;based single&#8208;junction and tandem OSCs achieve outstanding PCEs of 19.5% and 21.5% (Certified as 21.2%), respectively, which represents the milestone of 21% PCE in the field of OSCs. This study highlights the synergistic benefits of molecular design and implementation of tandem architecture as an effective strategy for enhancing photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

         <title>Structural Tuning Magnetism and Topology in a Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This systematic study of magnetic topological matter under hydrostatic pressure reveals strong material response to pressure, demonstrating a shrinking topological gap and enhanced magnetic order under compression. These findings establish strain engineering as an effective tuning parameter for manipulating and potentially enhancing the quantum anomalous Hall effect.








Abstract
To date, the most widely&#8208;studied quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI) platform is achieved by dilute doping of magnetic ions into thin films of the alloyed tetradymite topological insulator (TI) (Bi1 &#8722; xSbx)2Te3 (BST). In these films, long&#8208;range magnetic ordering of the transition metal substituants opens an exchange gap &#916; in the topological surface states, stabilizing spin&#8208;polarized, dissipationless edge channels with a nonzero Chern number C$\mathcal {C}$. The long&#8208;range ordering of the spatially separated magnetic ions is itself mediated by electronic states in the host TI, leading to a sophisticated feedback between magnetic and electronic properties. Here, a study is presented on the electronic and magnetic response of a BST&#8208;based QAHI system to structural tuning via hydrostatic pressure. A systematic closure of the topological gap under compressive strain is identified accompanied by a simultaneous enhancement in the magnetic ordering strength. Combining these experimental results with first&#8208;principle calculations, structural deformation is identified as a strong tuning parameter to traverse a rich topological phase space and modify magnetism in the magnetically doped BST&#160;system.

         <title>Lipidic Prodrug Co&#8208;Crystals: A Platform for Combination Therapy Targeting Fungal Biofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fungal infections are worsened by biofilms and inflammation, reducing antifungal efficacy. Lipidic prodrug co&#8208;crystals (LPCCs) are developed that co&#8208;deliver antifungal and anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs. LPCCs self&#8208;assemble, load drugs efficiently, and respond to biofilm environments. They inhibit biofilms and inflammation, modulate immunity, and restore tissue health in mice, offering a promising antifungal treatment strategy.








Abstract
Fungal infections are often complicated by biofilm formation and concurrent inflammation, limiting the efficacy of conventional antifungal therapies. To address these challenges, we developed a novel hybrid drug delivery platform&#8212;lipidic prodrug co&#8208;crystals (LPCCs)&#8212;that combines the benefits of lipidic self&#8208;assembly and pharmaceutical co&#8208;crystallization. In this study, a lipidic prodrug is synthesized by linking catechol&#8208;containing &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonate with phenylboronic acid&#8208;modified bifonazole (Bfz), an antifungal agent, via boronate bonding. The resulting self&#8208;assembled structures exhibit high drug&#8208;loading capacity (up to 85%) and are capable of co&#8208;crystallizing with anti&#8208;inflammatory agents such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) through strong aromatic and ionic interactions. This dual&#8208;delivery system enables the controlled, site&#8208;specific release of both antifungal and anti&#8208;inflammatory agents in response to the acidic and oxidative microenvironment of fungal biofilms. LPCCs effectively prevent biofilm formation, eradicate mature biofilms, and enhance ROS&#8208;scavenging capacity. Mechanistically, LPCCs inhibit the NF&#8208;&#954;B/COX&#8208;2 pathway, reduce pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines, and promote an anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 macrophage phenotype. In a murine rectal candidiasis model, LPCCs significantly reduced fungal load, restored tissue integrity, and normalized immune and microbial environments. Our findings highlight LPCCs as a promising strategy for enhancing treatment efficacy, improving patient compliance, and overcoming the limitations of current antifungal therapies.

&lt;p&gt;Fungal infections are worsened by biofilms and inflammation, reducing antifungal efficacy. Lipidic prodrug co-crystals (LPCCs) are developed that co-deliver antifungal and anti-inflammatory drugs. LPCCs self-assemble, load drugs efficiently, and respond to biofilm environments. They inhibit biofilms and inflammation, modulate immunity, and restore tissue health in mice, offering a promising antifungal treatment strategy.

         <title>Confined Polymer Electrolyte Synthesis in Porous Frameworks for Cold&#8208;Climate Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zn2+&#8208;conductive solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) is fabricated by in situ polymerization of 2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline (EtOx) within sulfonated porous aromatic frameworks (SPAF). The solvation effect of PEtOx and the anchoring effect of SPAF synergistically promote the transport of Zn2+ ions, reduce the migration energy barrier, and improve the performance of the battery at cryogenic temperatures.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are vital for zinc&#8208;ion solid&#8208;state batteries (ZSSBs) for dendrite suppression but face low&#8208;temperature hurdles from poor ionic conductivity and crystallization. Here, a supramolecularly engineered SPE is constructed by in situ polymerization of 2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline (EtOx) within sulfonated porous aromatic frameworks (SPAFs), acting as macroinitiators and nanoconfined reactors. Resulting poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PEtOx) chains assemble with the SPAF via strong non&#8208;covalent interactions, forming cohesive SPAF&#8208;PEtOx (SPP) with interconnected ion transport pathways. &#8722;SO3&#8722; groups anchor Zn2+, while confined PEtOx chains modulate solvation dynamics, facilitating efficient Zn2+ migration. SPE based on SPP embedded in polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)&#160;matrices (SPP@PVDF) achieves high ionic conductivity (5.04&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;s&#160;cm&#8722;1) and a wide electrochemical window (2.74&#160;V) at room temperature. A Zn || Zn symmetric battery exhibits stable plating/stripping over 3000&#160;h, while a full Zn || V2O5 battery retains capacity over 1000 cycles at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C with no decay. Notably, the ionic conductivity of SPP@PVDF at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C is 8&#8208;fold higher than SPAF@PVDF, as PEtOx reduces Zn2+ migration barriers. This work offers a molecular&#8208;level strategy for designing cryogenically robust SPEs, advancing ZSSB technologies for extreme environments.

         <title>Intermediate&#8208;States Mediated 2D MoO3&#8208;x Plasmon Enabling Pure&#8208;Phased CsPbX3 Photovoltaics with 27.33% Bifacial Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This remarkable work combines supercritical CO2 chemical engineering, two&#8208;dimension plasmon photophysical science, and perovskite photovoltaic technology. It introduces novel concepts like broad &#8208; spectrum coupled photon absorption, the intermediate &#8208; localized &#8208; states model, and optoelectrical &#8208; bimodal &#8208; coupling engineering. It aims to combat optoelectronic dissipation and enhance energy harvesting via a heterodimensional van der Waals optically coupled system.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic CsPbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) perovskites emerged as a crucial material for addressing the stability bottleneck due to their exceptional resistance to both light&#8208;thermal stress. However, their performance is limited by adverse optoelectronic dissipation arising from inadequate photon conversion and chaotic carrier energetics. Herein, the mechanism of the unique nonlinear plasmonic effect in van der Waals 2D MoO3&#8208;x is elucidated, which is mediated by electronic intermediate states. It demonstrates that the 2D MoO3&#8208;x serves as a light&#8208;capture&#8208;antenna in heterodimensional CsPbX3&#8208;MoO3&#8208;x optically coupled system, contributing to the accumulation the optical field energy on the nanoscale and resulting in a remarkable 59% increase in photon convergence. Additionally, facet&#8208;oriented carrier channels can be established through heteroepitaxy along matched Mo&#8208;O octahedron. This optoelectrical&#8208;bimodal&#8208;coupling engineering combined with a bifacial light&#8208;harvesting configuration yields a bifacial equivalent efficiency of 27.33%, which stands as the supreme performance in all&#8208;inorganic perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Organic Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Materials with Ultralong Lifetimes and Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Features Through Relay Phosphor Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared afterglow (NIR&#8208;AG) materials are successfully developed using a facile relay phosphor strategy and an efficient phosphorescence resonance energy transfer process. Bright NIR&#8208;AG materials are first reported with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics and an ultralong lifetime of 269&#160;ms at an emission maximum of 822&#160;nm, demonstrating the best performance among the organic afterglow materials and highlighting their versatile applications.








Abstract
Organic materials with afterglow properties have gained significant interest owing to their long lifetimes and potential applications. However, most of these organic materials emit light in the visible region, posing a significant challenge for developing near&#8208;infrared afterglow (NIR&#8208;AG). In this study, NIR&#8208;AG materials with ultralong lifetimes and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) features are fabricated using a relay phosphor strategy. Red relay phosphors are easily fabricated by incorporating pyrene derivatives into an electron&#8208;rich matrix. The triplet excited energy of the relay phosphor is manipulated and effectively transferred to the excited singlet state of the AIE molecule via phosphorescence resonance energy transfer. Following the radiative decay of the excitons, an exceptional NIR&#8208;AG is ultimately generated with an ultralong lifetime of 269&#160;ms at an emission maximum of 822&#160;nm. The NIR&#8208;AG materials with ultralong lifetimes and AIE characteristics are reported for the first time, demonstrating one of the best performances among the organic afterglow materials. Notably, the NIR&#8208;AG materials can be processed into diverse aggregated forms for advanced anticounterfeiting, fingerprint identification, information encryption, and tissue penetration imaging using red and NIR dual&#8208;delay channels with good performances. These promising findings are encouraging for the development of organic NIR&#8208;AG materials with exceptional performance.

In this study, NIR-AG materials with ultralong lifetimes and aggregation-induced emission (AIE) features are fabricated using a relay phosphor strategy. Red relay phosphors are easily fabricated by incorporating pyrene derivatives into an electron-rich matrix. The triplet excited energy of the relay phosphor is manipulated and effectively transferred to the excited singlet state of the AIE molecule via phosphorescence resonance energy transfer. Following the radiative decay of the excitons, an exceptional NIR-AG is ultimately generated with an ultralong lifetime of 269&#160;ms at an emission maximum of 822&#160;nm. The NIR-AG materials with ultralong lifetimes and AIE characteristics are reported for the first time, demonstrating one of the best performances among the organic afterglow materials. Notably, the NIR-AG materials can be processed into diverse aggregated forms for advanced anticounterfeiting, fingerprint identification, information encryption, and tissue penetration imaging using red and NIR dual-delay channels with good performances. These promising findings are encouraging for the development of organic NIR-AG materials with exceptional performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Compensation Principles of Soft&#8208;Lattice Nanocrystals toward High&#8208;Performance Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quaternary phosphonium iodides with engineered steric configurations enable efficient surface compensation in perovskite nanocrystals, achieving high&#8208;performance pure&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes. Systematic evaluation reveals an inverse correlation between ligand steric bulk and device performance. Compact molecular geometries facilitate superior vacancy repair while reducing defect generation during surface reconstruction, establishing steric minimization as one of the critical molecular design principles for soft&#8208;lattice optoelectronic materials.








Abstract
Surface reconstruction in electroluminescent nanocrystals (NCs) requires a delicate balance between defect passivation and preserving lattice integrity. The structural damage is exacerbated in soft&#8208;lattice perovskite systems by the conventional ligand exchange process. Herein, a surface compensation paradigm is presented employing quaternary phosphonium iodides that synergistically repair halogen vacancies and stabilize the surface without perturbing the ionic lattice. These molecular compensators are delicately designed to be soluble in weak&#8208;polar solvents, enabling non&#8208;destructive ionic surface compensation. Besides, the sterically optimized ionic coordination suppresses defect generation during surface reconstruction. Resulting pure&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) achieve remarkable electroluminescence performance with 28.8% peak external quantum efficiency, 1.75&#160;V sub&#8208;bandgap turn&#8208;on voltage, 30.1% power conversion efficiency, and 70.0 h operational half&#8208;lifetime at 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2, establishing new benchmarks for Rec.2020&#8208;compliant devices. The relationship between the steric factor of ligands and the compensation effect is further elucidated, providing molecular design principles for soft&#8208;lattice optoelectronic NCs.

         <title>Recent Advances in Moir&#233; Superlattice Systems by Angle&#8208;Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial moir&#233; superlattices have become a fertile playground for emergent quantum phenomena. Modern angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) can directly visualize electronic structures and thus can provide enlightening insights into fundamental physics in moir&#233; superlattice systems and guides for designing novel devices. Major advances in the ARPES studies of moir&#233; superlattices are reviewed and new experimental directions are discussed.








Abstract
The last decade has witnessed a flourish in 2D materials including graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as atomic&#8208;scale Legos. Artificial moir&#233; superlattices via stacking 2D materials with a twist angle and/or a lattice mismatch have recently become a fertile playground exhibiting a plethora of emergent properties beyond their building blocks. These rich quantum phenomena stem from their nontrivial electronic structures that are effectively tuned by the moir&#233; periodicity. Modern angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) can directly visualize electronic structures with decent momentum, energy, and spatial resolution, thus can provide enlightening insights into fundamental physics in moir&#233; superlattice systems and guides for designing novel devices. In this review, first, a brief introduction is given on advanced ARPES techniques and basic ideas of band structures in a moir&#233; superlattice system. Then ARPES research results of various moir&#233; superlattice systems are highlighted, including graphene on substrates with small lattice mismatches, twisted graphene/TMD moir&#233; systems, and high&#8208;order moir&#233; superlattice systems. Finally, it discusses important questions that remain open, challenges in current experimental investigations, and presents an outlook on this field of research.

         <title>Emerging Bioprinting for Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, a series of bioprinting techniques, polymer&#8208;based inks, and bioprinted devices are presented for wound healing. Recent advances in this cutting&#8208;edge field, including seven modification strategies of bioprinted devices and the clinical needs they address are summarized and discussed. Several frontiers of bioprinting, challenges, and future directions are highlighted and prospected.








Abstract
Bioprinting has attracted much attention due to its suitability for fabricating biomedical devices. In particular, bioprinting has become one of the growing centers in the field of wound healing, with various types of bioprinted devices being developed, including 3D scaffolds, microneedle patches, and flexible electronics. Bioprinted devices can be designed with specific biostructures and biofunctions that closely match the shape of wound sites and accelerate the regeneration of skin through various approaches. Herein, a comprehensive review of the bioprinting of smart wound dressings is presented, emphasizing the crucial effect of bioprinting in determining biostructures and biofunctions. The review begins with an overview of bioprinting techniques and bioprinted devices, followed with an in&#8208;depth discussion of polymer&#8208;based inks, modification strategies, additive ingredients, properties, and applications. The strategies for the modification of bioprinted devices are divided into seven categories, including chemical synthesis of novel inks, physical blending, coaxial bioprinting, multimaterial bioprinting, physical absorption, chemical immobilization, and hybridization with living cells, and examples are presented. Thereafter, the frontiers of bioprinting and wound healing, including 4D bioprinting, artificial intelligence&#8208;assisted bioprinting, and in situ bioprinting, are discussed from a perspective of interdisciplinary sciences. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects in this field are highlighted.

         <title>Conversion&#8208;Type Cathode Materials for Aqueous Zn Metal Batteries in Nonalkaline Aqueous Electrolytes: Progress, Challenges, and Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conversion&#8208;type cathode materials for aqueous Zn metal batteries in nonalkaline electrolytes can enable higher capacities and energy densities than conventional intercalated cathode materials. This review summarizes the reaction mechanisms, progress, challenges, and solutions of these four kinds of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials (MnO2, halogen materials, chalcogenide materials, and Cu&#8208;based compounds), and proposes some suggestions for their developments.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries are attractive as safe and low&#8208;cost energy storage systems. At present, due to the narrow window of the aqueous electrolyte and the strong reliance of the Zn2+ ion intercalated reaction on the host structure, the current intercalated cathode materials exhibit restricted energy densities. In contrast, cathode materials with conversion reactions can promise higher energy densities. Especially, the recently reported conversion&#8208;type cathode materials that function in nonalkaline electrolytes have garnered increasing attention. This is because the use of nonalkaline electrolytes can prevent the occurrence of side reactions encountered in alkaline electrolytes and thereby enhance cycling stability. However, there is a lack of comprehensive review on the reaction mechanisms, progress, challenges, and solutions to these cathode materials. In this review, four kinds of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials including MnO2, halogen materials (Br2 and I2), chalcogenide materials (O2, S, Se, and Te), and Cu&#8208;based compounds (CuI, Cu2O, Cu2S, CuO, CuS, and CuSe) are reviewed. First, the reaction mechanisms and battery structures of these materials are introduced. Second, the fundamental problems and their corresponding solutions are discussed in detail in each material. Finally, future directions and efforts for the development of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials for aqueous Zn batteries are proposed.

         <title>Functional Materials for Subcellular Targeting Strategies in Cancer Therapy: Progress and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review investigates eight targeting strategies of functional materials that specifically target subcellular structures in tumor cells, including mitochondria, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosome, Golgiosome, cytomembrane, and multi&#8208;organelle targeting strategies, and covers a wide range of functional materials, such as liposomes, metal nanoparticles, metal&#8208;organic frameworks, dendrimer nanoplatforms, carbon nanotubes, mitochondria&#8208;targeting mesoporous silica nanoparticles, carbon QD, amphiphilic copolymers, and small molecular compounds.








Abstract
Neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies have made significant progress in cancer treatment. However, tumor adjuvant therapy still faces challenges due to the intrinsic heterogeneity of cancer, genomic instability, and the formation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Functional materials possess unique biological properties such as long circulation times, tumor&#8208;specific targeting, and immunomodulation. The combination of functional materials with natural substances and nanotechnology has led to the development of smart biomaterials with multiple functions, high biocompatibilities, and negligible immunogenicities, which can be used for precise cancer treatment. Recently, subcellular structure&#8208;targeting functional materials have received particular attention in various biomedical applications including the diagnosis, sensing, and imaging of tumors and drug delivery. Subcellular organelle&#8208;targeting materials can precisely accumulate therapeutic agents in organelles, considerably reduce the threshold dosages of therapeutic agents, and minimize drug&#8208;related side effects. This review provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the research progress in subcellular organelle&#8208;targeted cancer therapy based on functional nanomaterials. Moreover, it explains the challenges and prospects of subcellular organelle&#8208;targeting functional materials in precision oncology. The review will serve as an excellent cutting&#8208;edge guide for researchers in the field of subcellular organelle&#8208;targeted cancer therapy.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis and Accurate Doping of Wafer&#8208;Scale 2D Semiconducting Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The up&#8208;to&#8208;date growth strategies for the controlled synthesis of wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconducting TMDCs polycrystalline and single&#8208;crystal films are systematically summarized. The large&#8208;area accurate doping of 2D semiconducting TMDCs and its effect on the device performances are discussed. The challenges regarding the improvement of electronic device performances of 2D semiconducting TMDCs are highlighted, and the further research directions are proposed.








Abstract
2D semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDCs) possess atomically thin thickness, a dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surface, flexible band structure, and silicon&#8208;compatible feature, making them one of the most promising channels for constructing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art field&#8208;effect transistors in the post&#8208;Moore's era. However, the existing 2D semiconducting TMDCs fall short of meeting the industry criteria for practical applications in electronics due to their small domain size and the lack of an effective approach to modulate intrinsic physical properties. Therefore, it is crucial to prepare and dope 2D semiconducting TMDCs single crystals with wafer size. In this review, the up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress regarding the wafer&#8208;scale growth of 2D semiconducting TMDC polycrystalline and single&#8208;crystal films is systematically summarized. The domain orientation control of 2D TMDCs and the seamless stitching of unidirectionally aligned 2D islands by means of substrate design are proposed. In addition, the accurate and uniform doping of 2D semiconducting TMDCs and the effect on electronic device performances are also discussed. Finally, the dominating challenges pertaining to the enhancement of the electronic device performances of TMDCs are emphasized, and further development directions are put forward. This review provides a systematic and in&#8208;depth summary of high&#8208;performance device applications of 2D semiconducting TMDCs.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Photothermal Therapy for Breast Cancer Noninvasive Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper discusses the photothermal properties and biological mechanisms of nanomaterials, emphasizing a clinical and biological perspective. The primary focus is on current research regarding photothermal nanoparticles for breast cancer treatment: nanoparticle materials, breast characteristics, functional design, and commonly used adjuvant therapy in clinical practice.








Abstract
Rapid advancements in materials science and nanotechnology, intertwined with oncology, have positioned photothermal therapy (PTT) as a promising noninvasive treatment strategy for cancer. The breast's superficial anatomical location and aesthetic significance render breast cancer a particularly pertinent candidate for the clinical application of PTT following melanoma. This review comprehensively explores the research conducted on the various types of nanoparticles employed in PTT for breast cancer and elaborates on their specific roles and mechanisms of action. The integration of PTT with existing clinical therapies for breast cancer is scrutinized, underscoring its potential for synergistic outcomes. Additionally, the mechanisms underlying PTT and consequential modifications to the tumor microenvironment after treatment are elaborated from a medical perspective. Future research directions are suggested, with an emphasis on the development of integrative platforms that combine multiple therapeutic approaches and the optimization of nanoparticle synthesis for enhanced treatment efficacy. The goal is to push the boundaries of PTT toward a comprehensive, clinically applicable treatment for breast cancer.

         <title>Hemoperfusion Adsorbents for Removal of Common Toxins in Liver and Kidney Failure: Recent Progress, Challenges, and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liver and kidney failure leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites such as bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxin, and creatinine in the blood and tissues, which aggravate the progression of the disease. Hemoperfusion can effectively adsorb and remove toxins by extracorporeal system. Carbon materials, zeolites, MXenes, polymer materials, composite materials, porous materials, etc. have been developed as hemoperfusion adsorbents to remove common toxins in liver and kidney failure and to treat liver and kidney failure.








Abstract
Liver and kidney failure can lead to extensive accumulation of toxic metabolites in the blood and tissues, such as bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxins, cytokines, creatinine, uric acid, and urea, which aggravate the progression of the disease. Hemoperfusion can effectively adsorb and remove toxins from the blood and treat liver and kidney failure. However, the adsorption efficiency and safety of traditional hemoperfusion adsorbents are not ideal. Thus, it is urgent to develop adsorbents with good blood compatibility, as well as high adsorption and strong selective capacities, to fulfill the clinical needs. In recent years, new hemoperfusion adsorbents with improved adsorption performance and good blood compatibility have been developed. This review classifies and summarizes the recent research progress in hemoperfusion adsorbents for common blood toxins (bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxins, cytokines, creatinine, uric acid, and urea) produced by liver and kidney failure. The composition and structure of various toxin adsorbents, toxin adsorption performance, biocompatibility, blood safety, and the adsorption mechanisms of toxins are discussed. Based on a summary of recent studies, feasible strategies have been explored for designing and preparing hemoperfusion adsorbents to fulfill future development requirements. The trends and clinical application prospects of various toxin adsorbents are also discussed.

Abstract
Nucleic acid plays a crucial role in countless biological processes. Hence, there is great interest in its detection and analysis in various fields from chemistry, biology, to medicine. Nanoporous crystalline materials exhibit enormous potential as an effective platform for nucleic acid recognition and application. These materials have highly ordered and uniform pore structures, as well as adjustable surface chemistry and pore size, making them good carriers for nucleic acid extraction, detection, and delivery. In this review, the latest developments in nanoporous crystalline materials, including metal organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) for nucleic acid recognition and applications are discussed. Different strategies for functionalizing these materials are explored to specifically identify nucleic acid targets. Their applications in selective separation and detection of nucleic acids are highlighted. They can also be used as DNA/RNA sensors, gene delivery agents, host DNAzymes, and in DNA&#8208;based computing. Other applications include catalysis, data storage, and biomimetics. The development of novel nanoporous crystalline materials with enhanced biocompatibility has opened up new avenues in the fields of nucleic acid analysis and therapy, paving the way for the development of sensitive, selective, and cost&#8208;effective diagnostic and therapeutic tools with widespread applications.

         <title>Machine Learning Paves the Way for High Entropy Compounds Exploration: Challenges, Progress, and Outlook</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning (ML) revolutionizes high entropy compounds (HECs) research, addressing their complex structures. It models HEC at atomic and macroscopic levels, using various algorithms. Accurate data, feature engineering, and cross&#8208;validation are key for robust models. ML's potential in HEC exploration is significant, driving Artificial&#8208;intelliegence&#8208;assisted material discovery.








Abstract
Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in the research field of high entropy compounds (HECs), which have gained worldwide attention due to their vast compositional space and abundant regulatability. However, the complex structure space of HEC poses challenges to traditional experimental and computational approaches, necessitating the adoption of machine learning. Microscopically, machine learning can model the Hamiltonian of the HEC system, enabling atomic&#8208;level property investigations, while macroscopically, it can analyze macroscopic material characteristics such as hardness, melting point, and ductility. Various machine learning algorithms, both traditional methods and deep neural networks, can be employed in HEC research. Comprehensive and accurate data collection, feature engineering, and model training and selection through cross&#8208;validation are crucial for establishing excellent ML models. ML also holds promise in analyzing phase structures and stability, constructing potentials in simulations, and facilitating the design of functional materials. Although some domains, such as magnetic and device materials, still require further exploration, machine learning's potential in HEC research is substantial. Consequently, machine learning has become an indispensable tool in understanding and exploiting the capabilities of HEC, serving as the foundation for the new paradigm of Artificial&#8208;intelligence&#8208;assisted material exploration.

         <title>Rational Designs of Biomaterials for Combating Oral Biofilm Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intractable oral biofilms are the chief culprits of both dental infections and systemic inflammation, posing a great threat to human health. In this review, core strategies of recently developed biomaterials in eradicating oral biofilm are present. Furthermore, design rationales of biomaterials with advanced antibiofilm capacity, as well as versatile antibiofilm biomaterials with other functions are comprehensively summarized.








Abstract
Oral biofilms, which are also known as dental plaque, are the culprit of a wide range of oral diseases and systemic diseases, thus contributing to serious health risks. The manner of how to achieve good control of oral biofilms has been an increasing public concern. Novel antimicrobial biomaterials with highly controllable fabrication and functionalization have been proven to be promising candidates. However, previous reviews have generally emphasized the physicochemical properties, action mode, and application effectiveness of those biomaterials, whereas insufficient attention has been given to the design rationales tailored to different infection types and application scenarios. To offer guidance for better diversification and functionalization of anti&#8208;oral&#8208;biofilm biomaterials, this review details the up&#8208;to&#8208;date design rationales in three aspects: the core strategies in combating oral biofilm, as well as the biomaterials with advanced antibiofilm capacity and multiple functions based on the improvement or combination of the abovementioned antimicrobial strategies. Thereafter, insights on the existing challenges and future improvement of biomaterial&#8208;assisted oral biofilm treatments are proposed, hoping to provide a theoretical basis and reference for the subsequent design and application of antibiofilm biomaterials.

         <title>Theranostic Lipid Nanoparticles for Renal Cell Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the recent advances on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for precision diagnosis and treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are comprehensively summarized. The chemical compositions of LNPs and the modification strategies for enhanced tumor target are introduced. After that, the authors&#8217; ongoing and foreseeable biomedical applications are discussed and prospected.








Abstract
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common urological malignancy and represents a leading threat to healthcare. Recent years have seen a series of progresses in the early diagnosis and management of RCC. Theranostic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are increasingly becoming one of the focuses in this field, because of their suitability for tumor targeting and multimodal therapy. LNPs can be precisely fabricated with desirable chemical compositions and biomedical properties, which closely match the physiological characteristics and clinical needs of RCC. Herein, a comprehensive review of theranostic LNPs is presented, emphasizing the generic tool nature of LNPs in developing advanced micro&#8208;nano biomaterials. It begins with a brief overview of the compositions and formation mechanism of LNPs, followed with an introduction to kidney&#8208;targeting approaches, such as passive, active, and stimulus responsive targeting. With examples provided, a series of modification strategies for enhancing the tumor targeting and functionality of LNPs are discussed. Thereafter, research advances on applications of these LNPs for RCC including bioimaging, liquid biopsy, drug delivery, physical therapy, and gene therapy are summarized and discussed from an interdisciplinary perspective. The final part highlights the milestone achievements of translation medicine, current challenges as well as future development directions of LNPs for the diagnosis and treatment of RCC.

         <title>Geometric Control and Optical Properties of Intrinsically Chiral Plasmonic Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanomaterials have provided great opportunities for many promising applications. Here, the geometric control and optical properties of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials are circumnavigated and widen the scope of their potential applications. It is envisioned that these studies will pave the way toward the rational design of chiral nanomaterials with desired optical properties for emerging applications.








Abstract
Intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanomaterials exhibit intriguing geometry&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties, which is due to the combination of plasmonic features with geometric chirality. Thus, chiral plasmonic nanomaterials have become promising candidates for applications in biosensing, asymmetric catalysis, biomedicine, photonics, etc. Recent advances in geometric control and optical tuning of intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanomaterials have further opened up a unique opportunity for their widespread applications in many emerging technological areas. Here, the recent developments in the geometric control of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials are reviewed with special attention given to the quantitative understanding of the chiroptical structure&#8208;property relationship. Several important optical spectroscopic tools for characterizing the optical chirality of plasmonic nanomaterials at both ensemble and single&#8208;particle levels are also discussed. Three emerging applications of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials, including enantioselective sensing, enantioselective catalysis, and biomedicine, are further highlighted. It is envisioned that these advanced studies in chiral plasmonic nanomaterials will pave the way toward the rational design of chiral nanomaterials with desired optical properties for diverse emerging technological applications.

         <title>The Key Role of Molecular Packing in Luminescence Property: From Adjacent Molecules to Molecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review mainly discusses the molecular aggregation science behind luminescence materials. From the basic packing modes of adjacent molecules to the various aggregated structures, the efficient bridge between molecular structures and luminescence property has been roughly built to promote their development from internal to external.








Abstract
The luminescence materials act as the key components in many functional devices, as well as the detection and imaging systems, which can be permeated in each aspect of modern life, and attract more and more attention for the creative technology and applications. In addition to the diverse properties of organic luminogens, the multiple molecular packing at aggregated states frequently offers new and/or exciting performance. However, there still lacks comprehensive analysis of molecular packing in these organic materials, resulting in an increased gap between molecular design and practical applications. In this review, from the basic knowledge of organic compounds as single molecules, to the discernable property of excimer, charge transfer (CT) complex or self&#8208;assembly systems by adjacent molecules, and finally to the opto&#8208;electronic performance of molecular aggregates, the relevant factors to molecular packing and practical applications are discussed.

         <title>Lightning the Spin: Harnessing the Potential of 2D Magnets in Opto&#8208;Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D magnets provide diverse magnetic orders for spins to be aligned, including intralayer ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, and interlayer (A&#8208;type) antiferromagnetism, which allow the spins to precess in a wide range of frequency from GHz to X&#8208;ray. By interacting with the given wavelength of light/electromagnetic wave, the spins can be excited (written) and detected (read), realizing different types of opto&#8208;spintronic devices and functions.








Abstract
Since the emergence of 2D magnets in 2017, the diversity of these materials has greatly expanded. Their 2D nature (atomic&#8208;scale thickness) endows these magnets with strong magnetic anisotropy, layer&#8208;dependent and switchable magnetic order, and quantum&#8208;confined quasiparticles, which distinguish them from conventional 3D magnetic materials. Moreover, the 2D geometry facilitates light incidence for opto&#8208;spintronic applications and potential on&#8208;chip integration. In analogy to optoelectronics based on optical&#8211;electronic interactions, opto&#8208;spintronics use light&#8208;spin interactions to process spin information stored in the solid state. In this review, opto&#8208;spintronics is divided into three types with respect to the wavelengths of radiation interacting with 2D magnets: 1) GHz (microwave) to THz (mid&#8208;infrared), 2) visible, and 3) UV to X&#8208;rays. It is focused on the recent research advancements on the newly discovered mechanisms of light&#8208;spin interactions in 2D magnets and introduces the potential design of novel opto&#8208;spintronic applications based on these interactions.

         <title>A Monolayer High&#8208;Entropy Layered Hydroxide Frame for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monolayer high&#8208;entropy layered hydroxide (HELH) frame is prepared by in situ conversion from Zn,Co&#8208;ZIF under a mild environment. The HELH with tailored geometric structure provides a guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts. It also provides a new insight into the field of fine regulation of high&#8208;entropy material structure.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials with tailored geometric and elemental compositions provide a guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are the most efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst. However, due to the huge difference in ionic solubility product, an extremely strong alkali environment is necessary to prepare high&#8208;entropy layered hydroxides (HELHs), which results in an uncontrollable structure, poor stability, and scarce active sites. Here, a universal synthesis of monolayer HELH frame in a mild environment is presented, regardless of the solubility product limit. Mild reaction conditions allow this study to precisely control the fine structure and elemental composition of the final product. Consequently, the surface area of the HELHs is up to 380.5&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1. The current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 is achieved in 1&#160;m KOH at an overpotential of 259&#160;mV, and, after 1000&#160;h operation at the current density of 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, the catalytic performance shows no obvious deterioration. The high&#8208;entropy engineering and fine nanostructure control open opportunities to solve the problems of low intrinsic activity, very few active sites, instability, and low conductance during OER for LDH catalysts.

         <title>AIEgen&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Preventing Malignant Ventricular Arrhythmias Via Local Hyperthermia Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of AIEgen&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks are constructed with a unique &#8220;one stone, two birds&#8221; functionality, which is not only efficient in directly modulating the function and neural activity of stellate ganglion (SG) through local hyperthermia therapy, but also further inducing browning of white fat and ameliorating the neuroinflammation of peri&#8208;SG, favorable for inhibiting malignant ventricular arrhythmias.








Abstract
The engineering of aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgen) based covalent organic frameworks (COFs), TDTA&#8208;COF, BTDTA&#8208;COF, and BTDBETA&#8208;COF are reported, as hyperthermia agents for inhibiting the occurrence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). These AIE COFs exhibit dual functionality, as they not only directly modulate the function and neural activity of stellate ganglion (SG) through local hyperthermia therapy (LHT) but also induce the browning of white fat and improve the neuroinflammation peri&#8208;SG microenvironment, which is favorable for inhibiting ischemia&#8208;induced VAs. In vivo studies have confirmed that BTDBETA&#8208;COF&#8208;mediated LHT enhances thermogenesis and browning&#8208;related gene expression, thereby serving a synergistic role in combating VAs. Transcriptome analysis of peri&#8208;SG adipose tissue reveals a substantial downregulation of inflammatory cytokines, highlighting the potency of BTDBETA&#8208;COF&#8208;mediated LHT in ameliorating the neuroinflammation peri&#8208;SG microenvironment and offering myocardial and arrhythmia protection. The work on AIE COF&#8208;based hyperthermia agent for VAs inhibition provides a new avenue for mitigating cardiac sympathetic nerve hyperactivity.

         <title>Microenvironment&#8208;Regulating Drug Delivery Nanoparticles for Treating and Preventing Typical Biofilm&#8208;Induced Oral Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most of the infectious diseases in the oral cavity are based on disturbances in the bacterial&#8208;cellular microenvironment. In this work, a microenvironment&#8208;targeted drug delivery nanoparticle is prepared to inhibit bacterial adhesion to surfaces, modulate macrophage polarization, and produce photodynamic and photothermal effects. It performs antibacterial, anti&#8208;biofilm, and anti&#8208;inflammation effects to achieve the treatment and prevention for typical biofilm&#8208;induced oral diseases.








Abstract
The oral cavity comprises an environment full of microorganisms. Dysregulation of this microbial&#8208;cellular microenvironment will lead to a series of oral diseases, such as implant&#8208;associated infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) biofilms and periodontitis initiated by Streptococcus oralis (S. oralis). In this study, a liposome&#8208;encapsulated indocyanine green (ICG) and rapamycin drug&#8208;delivery nanoparticle (ICG&#8208;rapamycin) is designed to treat and prevent two typical biofilm&#8208;induced oral diseases by regulating the microbial&#8208;cellular microenvironment. ICG&#8208;rapamycin elevates the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and temperature levels to facilitate photodynamic and photothermal mechanisms under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser irradiation for anti&#8208;bacteria. In addition, it prevents biofilm formation by promoting bacterial motility with increasing the ATP levels. The nanoparticles modulate the microbial&#8208;cellular interaction to reduce cellular inflammation and enhance bacterial clearance, which includes promoting the M2 polarization of macrophages, upregulating the anti&#8208;inflammatory factor TGF&#8208;&#946;, and enhancing the bacterial phagocytosis of macrophages. Based on these findings, ICG&#8208;rapamycin is applied to implant&#8208;infected and periodontitis animal models to confirm the effects in vivo. This study demonstrates that ICG&#8208;rapamycin can treat and prevent biofilm&#8208;induced oral diseases by regulating the microbial&#8208;cellular microenvironment, thus providing a promising strategy for future clinical applications.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Hollow&#8208;Structured Mesoporous Carbons by Enhanced Surface Interaction for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons with ultrahigh surface area, large pore volume and heteroatom doping are synthesized by a versatile and general silanol&#8208;assisted surface&#8208;casting method. The materials display remarkable electrochemical performance for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The studies reveal that strong interactions between the organic molecules and the silanol&#8208;rich surface of the silica template are crucial.








Abstract
Nanoporous carbons are very attractive for various applications including energy storage. Templating methods with assembled amphiphilic molecules or porous inorganic templates are typically used for the synthesis. Amongst the different members of this family, CMK&#8208;5&#8208;like structures that are constructed to consist of sub&#8208;10&#160;nm amorphous carbon nanotubes and ultrahigh specific surface area due to their thin pore walls, have the best properties in various respects. However, the fabrication of such hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons entails elaborately tailoring the surface properties of the template pore walls and selecting specific carbon precursors. Thus, very limited cases are successful. Herein, a versatile and general silanol&#8208;assisted surface&#8208;casting method to create hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons and heteroatom&#8208;doped derivatives with numerous organic molecules (e.g., furfuryl alcohol, resol, 2&#8208;thiophene methanol, dopamine, tyrosine) and different structural templates is reported. These carbon materials exhibit ultrahigh surface area (2400&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1), large pore volume (4.0&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1), as well as satisfactory lithium&#8208;storage capacity (1460&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability (320&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), and very outstanding cycling performance (2000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1).

This method involves three steps: the formation of a carbon protective layer on individual nanoparticle via electron&#8208;beam irradiation, selective removal of unprotected nanoparticles using a corrosive agent, and subsequent elimination of the carbon layer. This enables the fabrication of a single micrometer&#8208;long uniform through nanochannel in the silicon wafer, which can be employed for nanopore sensing and shape&#8208;based nanoparticle distinguishing.








Abstract
The structure of nanomaterials and nanodevices determines their functionality and applications. A single uniform nanochannel with a high aspect ratio is an attractive structure due to its unique rigid structures, easy preparation, and diverse pore structures and it holds significant promising importance in fields such as nanopore sensing and nanomanufacturing. Although the metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;assistant silicon etching technique can produce uniform nanochannels, however, the fabrication of single through nanochannels remains a challenge thus far. A simple and versatile strategy is developed that allows for the retention of individual gold nanoparticle on a substrate, enabling single&#8208;nanoparticle nanomachining. This method involves three steps: the formation of a carbon protective layer on individual nanoparticles via electron&#8208;beam irradiation, selective removal of unprotected nanoparticles using a corrosive agent, and subsequent elimination of the carbon layer. This enables the fabrication of a single submillimeter&#8208;long uniform through nanochannel in the silicon wafer, which can be employed for nanopore sensing and shape&#8208;based nanoparticle distinguishing. The developed method can also facilitate single&#8208;nanoparticle studies and nanomachining for a broad application in materials science, electronics, micro/nano&#8208;optics, and catalysis.

         <title>Ultrathin Van der Waals Lanthanum Oxychloride Dielectric for 2D Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrathin van der Waals (vdW) LaOCl is synthesized by controlling the growth kinetics. Due to the considerable dielectric properties of LaOCl and its dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surface, the MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) with vdW LaOCl dielectric exhibits ultralow hysteresis. LaOCl possesses the tremendous potential to act as an ideal gate dielectric for two&#8208;dimensional FETs.








Abstract
Downsizing silicon&#8208;based transistors can result in lower power consumption, faster speeds, and greater computational capacity, although it is accompanied by the appearance of short&#8208;channel effects. The integration of high&#8208;mobility 2D semiconductor channels with ultrathin high dielectric constant (high&#8208;&#954;) dielectric in transistors is expected to suppress the effect. Nevertheless, the absence of a high&#8208;&#954; dielectric layer featuring an atomically smooth surface devoid of dangling bonds poses a significant obstacle in the advancement of 2D electronics. Here, ultrathin van der Waals (vdW) lanthanum oxychloride (LaOCl) dielectrics are successfully synthesized by precisely controlling the growth kinetics. These dielectrics demonstrate an impressive high&#8208;&#954; value of 10.8 and exhibit a remarkable breakdown field strength (Ebd) exceeding 10 MV cm&#8722;1. Remarkably, the conventional molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) featuring a dielectric made of LaOCl showcases an almost negligible hysteresis when compared to FETs employing alternative gate dielectrics. This can be attributed to the flawlessly formed vdW interface and excellent compatibility established between LaOCl and MoS2. These findings will motivate the further exploration of rare&#8208;earth oxychlorides and the development of more&#8208;than&#8208;Moore nanoelectronic devices.

Properties of LM and its application in the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs.








Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remains a leading cause of high mortality and imposes a significant health burden globally. The biocompatibility between materials and the cardiovascular system, encompassing biological safety, modulus matching, and anti&#8208;fatigue performance in dynamic physiological environments, has been a critical challenge in the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs. The emergence of liquid metal (LM) offers promising opportunities to develop diagnostic and therapeutic methods that exhibit excellent biocompatibility with the cardiovascular system. In this perspective, the progress of LM applications in contrast agents, nanomedicine, implantable and wearable bioelectronic devices, and bionic materials is evaluated, providing a comprehensive and in&#8208;depth discussion of the role and advantages of LM in CVDs management. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of LM in the field of CVDs diagnosis and treatment are outlined.

         <title>Routes to Electrochemically Stable Sulfur Cathodes for Practical Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state reaction&#8221; mechanism can enable the redox reaction of sulfur to proceed in a solid&#8208;phase conversion manner in liquid electrolytes without the generation and dissolution of polysulfide intermediates at cycling, and therefore is a promising approach to develop high&#8208;capacity and cycle&#8208;stable sulfur cathodes for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries have been investigated intensively as a post&#8208;Li&#8208;ion technology in the past decade; however, their realizable energy density and cycling performance are still far from satisfaction for commercial development. Although many extremely high&#8208;capacity and cycle&#8208;stable S cathodes and Li anodes are reported in literature, their use for practical Li&#8211;S batteries remains challenging due to the huge gap between the laboratory research and industrial applications. The laboratory research is usually conducted by use of a thin&#8208;film electrode with a low sulfur loading and high electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) ratios, while the practical batteries require a thick/high sulfur loading cathode and a low E/S ratio to achieve a desired energy density. To make this clear, the inherent problems of dissolution/deposition mechanism of conventional sulfur cathodes are analyzed from the viewpoint of polarization theory of porous electrode after a brief overview of the recent research progress on sulfur cathodes of Li&#8211;S batteries, and the possible strategies for building an electrochemically stable sulfur cathode are discussed for practically viable Li&#8211;S batteries from the authors&#8217; own understandings.

An overview of interface engineering strategies to overcome the limitation of the Debye screening effect for the achievement of high&#8208;performance FET&#8208;based electronic devices is proposed, and their applications in biological environment analysis are systematically summarized.








Abstract
Promising advances in molecular medicine have promoted the urgent requirement for reliable and sensitive diagnostic tools. Electronic biosensing devices based on field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) exhibit a wide range of benefits, including rapid and label&#8208;free detection, high sensitivity, easy operation, and capability of integration, possessing significant potential for application in disease screening and health monitoring. In this perspective, the tremendous efforts and achievements in the development of high&#8208;performance FET biosensors in the past decade are summarized, with emphasis on the interface engineering of FET&#8208;based electrical platforms for biomolecule identification. First, an overview of engineering strategies for interface modulation and recognition element design is discussed in detail. For a further step, the applications of FET&#8208;based electrical devices for in vitro detection and real&#8208;time monitoring in biological systems are comprehensively reviewed. Finally, the key opportunities and challenges of FET&#8208;based electronic devices in biosensing are discussed. It is anticipated that a comprehensive understanding of interface engineering strategies in FET biosensors will inspire additional techniques for developing highly sensitive, specific, and stable FET biosensors as well as emerging designs for next&#8208;generation biosensing electronics.

         <title>Materials Strategies Tackling Interfacial Issues in Catalyst Layers of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective focuses on the latest progresses in material sciences for solving the problems related to the catalyst/ionomer interface in PEMFCs, with particular emphasis put on the effects of materials structures and intermolecular interactions. The content covers catalysts, ionomers, and additives. Based on molecule&#8208;level understanding, the challenges for the application of established materials and opportunities to broaden the material library are proposed.








Abstract
The most critical challenge for the large&#8208;scale commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), one of the primary hydrogen energy technologies, is to achieve decent output performance with low usage of platinum (Pt). Currently, the performance of PEMFCs is largely limited by two issues at the catalyst/ionomer interface, specifically, the poisoning of active sites of Pt by sulfonate groups and the extremely sluggish local oxygen transport toward Pt. In the past few years, emerging strategies are derived to tackle these interface problems through materials optimization and innovation. This perspective summarizes the latest advances in this regard, and in the meantime unveils the molecule&#8208;level mechanisms behind the materials modulation of interfacial structures. This paper starts with a brief introduction of processes and structures of catalyst/ionomer interfaces, which is followed by a detailed review of progresses in key materials toward interface optimization, including catalysts, ionomers, and additives, with particular emphasis on the role of materials structure in regulating the intermolecular interactions. Finally, the challenges for the application of the established materials and research directions to broaden the material library are highlighted.

         <title>Processability Considerations for Next&#8208;Generation Organic Photovoltaic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive set of key performance indicators is proposed to address the limitations of current evaluation methods for the processability of organic photovoltaic materials, aiming to guide academic research and enhance industrial processability.








Abstract
The evolution of organic semiconductors for organic photovoltaics (OPVs) has resulted in unforeseen outcomes. This has provided substitute choices of photoactive layer materials, which effectively convert sunlight into electricity. Recently developed OPV materials have narrowed down the gaps in efficiency, stability, and cost in devices. Records now show power conversion efficiency in single&#8208;junction devices closing to 20%. Despite this, there is still a gap between the currently developed OPV materials and those that meet the requirements of practical applications, especially the solution processability issue widely concerned in the field of OPVs. Based on the general rule that structure determines properties, methodologies to enhance the processability of OPV materials are reviewed and explored from the perspective of material design and views&#160;on the further development of processable OPV materials are presented. Considering the current dilemma that the existing evaluation indicators cannot reflect the industrial processability of OPV materials, a more complete set of key performance indicators are proposed&#160;for their processability considerations. The purpose of this perspective is to raise awareness of the boundary conditions that exist in industrial OPV manufacturing and to provide guidance for academic research that aspires to contribute to technological advancements.

         <title>Non&#8208;Hermitian Topological Phononic Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research of non&#8208;Hermitian physics is in the ascendant and has brought new opportunities for the development of topological metamaterials. This perspective reviews the recent advances in non&#8208;Hermitian topological phononic metamaterials for acoustic wave and mechanical structures. New configurations and mechanisms for skin effect in high&#8208;dimensional non&#8208;Hermitian systems and non&#8208;Hermitian effect for elastic wave metamaterials are worthy of further exploration.








Abstract
Non&#8208;Hermitian (NH) physics describes novel phenomena in open systems that allow generally complex spectra. Introducing NH physics into topological metamaterials, which permits explorations of topological wave phenomena in artificially designed structures, not only enables the experimental verification of exotic NH phenomena in these flexible platforms, but also enriches the manipulation of wave propagation beyond the Hermitian cases. Here, a perspective on the advances in the research of NH topological phononic metamaterials is presented, which covers the exceptional points and their topological geometries, the skin effect related to the topology of complex spectra, the interplay of NH effects and topological states in phononic metamaterials, etc.

         <title>In Situ Twistronics: A New Platform Based on Superlubricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 31, August 7, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The burgeoning field of twistronics has been ignited by the straightforward manipulation of interlayer twist between van der Waals layered materials. This perspective highlights the in situ twisting techniques and the underlying superlubricity mechanism, and exemplifies new promising opportunities arising from the intersection of the fields of twistronics, nanotribology, and micro/nano&#8208;electro&#8208;mechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS), etc.








Abstract
Twistronics, an emerging field focused on exploring the unique electrical properties induced by twist interface in graphene multilayers, has garnered significant attention in recent years. The general manipulation of twist angle depends on the assembly of van der Waals (vdW) layered materials, which has led to the discovery of unconventional superconductivity, ferroelectricity, and nonlinear optics, thereby expanding the realm of twistronics. Recently, in situ tuning of interlayer conductivity in vdW layered materials has been achieved based on scanning probe microscope. In this Perspective, the advancements in in situ twistronics are focused on by reviewing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in situ manipulating technology, discussing the underlying mechanism based on the concept of structural superlubricity, and exploiting the real&#8208;time twistronic tests under scanning electron microscope (SEM). It is shown that the real&#8208;time manipulation under SEM allows for visualizing and monitoring the interface status during in situ twistronic testing. By harnessing the unique tribological properties of vdW layered materials, this novel platform not only enhances the fabrication of twistronic devices but also facilitates the fundamental understanding of interface phenomena in vdW layered materials. Moreover, this platform holds great promise for the application of twistronic&#8208;mechanical systems, providing avenues for the integration of twistronics into various mechanical frameworks.

         <title>Revisiting The Role of Entropy for Charge Separation in 1D Pi&#8208;Conjugated Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes solution&#8208;phase microwave conductivity to study charge generation in a 1D model system of semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (s&#8208;SWCNTs) in low&#8208;dielectric solvent. The observation of high conductivity, even for much less than one dopant per s&#8208;SWCNT on average, demonstrates that entropy plays a key role in facilitating charge carrier escape in 1D systems, despite prior suggestions to the contrary.









Abstract
Free carrier generation in organic donor/acceptor heterojunctions and redox&#8208;doped organic semiconductors is poorly understood, since assumed tight electron&#8211;hole binding conflicts with observed high free carrier yields. Cornerstone analyses that have guided the field for over 15 years predict that entropy can stabilize free charges in 2D and 3D pi&#8208;conjugated semiconductors but not in 1D systems. Here, the impact of entropy on charge generation in 1D pi&#8208;conjugated semiconductors is revisited by exploiting a greatly simplified system where enthalpy considerations alone should not allow for free charge generation. Noncontact solution&#8208;phase microwave conductivity is used to investigate the carrier density&#8208;dependent conductivity and dielectric constant in isolated chemically doped semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes in a low&#8208;dielectric solvent. Dopant chemical structure dramatically influences the carrier density&#8208;dependent complex conductivity, with bulky dopants facilitating carrier escape even at carrier densities below one carrier per nanotube. Three distinct numerical calculations show that entropic stabilization dramatically lowers the Gibbs energy barrier for free charge generation, explaining the high yield of free carriers, even in 1D. This renewed understanding of entropy's role in carrier generation has important implications for designing organic electronic devices&#8211;such as solar cells and thermoelectric energy harvesters&#8211;for enhanced carrier yield, conductivity, and performance.

         <title>Variable&#8208;Temperature X&#8208;Ray Scattering Unveils the Solution Aggregation Structures and Processing Resiliency of High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Photovoltaics with Iodinated Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Variable&#8208;temperature small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering is used to investigate the solution aggregation behavior and processing resiliency of high&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaics with an iodinated electron acceptor. The iodinated acceptor exhibits superior processing stability compared to its fluorinated counterpart. A direct link between the solution aggregation structure, active layer morphology, and photovoltaic performance is established, which can guide the optimization of device efficiency.








Abstract
Polymer photovoltaics are promising for low&#8208;cost, flexible, and lightweight power supplies. Their performance is heavily influenced by the morphology of the polymer: acceptor blend, where the aggregation structures of both components play a crucial role in charge generation, transport, and overall device performance. This study probes and resolves the solution aggregation behavior and processing resilience of high&#8208;efficiency polymer photovoltaics incorporating an iodinated electron acceptor, BO&#8208;4I, using variable&#8208;temperature small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and neutron scattering. By comparing BO&#8208;4I with its fluorinated counterpart, it is found that BO&#8208;4I exhibits excellent solution processing stability, whether in chlorobenzene or toluene. In addition, temperature&#8208;induced change in the donor:acceptor blend aggregation structure leads to significant alterations in film morphology, ultimately affecting device performance. Particularly, the stable solution aggregation structure of the BO&#8208;4I system confers processing resilience to device performance and achieves higher long&#8208;term device stability. Combining film structural analysis and device performance characterization, a structural inheritance is identified from solution to film, and determined that a organic photovoltaics&#160;polymer aggregate length of 27 &#177; 3&#160;nm in solution is a key feature for achieving optimal efficiency in polymer photovoltaics. These findings provide valuable insights and guidance for designing future polymer photovoltaic systems.

         <title>Disordered Cu Sites in Amorphous Cu2Te Nanosheets Promote Electrocatalytic Acetylene Semi&#8208;hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D crystalline Cu2Te nanosheets (c&#8208;Cu2Te NSs) are converted into oxygen&#8208;doped amorphous analogues (a&#8208;Cu2Te NSs) via controlled air calcination. This amorphization induces Cu 3d&#8211;O 2p orbital hybridization, enhancing electronic structure and active site density. The a&#8208;Cu2Te NSs deliver 91.7% ethylene Faradaic efficiency and 550&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 partial current density with outstanding stability in electrocatalytic acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation offers a sustainable and energy&#8208;efficient alternative to conventional thermocatalytic methods, yet remains challenged by competing side reactions, including hydrogen evolution, over&#8208;hydrogenation, and carbon&#8208;carbon coupling. Here, the transformation of 2D van der Waals crystalline Cu2Te nanosheets (c&#8208;Cu2Te NSs) into oxygen&#8208;doped amorphous analogues (a&#8208;Cu2Te NSs) via controlled air calcination is reported. The resulting a&#8208;Cu2Te NSs feature a disordered Cu coordination network and deliver an ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 91.7% at a high partial current density of 550&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, along with excellent stability, outperforming both c&#8208;Cu2Te NSs and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. Mechanism investigations reveal that structural amorphization drives the redistribution of interlayer Cu atoms and alters key electronic properties, including the density of states and the Cu d&#8208;band center, through Cu 3d&#8208;O 2p orbital hybridization. These effects increase the density of accessible Cu active sites, optimize adsorption energetics, accelerate interfacial water dissociation, and promote hydrogen accumulation, thereby effectively suppressing undesirable side reactions. This work highlights amorphous engineering as a powerful strategy for designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.

         <title>Self&#8208;Toughened 2D Moir&#233; Superlattice Membranes with Extreme Thermal Shock Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D moir&#233; superlattice composed of vertically stacked hexagonal boron nitride and graphene (hBN/Gr) demonstrates exceptional fracture toughness, primarily attributed to hBN's crack deflection and bifurcation mechanisms. Notably, this robust membrane withstands 200 extreme thermal shock cycles up to 1800 K at a heating rate of 10&#8308; K s&#8315;&#185;. Such remarkable thermal stability facilitates the successful synthesis of high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles.








Abstract
Excellent mechanical strength and toughness are demanded for two&#8208;dimensional material (2DM) membranes in various applications to withstand extreme strain and temperature changes and resist crack propagation. However, the trade&#8208;off between strength and toughness poses significant challenges in meeting these requirements. This study presents a self&#8208;toughened 2D moir&#233; superlattice membrane composed of vertically stacked hexagonal boron nitride and graphene (hBN/Gr) that exhibits high mechanical strength. The intrinsic toughness originates from the high energy release rate associated with the crack deflection and bifurcation in hBN. Remarkably, this robust membrane endures 200 cycles of thermal shock up to 1800 K with 104 K s&#8722;1 heating rate, during which high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEA&#8208;NPs) are successfully synthesized. The findings pave the way for the design and fabrication of robust 2D superlattices, facilitating future exploration under extreme conditions.

         <title>Hard Carbon for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: From Fundamental Research to Practical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a promising anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, hard carbon stands out with its high Na storage capacity, structural stability, and safety. This review comprehensively summarizes and discusses its structural models, Na storage mechanisms, diverse modification strategies, and full&#8208;cell integration challenges, aiming to guide the development of high&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective sodium&#8208;ion batteries and inspire future research directions.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as a promising technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their unique performance characteristics and raw material accessibility. Among various anode materials, hard carbon (HC) stands out due to its high Na storage capacity, structural stability, and intrinsic safety. However, the structural complexity and heterogeneity of HC present ongoing challenges in understanding its structural models and Na storage mechanisms, impeding the rational design and performance optimization of HC&#8208;based anodes. This review provides a systematic overview of recent advances in HC for SIBs, beginning with an in&#8208;depth examination of representative structural models and the underlying structure&#8211;property relationships. The review critically analyzes Na storage mechanisms and bridges these insights with a diverse array of modification strategies&#8212;including precursor design, structural tailoring, and surface/interface optimization. Special emphasis is placed on improving initial Coulombic efficiency, rate capability, and long&#8208;term cycling stability. Furthermore, practical challenges related to full&#8208;cell integration are discussed, such as pre&#8208;sodiation techniques and electrolyte/interface engineering&#160;to enhance the real&#8208;world applicability of HC. By integrating fundamental understanding with forward&#8208;looking design strategies, this review provides&#160;a valuable reference for the development of high&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective SIB systems, and to inspire future research directions in sodium&#8208;ion energy storage.

         <title>Atomically Precise Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Faults Induced Enhanced Emission in Ligand Stabilized Mixed Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study overcomes challenges in visualizing atomic&#8208;level defects in perovskite nanocrystals, promising to significantly improve the stability and performance of quantum dot&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting devices. Using double&#8208;Cs&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy, the study enables atomic&#8208;resolution imaging of elusive RuddlesdenPopper faults hidden within CsPbBr3&#8208;xIx nanocrystals. Lead, cesium, bromine, and iodine atoms are identified precisely, revealing their spatial arrangement within a single nanocrystal. 








Abstract
Atomic&#8208;resolution imaging of Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) interfaces is challenging due to their concealment within perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) and the inherent limitations of conventional characterization techniques. In this study, distinctly oriented RP faults have been detected using double&#8208;Cs&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). A simple yet reliable STEM approach to achieve atomically precise identification of Pb, Cs, Br, and I atoms and analyze their spatial atomic arrangements in a single NC is employed. In addition, dislocations caused by lattice mismatch at grain boundaries (GBs) are identified. Lattice strain in GBs and RPs is determined and quantified, revealing that neither of these planar defects introduces the deep trap levels. Therefore, in absence of Pb dangling bonds or Pb&#9472;Pb bonds in GBs and RPs plays a crucial role in stabilizing NCs and preventing ion migration. Incorporating n&#8208;octylammonium iodide in pristine CsPbBr3 quantum dots leads to the formation of CsPbBr3&#8722;xIx NCs, resulting in a significant redshift in electroluminescence (&#8776;496&#8211;623 nm) with enhanced intensity (&#177;79%), attributed to higher exciton lifetime, increased exciton binding energy, and improved carrier confinement in flexible light&#8208;emitting devices. Density functional theory calculations confirm that additional carriers localized at the interface enhance electron&#8211;hole recombination, ensuring stable charge transportation for lighting devices.

A simple yet reliable STEM approach to achieve atomically precise identification of Pb, Cs, Br, and I atoms and analyze their spatial atomic arrangements in a single NC is employed. In addition, dislocations caused by lattice mismatch at grain boundaries (GBs) are identified. Lattice strain in GBs and RPs is determined and quantified, revealing that neither of these planar defects introduces the deep trap levels. Therefore, in absence of Pb dangling bonds or Pb&#9472;Pb bonds in GBs and RPs plays a crucial role in stabilizing NCs and preventing ion migration. Incorporating &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-octylammonium iodide in pristine CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots leads to the formation of CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;I&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; NCs, resulting in a significant redshift in electroluminescence (&#8776;496&#8211;623 nm) with enhanced intensity (&#177;79%), attributed to higher exciton lifetime, increased exciton binding energy, and improved carrier confinement in flexible light-emitting devices. Density functional theory calculations confirm that additional carriers localized at the interface enhance electron&#8211;hole recombination, ensuring stable charge transportation for lighting devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Universal Method for Covalent Attachment of Hydrogels to Diverse Polymeric Surfaces for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal, reagent&#8208;free strategy is presented for covalently attaching hydrogels to diverse polymeric substrates through reactive oxygen species. The scalable, linker&#8208;free approach enables robust adhesion and broad material compatibility, advancing the fabrication of hybrid solid&#8211;hydrogel systems for next&#8208;generation biomedical devices and bioprinting applications.








Abstract
Hydrogels, renowned for their biocompatibility and capacity to mimic biological tissues, are integral to many biomedical applications, such as implantable devices and wound dressings. However, their poor mechanical strength and the challenge of achieving durable adhesion to polymeric surfaces have hindered their broader utility. Current methods of creating hybrid solid&#8208;hydrogel (HSH) structures often rely on complex chemical linkers, adding steps, cytotoxic risks, and scalability issues. Here, a novel, reagent&#8208;free method that covalently bonds hydrogels to polymeric substrates directly via reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by an atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) is introduced. Through an evaporation&#8208;induced enhanced concentration (EIEC) approach, robust hydrogel layers are formed on ROS&#8208;functionalized surfaces, eliminating the need for silane&#8208;based linkers and achieving up to 60&#160;kPa adhesion strength in wet conditions. This strategy offers robust hydrogel adhesion, reduces processing complexity, and preserves cytocompatibility, as demonstrated by the culture of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and THP&#8208;1 derived macrophages with minimal immune response. Applicable across various hydrogels, such as gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), chitosan, and polymeric substrates, including Teflon, polyethylene, and polycaprolactone (PCL), this dry process holds substantial promise for integration into advanced biomanufacturing systems, such as 3D bioprinters, unlocking new potentials in tissue engineering and biomedical device fabrication.

         <title>Host&#8208;Dependent Tunable Phosphorescence Based on Aromatic Heterocyclic Derivatives: Highly Efficient and Photo&#8208;Activated Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and photo&#8208;activated RTP is achieved by doping aromatic heterocyclic derivatives into different polymers. If they are doped into PAM, PVA, or PAA, the resultant powders exhibit a high phosphorescence efficiency of 66.2% under ambient conditions. If the guests are doped into PDMA or PVP, the resultant films demonstrate photo&#8208;activated room temperature phosphorescence with a long lifetime of 578.6&#160;ms.








Abstract
Achieving high phosphorescence efficiency and photo&#8208;activated ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) based on the same molecule remains a formidable challenge. Here, a concise strategy is proposed to obtain highly efficient and photo&#8208;activated RTP by doping aromatic heterocyclic derivatives into different polymers. Aromatic heterocyclic derivatives are doped into PAM, PVA, or PAA polymers to produce high phosphorescence efficiency. Impressively, the highest phosphorescence quantum yield can reach up to 66.2% at room temperature, which can be attributed to isolating the chromophore to reduce the excimer and the rigid environment from the polymer to restrict the non&#8208;radiative transitions. In addition, phosphorescence emission color can be tailored from green to deep blue by varying the guests. After aromatic heterocyclic derivatives are doped into PDMA or PVP, the phosphorescence lifetime is prolonged from 1.2 to 578.6&#160;ms. These polymers are successfully applied to multicolor displays and high&#8208;level information storage. This work provides a reasonable strategy to develop highly efficient and photo&#8208;activated RTP materials based on the same molecule.

         <title>Diverse Optical Regulations in a Single Electrochromic Layer of V2O5 via an Intrinsic Multiple Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single layer of orthorhombic V2O5 (&#945;&#8208;V2O5) can achieve diverse optical regulations, i.e., blue shift of absorption edge (multi&#8208;color variation) and dual band modulation of both visible and near&#8208;infrared light, via an intrinsic multiple phase transitions upon ion intercalation. This allows the warm mode to be compatible with other modes within a single electrochromic layer.








Abstract
Electrochromic oxides possessing the characteristics of color variation and spectra modulation are desirable for smart windows, displays, and camouflage. Here, it is reported that, upon ion intercalation, a single layer of a model phase&#8208;transition material, V2O5, can possess diverse modulation of visible and near&#8208;infrared spectra while changing color, via intrinsic multiple phase transitions. Specifically, as the phase transitions from &#945; to &#948; occur, the band transitions around 2.94 eV (420 nm) weaken, causing a blue shift in the optical absorption edge within the visible region. Simultaneously, new band transitions at 1.21 eV emerge and intensify, leading to a broad optical absorption centered around 1025 nm. As the phase transition progresses from &#948; to &#947;, the split&#8208;off bands in the &#947; phase fall below the Fermi level, which leads to a near&#8208;infrared transparent nature of &#947;&#8208;LixV2O5. Both absorption edge shifting and dynamically modulating the transmittance in V2O5 are different from other cathodic electrochromic oxides. The color&#8208;changing characteristics, together with selective spectral modulation, inspire the realization of multiple working modes for smart windows. Moreover, the optical constants of refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) at various phases for LixV2O5 are also demonstrated. It is anticipated that multiple and reversible phase transitions, which have not yet been realized, will be the key design principle for achieving superior electrochromic devices.

         <title>Stereochemical Control of Water Transport Properties in Thiol&#8208;yne Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rigorous understanding of thiol&#8208;yne crystallization in a series of stoichiometrically identical stereocontrolled elastomers with variations in cis vs trans backbone stereochemistry provides a path forward to design and utilize structural elements in films for barrier applications. Varying the isomer content in these elastomers directs different temperature and rate dependent crystallization behavior which affords control overmicron&#8208;scale structure.








Abstract
Barrier polymers underpin almost every commercial sector, yet the needs of several emerging areas remain unmet by commercially&#8208;available materials, including temporary orthopedic implants, transient health monitors, neural implants, and other long&#8208;term implants. The ability to tune polymer composition independently of polymer structure positions thiol&#8208;yne click chemistry as a promising platform to serve these emerging technologies. This work describes the differences in the hierarchical structure of stoichiometrically identical materials which differ only in the proportion of the cis versus trans backbone alkene stereochemistry. Varying the isomer content in this way directs different temperature and rate dependent crystallization behavior, which affords control over micron&#8208;scale structure. This investigation focuses on how these stereochemical features affect the water vapor permeation process by several methods and develops an understanding of how this unique structural regularity improves barrier performance relative to a commercially available water barrier polymer, poly(ethylene terephthalate).

         <title>Dynamic Confinement and High&#8208;Entropy Catalytic Synergy Engineering in Hollow Nano&#8208;Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a generalized dynamic template strategy for the controllable synthesis of H&#8208;MOFs (e.g., ZIF&#8208;67 and Co&#8208;BTC) and systematically investigates the effects of pore size, functional groups, and multimetal synergism on the performance of Li&#8211;S batteries. The study also screens out a high&#8208;performance sulfur&#8208;hosted HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;74.

The systematic regulation of the pore size and chemical environment of nano&#8208;metal&#8208;organic skeletons (n&#8208;MOFs) has been challenged, making it difficult to study their structure&#8208;property relationships in depth. In this study, a universal dynamic template strategy is proposed and successfully achieves the controllable construction of various hollow n&#8208;MOFs (including ZIF&#8208;67, Co&#8208;BTC, etc.). Based on this, the progressive optimization mechanism of pore size limitation (3.4&#8211;18 &#197;), functional group modification (&#9472;H, &#9472;NH2, etc.), and multi&#8208;metal (Co, Ni, etc.) synergism on the performance of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries is systematically revealed, and the long&#8208;cycle&#8208;life sulfur host HE&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 is further screened. The experimental findings and in situ characterizations collectively demonstrate that hierarchical structural optimization synergistically mitigates active material deactivation and host structure degradation. This work not only provides an integrated &#8220;synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;performance&#8221; material design paradigm for Li&#8211;S batteries, but also provides a theoretical basis for extending the multiscale optimization logic to other multistep reactive systems.

&lt;p&gt;This study proposes a generalized dynamic template strategy for the controllable synthesis of H-MOFs (e.g., ZIF-67 and Co-BTC) and systematically investigates the effects of pore size, functional groups, and multimetal synergism on the performance of Li&#8211;S batteries. The study also screens out a high-performance sulfur-hosted HE-MOF-74.

         <title>Environmental Control of Ferroelectricity in Hafnia Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible transition from nonferroelectric to ferroelectric behavior is achieved in hafnia films by modulating the surrounding atmosphere. The domain relaxation dynamics exhibit high sensitivity to environmental factors, including gas composition (ambient, N2, CO2, O2) and relative humidity, highlighting the crucial role of the measurement environment in determining the ferroelectric properties of hafnia films.








Abstract
Ferroelectricity in hafnia films has triggered significant research interest over the past decade due to its immense promise for next&#8208;generation memory devices. However, the origin of ferroic behavior at the nanoscale and the means to control it remain an open question, with the consensus being that it deviates from conventional ferroelectrics. In this work, a novel approach is presented to tune ferroelectric properties of hafnia through environmental control using piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). A reversible transition from non&#8208;ferroelectric to ferroelectric behavior by modulating the surrounding atmosphere is demonstrated. Notably, the domain relaxation dynamics exhibit striking sensitivity to environmental factors, including ambient conditions, specific gas compositions (N2, CO2, O2), and humidity levels. The critical role of surface water removal, gas molecule adsorption, and their interactions with near&#8208;surface oxygen vacancies is identified and the injected charge in determining ferroelectricity in uncapped hafnia films. These insights reveal a significant strategy for stabilizing ferroic responses by carefully regulating the chemical environment, offering new possibilities for precise control in hafnia&#8208;based films.

         <title>Advances and Strategies in Enhancing mRNA Cancer Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines offer a powerful approach for cancer immunotherapy, but their clinical impact remains limited by delivery challenges and suboptimal immune activation. This review discusses key biological barriers and design strategies&#8212;including structural optimization, immunomodulation, organ targeting delivery, and advanced nanocarriers&#8212;to enhance vaccine efficacy. Emerging innovations and translational challenges are highlighted to guide next&#8208;generation mRNA cancer vaccine development.








Abstract
Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine has emerged as a promising strategy in cancer immunotherapy, enabling the induction of precise and robust immune responses against tumor antigens. Nevertheless, enormous challenges remain, in particular its limitations in achieving optimal immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy, result in modest clinical benefit. Here, the biological barriers are reviewed that impede the functionality of mRNA cancer vaccine and describe the design considerations, including structure engineering, chemical modification, and development of next&#8208;generation delivery materials for enhancing cancer immunotherapy. Recent advances are highlighted aimed at improving vaccine efficacy through targeted delivery, modulation of immune cell interactions, and stimulation of innate immune responses. Finally, the challenges are examined in clinical translation and explore future directions for improving the therapeutic potential of mRNA cancer vaccines. By synthesizing current progress and identifying critical hurdles, this review provides a framework for advancing mRNA&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Artificial Intelligence&#8208;Driven Nanoarchitectonics for Smart Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective introduces an artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;driven nanoarchitectonics framework for targeted drug delivery, combining database&#8208;guided nanocarrier design, machine learning (ML)&#8208;assisted surface engineering with a designed targeting system, and in silico modeling for dynamic optimization. This integrated strategy enables the development of programmable, responsive, and adaptive delivery systems, offering a transformative approach to overcoming translational barriers in precision nanomedicine.








Abstract
The development of data&#8208;driven and targeted drug delivery systems is essential for advancing precision therapeutics. Despite substantial progress in nanocarrier development, conventional platforms continue to face major challenges in clinical translation due to biological complexity, off&#8208;target accumulation, and limited adaptability to dynamic physiological environments. The integration of nanoarchitectonics and artificial intelligence (AI) offers an advanced strategy for engineering delivery systems that are structurally programmable, stimuli&#8208;responsive, and autonomously optimized. Nanoarchitectonics enables the construction of hierarchical nanostructures with precise spatial and temporal control, while AI facilitates modeling, prediction, and iterative optimization throughout the development pipeline. In this perspective, an AI&#8208;driven nanoarchitectonics framework is introduced for targeted drug delivery, structured around three key phases: 1) molecular target identification through bioinformatic profiling, 2) machine learning (ML)&#8208;guided surface engineering to enhance targeting specificity, and 3) in silico modeling of delivery dynamics and systemic distribution. Drawing on recent advances and representative case studies, how AI tools are illustrated, from generative design algorithms to predictive pharmacokinetic models, are transforming the field from empirical formulation toward mechanism&#8208;informed and AI&#8208;driven intelligent design. By highlighting current limitations and outlining future directions for the integration of AI and nanoarchitectonics, are concluded with a focus on enabling clinically translatable nanomedicine platforms.

         <title>Unlocking the Ligand&#8208;Dominated Redox Activity in &#960;&#8211;d Conjugated Coordination Polymers for High&#8208;Capacity and Stable Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through precise d&#8208;orbital optimization, a novel Ni&#8208;based coordination polymer, Ni&#8208;BTA, is synthesized for potassium&#8208;ion battery anodes. The engineered electronic structure, featuring strong Ni2&#8314;&#8211;ligand &#960;&#8211;d conjugation, enhances the stability of the organic framework by strengthening C&#9552;N bonds. This structural reinforcement enables highly reversible electrochemical processes and contributes to the material's exceptional cycling performance and high capacity.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) offer a cost&#8208;effective, resource&#8208;abundant alternative to lithium&#8208;ion systems, yet the development of high&#8208;performance anodes with adequate capacity, stability, and rate capability remains a major challenge. Here, an electronic structure engineering strategy is introduced via d&#8208;orbital configuration optimization in a novel class of &#960;&#8211;d conjugated coordination polymers (TM&#8208;BTA, TM = Ni, Co, Mn). Orbital&#8208;level and charge density analyses reveal that the metal center's electronic configuration governs metal&#8211;ligand interaction strength, thereby modulating charge delocalization and ligand redox behavior. Among the series, Ni2&#8314; exhibits the strongest &#960;&#8211;d conjugation with nitrogen donor atoms, stabilizing C&#9552;N bonds and enabling highly reversible C&#9552;N/C&#9472;N transformations as the dominant redox process. This optimized coordination lowers the K&#8314; adsorption energy barrier by 44% compared to Co2&#8314; and Mn2&#8314;, markedly improving kinetics. As a result, Ni&#8208;BTA delivers a high reversible capacity of 452&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with 99.2% retention over 500 cycles at 100&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, and maintains 292&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 4,000 cycles at 1,000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1. In situ spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal a ligand&#8208;centered three&#8208;electron redox mechanism, where nitrogen heterocycles dominate K&#8314; storage and electrochemically inert Ni centers maintain structural integrity. This work establishes a general design principle for KIB anodes via d&#8208;orbital engineering in coordination polymers.

         <title>Unveiling the Mutual Promotion Mechanism of Adjacent Vacancy Defects Enables High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the mutual promotion of adjacent cation and anion vacancies in perovskite, and further develops a passivation strategy to synchronously passivate perovskite defects using a new additive of 2&#8208;hydrazinylpyrazine. The PSCs with active areas of 0.08 and 1 cm2 achieve champion PCEs of 26.28% and 24.71%, retaining 93% efficiency after 1700 h under 1&#8208;sun illumination.








Abstract
The perovskite defect evolution directly impacts the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, the mutual promotion mechanism of adjacent cation and anion vacancies in perovskite is unveiled, which means the cation/anion vacancy induces the adjacent anion/cation vacancy through decreasing the formation energy. This mutual promotion mechanism provides an explanation for the dynamic evolution of defects, and emphasizes the necessity of simultaneously passivating of adjacent defects. Accordingly, a new additive of 2&#8208;hydrazinylpyrazine is utilized to passivate adjacent defects, considering its adjacent electron&#8208;rich N atom, which can chemically bond uncoordinated Pb, and the hydrazine group, which can anchor FA+ through hydrogen bonds. Besides, this 2&#8208;hydrazinylpyrazine also optimizes the perovskite crystallization through accelerating nucleation and slowing crystal growth, demonstrated by the in situ photoluminescence spectra. The resulting inverted 0.08 cm2 and 1 cm2 PSCs obtain PCEs of 26.28% and 24.71%, respectively. Moreover, the Target device shows enhanced stability by maintaining 93% and 90% of the initial efficiency after operating 1700 h under 1&#8208;sun illumination and being exposed to harsh thermal cycling for 150 times, respectively.

         <title>A Dipole&#8208;Engineered Electrolyte Paradigm to Overcome Desolvation Barriers for Exceptional Ultralow&#8208;Temperature Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our dipole&#8208;engineered electrolyte paradigm establishes an innovative approach beyond prevailing ion&#8208;dipole modulation framework, offering a generic&#8208;methodology for ultralow&#8208;temperature electrolyte design.








Abstract
Electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices often exhibit poor low&#8208;temperature performance due to high interfacial desolvation energy barriers. While conventional strategies targeting ion&#8208;dipole interactions have improved desolvation kinetics, they suffer from a fundamental trade&#8208;off with bulk&#8208;phase ion diffusion. Here, a dipole&#8208;engineered electrolyte paradigm is proposed to overcome desolvation barriers for enhanced ultralow&#8208;temperature energy storage. Following this new paradigm, a weakly&#8208;dipolar&#8208;interacting electrolyte (WDIE) is developed by regulating dipole&#8211;dipole interactions within ionic solvates between primary and co&#8208;solvents. Through comprehensive experimental characterization and theoretical analyses, the interplay between dipole&#8211;dipole interactions and solvation dynamics across both interfacial and bulk phases is elucidated. Specifically, WDIE transforms the ionic solvate from conventional double&#8208;layer to distinctive mono&#8208;layer with attenuated solvent coordination number, effectively lowering solvent residence time and desolvation energy barriers. Simultaneously, it promotes solvent cluster dissociation, disrupting cross&#8208;linked electrolyte networks and enhancing bulk ion diffusion. As a proof of concept, WDIE&#8208;based supercapacitors exhibit optimized ultralow temperature performance, which retain 97.15% capacity from 20 to &#8722;70 &#176;C, surpassing moderately&#8208; and strongly&#8208;dipolar&#8208;interacting electrolytes and ranking among the best reported. Moreover, theoretical calculations further demonstrate the broad applicability of this strategy when ionic radius exceeds 3.84 &#197;. This work demonstrates a scalable dipole&#8208;engineered electrolyte paradigm to overcome low&#8208;temperature EES limitations.

         <title>A Real&#8208;Time Solar UVA Dose Monitor Based on Recyclable Azobenzene&#8208;Containing Elastomer Fabrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the self&#8208;synthesized main&#8208;chain azobenzene thermoplastic polyurethane (Az&#8208;TPU), a real&#8208;time solar UV dose monitoring device is developed. This device exhibits high performance, recyclability, and strain&#8208;insensitivity, enabling the conversion of solar UVA signals into real&#8208;time signals transmitted via a smartphone application, demonstrating promising potential for broad practical applications.








Abstract
Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a primary cause of skin cancer and erythema, poses irreversible risks to human health, underscoring the urgent need for advanced solar UV detector. Herein, we present a novel intrinsically flexible UVA detector featuring real&#8208;time monitoring, high performance and recyclability. This breakthrough is achieved through engineered oriented composite fabrics combining main&#8208;chain azobenzene&#8208;thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers (Az&#8208;TPU) with piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)] nanogenerators. The molecular architecture employs azobenzene groups and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) as hard segment, while polytetramethylene ether glycol (PTMG) forms the soft segment. The physical cross&#8208;linking network and homogeneous microphase&#8208;separated structure enables the fabrics to generate substantial internal stress, resulting in superior photoelectrical conversion capabilities. The device we report achieves an 80 ms response time and maintains excellent linear correlation (R2 = 0.997) across a broad light intensity range (0.05&#8211;50 mW&#183;cm&#8722;2). Remarkably, the fabric achieves dynamic UV light monitoring when subjected to a tensile strain of 10%. Integrated with Bluetooth communication, the device enables real&#8208;time data transmission to mobile devices for continuous UVA intensity and dose monitoring throughout daily sunlight exposure. With demonstrated capability for solar UVA measurement, this technology presents significant industrial potential for wearable solar UV monitoring systems.

         <title>Naphthalene&#8208; and Perylene&#8208;Diimide&#8208;Based Chiral Supramolecular Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically outlines recent advances in designing chiral supramolecular architectures based on naphthalene diimide and perylene diimide (PDI). It categorizes structures (macrocycles, cages, aggregates, crystalline frameworks) and details chirality sources (covalent chiral modification, intrinsic PDI core distortion, exogenous induction). Key applications in circularly polarized luminescence, optoelectronic detectors, and asymmetric catalysis are highlighted.








Abstract
Chiral supramolecular architectures based on naphthalene diimide (NDI) and perylene diimide (PDI) possess significant potential for chiroptical applications due to their physical properties, including large molar extinction coefficient, high fluorescence quantum yield, reversible redox activity, and robust photochemical/thermal stability. The chirality of NDI/PDI&#8208;based supramolecular architectures primarily originates from three sources: i) covalent modification of NDI/PDI with chiral substituents, ii) intrinsic axial chirality through distortion of the PDI conjugated plane, and iii) supramolecular asymmetric assembly of achiral NDI/PDI induced by exogenous chiral environments. This review systematically outlines recent advancements in the design principles of NDI/PDI&#8208;based chiral supramolecular architectures, including macrocycles, cages, aggregates, and crystalline frameworks, with an emphasis on the structure&#8211;activity relationship for chirality induction, transmission, and amplification. Advancements for their functional applications in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), optoelectronic detectors, and asymmetric catalysis are also listed. Despite such progress, challenges persist in expanding the diversity of chiral NDI/PDI motifs, regulating the weak interactions for chiral supramolecular structures, elucidating chirality transfer and amplification mechanisms, and realizing diverse chiral applications. This review provides a comprehensive guide for the rational design of NDI/PDI&#8208;based chiral supramolecular architectures, facilitating their full exploitation in next&#8208;generation chiral technologies, like CPL light&#8208;emitting diode and chiral biomedicine.

         <title>General Prelithiation Approaches and the Corresponding Full Cell Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prelithiation boosts the electrochemical performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries by compensating for lithium loss. This review integrates the synergistic effects of prelithiation of each component in full cells. Additionally, the kinetic challenges of prelithiation in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries are summarized. Finally, the prelithiation strategy is extended to other premetallation designs, providing guidance for the establishment of high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;safety energy storage systems.








Abstract
Prelithiation technology is widely regarded as an effective strategy to enhance the energy density and extend the cycle life of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The principle of prelithiation is to introduce additional active Li+, thereby compensating for Li losses during initial charging and long&#8208;term cycling. However, the current summaries of various prelithiation approaches are predominantly focused on liquid LIBs, with limited reviews available on solid&#8208;state LIBs. Compared to liquid LIBs, solid&#8208;state LIBs not only face uniformity issues caused by the uneven mixing of active materials and Li sources during prelithiation, but also encounter severe kinetic challenges arising from rigid solid&#8211;solid interface contact. Here, various prelithiation techniques are first integrated and the dynamic correlation between the prelithiation of each component in a full cell and its electrochemical performance is systematically introduced. Furthermore, the challenges of prelithiation techniques in solid&#8208;state LIBs in terms of solid&#8211;solid interface and Li+ transport are discussed. Finally, these prelithiation technologies are expected to be extended to the design of other premetallation agents, which guide the development of high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;safety energy storage systems.

However, the current summaries of various prelithiation approaches are predominantly focused on liquid LIBs, with limited reviews available on solid-state LIBs. Compared to liquid LIBs, solid-state LIBs not only face uniformity issues caused by the uneven mixing of active materials and Li sources during prelithiation, but also encounter severe kinetic challenges arising from rigid solid&#8211;solid interface contact. Here, various prelithiation techniques are first integrated and the dynamic correlation between the prelithiation of each component in a full cell and its electrochemical performance is systematically introduced. Furthermore, the challenges of prelithiation techniques in solid-state LIBs in terms of solid&#8211;solid interface and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport are discussed. Finally, these prelithiation technologies are expected to be extended to the design of other premetallation agents, which guide the development of high-energy and high-safety energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Covalent Tridentate Molecule Anchoring Enhances Nickel Oxide for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiOx suffers from high surface defects and an energy level mismatch with perovskite. Conventional organic modifiers, limited by weak binding, fail to deliver effective surface passivation and energy level regulation. We design [4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]triethoxysilane (3F&#8208;PTES), forming strong tridentate bonds with NiOx to reduce surface defects, while its terminal dipole group optimizes energy alignment, enabling efficient p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Nickel oxide (NiOx) is a promising hole transport material for perovskite solar cells, but its high surface defect density and energy level mismatch with perovskite limit&#160;device efficiency. Conventional organic surface modifiers, relying on weak hydrogen bonds or single covalent bonds, fail to anchor stably to NiOx, hindering their functional effectiveness. Here, A multidentate anchoring organic molecule, [4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]triethoxysilane (3F&#8208;PTES), is presented, forming robust tridentate covalent bonds with the NiOx surface and significantly enhances interfacial binding strength and surface coverage compared with conventional groups (e.g., carboxyl). As a result, the interfacial defect density is reduced by 2.5&#8208;fold compared with carboxyl&#8208;modified counterparts and significantly suppresses the deprotonation reaction between NiOx and perovskite, thereby greatly improving interfacial contact. The designed trifluoromethyl terminal group further enables precise tuning of NiOx energy levels, achieving near&#8208;ideal band alignment with perovskite (energy offset &#916;E = 0.01&#160;eV). Incorporating this modified NiOx into inverted devices, a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.47% is achieved, along with outstanding operational stability, retaining 97% of their initial efficiency after 1500 h&#160;of continuous operation under maximum power point tracking (65&#160;&#176;C, 60% relative humidity, AM 1.5G illumination, ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 protocol).

         <title>Closed&#8208;Pore Engineering in Double&#8208;Layer Textiles for Adaptive Thermal and Moisture Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Foam&#8208;TEX textile is developed through an integrated back&#8208;weft weaving and in situ foaming process, creating an interlocking double&#8208;layer textile with a closed&#8208;pore microstructure. This material has low thermal conductivity (0.039 W/(m&#8901;K)), excellent water resistance and moisture transport (one&#8208;way transport index: 1082%; WVT &gt; 4000 g/(m2&#183;24h)), and maintains stable under extreme temperatures (&#8211;196 to 100&#160;&#176;C), deformation, and washing.








Abstract
Protective textiles face a critical challenge in cold and moisture&#8208;rich environments, in which conventional layered clothing systems and multi&#8208;layer functional textiles often sacrifice breathability and comfort to enhance insulation, or conversely, lose body heat with moisture accumulation. Here, back&#8208;weft weaving technology is combined with an in situ foaming process to produce an interlocking double&#8208;layer textile (Foam&#8208;TEX) featuring abundant closed&#8208;pore microspheres on the foamed fibers and gradient pores throughout the textile. The closed&#8208;pore structural engineering spatially couples the closed&#8208;pore insulation unit with the gradient vapor transmission channel to ensure thermal comfort in cold environments, while effectively preventing heat loss caused by the degradation of insulation performance due to sweat in extremely cold working conditions. As a result, the closed&#8208;pore microstructure provides a low thermal conductivity of 0.039 W/(m&#183;K). Meanwhile, the gradient pores create Laplace pressure difference during water diffusion, driving unidirectional moisture transport and achieving excellent one&#8208;way transport index (1082%) and moisture permeability (&gt;4000 g/(m2&#183;24h)). Foam&#8208;TEX also demonstrates excellent stability under alternating extreme temperature conditions (&#8211;196 to 100&#160;&#176;C), washing, and wringing. This approach provides a flexible and scalable platform to extend the capabilities of Foam&#8208;TEX (e.g., Joule heating) to accommodate a variety of extreme wearing scenarios.

         <title>Solar Trap&#8208;Adsorption Photocathode for Highly Stable 2.4&#160;V Dual&#8208;Ion Solid&#8208;State Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel organic||I2 battery system with a photo&#8208;assisted mechanism is developed. This design offers accelerated iodine conversion kinetics, enhanced utilization of iodine ions, avoided polyiodide's shuttle, and four&#8208;electron reaction mechanism for iodine species conversion. Leveraging the above merits, the photo&#8208;assisted PTCDI||I2 battery delivers a high energy density of 0.66&#160;mWh&#160;cm&#8722;2 alongside remarkable long&#8208;term cycling durability and excellent bending capability.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous iodine&#8208;based electrochemical energy storage systems offer a cost&#8208;effective alternative to conventional alkali metal batteries for grid&#8208;scale applications. However, their practical deployment is hindered by sluggish iodine redox kinetics and the shuttle of polyiodides, which severely limit their lifespan. To address these challenges, a novel solid&#8208;state organic||I2 battery leveraging a Co3O4&#8208;TiO2 heterojunction photocathode is developed. By integrating a photo&#8208;assisted mechanism with an innovative device architecture, the system achieves accelerated iodine conversion kinetics, enhances iodide ion utilization, and enables a four&#8208;electron redox pathway. Theoretical calculation combined with electrochemical analysis reveals that the photo&#8208;assisted mechanism promotes electrostatic adsorption of polyiodides, accelerates interfacial charge transfer, and significantly improves iodine redox kinetics. As a result, the organic||I2 battery delivers a high specific capacity of 1.36&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, a discharge voltage of 2.4&#160;V, and excellent cycle stability over 1000 cycles, retaining 80.9% of its capacity at a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. This photo&#8208;enhanced battery exhibits strong competitiveness compared to previously reported iodine&#8208;based batteries. The remarkable performance of this photo&#8208;assisted prototype offers a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective solution for next&#8208;generation energy storage.

         <title>Sustained Continuous&#8208;Wave Lasing in Quantum Dot Microfluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustained continuous&#8208;wave lasing in colloidal quantum dots is achieved by leveraging a novel microfluidic dot&#8208;in&#8208;matrix strategy. The novel QD microfluidic platform enables the first demonstration of 6 excitons per QD under cw excitation and hence simultaneous two&#8208;band cw stimulated emission from both the 1S and 1P states. These results open the first&#8208;ever cw QD laser device relevant for practical applications.








Abstract
Sustained amplified stimulated emission (ASE) under continuous&#8208;wave (cw) excitation is a prerequisite for any new gain material being developed for lasing applications. Despite the great success achieved in colloidal quantum dot (QD) lasers, the cw light amplification is hampered by the high pump threshold and thermal effects of QD solids. Herein, the first&#8208;ever cw ASE and lasing from QDs relevant for practical implementations are realized by adopting the microfluidic dot&#8208;in&#8208;matrix design. Leveraging on the transient and steady&#8208;state gain spectroscopy, it is demonstrated that the high&#8208;concentration dispersed QDs with a gain feature customized for cw pumping render the low pump threshold (&#8776;340 W&#160;cm&#8722;2). Meanwhile, the QD micro&#8208;liquids effectively dissipate the heat arising from the nonradiative multi&#8208;carrier recombination. As such, the unprecedented two&#8208;band cw ASE and long&#8208;lasting cw lasing with coherent output beam are realized. The findings open the door to practical QD lasers and may unlock new possibilities in optofluidics and optoelectronics.

         <title>p&#8208;Block Metal&#8208;Based Catalysts: Hidden Gems for Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in p&#8208;block metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for H2O2 synthesis, covering catalyst design, performance optimization, and comparison to noble and transition metals, outlining reaction mechanisms by a synthesis of DFT calculations reported in the literature. Considering the merits and limitations of different metals, it outlines key challenges, actionable strategies, and future prospects for the field.








Abstract
Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) offers a sustainable alternative for the traditional anthraquinone method. p&#8208;block metals exhibit unique electronic structures and tunable surface properties, showing great potential in 2e&#8722; ORR. However, a systematic review focusing on recent progress in p&#8208;block metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for H2O2 synthesis is lacking. To fill the gap, this work first shows a marked increase in p&#8208;block metal research over the past decade by bibliometric analysis of over 300 publications. Research on 2e&#8722; ORR has surged since 2019, while research on 2e&#8210; water oxidation reaction (WOR) has declined. Strategies for the synthesis and optimization of various p&#8208;block metal&#8208;based catalysts are discussed in detail. Based on a synthesis of DFT calculations in the literature, the reaction mechanisms of p&#8208;block metal catalysis proceeding are summarized via a 2e&#8722; pathway. Finally, considering the merits and limitations of different metals, this review outlines the primary challenges and future directions in this area, emphasizing the importance of improving catalyst stability, deepening mechanistic understanding, and developing cost&#8208;effective synthesis methods. It also offers novel perspectives on the engineering of p&#8208;block metal&#8208;based catalysts and promotes the development of sustainable H2O2 electrosynthesis technologies.

         <title>Inverted Device Engineering for Efficient and Bright Quantum Rod LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Equivalent circuit model and micro&#8208;surface analysis prove that horizontally aligned rod&#8208;in&#8208;rod quantum rods films (82% in&#8208;plane dipoles) enable high outcoupling yet suffer from carrier leakage within the conventional device structure. An inverted device structure suppresses carrier leakage and achieves 31% and 20.2 % EQE in red and green QR&#8208;LEDs, respectively, unlocking the potential of anisotropic nanocrystals.








Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QD&#8208;LEDs) have approached the theoretical limit of external quantum efficiency (EQE) determined by outcoupling efficiency. To achieve further improvements, novel optical designs must be explored, such as constructing optical microcavities, utilizing light scattering, or tuning the orientation of transition dipole moments (TDM). This study reports advances in red rod&#8208;in&#8208;rod quantum rods (QRs) film that exhibits a high in&#8208;plane dipole orientation of 82%, achieved through shape&#8208;induced horizontal self&#8208;alignment. Also a critical issue is discovered: the carrier leakage through irregular quantum rod films, which hinders the EQE of quantum rod light&#8208;emitting diodes (QR&#8208;LEDs) and limits its competitiveness with QD&#8208;LEDs. An equivalent circuit model comprising two diodes clearly illustrates the impacts of the leakage current within conventional QR&#8208;LED structures. By transforming the QR&#8208;LEDs device structure, balanced carrier injection and suppressed leakage current are simultaneously enhanced, achieving a red QR&#8208;LEDs with a peak EQE of 31% and a peak brightness of 110&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. Additionally, these strategies are applied to green dot&#8208;in&#8208;rod QRs, demonstrating a peak EQE of 20.2% with ultra&#8208;high luminance of 250&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. This work is expected to pave the way for further improvements in the LED performance based on anisotropic nanocrystals.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first electrically&#8208;driven 2D semiconductor microcavity laser is achieved at room temperature under AC voltage driving conditions.

Abstract
2D monolayered transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are promising materials for realizing ultracompact, low&#8208;threshold semiconductor lasers. And the development of the electrical&#8208;driven TMDC devices is crucial for enhancing the integration potential of practical optoelectronic systems. However, at the current stage, the electrically&#8208;driven 2&#8208;D TMDC laser has never been realized. Herein, the first electrically&#8208;driven 2&#8208;D TMDC microcavity laser have been developed. In this device, an alternating current (AC) generates electroluminescence lasing in suspended monolayered WSe2 integrated on a microdisk cavity. The input&#8211;output curve, bandwidth narrowing, and second&#8208;order coherence is analyzed to confirm the lasing characteristics at room temperature. The realization of the room&#8208;temperature AC&#8208;driven 2&#8208;D TMDC laser establishes a new area of research on electrically pumped compact lasers and is likely to assist with the implementation of diverse TMDC&#8208;based practical photonic devices in the future.

         <title>Two&#8208;Stage Bipolaron Formation in Molecularly Doped Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates bipolaron formation in 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ)&#8208;doped conjugated polymer P(g32T&#8208;T) films with glycol sidechains at two stages of both low and high doping levels. At the early stage, bipolarons mainly form from double doping, enhancing structural ordering, and carrier transport. In contrast, late&#8208;stage bipolarons, mostly generated by polaron combination, exhibit adverse effects on those properties.








Abstract
The formation and dynamics of bipolarons are crucial in determining the electrical properties of molecularly doped conjugated polymers. Traditionally, bipolarons are known to form at very high doping levels through the combination of two adjacent polarons, a process that is generally accompanied by structural disorder and impaired carrier transport. Here, it is demonstrated that bipolaron formation can occur at both the early stage with low doping levels and the late stage with high doping levels in 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) dip&#8208;doped conjugated polymer films with glycol sidechains. Bipolaron formation at the early stage is discovered to be mainly associated with double doping, which is uncommon in conventional doped polymer systems. In contrast, bipolaron formation at the late stage is dominated by combining two polarons. Furthermore, these bipolarons are observed to behave differently: early&#8208;stage bipolarons generated through double doping enhance both the molecular ordering and carrier transport, whereas late&#8208;stage bipolarons resulting from polaron combination occur alongside detrimental effects in structural and transport properties. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of bipolaron formation across different doping levels and underscore the potential for optimizing doping strategies. A deeper understanding of bipolarons can guide the design of next&#8208;generation molecularly doped conjugated polymers with improved performance.

         <title>Reversing the Reaction Order Between FA+ and Rb+ Enhances the Photovoltaic Performance of Blade&#8208;Coated Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
5&#8208;hydroperoxy&#8208;1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidinone (HMP) retards Rb+ reaction with the Pb&#8208;I framework, enabling Rb&#8314; occupation at the A&#8208;site cation position. This allows Rb&#8314; to alloy with formamidinium (FA), stabilizing the perovskite lattice and reducing strain. HMP boosts perovskite photovoltaic cell efficiency to a record 25.8% and enhances harsh&#8208;environment stability, offering a novel approach to regulate crystallization kinetics. 








Abstract
Manipulating the kinetics of the reaction between A&#8208;site cations and Pb&#8208;I frameworks holds paramount importance for achieving high&#8208;quality, phase&#8208;homogeneous FA&#8208;dominant perovskites. It has been observed that when rubidium (Rb) serves as an A&#8208;site cation dopant, it tends to accumulate in the bulk region of the perovskite structure due to its pronounced affinity for Pb&#8208;I frameworks compared to FA+. Consequently, Rb+ ions struggle to alleviate the exaggerated tensile strain induced by the bulky FA cations on the perovskite surface. To mitigate this challenge, 5&#8208;hydroperoxy&#8208;1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidinone (HMP) is introduced as an additive to invert the sequence between FA+ and Rb+ in reaction with the Pb&#8208;I frameworks. The introduction of HMP effectively stabilizes Rb+ cations within the perovskite lattice, leading to a surface enriched with Rb that exhibits diminished lattice strain and defects. Finally, a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.8% for 0.09 cm2 perovskite solar cells and 19.8% for 52 cm2 mini&#8208;module is achieved, which are fabricated via blade coating under ambient conditions with a relative humidity of &#8804;55%. Notably, these cells exhibit minimal hysteresis and demonstrate significantly enhanced resilience against illumination, dampness, and heat.

&lt;p&gt;5-hydroperoxy-1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (HMP) retards Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reaction with the Pb-I framework, enabling Rb&#8314; occupation at the A-site cation position. This allows Rb&#8314; to alloy with formamidinium (FA), stabilizing the perovskite lattice and reducing strain. HMP boosts perovskite photovoltaic cell efficiency to a record 25.8% and enhances harsh-environment stability, offering a novel approach to regulate crystallization kinetics. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manipulating the kinetics of the reaction between A-site cations and Pb-I frameworks holds paramount importance for achieving high-quality, phase-homogeneous FA-dominant perovskites. It has been observed that when rubidium (Rb) serves as an A-site cation dopant, it tends to accumulate in the bulk region of the perovskite structure due to its pronounced affinity for Pb-I frameworks compared to FA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Consequently, Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions struggle to alleviate the exaggerated tensile strain induced by the bulky FA cations on the perovskite surface. To mitigate this challenge, 5-hydroperoxy-1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (HMP) is introduced as an additive to invert the sequence between FA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in reaction with the Pb-I frameworks. The introduction of HMP effectively stabilizes Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations within the perovskite lattice, leading to a surface enriched with Rb that exhibits diminished lattice strain and defects. Finally, a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.8% for 0.09 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; perovskite solar cells and 19.8% for 52 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; mini-module is achieved, which are fabricated via blade coating under ambient conditions with a relative humidity of &#8804;55%.

         <title>Permeable, Wet&#8208;Adhesive, and EMI&#8208;Resistant Liquid Metal Electronic Skin for High&#8208;Fidelity Electrophysiological Monitoring in Sweaty and Electromagnetic Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A breathable, wet&#8208;adhesive, and EMI&#8208;resistant textile&#8208;based e&#8208;skin is developed to enable stable, high&#8208;fidelity electrophysiological monitoring under humid and high&#8208;interference conditions. By integrating oxidation&#8208;resistant liquid metal inks, a conductive sandwich textile structure, and a permeable adhesive layer, the e&#8208;skin offers a promising solution to the adhesion&#8211;breathability trade&#8208;off in next&#8208;generation wearable bioelectronics.








Abstract
Textile&#8208;based e&#8208;skins possess outstanding permeability, flexibility, and biocompatibility, making them ideal for wearable health monitoring and human&#8211;machine interfaces. However, the intrinsic trade&#8208;off between breathability and adhesiveness poses a major challenge to maintaining a stable and comfortable skin&#8211;electrode interface. This often results in elevated interfacial impedance, signal artifacts, and reduced signal fidelity under extreme conditions. Herein, a breathable, wet&#8208;adhesive, and electromagnetic interference (EMI)&#8208;resistant textile&#8208;based e&#8208;skin is engineered for stable and high&#8208;fidelity electrophysiological monitoring, particularly in sweaty and strong electromagnetic environments. Liquid metal particles (LMPs) are encapsulated within polysaccharide molecules to prevent surface oxidation and enhance printability. The conductive ink is directly patterned onto a sandwich&#8208;structured textile substrate, which integrates a wet&#8208;adhesive yet permeable fibrous layer, and an EMI&#8208;shielding interlayer coated with silver nanoparticles. The resulting e&#8208;skin demonstrates excellent permeability (1439.1&#160;&#177;&#160;13.3&#160;g&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;day&#8722;1), strong wet adhesion (2.1&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;2), and robust EMI shielding effectiveness (&gt;50&#160;dB in the X&#8208;band), these advantages collectively empower comfortable, stable, and high&#8208;fidelity acquisition of various electrophysiological signals including electrocardiography (ECG), electroencephalography (EEG), visual evoked potentials (VEP), and electrooculography (EOG), even in humid and EMI conditions. This functional synergy represents a key innovation that enhances long&#8208;term stability and fidelity in complex, real&#8208;world bio&#8208;monitoring scenarios.

         <title>Opto&#8208;Ion&#8208;Exchange Enabled Active Swarming System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;regulated swarm intelligence system is developed through the integration of ionic communication and photochemical regulation, successfully replicating predator&#8208;prey ecological dynamics. This platform demonstrates spatiotemporally programmable collective behaviors through light modulation, including enhanced motility, reversible aggregation, repulsion, and distinct reactive states. This intelligent swarm design paradigm opens new avenues for smart collective robotics and applications in environmental remediation and beyond.








Abstract
Swarming behavior often enables systems to achieve intelligent responses that surpass the capabilities of individual components, allowing for complex tasks to be accomplished. Despite significant advances in active swarm research, achieving precise control over swarm responsiveness remains a challenge. In this study, a light&#8208;controlled chemical communication&#8208;mediated swarming system through integrating the ion&#8208;exchange and light decomposition reactions to emulate predator&#8208;prey interactions is designed. In this system, ion exchange resin particles (acting as &#8220;predators&#8221;) actively approach and aggregate silver phosphate (Ag3PO4) nanoparticles (acting as &#8220;prey&#8221;), which in turn exhibit light&#8208;triggered escape responses driven by photodecomposition&#8208;induced ionic gradients. These swarms exhibit a range of novel, light&#8208;modulated dynamic behaviors, including enhanced motility, reversible aggregation, repulsion, and distinct reactive states. These behaviors provide valuable insights into active swarm dynamics. Furthermore, the synergistic effects of the collective swarming, active interactions, and light&#8208;induced Ag&#8314; production establish a robust antibacterial platform capable of rapid and efficient bacterial eradication. This intelligent swarm design presents new possibilities for the development of multifunctional, responsive swarms, offering valuable applications in environmental treatment and beyond.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biphasic Ni&#8208;MXene quantum&#8208;confined nanostructure (Ni&#8208;MJQD) serves as a Janus platform, simultaneously achieving high&#8208;performance energy storage and efficient catalytic oxidation. The unique architecture enables superior energy storage performance and selective benzyl alcohol oxidation&#8208;symbolizing &#8220;one stone, two birds&#8221; for sustainable energy and catalysis.








Abstract
The demand for sustainable energy storage and ecofriendly catalysts has intensified the search for advanced multifunctional materials. Herein, this work presents the synthesis and characterization of Janus Ni&#8208;MXene quantum dot (Ni&#8208;MJQD), a novel material architecture that exhibits high performance in supercapacitor and catalytic applications. A Ni&#8208;MJQD cathode delivers an impressive gravimetric specific capacity of 168.75 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 A g&#8722;1, and its Janus structure optimizes the balance between capacity and ion diffusion. In an asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor (AHSC) with a porous activated carbon (PAC) anode, it achieves an energy density of 54.22&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, a power density of 1599&#160;W kg&#8722;1, and 88% capacity retention over 20&#160;000 cycles. As a catalyst, the Ni&#8208;MJQD also exhibits high activity in benzyl alcohol oxidation, reaching 95% conversion and 98.4% selectivity for benzaldehyde, with the largest turnover frequency of 8.8825 &#215; 10&#8722;3 moles g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 using peroxymonosulfate (PMS) as an oxidant. Mechanistic analysis reveals contributions from both radical and nonradical pathways. These findings emphasize the unique potential of the Ni&#8208;MJQD electrodes for sustainable energy storage and green synthesis applications.

         <title>Microneedle Delivery of Small Extracellular Vesicles From Young Blood to Treat Endothelial Senescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microneedle patch loaded with extracellular vesicles derived from umbilical cord plasma (young plasma, Y&#8208;sEVs) is developed to treat endothelial senescence and aging&#8208;related vascular diseases. Among the microRNA cargos of Y&#8208;sEVs, miR&#8208;26a&#8208;5p suppresses the expression of Pak2 and NF&#8208;&#954;B, thereby reducing inflammatory cell infiltration across the endothelium and alleviating cellular senescence.








Abstract
Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a crucial role in mediating communication between different cell populations and organs, significantly influencing inflammation and vascular diseases. To evaluate the role of EVs in regulating senescence, small EVs isolated from umbilical cord plasma (young sEVs, Y&#8208;sEVs) are compared with those from the plasma of elderly individuals (old sEVs, O&#8208;sEVs, &gt;70 years old) to identify key cargo components. To investigate their effects on senescence, Y&#8208;sEVs or O&#8208;sEVs are administered to aged mice using transdermal microneedle patches, enabling sustained EV release into the circulation. Doxorubicin is administered to induce enhanced endothelial senescence in aged mice (22&#8211;24 months old). Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing revealed that Y&#8208;sEV treatment downregulated senescence&#8208;related genes in endothelial cells decreased the proportion of activated fibroblasts in the heart, and reduced disease&#8208;associated microglia in the brain. Delivery of Y&#8208;sEVs via microneedle patches preserved endothelial cell function, and mitigated inflammation and senescence, whereas O&#8208;sEVs exacerbated endothelial dysfunction.

To investigate their effects on senescence, Y-sEVs or O-sEVs are administered to aged mice using transdermal microneedle patches, enabling sustained EV release into the circulation. Doxorubicin is administered to induce enhanced endothelial senescence in aged mice (22&#8211;24 months old). Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that Y-sEV treatment downregulated senescence-related genes in endothelial cells decreased the proportion of activated fibroblasts in the heart, and reduced disease-associated microglia in the brain. Delivery of Y-sEVs via microneedle patches preserved endothelial cell function, and mitigated inflammation and senescence, whereas O-sEVs exacerbated endothelial dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Harvesting Nanomaterials Based on Dyes for Energy Transfer and Amplified Biosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light harvesting (LH) in plants inspires researchers to develop artificial LH nanomaterials. Here, LH nanomaterials based on organic dyes are reviewed, considering fundamental challenges on aggregation&#8208;caused quenching, excitation energy transfer, and exciton migration length. The efficient energy transfer from LH nanomaterial to an acceptor leads to signal amplification (antenna effect) important for sensing.








Abstract
Fascinating process of light harvesting (LH) in plants and bacteria leads to photosynthesis of oxygen and organic matter on the planet. It inspires researchers in the last decades to develop synthetic analogues &#8211; artificial LH nanomaterials. Here, LH nanomaterials based on dyes (organic chromophores) are reviewed. The fundamental aspects of LH include dye assembly into materials with minimal energy losses (i.e., high fluorescence quantum yield with minimized aggregation&#8208;caused quenching) and fast excitation energy transfer with large exciton migration length. The efficient energy transfer from LH nanomaterial to an acceptor leads to an amplification of acceptor emission &#8211; antenna effect, which constitutes the key performance parameter of LH nanoantenna. Individual classes of dye&#8208;based LH nanomaterials are analyzed: covalent molecular arrays of dyes (e.g., dendrimers and macrocycles), aggregates of &#8220;classical&#8221; dyes, aggregation&#8208;induced emission nanomaterials, metal&#8208;organic frameworks, ion&#8208;associated nanomaterials, and hybrid dye&#8208;based organic systems, such as dye&#8208;biomolecule hybrids, micelles and supramolecular polymers, dye&#8208;loaded silica and polymeric nanoparticles. The design principles and key performance characteristics of their selected (non&#8208;exhaustive) examples are analyzed. Due to their capacity to amplify the acceptor fluorescence signal, LH nanomaterials are particularly suitable for amplified sensing of small molecules, ions, biomolecules, which is particularly attractive for biomedical applications.

         <title>High Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells via Heteroatom&#8208;Containing Multifunctional Spiro Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel SAM is designed by introducing heteroatoms into a spiro structure, named Spiro&#8208;S, which achieves four functions: 1) the spiro structure suppresses molecular aggregation to ensure uniform substrate coverage; 2) the incorporated heteroatoms passivate buried interface defects; 3) enhancing perovskite crystallization; 4) suitable energy level. The resulting Spiro&#8208;S&#8208;based device demonstrates an exceptional PCE of 25.75% with improved stability.








Abstract
In inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the arrangement of self&#8208;assembled hole&#8208;transporting monolayers (SAMs) on substrates and their interaction with perovskite layer are critical for device efficiency and stability. Herein, two spiro SAMs are developed by introducing O and S atoms into the structure, named Spiro&#8208;O and Spiro&#8208;S, respectively. On one hand, the unique orthogonal molecular configuration of the spiro structure weakens intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, thereby inhibiting molecular aggregation. This ensures uniform coverage on the substrate and a homogeneous surface potential distribution. On the other hand, the lone pair electrons of the introduced heteroatoms can interact with the Pb2+ ions, enhancing the quality of the perovskite film and effectively passivating the defects at the perovskite/SAM interface. The experimental and theoretical results show that the S in Spiro&#8208;S strongly interacts with perovskite, resulting in the formation of a more uniform and higher&#8208;quality crystalline perovskite layer. Compared to PSCs based on Spiro&#8208;O, the device with Spiro&#8208;S shows decreased defects at the buried interface, ultimately achieving an impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.75% (certified 25.19%). Furthermore, the PSCs based on Spiro&#8208;S also exhibit better long stability; the unencapsulated champion devices retain 92% of the initial efficiency after being stored at 25&#160;&#176;C for 1200 h.

         <title>Constructing Continuously&#8208;Distributed and Crystalline&#8208;NaF&#8208;Rich SEI on Hard Carbon Anode Through Binder Chemistry for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative, continuously crystalline NaF&#8208;rich SEI is engineered on hard carbon anodes through cost&#8208;effective binder manipulation. The anion&#8208;coordination preferred LA133's functional groups synergistically promoting anion decomposition kinetics to form crystalline NaF, and homogenous LA133 coverage guides continuous NaF growth. The optimized hard carbon anodes deliver excellent storage performances regarding initial Columbic efficiency, rate capability, cycling stability, and wide temperature adaptability.








Abstract
Constructing the continuously&#8208;distributed and crystalline&#8208;NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (CC&#8208;NaF&#8208;SEI) is expected to greatly promote the sodium storage performance of hard carbon (HC) anodes. However, such an impressive concept remains extremely intractable to achieve and lacks an efficiently cost&#8208;less strategy. Herein, the application of the commercially available LA133 binder is pioneered to engineer such a CC&#8208;NaF&#8208;SEI. Through comparative analysis of representative binders with distinct functional groups, reveals the critical role of binder chemistry on SEI regulation. Specifically, the LA133 binder demonstrates a dual&#8208;regulation mechanism for CC&#8208;NaF&#8208;SEI formation. The anion&#8208;coordination preferred &#9472;CN bonds induce an anion&#8208;enriched interfacial solvation structure, and the &#9472;CONH/&#9472;CN groups catalytically cleave P&#9472;F bond dissociation in PF6&#8722;, synergistically promoting anion decomposition kinetics to form crystalline NaF. Furthermore, robust hydrogen bonds between multiple polar groups in LA133 and HC surface create the spatially anion&#8208;confined microenvironments to guide orderly anion decomposition and facilitate continuous NaF growth into a mechanically integrated SEI. The optimized CC&#8208;NaF&#8208;SEI endows HC anodes with exceptional sodium storage performance: an ultrahigh initial Coulombic efficiency (95.9%), remarkable reversible capacity (356.6 mAh g&#8722;1), and stable cycling under extreme conditions (&#8722;20&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C). This work provides fundamental insights into binder&#8208;SEI correlations, establishing a novel paradigm for interfacial optimization in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A 2D&#8208;3D Perovskite Memristor&#8208;Based Light&#8208;Induced Sensitized Neuron for Visual Information Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a 2D passivated 2D&#8208;3D OHPs memristor and explores its electronic and optical properties in detail. A neural spike circuit is designed to emulate light&#8208;induced sensitized neurons. Leveraging its frequency conversion excitation characteristics and wavelength selectivity, the visual image color filtering processing and the improved sensitized spiking neural network for computer image recognition are successfully achieved.








Abstract
Implementing Leaky Integrate&#8208;and&#8208;Fire (LIF) neurons in hardware is poised to enable the creation of efficient, low&#8208;power spiking neural networks (SNNs). This is attributed to the ability of LIF neurons to mimic the rapid response and sensitivity of biological neurons, thereby reducing unnecessary computational resources. The fixed firing frequency of conventional LIF neurons limits their adaptability to complex, dynamic environments. Existing variable&#8208;frequency LIF neurons often require additional circuitry, which increases system complexity. In this study, a 2D&#8208;3D organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OHPs) memristor is presented, incorporating 2D passivation of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) with phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI). The introduction of the 2D layer increases the migration energy barrier and restricts the diffusion of ions, thus enabling the modulation of the current decay and light responsivity. By leveraging the tunable decay and wavelength selectivity of the memristor, a light&#8208;induced sensitized neuron (LISN) with an enhanced firing frequency is developed using a fundamental circuit design. Furthermore, LISN, which exhibits improved temporal processing and long&#8208;term dependency management, are integrated into sensitized spiking neural networks (SSNNs) to demonstrate their superior classification capabilities. This study underscores the potential of LISN&#8208;based neuromorphic systems in visual information processing and offers new insights for applications in complex scenarios.

         <title>Ion Valency as a Molecular Switch for Salt&#8208;Resistant Underwater Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monovalent K+ ions weaken adhesion by forming K+&#8208;&#960; complexes with weak bridging capacity. In contrast, multivalent cations like Y3+ enhance adhesion by forming stable &#960;&#8208;cation&#8208;&#960; bridging networks, which are resistant to salt and capable of compensating for the loss of native &#960;&#8211;&#960; and NH3+&#8208;&#960; interactions. Through these contrasting effects, K+ and Y3+ function as molecular switches that regulate adhesion in cation&#8208;&#960;&#8208;based adhesive systems.








Abstract
Achieving underwater adhesion remains challenging due to the disruption of interfacial interactions by hydration layers and the ionic environment. This study shows how high adhesion in a saline environment can be achieved in adhesive peptide systems relying on &#960;&#8211;&#960; and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions using multivalent ions. Monovalent ions (K+) disrupt native peptide&#8208;peptide interactions, drastically reducing adhesion strength. Conversely, multivalent ions (Mg2+ and Y3+) enable robust interfacial adhesion by forming stable &#960;&#8208;cation&#8208;&#960; networks, effectively compensating for disrupted native pairings. The adhesion enhancement by Y3+ is particularly pronounced, highlighting its unique capability for multidentate bridging. Molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanical analyses confirm that Y3+ ions stabilize extended interfacial interactions, enabling stronger stress dissipation during tensile deformation. Additionally, NMR spectroscopy supports these observations by demonstrating significant cation&#8208;dependent perturbations of aromatic (Phe) and cationic (Lys) peptide residues. A thermodynamic model further elucidates the competitive binding dynamics underpinning adhesion modulation and capturing all experimental trends. This work provides detailed molecular insights into ion valency effects on cation&#8208;&#960; mediated underwater adhesion, guiding the development of bio&#8208;inspired materials with tailored ionic responsiveness suitable for biomedical and technological applications in saline environments.

         <title>Interface Reinforced Tailoring of Quantum Dots Regulates Reaction Trajectory of CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interface&#8208;reinforced regulation strategy is proposed to tailor the activation mode of CO2 in water. The facilitation of directional electron transfer and the interface&#8208;reinforced charge difference of the catalytic site at the CdSe/S/InS QD interface greatly promotes the shift of reaction trajectory of CO2 photoreduction, i.e., the main HCOO&#8722; product for CdSe is transformed into CO for CdSe/S/InS QDs.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis using semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) is one of the most promising pathways toward converting CO2 into valuable chemicals. However, the multistep process of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion endows the regulation of reaction trajectory from CO2 to specific products very challenging in aqueous solution. Here, it is first disclosed that the anisotropic growth of CdSe&#8722;S&#8722;InS interface in ultrafine heterojunction QDs alters the trajectory of CO2 photoreduction in water, i.e., CdSe/S/InS QDs mainly produce CO while CdSe QDs generate HCOO&#8722;. Under optimal conditions, the CO turnover number of CdSe/S/InS QDs is &#8776;1000 (12 h; vs QDs) with a selectivity of &gt;96% in C&#8208;based products or &#8776;57.6% when considering H2. The formation of anisotropic CdSe/S/InS ultrafine heterojunction facilitates charge migration at the interface, which is confirmed by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transient absorption spectroscopy. Further DFT simulations and in situ experiments demonstrate that the interfacial lattice expansion reinforces the charge difference at the interface, thus contributing to the product shift from HCOOH to CO, which clarifies the mechanism of interface&#8208;reinforced tailoring of CO2 reaction trajectories. This work can not only provide guidance for interfacial CO2 activation mode in water but also inspire the design of novel artificial photocatalysts with new functions.

         <title>Low&#8208;Energy, Ultrafast Spin Reorientation at Competing Hybrid Interfaces with Tunable Operating Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin reorientation transition is generated at hybrid interfaces of Pt&#8208;Co&#8208;organic molecules in the vicinity of room temperature. This spin reorientation transition happens at an ultrafast scale and is controlled either through electrical current or fs laser pulse, introducing perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in formerly planar magnetised samples through heating.








Abstract
Information can be stored in magnetic materials by encoding with the direction of the magnetic moment. A figure of merit for these systems is the energy needed to rewrite&#160;the information by changing the magnetic moment. Organic molecules offer a playground to manipulate spin order, with metallo&#8208;molecular interfaces being a promising direction for sustainable devices. Here, a spin reorientation transition is demonstrated in molecular interfaces of 3d ferromagnetic films due to a competition between a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) induced by a heavy metal that dominates at high temperatures, and an in&#8208;plane anisotropy generated by molecular coupling at low temperatures. The transition can be tuned around room temperature by varying the ferromagnet thickness (1.4 &#8211; 1.9&#160;nm) or the choice of molecular overlayer, with the organic molecules being C60, hydrogen, and metal (Cu, Co) phthalocyanines. Near the transition temperature, the magnetisation easy axis can be switched with a small energy input, either electrically with a current density of 105&#8197;A&#8197;cm&#8722;2, or optically by a fs laser pulse of fluence as low as 0.12&#8197;mJ&#8197;cm&#8722;2, suggesting heat assisted technology applications. Magnetic dichroism measurements point toward a phase transition at the organic interface being responsible for the spin reorientation transition.

         <title>A Microalgae&#8208;Probiotic&#8208;Nanozyme Robot for Alleviating Intestinal Inflammation and Microbiota Dysbiosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orally administered micro&#8208;nano robot is developed by encapsulating Lactobacillus plantarum armed with AuCe nanozyme onto Spirulina platensis (SP@LP@AuCe) to improve gut retention, deliver antioxidant protection, and regulate microbiota composition. The SP@LP@AuCe reduces pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines, enhances probiotic viability, and restores gut microbiota balance, demonstrating superior efficacy over conventional probiotic or nanozyme therapies.








Abstract
Inflammatory bowel disease is chronic gastrointestinal disorder characterized by persistent intestinal inflammation, which can lead to severe complications such as impaired intestinal barrier function and dysbiosis. Conventional therapies have challenges such as oxidative stress and insufficient intestinal colonization that hinder the treatment efficacy. Therapeutic strategies based on micro&#8208;nano robotic delivery are promising to address the limitations of current treatments by enabling precise targeting, enhancing bioavailability, and improving therapeutic outcomes. Herein, an orally administered micro&#8208;nano robot is developed utilizing Spirulina platensis as a carrier for nanozyme&#8208;armed probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum (SP@LP@AuCe) to enhance the efficacy of oral probiotics and nanomedicine in treating intestinal diseases. SP@LP@AuCe exhibits strong fluorescence imaging capability due to its chlorophyll&#8208;rich content, allowing for non&#8208;invasive and real&#8208;time monitoring following oral administration. The helical structure of Spirulina platensis facilitates entrapment in intestinal villi that enhances intestinal retention. Importantly, SP@LP@AuCe scavenges reactive oxygen species and modulates inflammatory responses, thereby alleviating intestinal inflammation, improving bacterial viability, and restoring the balance of intestinal microbiota. This strategy integrates microalgae, probiotics, and nanozymes within a micro&#8208;nano robotic framework, presenting a promising approach to enhancing drug bioavailability and exerting potent anti&#8208;inflammatory effects in the treatment of intestinal diseases.

         <title>Volumetric 3D Printing and Melt&#8208;Electrowriting to Fabricate Implantable Reinforced Cardiac Tissue Patches</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an implantable reinforced cardiac patch (RCPatch) combining volumetrically 3D&#8208;printed metamaterials with melt&#8208;electrowritten (MEW) meshes. The design integrates tunable stiff polymer structures&#160;with soft, cell&#8208;laden hydrogels. The RCPatch withstands suturing, intraventricular pressure, and cardiac contraction in a large animal myocardial defect model. The patch prevents bleeding and enables partial hemodynamic restabilization, demonstrating its potential for myocardial repair.








Abstract
Cardiac patches to repair myocardial defects require mechanically stable materials that prevent bleeding and can be implanted via suturing. The current clinical standard, bovine pericardial patches (BPPs), serve this purpose but do not degrade or integrate with the myocardium, limiting their long&#8208;term effectiveness. Here, we present the reinforced cardiac tissue patch (RCPatch). This multimaterial patch comprises a stiffness&#8208;tuned, cardiomyocyte&#8208;infiltrated 3D metamaterial and a suturable, hydrogel&#8208;infiltrated mesh to reduce permeability and bleeding. Anisotropic metamaterials are designed and computationally optimized using a generative modeling approach and fabricated from poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) via volumetric 3D printing (VP). The metamaterial supports the infiltration of cardiomyocytes, which are viable and contract in vitro. The implantability and low blood permeability of the patch is enabled&#160;by adding a melt&#8208;electrowritten (MEW) mesh infiltrated with a fibrin hydrogel. In an acute large animal trial, the RCPatch was applied on an induced myocardial defect, where it withstood intraventricular blood pressure, prevented bleeding, and enabled hemodynamic restabilization (intraventricular pressure of 81 mmHg before, vs 66 mmHg after implantation). These findings establish a scalable framework for fabricating cardiac tissue patches that integrate mechanical reinforcement with biological function, offering a surgically implantable&#160;and future regenerative solution for intraventricular myocardial repair.

     alt="Volumetric 3D Printing and Melt-Electrowriting to Fabricate Implantable Reinforced Cardiac Tissue Patches"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study presents an implantable reinforced cardiac patch (RCPatch) combining volumetrically 3D-printed metamaterials with melt-electrowritten (MEW) meshes. The design integrates tunable stiff polymer structures&#160;with soft, cell-laden hydrogels. The RCPatch withstands suturing, intraventricular pressure, and cardiac contraction in a large animal myocardial defect model. The patch prevents bleeding and enables partial hemodynamic restabilization, demonstrating its potential for myocardial repair.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardiac patches to repair myocardial defects require mechanically stable materials that prevent bleeding and can be implanted via suturing. The current clinical standard, bovine pericardial patches (BPPs), serve this purpose but do not degrade or integrate with the myocardium, limiting their long-term effectiveness. Here, we present the reinforced cardiac tissue patch (RCPatch). This multimaterial patch comprises a stiffness-tuned, cardiomyocyte-infiltrated 3D metamaterial and a suturable, hydrogel-infiltrated mesh to reduce permeability and bleeding. Anisotropic metamaterials are designed and computationally optimized using a generative modeling approach and fabricated from poly(&#949;-caprolactone) (PCL) via volumetric 3D printing (VP). The metamaterial supports the infiltration of cardiomyocytes, which are viable and contract in vitro. The implantability and low blood permeability of the patch is enabled&#160;by adding a melt-electrowritten (MEW) mesh infiltrated with a fibrin hydrogel. In an acute large animal trial, the RCPatch was applied on an induced myocardial defect, where it withstood intraventricular blood pressure, prevented bleeding, and enabled hemodynamic restabilization (intraventricular pressure of 81 mmHg before, vs 66 mmHg after implantation). These findings establish a scalable framework for fabricating cardiac tissue patches that integrate mechanical reinforcement with biological function, offering a surgically implantable&#160;and future regenerative solution for intraventricular myocardial repair.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>AI&#8208;Powered Experimental Discovery of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for n/i&#8208;Butane Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adsorption isotherms serve as descriptors which is accessible via both experiments and simulations. A training set optimization strategy based on descriptor similarity significantly reduces the training costs of AI model. The combination of AI, simulation and experiment accelerates the discovery of the high&#8208;performance MOF for separating n/i&#8208;butane.








Abstract
There are significant challenges in developing efficient adsorbents as alternatives to the energy&#8208;intensive distillation processes for n/i&#8208;butane separation. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great potential in addressing this issue. However, the vast diversity of MOFs makes the discovery of high&#8208;performance materials akin to searching for a needle in a haystack. Here, the high&#8208;throughput screening based on artificial intelligence (AI)&#160;is employed to accelerate the identification of MOFs for n/i&#8208;butane separation. An integrated descriptor system, accessible via both experiments and simulations, is proposed and broadly validated, demonstrating better performance over those widely&#8208;used descriptors. In addition, an optimization strategy for training dataset is proposed based on similarity, allowing for the efficient model training with only 10% samples from the entire database and thus significantly reducing the costs. Leveraging the integrated descriptors and optimization strategy, MOFs with exceptional n/i&#8208;butane separation performance are successfully identified through neural network model. As a proof of concept, SIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Zn is synthesized for validation because it has the largest n&#8208;butane capacity among top 20 MOFs. The SIFSIX&#8208;3&#8208;Zn demonstrates outstanding n/i&#8208;butane separation performance with nearly zero uptake of i&#8208;butane. This work introduces a novel research paradigm integrating AI, simulation and experiment, and presents an efficient process with broad applicability for material discovery.

         <title>Dimensionality Effect of Nanocarbon Precursors on Diamond Synthesis under Extreme Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dimensionality effect of nanocarbon precursors on diamond synthesis and transformation mechanism is investigated using laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell, including 0D carbon nanocage and fullerene, 1D nanotube and 3D graphite. The critical temperature and pressure of nanocarbon precursors becomes more stringent as their dimensionalities rise up. This work can shed light on the controllable preparation of diamond and related materials.








Abstract
Diamond holds significant promise for a wide range of applications due to its exceptional physicochemical properties. Investigating the controlled diamond preparation from nanocarbon precursors with varying dimensionalities is crucial to optimize the transition conditions and even elucidate the daunting transformation mechanism, however, this remains outstanding challenge despite considerable effort. Herein, the imperative dimensionality effect of nanocarbon precursors on diamond synthesis and the physical mechanism under high temperature and high pressure is reported, by comparing the distinct transition processes of 0D carbon nanocages (CNCs) and 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from conventional graphite. The optical and structural characterizations evidently demonstrate that both 0D CNCs and 1D CNTs first undergo collapse and graphitization, followed by the formation of mixed amorphous carbon with embedded diamond clusters, eventually leading to cubic diamond. The plotted pressure&#8208;temperature diagram exhibits the unique dimensionality effect of carbon nanomaterials to diamond transformation. These results provide valuable insights into the phase transition mechanisms of diamond synthesis and its derivatives under extreme conditions.

         <title>Unlocking Grotthuss Proton Energy Storage in Pyrochlore&#8208;Type Tungsten Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel trace&#8208;Ni2+&#8208;implanted pyrochlore&#8208;type tungsten oxide is developed to showcase unique Grotthuss proton conduction abilities based on hydrogen&#8208;bonding topochemistry, which has realized ultrafast and stable electrochemical proton storage performance in aqueous proton batteries up to 500C.








Abstract
It is of momentous significance to identify suitable proton&#8208;storage electrode materials inherent with Grotthuss topochemistry toward high&#8208;power aqueous proton batteries. However, currently reported oxide electrode materials have seldom conformed to the Grotthuss mechanism. Here Grotthuss mechanism&#8208;dominated proton storage is showcased in a novel 3D&#8208;tunnel&#8208;structured pyrochlore&#8208;type WO3&#183;0.5H2O (WOH), together with a reliable and effective approach to amplifying its Grotthuss conduction effect. Different from other phases of tungsten oxide (e.g., orthorhombic, monoclinic, and hexagonal), the zeolitic&#8208;water&#8208;enriched cubic pyrochlore WOH favors proton&#8208;hopping akin to &#8220;Newton's cradle&#8221; instead of traditional &#8220;vehicle&#8208;like&#8221; transport. Interestingly, introducing trace Ni(II) ions into the WOH (NWOH) is find to notably increase the content of structural water in lattice, thereby reframing the hydrogen&#8208;bonding network along with enhanced proton transfer capability as a consequence of its largely reduced activation energy as low as 0.08 eV. Hence, NWOH shows boosted reversible capacity of 71 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100C, ultrafast charging capability up to 500C, and ultralong cycling life over 30,000 cycles. Once coupled with Prussian blue analogue cathodes with identical Grotthuss conduction mechanism, the resultant high&#8208;output&#8208;voltage full&#8208;cells (&#8776;1.1 V) sustain high&#8208;rate cycling with high energy/power density and operate at a wide working temperature from &#8722;20 to 50&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Sacrificial&#8208;Agent&#8208;Triggered Mass Transfer Gating in Covalent Organic Framework for Hydrogen Peroxide Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sacrificial&#8208;agent&#8208;triggered mass transfer gating (MTG) strategy reconfigures interfacial reactions for photocatalytic H2O2 generation in COFs. This enables precise switching of the dominant photocatalytic mechanism between surface&#8208;confined directional charge transfer pathways and diffusion&#8208;dominated redox processes. Mechanistic studies elucidate the ternary role of sacrificial agents as MTG regulators, effectively addressing inherent reaction constraints.








Abstract
Covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalysts for H2O2 production remain challenging by mass transport limitations and poor charge separation efficiency. Herein, a sacrificial agent&#8208;triggered mass&#8208;transfer gating (MTG) strategy is developed to reconfigure interfacial reaction for photocatalytic H2O2 generation via synthesized benzothiazole&#8208;COFs. This enables precise switching of the dominant photocatalytic mechanism between surface&#8208;confined directional charge transfer pathways and diffusion&#8208;dominated redox processes. Notably, benzyl alcohol (BA) enhances the mass transport and the catalytic site accessibility, scavenges photogenerated holes, and supplies protons for coupling reactions, thereby increasing the H2O2 yield of Tp&#8208;BTz COF to 100.9 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and achieving the outstanding photocatalytic performance reported to date. Both Tp&#8208;BTz COF and Tp&#8208;TTz COF demonstrate durably high H2O2 production efficiency even in the high&#8208;salinity seawater and municipal tap water systems. The generated H2O2 effectively degrades organic pollutants such as methyl orange (MO) and rhodamine B (RhB), demonstrating practical potential for wastewater treatment. The proposed gating strategy by introducing BA enables three synergistic functions: i) modulating interfacial reactions, ii) acting as a sacrificial agent to scavenge holes, and iii) supplying abundant protons (H+) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to facilitate the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. This approach establishes a generalizable paradigm for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalytic systems toward sustainable energy and environmental applications.

         <title>Electric Field&#8208;Guided Ion Orchestration for Multi&#8208;Chemistry Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

An electric field&#8208;guided ion orchestration (EF&#8208;IO) strategy is developed to stabilize zinc metal batteries. By leveraging cation interfacial modifiers to reconfigure electric double layers and solvation configurations, the EF&#8208;IO design enables ultra&#8208;long cyclability and wide temperature adaptability. It also unlocks new reversible anion storage in high&#8208;voltage organic cathodes, advancing multi&#8208;chemistry zinc battery designs.








Abstract
While nonaqueous cosolvents alleviate hydrogen evolution reaction and dendritic growth in aqueous zinc (Zn) metal batteries (ZMBs), persistent H2O activity at Zn|electrolyte interfaces originating from unregulated ion distribution leads to premature failure. Here, an electric field&#8208;guided ion orchestration (EF&#8208;IO) strategy is proposed, leveraging cation interfacial modifiers to reconfigure electric double layers (EDLs) and solvation configurations. Interfacial simulations combined with experimental investigations verify that the ion&#8208;orchestrated&#8208;EDL synergistically diversifies Zn2+/Na+ solvation configurations and homogenizes localized electric fields, thereby forming an organic&#8211;inorganic gradient solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that suppresses parasitic reactions. This enables dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating with 3400&#160;h cyclability in Zn||Zn symmetric cells, while Zn||V10O24&#183;12H2O full cells exhibit exceptional durability along with wide temperature adaptability (&#8722;45 to 55&#160;&#176;C). Crucially, this EF&#8208;IO strategy unlocks ClO4&#8722;&#8208;based reversible anion storage in high&#8208;voltage organic cathodes. By bridging interfacial dynamics and multi&#8208;chemistry compatibility, this work establishes a promising paradigm for robust and versatile ZMBs.

         <title>Nonreciprocal Spin Waves in Nanoscale Hybrid N&#233;el&#8211;Bloch&#8211;N&#233;el Domain Walls Detected by Scanning X&#8208;Ray Microscopy in Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropic Fe/Gd Multilayers</title>

         <dc:description>
Using scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy, nonreciprocal spin&#8208;wave behavior is revealed in real space in Fe/Gd multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, highlighting their functionality for magnonic logic circuits operating at GHz frequencies. Topological defects disrupt phase continuity while preserving nonreciprocity, demonstrating the potential of these domain walls as programmable magnonic waveguides for directed information flow.








Abstract
Spin wave nonreciprocity is crucial for signal processing in magnonic circuits. Domain walls (DWs) have been suggested as channels for nonreciprocal spin waves (magnons) with directional&#8208;dependent properties. However, the experimental investigations are challenging due to the low&#8208;damping magnetic material with DWs demanded and the nanoscale length scales involved. In this study, scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (STXM) is used to examine coherently&#8208;excited magnons when propagating in hybrid N&#233;el&#8208;Bloch&#8208;N&#233;el DWs in amorphous Fe/Gd multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Well&#8208;ordered lattices of stripe domains and DWs are created through the integration of Cobalt nanowire arrays. Their width is measured to be &#948;DW = (60 &#177; 13) nm. Near 1 GHz magnons are detected with short wavelengths down to &#955; = (281 &#177; 44)&#160;nm which were&#160;channeled in the DWs. Consistent with micromagnetic simulations, the STXM data revealed a nonreciprocal magnon band structure inside the DWs. Bloch points are identified which disrupted the phase evolution of magnons and induced different &#955; adjacent to these topological defects. These observations provide direct evidence of nonreciprocal spin waves within hybrid N&#233;el&#8211;Bloch&#8211;N&#233;el DWs in PMA materials, serving as programmable waveguides in magnonic devices with directed information&#160;flow.

         <title>Selective Crystallization Delay in Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites Enables Initial Homogeneous Phase for Square Centimeter Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed&#8208;halide perovskite film with initially homogeneous phase distribution is obtained by using 3&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;fluorobenzamide additive, which selectively suppresses bromide precipitation during crystallization to mitigate halide phase segregation while demonstrating weak size dependence. The resulting 1.004&#8208;cm2 perovskite/organic tandem solar cells achieved a remarkable 25.21% power conversion efficiency, coupled with impressive operational stability maintaining &#8776;90% initial performance over 1500 h.








Abstract
Mixed halide wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites, used in high&#8208;performance perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs), are prone to phase segregation under light irradiation. Particularly, the initial inhomogeneous halide phase distribution in WBG perovskites can accelerate the phase segregation under operational stressors, thus hindering scaling of TSCs that require high phase homogeneity. Here, a selective delayed crystallization strategy is proposed in which a functional agent (3&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;fluorobenzamide; AFBA) is used to regulate the initial halide phase distribution. The &#8208;NH2 of AFBA, with a low electron&#8208;cloud density, shows a higher binding affinity with bromide than with iodide, thus selectively delaying the rapid crystallization of bromide; this phenomenon induces a homogeneous halide distribution across the film. The initial homogeneous film is phase&#8208;stable under operational stressors. As a result, the square&#8208;centimeter WBG perovskite front cell achieves a high efficiency of 18.61%. When stacked with organic subcells, the square&#8208;centimeter perovskite/organic TSC exhibits a remarkable efficiency of 25.21%, showing a weak&#8208;dependence of efficiency on size from 0.062 to 2.000 cm2, as well as a prolonged operational lifetime with a T90 of 1500&#160;h. Perovskite/organic TSCs are also connected in series with electrochromic devices to dynamically monitor the TSC performance via the color variation, providing insights for their future applications.

         <title>Gate&#8208;Tunable Highly Linear Bipolar Photoresponse in Se@SWCNT Adaptive Neurons for Dynamically Programmable Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a dynamically programmable synaptic transistor with a Se@SWCNT 1D van der Waals heterojunction, enabling both positive and negative responses via gate&#8208;tunable modulation. The transistor achieves high symmetry and linearity (R2&#160;&gt;&#160;0.99) in weight variation, demonstrating excellent performance across complex tasks, offering promising applications in brain&#8208;inspired optical neuromorphic systems with high accuracy.








Abstract
The development of tunable and highly controllable photoconductive devices for brain&#8208;inspired optical neuromorphic systems remains challenging. Previous neuromorphic devices are limited by asymmetric and nonlinear conductive properties, which impose specific restrictions on training tasks and weight learning rules in dynamic and complex visual environments. A programmable synaptic transistor based on a Se@SWCNT 1D van der Waals heterojunction, enabling gate&#8208;controlled positive and negative responses is presented. This approach eliminates the need for multilayer heterojunctions or complex circuits, simplifying array integration and wafer&#8208;scale fabrication. This phototransistor shows improved symmetry and linearity (R2&#160;&gt;&#160;0.99) in weight variation following optical stimulation, and simultaneously achieves linear persistent photoconductivity and negative photoconductivity with over 128 memory states, which is not reported previously. By adjusting light intensity and wavelength range, consistent weight rule processing across three tasks of increasing complexity is demonstrated. Notably, different visual tasks require distinct neural structures and decay rates. The proposed transistor facilitates transitions between bio&#8208;inspired brain regions via optical hybrid programming, adapting to dynamic visual environments. This innovation contributes significantly to brain&#8208;like computing and bio&#8208;inspired vision, due to its exceptional accuracy and dynamic switch models.
