         <title>FeNb2O6 as a High&#8208;Performance Anode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by Structural Amorphization Coupled with NbO6 Local Ordering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FeNb2O6 is applied for the first time as a high&#8208;performance anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The presence of iron disrupts the long&#8208;range order by local disorder of the FeO6 octahedra during initial sodiation. Simultaneously, the formation of short&#8208;range ordered zigzag&#8208;chain structures within the NbO6 planes establishes a robust intercalation host that maintains abundant active sites for pseudocapacitive intercalation and enhanced ion&#8208;diffusion pathways.








Abstract
Pseudocapacitance&#8208;type transition metal oxides have been extensively investigated as anodes&#160;for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Currently, they are also gaining attention&#160;for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their low volume change and safety. However, their performance in sodium storage remains limited, primarily due to the larger Na+ ion radius. Here, for the first time, an iron niobate is reported with a columbite structure as a high&#8208;performance sodium storage anode. The presence of iron triggers&#160;the loss of long&#8208;range order through disorder of the FeO6 octahedra local structure, subsequently allowing reversible sodium storage in an amorphous phase. Simultaneously, the formation of short&#8208;range ordered zigzag&#8208;chain structures within the NbO6 planes creates a &#8220;skeleton&#8221; that offers abundant active sites for pseudocapacitive ion storage and enhanced ion diffusion pathways. These characteristics of FeNb2O6 make it an effective intercalation host, offering high capacity along with fast Na+ kinetics, as demonstrated through operando and ex situ characterizations. It leads to an applicable reversible capacity (&gt;300 mAh g&#8722;1) with a favorable average voltage of &#8776;0.6&#160;V and excellent rate capability (180.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at a current density of 2 A g&#8722;1). This study provides insights into the development of intrinsically active transition metal oxides for Na+&#8208;ion intercalation.

         <title>Low&#8208;Symmetry 2D Ta2PtSe7 Induced by Ultralong Structural Motifs for Flexible Long&#8208;Wave Infrared Photodetection up to 10.6 &#181;m</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a symmetry&#8208;reduction strategy employing structural motif engineering, ultra&#8208;low&#8208;symmetry Ta2PtSe7 atomic layers featuring unprecedented 20.1&#160;&#197;&#8208;long [Ta4Pt2Se14] motifs were discovered. This extended motif architecture enables exceptional in&#8208;plane anisotropy, confirmed by direction&#8208;dependent optical and electrical characteristics. Notably, the bandgap&#8208;independent photoresponse of 2D Ta2PtSe7 achieves 27 V/W at 10.6 &#181;m while maintaining &gt;70% of its initial photocurrent throughout 50 bending cycles.








Abstract
The limited ability of traditional 2D anisotropic materials to meet next&#8208;generation anisotropic device demands necessitates innovative design strategies. To address this challenge, a symmetry&#8208;reduction approach is proposed that enhances in&#8208;plane anisotropy by extending structural motifs to lower crystal symmetry. Implementing this design principle, a novel van der Waals material, Ta2PtSe7 atomic layers is successfully developed, featuring record&#8208;breaking [Ta4Pt2Se14] structural motifs with an unprecedented length of 20.1 &#197;. This unique architecture endows Ta2PtSe7 with remarkable intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropy, manifesting in strongly direction&#8208;dependent optical and electrical characteristics. The developed Ta2PtSe7&#8208;based photodetector demonstrates exceptional broadband responsiveness across an expansive spectral range from visible to long&#8208;wavelength infrared (LWIR; 671 nm&#8211;10.6 &#181;m). Particularly noteworthy is its outstanding performance under low operating voltage (0.1 V), achieving a high responsivity of 27 V&#160;W&#8722;1 at 10.6 &#181;m illumination &#8211; a significant advancement in LWIR detection capabilities. Furthermore, flexible device configurations exhibit excellent mechanical robustness, maintaining over 70% of initial photocurrent after 50 bending cycles, demonstrating promising potential for flexible optoelectronics. This study proposes a novel structural motif engineering strategy to design anisotropic materials, exemplified by Ta2PtSe7&#8217;s exceptional in&#8208;plane anisotropy, broadband photoresponse, and mechanical robustness, enabling high&#8208;performance anisotropic optoelectronic devices.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Sustainable, Ultrarobust and High&#8208;Power&#8208;Density Triboelectric Nanogenerator for In Situ Powering of Marine Internet of Things</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synergizing charge supplementation with a multiphase electrode strategy, record&#8208;breaking ultrahigh durability and power output for TENGs is achieved, and further integrated a self&#8208;developed ultralow&#8208;power management circuit to enable fully self&#8208;sustained, continuous operation of marine IoT nodes with GPS functionality&#8212;powered solely by TENG energy.








Abstract
The sustainable operation of marine Internet of Things (IoT), as a critical enabler for marine resource utilization, is hindered by the lack of robust energy solutions capable of powering advanced functionalities in unpredictable oceanic environments. Here, a self&#8208;sustainable, highly reliable triboelectric nanogenerator system is presented that synergizes a non&#8208;contact architecture with dynamic charge supplementation and multiphase electrode design to overcome persistent limitations in durability, energy storage, and water wave adaptability. The system achieves a 3&#8208;fold enhancement in output charge with 97% performance retention over 20 million cycles&#8212;5.2 times more durable than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art counterparts. A chaotic double&#8208;pendulum structure further broadens operational bandwidth to 0.4&#8211;1.0 Hz with the charge accumulation rate of 4.6 times, enabling record&#8208;breaking average power density of 13.53 W m&#8722;3 Hz&#8722;1. Furthermore, an adaptive ultralow&#8208;powered (244 nW) integrated management circuit with on&#8208;demand direct current supply functionality ensures a 394&#8208;fold energy storage speed, successfully sustaining real&#8208;time GPS communication and water quality monitoring in autonomous buoys. This work establishes a scalable, maintenance&#8208;free paradigm for marine energy harvesting, directly addressing the energy paradox in IoT deployment while advancing sustainable resource management and climate resilience strategies.

         <title>Elastic Energy Storage in Biological Materials: Internal Stresses and Their Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing and storing internally generated elastic energy is a clever strategy by biological materials to perform functions like shape transformation, movement, and predation. This review explores how biological systems manipulate mechanisms like atomic or protein integration into minerals, protein conformational shifts, phase transitions, and osmotic pressure to store and utilize elastic energy&#8212;functioning as &#8220;elastic energy batteries&#8221; to drive biological processes.








Abstract
In the biological world, materials are often heterogeneous and anisotropic, comprising components with very different elastic properties. The resulting structures are exposed to force generation by chemo&#8208;mechanical energy conversion&#8212;such as water absorption, phase separation, or crystallization. Such phenomena may result in strain misfits that generate internal stresses that store elastic energies, which turn out to be extremely useful for enabling functions such as shape change, locomotion, or predation. However, the significance of elastic energy storage has received little attention. In this review, by considering examples of a broad spectrum of biological materials spanning shape&#8208;morphing plant seed pods, smart appendages of crustaceans, ballistic tongues, and damage&#8208;tolerant mineralized tissues, the fundamental aspects involved in the generation, storage, and release of internally generated elastic energies are surveyed. These have major implications for functions such as strengthening and toughening, shape morphing and actuation, ballistic movements, tensegrity, and bending stabilization. How Phenomena such as atomic or protein incorporation into minerals, conformational changes of proteins, phase transformation, and osmotic pressure are manipulated in the biological world to generate function by storing elastic energy are described. Such &#8220;elastic energy batteries&#8221; provide efficient performance and evolutionarily adapted functionality through a smart, structure&#8208;based energy management.

         <title>Magnetocrystalline Anisotropic Platinum&#8211;Palladium&#8211;Iron Ternary Intermetallic Alloy for Enhanced Fuel Cell Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, how crystallographic anisotropy governs the catalytic process is investigated by comparing the tetragonal L10 and cubic L12 ordered phases in a newly developed PtPdFe ternary intermetallic system. New insights into the fundamental understanding of the ordered Pt&#8208;based ternary intermetallic alloys are introduced, unveiling magnetocrystalline anisotropy as a structure&#8208;intrinsic descriptor for oxygen reduction electrocatalysis in fuel cells.








Abstract
Ordered Pt&#8208;based intermetallic alloys have emerged as promising candidates for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts in comparison to their disordered counterparts. Here, novel ferromagnetic PtPdFe ternary intermetallic alloys with structurally ordered tetragonal L10 and cubic L12 phases are presented, featuring distinctive characteristics in crystal structures and atomic alignments. Insights into the fundamental understanding of the Pt&#8208;based ternary intermetallic catalysts are provided, unveiling magnetocrystalline anisotropy as a structure&#8208;intrinsic descriptor for ORR catalysis. Electrochemical half&#8208; and single&#8208;cell assessments reveal that the L10&#8208;PtPdFe intermetallic catalysts exhibit superior ORR performance compared to their L12&#8208;type counterparts. Combined experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that the unique tetragonal structure of L10&#8208;PtPdFe, characterized by strong 5d&#8211;3d orbital interactions along the c&#8208;axis direction, induces ferromagnetic ordering and leads to increased magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, thereby accelerating the ORR process. The fuel cell fabricated by such a cathode catalyst retains its performance after prolonged degradation test, meeting the 2025 stability goals set by the US Department of Energy under H2&#8211;O2, H2&#8211;air, and H2&#8211;N2 conditions. These new conceptual findings establish a rational framework for designing high&#8208;performance Pt&#8208;based intermetallic electrocatalysts, where magnetic anisotropy arising from ferromagnetic ordering can be harnessed to tailor catalytic performance for next&#8208;generation fuel cells.

         <title>Materials Engineering for Light&#8208;Activated Gas Sensors: Insights, Advances, and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light activation of gas sensors is a promising strategy for enabling power&#8208;efficient operation in next&#8208;generation smart devices, where a rational design of sensing layers can enhance light energy utilization. This review discusses design strategies for light&#8208;activated gas sensors, including doping&#8208;induced band structure tuning, plasmonic nanoparticle incorporation, and heterojunction engineering, along with key factors in light&#8208;activated gas sensing.








Abstract
Light activation stands out as one of the most&#160;promising&#160;strategies for improving the energy efficiency of chemiresistive gas sensors, a crucial step toward their commercialization and integration with smart devices. Current designs of light&#8208;activated gas sensors have primarily focused on catalyst decoration and doping in various photoreactive substrates (e.g., semiconducting metal oxides, conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks, or transition metal dichalcogenides). These approaches aim to induce surface activation to varying extents rather than optimizing the material itself for efficient light&#8208;energy utilization. Consequently, advancing light&#8208;activated gas sensor technology requires a dual focus on enhancing gas response characteristics and maximizing the utilization of incident light energy. To this end, this review provides an in&#8208;depth analysis of the photochemical mechanisms governing light&#8208;activated gas sensing, highlights key factors for performance optimization, and discusses the recent advancement in design strategies such as band structure tuning through doping, plasmonic nanoparticle incorporation, and heterojunction engineering. This review concludes with insights on future research directions in material development, signal processing, and device integration, offering a comprehensive perspective on the practical advancements of light&#8208;activated gas sensing technology.

         <title>Nanostructured Protein Surfaces Inspired by Spider Silk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing recombinant spider silk technology, bioengineered spidroin variants enable the creation of functionalized nanostructured coatings with tunable affinity for specific targets, supporting a broad range of applications &#8208; from antifouling surfaces and targeted drug delivery to advanced cell therapies and precision bio&#8208;patterning via lithography.








Abstract
Spider silk is renowned for its exceptional mechanical properties, surpassing those of many natural and synthetic materials. This review focuses on biotechnologically produced recombinant spidroin variants inspired by well&#8208;understood major ampullate spider silk proteins (=spidroins), which are role models for understanding molecular composition, architecture, and the nanoscopic and mesoscopic structures formed through self&#8208;assembly and phase separation of spider silk fibers. The use of recombinant spidroins is explored to fabricate functionalized nanostructured surfaces, and molecular engineering is highlighted to tailor the interfacial properties of various morphologies, including particles, capsules, electrospun nanofibers, films/coatings, macroscopic nanofibril&#8208;based hydrogels, and nanohydrogel coatings. One focus is on functionalization of spidroins with peptide tags enabling a variety of affinity&#8208;based targets from cellular markers to inorganic nanoparticles, and allowing for instance specific drug delivery, cell accommodation in hydrogels, or bioselective immobilization of cells on surfaces. Furthermore, applying nanostructured spidroin coatings in combination with photo&#8208; and soft&#8208;lithography techniques is demonstrated, which can be used to produce micro&#8208; and nanostructured patterns exhibiting confined, spidroin&#8208;defined targeting, affinity, or repulsion properties.

         <title>K&#8208;Edge&#8208;Inspired Selenomelanin Hydrogel: An X&#8208;Ray Filtering Biomaterial for Skin Protection in Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides an energy&#8208;selective shielding strategy by developing an X&#8208;ray filtering hydrogel, achieving skin protection in radiotherapy. The hydrogel exhibits up to 96% shielding for low&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray harm to skin through the strong absorption of near&#8208;threshold&#8208;energy photons at the K&#8208;edge in SeMNPs, while maintaining over 98% transmission for therapeutic photons.








Abstract
Radiotherapy is widely employed in cancer treatment, yet its inevitable side effects, particularly radiation dermatitis (RD), remain a significant concern. Numerous studies focus on alleviating RD symptoms, but approaches to minimize the radiation dose to the skin are underexplored. Shielding skin&#8208;damaging photons (10&#8211;20 keV) holds promise for skin dose reduction; however, this strategy is hindered by inadequate shielding efficiency of current RD biomaterials and overshielding by conventional high&#8208;Z materials which attenuate therapeutic high&#8208;energy photons. Here, inspired by the strong absorption of near&#8208;threshold&#8208;energy photons at the K&#8208;edge, an energy&#8208;selective shielding strategy by integrating selenium&#8208;containing melanin nanoparticles with a carbomer hydrogel is proposed, developing an X&#8208;ray filtering skin dressing (SeMNPs@Car). It exhibits up to 96% shielding for low&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray (10&#8211;20 keV) while maintaining over 98% transmission for high&#8208;energy photons. In RD animal models, the SeMNPs@Car achieves 100% prevention of ulceration and the longest delay in the onset of RD (&#8776;20 days), outperforming clinical RD treatments. Furthermore, Monte&#8208;Carlo&#8208;based reconstruction of radiotherapy scenarios demonstrates its clinical applicability. This work incorporates photoelectric absorption properties into hydrogel design, providing valuable insights for RD management and the creation of soft&#8208;material&#8208;based X&#8208;ray filters.

         <title>Life Engineering of Materials: Artificial Materials as Plugins for Biological Regulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Life engineering of materials: Constructing life plugins based on artificial materials, and achieving non&#8208;natural transformation and evolution of biological systems through the mutual integration and interaction between materials and life processes. Transform nonliving materials into components of life, breaking the boundaries between traditional material science and life science.








Abstract
Biomineralization is nature's precision engineering system, creating functional biomaterials with exceptional performance through orchestrated organic&#8211;inorganic synergistic interactions. Beyond fundamental investigations into biomineralization processes and mechanisms, research has evolved from structural biomimetics toward creating interdependent material&#8211;organism hybrids through mineralization&#8208;inspired design. Breakthroughs in technologies such as inorganic ion polymerization have significantly advanced strategies for fusing artificial materials with hard tissue regeneration (teeth/bones). Through material&#8211;biological integration strategies such as extracellular assembly, artificial organelle transplantation, and artificial functional tissue construction, the creation of artificial life plugins with enhanced nongenetic biological functions (not directly encoded by the DNA) has been achieved. A key pathway to achieving mineralization&#8208;inspired design lies in the development of a material&#8208;engineered bio&#8208;plugin, the material unit with interfaces characterized by chemically tailored compatibility and programmable bio&#8208;interactions. Materials that can serve as bio&#8208;plugins confer organisms with emergent functionalities such as cell protection, vaccine enhancement, and disease treatment. This review systematically summarizes recent advancements in artificial material&#8211;biological fusion technologies, highlights their critical role in the life engineering of materials, and envisions their potential to catalyze new paradigms in biomedical applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biomineralization is nature's precision engineering system, creating functional biomaterials with exceptional performance through orchestrated organic&#8211;inorganic synergistic interactions. Beyond fundamental investigations into biomineralization processes and mechanisms, research has evolved from structural biomimetics toward creating interdependent material&#8211;organism hybrids through mineralization-inspired design. Breakthroughs in technologies such as inorganic ion polymerization have significantly advanced strategies for fusing artificial materials with hard tissue regeneration (teeth/bones). Through material&#8211;biological integration strategies such as extracellular assembly, artificial organelle transplantation, and artificial functional tissue construction, the creation of artificial life plugins with enhanced nongenetic biological functions (not directly encoded by the DNA) has been achieved. A key pathway to achieving mineralization-inspired design lies in the development of a material-engineered bio-plugin, the material unit with interfaces characterized by chemically tailored compatibility and programmable bio-interactions. Materials that can serve as bio-plugins confer organisms with emergent functionalities such as cell protection, vaccine enhancement, and disease treatment. This review systematically summarizes recent advancements in artificial material&#8211;biological fusion technologies, highlights their critical role in the life engineering of materials, and envisions their potential to catalyze new paradigms in biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transparent&#8208;To&#8208;Reflective Multicolor All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrochromic Devices for Next&#8208;Generation Intelligent Display Windows</title>

         <dc:description>
Based on the challenge that it is difficult to construct a resonant cavity in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic devices to achieve multiple color changes, a dielectric&#8208;metal&#8208;dielectric (DMD) composite electrode is utilized to realize multiple color changes in the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic device based on WO3, achieving a wide color gamut of up to 11.58%.








Abstract
Inorganic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic devices have a wide range of industrial applications due to favorable chemical stability, high optical modulation rate, and good process compatibility. However, the monochromatic nature evidently restricts its development in transparent display, especially in application scenarios where color display is required. Here, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state WO3&#8208;based electrochromic device is presented with a dielectric&#8208;metal&#8208;dielectric (DMD) composite electrode, which features a transparent&#8208;to&#8208;reflective switching mode. More importantly, through the optimization of optical interference, the device exhibits rainbow structural colors. Leveraging the tunable optical constants of the electrochromic layer in conjunction with the additive color mixing principle, a remarkably wide color gamut of up to 11.58% can be attained with merely a minimal bias voltage of &#177;1.5 V, which substantially broadens the color gamut boundary of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ECDs and represents a significant breakthrough in color&#8208;rendering capabilities. The device exhibits excellent electrochromic performance, remarkable cycling stability (at least 5600 cycles), low power consumption (3.8 mW cm&#8722;2). Moreover, this device has two different performance modes, namely transmittance and reflection, and it holds great application potential in fields such as advertising, information transmission, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Revisiting Ferroelectric&#8208;Gated Phototransistors: A Tripartite Synapse&#8208;Inspired Approach to In&#8208;Sensor Image Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferroelectric&#8208;gated phototransistor (FGPT) enables linear and multilevel modulation of photoconductance through partial polarization switching and photogating effects. The device achieves photonic non&#8208;volatility over a 153&#160;dB dynamic range and performs in&#8208;sensor processing under unstructured illumination, demonstrating enhanced face recognition accuracy by recalibrating distorted visual inputs into a pre&#8208;trained range.








Abstract
Neuromorphic devices inspired by the tripartite synapse system offer enhanced modulation of synaptic weight via a third terminal. However, using an electrically independent terminal for memorizing and processing optical information remains unexplored. Here, a ferroelectric&#8208;gated phototransistor (FGPT) incorporating ferroelectric polymers and organic photoactive channels is revisited for neuromorphic vision systems. It is demonstrated that partial polarization switching in the ferroelectric gate insulator enables linear control of the photoactive channel. Furthermore, the photogating effect induced by charge trapping at the ferroelectric insulator/photoactive channel interface further enhances the photonic non&#8208;volatile (PNV) characteristics of the FGPT. This allows memorized visual information, expressed as photoconductance, to be incrementally potentiated or depressed. The modulated photoconductance fully spans the current level within the dynamic range of the device (153&#160;dB). Finally, the feasibility of the device for all&#8208;day face recognition is shown by in&#8208;sensor processing of visual information obtained from unstructured environments into the pre&#8208;trained range. This approach results in up to a &#8776;40% improvement in recognition accuracy.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Exchange Membrane Electrolysis for Efficient Uranium Extraction from Saline Wastewater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated EE&#8208;PR process is developed using a ZrN/CF electrode and AEM flow cell. This system enables rapid, selective, and scalable recovery of uranium from saline nuclear wastewater, offering a low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional solvent&#8208;based extraction methods.








Abstract
Recovery of uranium from residual spent fuel dissolution liquor in nuclear power plants is economically and environmentally desirable. While electrochemical extraction offers a greener alternative to solvent&#8208;based methods like the PUREX (plutonium uranium reduction extraction) process, it has been limited to batch processing of non&#8208;saline waters. Here, a high&#8208;performance ZrN/copper foam (ZrN/CF) electrode is presented that enables a continuous electroextraction&#8208;purification&#8208;reuse (EE&#8208;PR) process, achieving &gt;98% pure UO2 directly from saline wastewater for direct reuse as nuclear fuel. An anion&#8208;exchange membrane (AEM) flow cell for uranium extraction is introduced, integrating it with a ZrN/CF electrode to achieve complete uranium removal within two hours &#8211; an unprecedented efficiency in marine environments. Scalability assessments and techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) confirm the environmental and economic feasibility of this approach, with the estimated total cost for extracting uranium comparable to the current market price. As the global adoption of nuclear energy accelerates, this process offers a transformative solution for sustainable uranium recovery and resource management.

         <title>Microstructure Optimization via Grain&#8208;Boundary Segregation to Enhance DC Bias Dielectric Performance of BaTiO3 Multilayer Ceramic Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By tuning grain size through nanoscale grain&#8208;boundary segregation of single&#8208;element additives, high&#8208;performance BaTiO&#8323;&#8208;based multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) exhibit exceptionally low dielectric loss over a wide frequency range and excellent thermal stability. In particular, an optimal grain size is identified for maximizing effective capacitance under high DC bias fields, offering a key strategy to enable thinner dielectric layers in future MLCCs.








Abstract
BaTiO&#8323;&#8208;based multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) are essential components in modern electronics. To enhance overall capacitance, achieving thinner ceramic layers has become a primary issue. However, this introduces two major challenges: controlling grain size during processing and ensuring stability under high electric fields. In this study, a novel strategy employing single&#8208;element additives such as Fe3&#8314; and Ni2&#8314; is presented to effectively suppress grain growth. These additives strongly segregate at grain boundaries, thereby limiting grain coarsening during sintering and enabling fine&#8208;grained microstructures. The optimized BaTiO&#8323; samples, free of costly rare&#8208;earth elements, exhibit stable high permittivity (&#8776;103), low dielectric loss, and improved reliability across varying temperatures and frequencies. More importantly, we identify the ideal grain size of &#8776;200&#160;nm for maximizing capacitance under a DC bias exceeding 4&#160;V&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1. The findings suggest that further reducing the dielectric layer thickness to 200&#160;nm represents a promising direction for future MLCCs.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Sensitivity, Wide&#8208;Range Thermometry Based on High&#8208;Quality Microscale Diamond Resonators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combing high&#8208;crystal quality single&#8208;crystal diamond MEMS cantilevers with multi&#8208;mode resonance, the groundbreaking microscale ultra&#8208;high sensitivity &#8776;22 nK&#160;Hz&#8315;&#185;/2 and resolution of 100 &#181;K thermometry is achieved. The diamond MEMS thermometry can operate over a wide temperature range from 6.5 to 380 K. This work underscores diamond MEMS resonators as a cutting&#8208;edge platform for microscale high&#8208;resolution thermometry.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation thermometry requires ultrahigh temperature sensitivity, precision, and microscale or nanoscale spatial resolution for bio&#8208;calorimetry, optoelectronic sensing, quantum science, energy storage, and thermal management of electronic devices. Current thermometry approaches based on thermocouple, resistive, and optical mechanisms suffer from various problems such as large volume, low resolution, high noise level, and narrow temperature range. Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) resonators hold great potential as thermometry due to the small size, batch fabrication, and facile integration with electrical circuits. However, mainstream silicon MEMS thermometry struggles with the trade&#8208;off between responsivity, temperature resolution, and sensitivity. In this work, we utilize the highest crystal quality single&#8208;crystal diamond and multi&#8208;mode resonance for MEMS cantilever thermometry to address these challenges.

The groundbreaking sensing performance highlights the versatility and transformative potential of diamond MEMS resonator as the next&#8208;generation platform for ultrahigh&#8208;sensitivity and high&#8208;resolution temperature sensing in microscale or nanoscale space.

&lt;p&gt;By combing high-crystal quality single-crystal diamond MEMS cantilevers with multi-mode resonance, the groundbreaking microscale ultra-high sensitivity &#8776;22 nK&#160;Hz&#8315;&#185;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and resolution of 100 &#181;K thermometry is achieved. The diamond MEMS thermometry can operate over a wide temperature range from 6.5 to 380 K. This work underscores diamond MEMS resonators as a cutting-edge platform for microscale high-resolution thermometry.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next-generation thermometry requires ultrahigh temperature sensitivity, precision, and microscale or nanoscale spatial resolution for bio-calorimetry, optoelectronic sensing, quantum science, energy storage, and thermal management of electronic devices. Current thermometry approaches based on thermocouple, resistive, and optical mechanisms suffer from various problems such as large volume, low resolution, high noise level, and narrow temperature range. Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) resonators hold great potential as thermometry due to the small size, batch fabrication, and facile integration with electrical circuits. However, mainstream silicon MEMS thermometry struggles with the trade-off between responsivity, temperature resolution, and sensitivity. In this work, we utilize the highest crystal quality single-crystal diamond and multi-mode resonance for MEMS cantilever thermometry to address these challenges. The resulting diamond MEMS thermometry exhibits unparalleled performance, with an ultra-high sensitivity of &#8776;22 nK&lt;sup&gt;Hz&#8722;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;, a high temperature resolution of 100 &#181;K, and a wide-temperature range from 6.5 to 380 K. The groundbreaking sensing performance highlights the versatility and transformative potential of diamond MEMS resonator as the next-generation platform for ultrahigh-sensitivity and high-resolution temperature sensing in microscale or nanoscale space.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Phenothiazine Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials: Unlocking Stability and Scalability in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorene&#8208;functionalized spiro&#8208;phenothiazine (PTZ&#8208;Fl) exhibits strong Li+ affinity and thermal stability, enabling a PCE of 25.75% in small&#8208;area cells and 22.07% in 25 cm2 modules. Under ISOS&#8208;L3 conditions, PTZ&#8208;Flbased devices retain over 80% efficiency after 1000 hours, demonstrating superior stability and scalability compared to spiro&#8208;OMeTAD for next&#8208;generation perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Improving both the efficiency and long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is critical for their commercial deployment. Despite the widespread use of spiro&#8208;OMeTAD as a hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM), its inhomogeneous doping behavior and susceptibility to moisture and heat have hindered its large&#8208;scale industrial implementation. Here, a family of spiro&#8208;phenothiazine&#8208;based HTMs (PTZ) is reported to address these drawbacks. Among them, the fluorene derivative (PTZ&#8208;Fl) shows a larger Li+ affinity and forms a compact interphase by intercalation in the perovskite passivating layer that prevents Li+ migration. PSCs incorporating PTZ&#8208;Fl exhibit power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 25.8% (certified 25.2% under reverse scan), retaining 80% of their initial performance after 1000 h under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 protocol. Furthermore, a 5 &#215; 5&#160;cm mini&#8208;module reaches a PCE of 22.1%, surpassing spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8208;based PSCs and retaining over 85% of its efficiency after 1100 h under ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1 protocol. These results demonstrate that PTZ&#8208;Fl not only enables high PCEs but also substantially improves operational stability, offering a promising pathway toward the large&#8208;scale deployment of next&#8208;generation PSCs.

The fascinating properties of LCEs demonstrate outstanding potential in biomimetic soft robots. From the novel perspective of integrated material&#8211;structure&#8211;function interrelationship, this paper systematically reviewed the latest research progress of biomimetic LCE soft actuators, including plant&#8208;inspired biomimetic shape&#8208;morphing of LCEs, animal&#8208;inspired biomimetic locomotion of LCEs, and bionic intelligent color&#8208;changing of LCEs. The potential application prospects and challenges of bio&#8208;inspired LCE soft actuators are discussed.








Abstract
After 30 years of development, liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) biomimetic soft robots have been engineered to possess the capability to mimic and surpass the locomotion of soft organisms. However, most of the current reviews on LCEs are focused on their material/alignment design, fabrication technologies, actuation mechanisms, and applications. The latest research progress of biomimetic LCE soft actuators is systematically reviewed here from a novel perspective of material&#8211;structure&#8211;function interrelationship, which includes plant&#8208;inspired biomimetic shape&#8208;morphing of LCEs, animal&#8208;inspired biomimetic locomotion of LCEs, and bionic intelligent color&#8208;changing of LCEs. In addition, the potential application prospects and challenges of bio&#8208;inspired LCE soft actuators are discussed, where further in&#8208;depth research is required. Directions and valuable insights are provided for subsequent research efforts. This paper offers an inspiring and critical overview of the significant progress in the field of smart biomimetic LCE soft robotics and provides an available guide for researchers who are considering entering the exciting domain of LCE soft actuators.

         <title>Advanced Nanotechnology&#8208;Driven Innovations for Corneal Neovascularization Therapy: Smart Drug Delivery and Enhanced Treatment Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Corneal neovascularization (CoNV) causes significant visual impairment. Advances in nanomaterials offer promising CoNV treatments. This review categorizes different drug delivery systems, summarizes effective treatment strategies, and highlights recent nanotherapy innovations. By analyzing ocular barriers and neovascularization mechanisms, it identifies key biological factors, regulatory pathways, and challenges in ophthalmology, emphasizing nanomaterials' potential to transform CoNV treatment and advance precision medicine.








Abstract
Corneal neovascularization (CoNV) is a major global contributor to visual impairment, significantly affecting patients' vision and overall quality of life. Traditional treatment modalities often prove inadequate, constrained by limited bioavailability, and their extended use may result in serious complications, including secondary infections, glaucoma, and cataracts. However, recent progress in nanomaterials has led to promising therapeutic approaches for CoNV therapy. These nanomaterials, serving as carriers for anti&#8208;vascular endothelial growth factor (anti&#8208;VEGF) drugs or corticosteroids, exhibit remarkable capabilities in efficient penetration, adhesion, targeted drug delivery, and controlled release. Furthermore, they demonstrate independent inhibitory effects on neovascularization, thereby paving the way for a comprehensive treatment strategy that encompasses both the microenvironment and molecular pathways. This review offers a systematic classification of innovative drug delivery systems specifically tailored for the cornea. It provides an overview of effective strategies and compiles the latest advancements in cutting&#8208;edge nanotherapy technologies for CoNV. By delving into the intricacies of ocular barriers and neovascularization mechanisms, this review elucidates crucial biological factors and regulatory pathways, highlights the prevalent challenges in ophthalmic medicine, and underscores the significant potential of nanomaterials in revolutionizing CoNV treatment. This in&#8208;depth analysis establishes a scientific foundation for precision medicine and clinical transformation in the field of CoNV.

         <title>Magnetically &#8220;Programming&#8221; Cobalt&#8208;Doped Iron Oxide Nanoparticles for Localized Induction Heating: Triggering a Collective Effect of Magnetic Moment Alignment on Demand</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates enhanced induction heating in cobalt&#8208;doped iron oxide nanoparticles via specific pre&#8208;magnetization, induced by the pre&#8208;alignment of magnetic moments. By correlating Co content with magnetic properties, the research highlights how magnetic pre&#8208;programming enables localized, on&#8208;demand debonding in composites. These findings offer future applications in industrial recycling, emphasizing the potential of a switchable magnetic memory in advanced systems.








Abstract
Induction heating, a contactless and efficient method for generating heat via alternating magnetic fields (AMFs), has evolved from simple thermal applications to precise process control in fields like catalysis, self&#8208;healing, and debonding. Magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) play a key role as heat mediators, with heating properties adjustable via composition, size, and interactions. However, spatially precise heat control remains challenging. Current strategies rely on external AMF adjustments or material modifications, but lack an inherent mechanism to predefine which particles or regions will be activated for induction heating, limiting applicability in structured materials or complex environments. Here, it is shown that pre&#8208;magnetizing cobalt&#8208;doped iron oxide NPs with a static magnetic field irreversibly enhances their heating rates by up to a factor of 40. This process permanently alters their magnetic properties, enabling selective heating independent of AMF modulation. The extent of activation scales with cobalt content, introducing a material&#8208;intrinsic thermal switch. Furthermore, assembling these NPs into supraparticles facilitates integration into functional materials. By enabling spatially resolved and selective heat generation, this strategy advances the control of induction heating at the material level. It opens new possibilities for on&#8208;demand, pre&#8208;programmable, spatially resolved thermal activation in composite materials, smart adhesives, and targeted energy delivery in complex systems.

         <title>GHz&#8208;Speed Wavefront Shaping Metasurface Modulators Enabled by Resonant Electro&#8208;Optic Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electro&#8208;optically tunable metasurfaces using a silicon&#8208;on&#8208;lithium niobate platform are presented, achieving both GHz amplitude modulation and transmissive wavefront shaping. Voltage biasing the lithium niobate tunes its refractive index, modulating the high quality factor resonance of the Si nanobar. Using this resonant nanoantenna platform, a beamsplitting metasurface device is developed, whose diffraction efficiency can be modulated with a bandwidth of 1.03 GHz. This platform provides a foundation for compact, high&#8208;bandwidth free&#8208;space communications and sensing devices.








Abstract
Electrically tunable metasurfaces that control the amplitude and phase of light through biasing of nanoscale antennas present a route to compact modulator devices. However, most platforms face limitations in bandwidth, optical efficiency, and tuning response. Electro&#8208;optically tunable metasurfaces achieving both GHz amplitude modulation and transmissive wavefront shaping in the telecom range are presented. The resonant electro&#8208;optic nanoantenna design consists of a silicon nanobar atop thin&#8208;film lithium niobate, with gold electrodes. The nanobar is a periodically perturbed optical waveguide that supports high quality factor (Q &gt; 1000) guided mode resonances excited with free&#8208;space light. Voltage biasing the lithium niobate tunes its refractive index, modulating the resonance of the nanobar through evanescent mode overlap. Absolute transmittance modulation of 7.1% with &#177;5 V applied voltage is demonstrated, and the modulation dependence on the resonance quality factor is shown. Additionally, the modulation bandwidth of these devices exceeds 800 MHz, and the electrode limitations on this bandwidth are studied. Finally, how this resonant antenna platform can enable wavefront shaping metasurfaces is shown. A beamsplitting metasurface device is demonstrated, whose diffraction efficiency can be modulated with a bandwidth of 1.03 GHz. The high&#8208;speed modulation and wavefront control capabilities of this platform provide a foundation for compact, high&#8208;bandwidth free&#8208;space communications and sensing&#160;devices.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Multiferroic Liquids: Ferroelectric and Ferromagnetic Order in a Hybrid Nanoparticle&#8211;Liquid Crystal System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid fluid combining ferrimagnetic nanoplatelets and a ferroelectric nematic displays coexisting magnetization and polarisation at room temperature. This self&#8208;assembled multiferroic shows strong magnetoelectric effect and nonlinear optical response, offering a soft, reconfigurable platform for next&#8208;generation sensing, actuation, and photonic applications.








Abstract
Responsiveness to multiple stimuli and adaptivity are paramount for designing smart multifunctional materials. In soft, partially ordered systems, these features can often be achieved via self&#8208;assembly, allowing for the combination of diverse components in a complex nanostructured material. Here, an example of a liquid is demonstrated that simultaneously displays both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic types of order. This material is a nanostructured liquid crystalline hybrid comprising ferrimagnetic barium hexaferrite nanoplatelets suspended in a ferroelectric nematic host. Director&#8208;mediated interactions drive the self&#8208;assembly of nanoplatelets in an intricate network. Due to the coupling between the polar electric and magnetic types of order, this material demonstrates magnetically driven electric and nonlinear optical responses, as well as electrically driven magnetic response. Such multiferroic liquids are highly promising for applications in energy harvesting, nonlinear optics, and sensors.

         <title>Enhancing N&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistor Performance via Blending Alkyl and Oligoglycol Functionalized Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blending hydrophobic and hydrophilic n&#8208;type conjugated polymers in precise ratios enhances charge carrier mobility and dramatically improves organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) performance. This strategy demonstrates how molecular interactions and phase compatibility within polymer blends can be engineered to tune microstructure and transport properties, providing a versatile design approach for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type OECT materials.








Abstract
Compared to their p&#8208;type counterparts, n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) generally exhibit inferior stability, slower ion injection kinetics, and reduced sensitivity when used as the active layer in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs). Enhancing the performance of n&#8208;type OMIECs is crucial for advancing next&#8208;generation technologies that rely on mixed conduction, including bioelectronics, neuromorphic computing, and energy storage. Here, how blending two n&#8208;type conjugated polymers with oligoglycol and alkyl side chains impacts OECT performance is investigated. Specifically, NDI(biOE2)&#8208;T2, which has branched oligoglycol side chains, and N2200, which has branched alkyl side chains, are examined. Blending these polymers in a 90:10 NDI(biOE2)&#8208;T2:N2200 ratio results in a twofold increase in the electronic mobility volumetric capacitance product (&#181;C*) compared to pure NDI(biOE2)&#8208;T2. However, at higher N2200 concentrations, the &#181;C* product declines sharply. The enhancement in &#181;C* arises from an increase in electronic mobility (&#181;), likely due to reduced polymer swelling upon N2200 addition. Nanoscale infrared imaging with photoinduced force microscopy (PiFM) is used to visualize the spatial distribution of the two polymers and observe that higher N2200 content leads to phase separation, contributing to the drop in &#181;C*. Overall, this study highlights polymer blending as a promising strategy for improving the performance of n&#8208;type OMIECs.

         <title>Enabling Multielectron Reaction of Polyanionic Cathodes Toward High&#8208;Energy Calcium Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new CaxNaV1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 (0 &#8804; x &#8804; 1.4) cathode is developed to unlock the persistent challenge of single electron transfer per ion insertion in polyanionic materials. The cathode achieves a 1.87&#8208;electron transfer in Ca&#8208;ion cells by in situ activated multielectron reaction, thus offering a high capacity of 162&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and an energy density of 400 Wh kg&#8722;1 for advanced calcium rechargeable batteries.








Abstract
Polyanionic cathode materials with robust structural stability and large Ca2+ diffusion channels have aroused great interest in propelling the development of calcium&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs). However, polyanionic cathodes usually exhibit single&#8208;electron transfer per unit, rendering limited specific capacity and energy densities. Herein, a new polyanionic CaxNaV1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 (0 &#8804; x &#8804; 1.4) cathode is proposed for high&#8208;capacity and ultra&#8208;stable CIBs by unlocking 1.87&#8208;electron transfer per vanadium redox center during Ca ion insertion. The CaxNaV1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 cathode delivers a reversible calcium storage capacity of 162 mAh g&#8722;1 at an average voltage of &#8776;2.5 V at 10 mA g&#8722;1, featuring a record&#8208;high energy density of &#8776;400 Wh kg&#8722;1. The low volume changes (&#8710;V = 1.8%) and fast diffusion kinetics indicate excellent cycling stability of CaxNaV1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 with capacity retentions of 98.2% and 80.8% over 600 and 5000 cycles, respectively. In Ca metal full cells made from a Ca metal anode and a compatible electrolyte, the CaxNaV1.5Cr0.5(PO4)3 presents a high energy density of 318 Wh kg&#8722;1 over 50 cycles, which rivals the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art CIB performance. This work sheds new light on the electrochemically activated multielectron redox reactions of polyanionic cathode materials for sustainable CIBs.

&lt;p&gt;Polyanionic cathode materials with robust structural stability and large Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion channels have aroused great interest in propelling the development of calcium-ion batteries (CIBs). However, polyanionic cathodes usually exhibit single-electron transfer per unit, rendering limited specific capacity and energy densities. Herein, a new polyanionic Ca&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;NaV&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cr&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (0 &#8804; &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; &#8804; 1.4) cathode is proposed for high-capacity and ultra-stable CIBs by unlocking 1.87-electron transfer per vanadium redox center during Ca ion insertion. The Ca&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;NaV&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cr&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cathode delivers a reversible calcium storage capacity of 162 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at an average voltage of &#8776;2.5 V at 10 mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, featuring a record-high energy density of &#8776;400 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The low volume changes (&lt;i&gt;&#8710;V&lt;/i&gt; = 1.8%) and fast diffusion kinetics indicate excellent cycling stability of Ca&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;NaV&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cr&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with capacity retentions of 98.2% and 80.8% over 600 and 5000 cycles, respectively. In Ca metal full cells made from a Ca metal anode and a compatible electrolyte, the Ca&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;NaV&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cr&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; presents a high energy density of 318 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; over 50 cycles, which rivals the state-of-the-art CIB performance. This work sheds new light on the electrochemically activated multielectron redox reactions of polyanionic cathode materials for sustainable CIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Printing of Conducting Polymer Hydrogels for Electrostimulation&#8208;Assisted Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights nanosized inherently conducting polymers (ICPs) as promising ink constituents for 3D printing of conducting hydrogel (CH)&#8208;based electrostimulation (ES) devices. ICP&#8208;based ink formulation, 3D printing, and solidification strategies are discussed, along with the application of 3D&#8208;printed ICP&#8208;based CHs as ES platforms for regulating cell activities such as proliferation, differentiation, and maturation, ultimately supporting tissue regeneration.








Abstract
Electrostimulation (ES) is at the cutting edge of contemporary medicine, effectively promoting tissue regeneration and wound healing by applying small electrical cues to stimulate specific cellular responses. The 3D printing of electronically conducting hydrogels (CHs) offers a transformative strategy for developing ES platforms. These hydrogels integrate conformal, customizable geometries, mechanical compliance, adequate electrical conductivity, and biocompatibility, enabling seamless interaction with native tissues. Nanosized inherently conducting polymers (ICPs) are promising conductive ink constituents for 3D printing, owing to their straightforward preparation, electrical conductivity, and printability. However, 3D printing of ICP&#8208;based CHs faces several challenges. Controlling the tendency of ICPs to aggregate and achieving the rheological properties required by specific 3D printing modalities are vital for achieving uniform and precise printed structures. Furthermore, post&#8208;printing solidification of ICPs often uses harsh curing conditions, e.g., high temperatures or toxic solvents, rendering encapsulation of biological components and cells infeasible. This review critically assesses strategies for synthesizing ICP nanostructures, preparing ICP&#8208;based CHs, and applicable 3D printing techniques. Progress in tissue regeneration utilizing 3D&#8208;printed ICP&#8208;based CHs as ES devices is highlighted, along with future perspectives regarding the development of bio&#8208;functional ICPs and integrated powering mechanisms for closed&#8208;loop ES systems.

         <title>Off&#8208;the&#8208;Shelf Granular Microtissue Bioinks: Long&#8208;Term Preserved Cellularized Porous Microgels with Enhanced Cell Activity for Shelf&#8208;Ready Biofabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces long&#8208;term preserved cellularized porous microgels that 1) achieve a considerably long preservation duration (up to 14&#160;months); 2) enable better cell and tissue growth due to the presence of internal interfaces; and 3) allow for injectable and 3D bioprinting use as a novel granular bioink. It advances the form of bioinks and represents a future trend of tissue engineering toward ready&#8208;to&#8208;use products.








Abstract
Off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf cellularized products greatly advance the therapeutic practice for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, it remains a challenge to achieve long&#8208;term preservation and superior biological outcomes. Here, the cryo&#8208;gelation methodology is optimized to develop a cellularized porous microgel platform that allows for long&#8208;term cryopreservation on the shelf (up to 14&#160;months) and favors tissue growth due to the presented subvoxel interfaces. The modular granular microtissues serve as an injectable formulation for non&#8208;invasive therapy and innovative printable bioinks for precise biofabrication, free of on&#8208;site operations on cell isolation and preparation. The internal biomaterial interfaces down to the microtissue building blocks significantly enhance cell growth and function, compared to the conventional bulk counterpart. The ready&#8208;to&#8208;use potential of months&#8208;preserved hMSC&#8208;laden modules is demonstrated through subcutaneous injection and critical&#8208;sized skull defect repair in rats, which confirms the benefits of subvoxel interfaces for tissue regeneration. These off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf granular cellularized blocks enable highly accessible and on&#8208;demand use in cell&#8208;based regenerative medicine.

         <title>Vascularized and Perfusable Human Heart&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip Model Recapitulates Aspects of Myocardial Ischemia and Enables Analysis of Nanomedicine Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This novel 3D human ischemic heart&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip, with perfusable vasculature directly interfaced with myocardial tissue, replicates key aspects of ischemic heart injury. It also demonstrates the targeted delivery and therapeutic efficacy of cardiac homing peptide&#8208;conjugated liposomes, validating the platform for drug and nanomedicine screening in myocardial ischemia.








Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of CVDs are not yet fully understood, and animal models do not accurately replicate human heart function. Heart&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip technologies with increasing complexity are being developed to mimic aspects of native human cardiac physiology for mechanistic studies and as screening platforms for drugs and nanomedicines. Here, a 3D human myocardial ischemia&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip platform incorporating perfusable vasculature in direct contact with myocardial regions is designed. Infusing a vasoconstrictor cocktail, including angiotensin II and phenylephrine, into this heart&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip model leads to increased arrhythmias in cardiomyocyte pacing, fibroblast activation, and damage to blood vessels, all of which are hallmarks of ischemic heart injury. To verify the potential of this platform for drug and nanocarrier screening, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study is conducted with cardiac homing peptide&#8208;conjugated liposomes containing Alamandine. This nanomedicine formulation enhances targeting to the ischemia model, alleviates myocardial ischemia&#8208;related characteristics, and improves cardiomyocyte beating. This confirms that the vascularized chip model of human myocardial ischemia provides both functional and mechanistic insights into myocardial tissue pathophysiology and can contribute to the development of cardiac remodeling medicines.

         <title>High Ionic Seebeck Effect in Natural Leaves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals a role of natural leaves as thermoelectric biomaterials, capable of converting heat into electricity through the ionic Seebeck effect. The leaves exhibit significant and reproducible thermopower under both moderate temperature gradients and photothermal conditions. These findings open avenues for developing eco&#8208;friendly energy conversion systems and biotechnologies based on in vivo thermoelectric assay.








Abstract
Plants actively transport ions to sustain life, yet their capacity to convert heat to electricity via the ionic Seebeck effect has remained unexplored. Here, it is demonstrated that natural Ficus elastica leaves can generate ionic thermovoltages up to 7 V under mild temperature gradients, achieving a high ionic figure of merit of &#8764;5.6 at room temperature. This pronounced thermoelectric response arises from anion thermodiffusion through the apoplast and is significantly amplified by leaf desiccation and electrode selection. A dielectric capacitive model accounts for the observed enhancement. Notably, living leaves generate thermopower under light&#8208;induced temperature gradients, underscoring the potential of in vivo ionic thermoelectric assays. These findings reveal an unrecognized energy&#8208;harvesting function in plant tissue and introduce a biodegradable platform for sustainable thermal&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion.

A bifunctional Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst (Pt&#8208;DG&#8208;1) is discovered with enhanced ammonia oxidation reaction and oxygen reduction reaction mass activities compared to commercial Pt/C. It is shown that modulating the coordination environment of Pt single atoms is crucial towards dictating the electrocatalytic activity. The bifunctional capability of Pt&#8208;DG&#8208;1&#160;is demonstrated as both the cathode and anode in a direct ammonia fuel cell.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature direct ammonia fuel cells (DAFCs) can be used for the on&#8208;demand generation of clean electricity. However, such systems have low efficiency due to the kinetically sluggish ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Prior reports have largely focused on Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts, however, their high cost motivates the need for simultaneously increasing activity whilst reducing the metal loading. Here, the design of a bifunctional Pt single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) is reported, with enhanced catalytic activities compared to commercial Pt/C for both reactions. Notably, by modulating the Pt SAC coordination, the optimal catalyst (Pt&#8208;DG&#8208;1) displayed a high AOR mass activity of 1.23 A mgPt&#8722;1 and ORR mass activity of 7.98 A mgPt&#8722;1. This is then integrated into a DAFC as both the cathode and anode, achieving a peak power density of 21.8 mW cm&#8722;2 and low Pt mass loading of only 0.034 mg cm&#8722;2. In situ shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS) experiments on Pt&#8208;DG&#8208;1 indicate a lower *OH coverage under ORR conditions and suppressed formation of poisoning species *NOx under AOR conditions as additional reasons for its enhanced bifunctional catalytic activity. Importantly, the study demonstrates how SACs can be rationally designed for DAFC electrocatalysis.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Effect of Mesoporous Metal Oxides Promotes Tandem Catalysis for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis from Nitrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy effect of mesoporous metal oxide electrocatalysts is demonstrated to lower the energy barrier of the hydrodeoxygenation route and thus facilitate two&#8208;step tandem nitrate reduction electrocatalysis for selective ammonia electrosynthesis in a more sustainable manner.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) in water offers a sustainable alternative for robust electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) in ambient conditions. However, NO3&#8722;RR electrocatalysis generally involves two&#8208;step tandem routes and suffers from sluggish hydrodeoxygenation kinetics, which result in a low ammonia selectivity and yield rate. In this work, it is demonstrated that the high&#8208;entropy effect of mesoporous metal oxides remarkably decreases the energy barrier of the hydrodeoxygenation route and facilitates two&#8208;step tandem electrocatalysis of NO3&#8722;RR, which thus promotes selective NH3 electrosynthesis in an alkaline condition. By comparing a series of high&#8208;entropy mesoporous metal oxides and corresponding metal alloys and monometallic counterparts, high&#8208;entropy mesoporous (CoMnFeNiCu)3O4 discloses the highest electrocatalytic performance for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis from NO3&#8722;RR, including remarkable NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 96.3%, high NH3 yield rate of 1.83 mmol h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1, and excellent recycling stability of 20 cycles, representing one of the best electrocatalysts reported in the past three years. Moreover, cathode NO3&#8722;RR performance for selective NH3 electrosynthesis is enhanced when further coupled with the thermodynamically favorable benzyl alcohol oxidation reaction at the anode. It is expected that the high&#8208;entropy effect opens up a new route to design a library of novel tandem mesoporous metal electrocatalysts for the selective electrosynthesis of various valuable chemicals from wastewater.

         <title>Unleashing the Power of Magnetic Particle Imaging: Tailored Magnetic Nanoparticles for Ultrasensitive Detection of Bone Metastases in Prostate Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A temperature&#8208;controlled synthesis strategy is developed to optimize the magnetic diameter of magnetic nanoparticles for enhanced magnetic particle imaging. The resultant Fe310P exhibits an eight&#8208;fold increase in MPI signal intensity compared to the commercial tracer. Subsequent functionalization with engineered macrophage membranes yields Fe3104PMgy&#8208;1, enabling ultrasensitive detection of prostate tumors and bone metastases as small as 0.5&#160;mm in diameter.








Abstract
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a groundbreaking imaging technique hindered by suboptimal tracers, as current magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are primarily designed for magnetic resonance imaging and are not specifically tailored for the distinct physics of MPI. To address this issue, optimizing the magnetic diameter of MNPs is focused on, a pivotal parameter influenced by both physical size and magnetic disorder, yet underexplored in the development of MPI tracers. By employing a precise temperature&#8208;controlled synthesis strategy, this study successfully modulates these parameters synergistically to create high&#8208;performance Fe310P with an optimal magnetic diameter, exhibiting an eight&#8208;fold increase in the MPI signal in vitro compared to the commercial tracer VivoTrax. Further surface functionalization with engineered macrophage membranes expressing a prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA)&#8208;targeting antibody fragment (gy&#8208;1) yields tumor&#8208;targeted Fe3104PMgy&#8208;1, which enables the detection of as few as 800 tumor cells with a single scan, without the need for repeated acquisitions. Compared to VivoTrax, Fe3104PMgy&#8208;1 achieves a 330&#8208;fold enhancement in the MPI signal in vivo, which enables the sensitive detection of prostate tumors and bone metastasis with 0.5&#160;mm in diameter. This study provides valuable insights into the development of advanced MPI tracers, paving the way for broader biomedical applications of MPI.

         <title>Bringing Attomolar Detection to the Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care with Nanopatterned DNA Origami Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single DNA molecules are captured within the hotspots of DNA origami NanoAntennas arranged on a chip surface. Fluorescence is amplified, enabling direct detection on a point&#8208;of&#8208;care&#8208;compatible imaging setup (visualized as bright signals against a dark background).








Abstract
Creating increasingly sensitive and cost&#8208;effective nucleic acid detection methods is critical for enhancing point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) applications. This requires highly specific capture of biomarkers and efficient transduction of capture events.&#160;However, the signal from biomarkers present at extremely low amounts often falls below the detection limit of typical fluorescence&#8208;based methods, necessitating molecular amplification. Here, we present single&#8208;molecule detection of a non&#8208;amplified,&#160;151&#8208;nucleotide sequence specific to antibiotics&#8208;resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae down to attomolar concentrations, using Trident NanoAntennas with Cleared HOtSpots (NACHOS). This NACHOS&#8208;diagnostics assay leverages a compact microscope with a large field&#8208;of&#8208;view, including microfluidic flow to enhance capturing efficiency. Fluorescence enhancement is provided by NanoAntennas, arranged using a combination of nanosphere lithography and site&#8208;specific DNA origami placement. This method can detect 200&#160;&#177; 50 out of 600 molecules in a 100&#160;&#181;L sample volume within an hour. This represents a typical number of pathogens in clinical samples commonly detected by Polymerase Chain Reaction. We achieve similar sensitivity in untreated human plasma, enhancing the practical applicability of the system. This platform can be adapted to detect shorter nucleic acid fragments that are not compatible with traditional amplification&#8208;based technologies. This provides a robust and scalable solution for sensitive nucleic acid detection in diverse clinical settings.

         <title>Perovskite Tandems: the Next Big Leap in Photovoltaic Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tunability of band gap enables wide bandgap perovskites to serve as top subcells shared by various emerging tandem technologies. Based on the application of wide bandgap perovskites in perovskite/silicon, perovskite/perovskite, perovskite/organic, and perovskite/CIGS tandem solar cells, this review outlines the theory, progress, challenges, and future path of wide bandgap perovskites.








Abstract
The global demand for clean energy is driving the need for next&#8208;generation solar technologies with higher power conversion efficiencies. Multijunction solar cells, which stack absorbers with cascaded bandgaps, offer a compelling path forward by more efficiently utilizing the solar spectrum. Among these, metal halide perovskites stand out for their bandgap tunability, enabling efficient tandem solar cells (TSCs) when paired with a range of semiconductors&#8212;including perovskite/perovskite, perovskite/silicon, perovskite/organic, and perovskite/CIGS. Central to these architectures are wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites, which harvest high&#8208;energy, short&#8208;wavelength photons. This review highlights recent advances and challenges in perovskite&#8208;based TSCs, focusing on the photophysical properties and application of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites across different tandem configurations. Future research directions are outlined aimed at enhancing performance and long&#8208;term stability to accelerate industrial deployment.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global demand for clean energy is driving the need for next-generation solar technologies with higher power conversion efficiencies. Multijunction solar cells, which stack absorbers with cascaded bandgaps, offer a compelling path forward by more efficiently utilizing the solar spectrum. Among these, metal halide perovskites stand out for their bandgap tunability, enabling efficient tandem solar cells (TSCs) when paired with a range of semiconductors&#8212;including perovskite/perovskite, perovskite/silicon, perovskite/organic, and perovskite/CIGS. Central to these architectures are wide-bandgap perovskites, which harvest high-energy, short-wavelength photons. This review highlights recent advances and challenges in perovskite-based TSCs, focusing on the photophysical properties and application of wide-bandgap perovskites across different tandem configurations. Future research directions are outlined aimed at enhancing performance and long-term stability to accelerate industrial deployment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Atomic Metal Deposition for an Efficient Dual&#8208;Site Incorporated Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research introduces a low&#8208;temperature atomic metal deposition method using metal carbonyl precursors at 100&#160;&#176;C. The approach is applicable not only to TiO2 but also to various carbon&#8208;based and oxide materials. Among these, W oxo&#8208;clusters stabilize surface oxygen vacancies of TiO2 and have been effectively utilized in the benzene&#8208;to&#8208;phenol reaction. These findings highlight the potential of this simplified and energy&#8208;efficient method for the scalable production of atomically dispersed metal catalysts.








Abstract
A universal, low&#8208;temperature atomic metal deposition (LTAMD) strategy is herein reported for synthesis of atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADMCs) using metal carbonyl precursors. This scalable approach enables the fabrication of diverse ADMCs with various transition metals, including W, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Mo, Ru, Rh, and Re on oxide and carbon&#8208;based supports. Tungsten&#8208;incorporated TiO2 exhibits exceptional photocatalytic benzene oxidation activity, attributed to the generation of surface oxygen vacancies with Ti3+, which act as active reduction sites under aerobic conditions, facilitating the formation of reduced oxygen intermediates. It is demonstrated that tungsten plays a crucial role in stabilizing these oxygen vacancies and promoting electron&#8208;hole separation by accommodating photogenerated holes and activating the C&#9472;H bond of benzene. Leveraging dual&#8208;site photocatalysis, the tungsten&#8208;TiO2 system achieves a remarkable 42.7% yield in the photocatalytic oxidation of benzene to phenol, with high recyclability over ten cycles. By integrating theoretical insights with experimental results, a distinct photocatalytic mechanism is unveiled, driven by the synergistic interaction between atomic tungsten and TiO2. This strategy not only enables the energy&#8208;efficient synthesis of a broad range of ADMCs on various supports but also enhances the intrinsic catalytic properties of the TiO2 photocatalyst without compromising its crystal or electronic structure.

         <title>Albendazole Passivation in Inverted Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells toward Efficient Perovskite/CuInGaSe2 Tandem Photovoltaics</title>

Albendazole (ALB) post&#8208;treatment mitigated [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz) aggregation and poor wettability, enhancing perovskite film crystallinity, optimizing energy&#8208;level alignment, reducing interfacial defects, and enhancing the carrier transport properties, resulting in a 1.67&#160;eV inverted wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cell with 22.68% power conversion efficiency (PCE) and achieving 29.06% efficiency in a four&#8208;terminal tandem with a CuInGaSe2 (CIGS) subcell.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled materials (SAMs) like [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz) are commonly used as hole transport layers (HTLs) in inverted wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells. However, the poor wettability of perovskite precursor solutions on Me&#8208;4PACz and its polarity&#8208;induced aggregation hinder high&#8208;quality film formation. To address these challenges, albendazole (ALB) is introduced as a surface modifier for Me&#8208;4PACz. The ALB solution mitigates the aggregation of Me&#8208;4PACz and promotes the desorption and rearrangement process of weakly bound Me&#8208;4PACz molecules. Concurrently, its Lewis basic moiety improves film quality, reduces buried interfacial defects, and optimizes energy level alignment. Additionally, ALB forms directional &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions with Me&#8208;4PACz, ultimately suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination and facilitating charge carrier transport. As a result, ALB&#8208;optimized inverted WBG perovskite solar cells achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.68%, with unencapsulated devices retaining 93.87% of their initial efficiency after 736&#160;h of continuous maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under illumination. Furthermore, integrating the ALB&#8208;modified semi&#8208;transparent perovskite top cell with a 1.03&#160;eV bandgap CuInGaSe2 (CIGS) bottom cell yields a four&#8208;terminal tandem device with an impressive total efficiency of 29.06%. This dual&#8208;objective strategy provides a simple and effective method for simultaneously improving the film quality of both the HTL and the perovskite layer.

         <title>Crystal Orientation Engineering for Energy Storage and Conversion Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in crystal orientation engineering for energy materials. It discusses orientation&#8208;dependent properties, characterization methods, preparation strategies, and their applications in energy conversion and storage systems. It provides insights into how orientation control enables performance breakthroughs in energy&#8208;related applications and may guide future developments in this emerging field.








Abstract
Nanoscale material design&#160;is crucial to the development of efficient renewable energy and storage technologies. While conventional research paradigms have emphasized material morphology, crystal polymorphs, and defect engineering, recent years have witnessed an emerging research interest in crystal orientation engineering since it can exploit anisotropic material properties to significantly enhance&#160; emerging energy storage and conversion applications. Herein, a comprehensive review of engineering the crystal orientation of materials to improve various energy conversion and storage technologies is provided. First, we discuss the effect of crystal orientation on material properties, including electrical conductivity, dielectric constant, surface energy, surface electronic structure, atom/molecule adsorption ability, and ionic conductivity. Then, the techniques to characterize the crystal orientation, including X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and optical microscopy, are reviewed. After that, effective&#160;strategies to engineer crystal orientation using both bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down approaches are summarized. The advances in crystal orientation engineering in energy conversion (electrocatalysis, solar cells, and nanogenerators) and storage (metal anodes, non&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrode materials, and solid electrolytes) applications are subsequently discussed. Finally, future perspectives on the potential of crystal orientation engineering and its impact on emerging energy transition technologies are summarized.

         <title>Confining Quantum Dots Within Covalent Organic Framework Cages for Coupled CO2 Photoreduction and Value&#8208;Added Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D/0D S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst is constructed by spatially confining ZnSe quantum dots within covalent organic framework (COF) porous cages, enabling coupled CO2 photoreduction and value&#8208;added chemical synthesis. COF porous cages serve as nanoreactors, enriching reactant concentrations, and the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction facilitates charge separation. This synergistic integration of nanoconfinement and S&#8208;scheme charge modulation establishes an efficient and robust bifunctional platform.








Abstract
Coupling photocatalytic CO2 reduction with the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals represents a promising strategy to mitigate carbon emissions while maximizing solar energy utilization. Quantum dots (QDs) are attractive photocatalysts for such tandem reactions, owing to their size&#8208;tunable band structures, abundant surface&#8208;active sites, and strong light&#8208;harvesting capabilities. However, their implementation is often hindered by severe aggregation and sluggish mass transfer, which limit their photocatalytic performance. Herein, a spatially confined 3D/0D covalent organic framework (COF)/ZnSe QDs step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) heterojunction photocatalyst is reported, prepared via an in situ encapsulation strategy, for concurrent CO2 photoreduction and organic transformation. The ZnSe QDs are immobilized within the nanoporous cages of the COF, forming a confined microenvironment that suppresses aggregation, enhances photostability, and promotes efficient mass transfer. As a result, the COF/ZnSe heterostructure achieves a CO generation rate of 128.3 &#181;mol g&#8315;1 h&#8315;1, while synchronously delivering 95.1% conversion of 1&#8208;phenylethanol to 1&#8208;phenylethanone under light irradiation.

     alt="Confining Quantum Dots Within Covalent Organic Framework Cages for Coupled CO2 Photoreduction and Value-Added Chemical Synthesis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 3D/0D S-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst is constructed by spatially confining ZnSe quantum dots within covalent organic framework (COF) porous cages, enabling coupled CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction and value-added chemical synthesis. COF porous cages serve as nanoreactors, enriching reactant concentrations, and the S-scheme heterojunction facilitates charge separation. This synergistic integration of nanoconfinement and S-scheme charge modulation establishes an efficient and robust bifunctional platform.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coupling photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction with the synthesis of value-added chemicals represents a promising strategy to mitigate carbon emissions while maximizing solar energy utilization. Quantum dots (QDs) are attractive photocatalysts for such tandem reactions, owing to their size-tunable band structures, abundant surface-active sites, and strong light-harvesting capabilities. However, their implementation is often hindered by severe aggregation and sluggish mass transfer, which limit their photocatalytic performance. Herein, a spatially confined 3D/0D covalent organic framework (COF)/ZnSe QDs step-scheme (S-scheme) heterojunction photocatalyst is reported, prepared via an in situ encapsulation strategy, for concurrent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction and organic transformation. The ZnSe QDs are immobilized within the nanoporous cages of the COF, forming a confined microenvironment that suppresses aggregation, enhances photostability, and promotes efficient mass transfer. As a result, the COF/ZnSe heterostructure achieves a CO generation rate of 128.3 &#181;mol g&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, while synchronously delivering 95.1% conversion of 1-phenylethanol to 1-phenylethanone under light irradiation. The hierarchical COF matrix acts as a nanoreactor, enriching local CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration within its porous network, while the rationally designed S-scheme heterojunction facilitates directional charge flow, ensuring robust redox selectivity. This work provides a generalizable strategy for designing advanced heterostructured photocatalysts for efficient bifunctional solar chemical conversions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Soft robots with exceptional adaptability and versatility have opened new possibilities for applications in complex and dynamic environments. Thermal actuation has emerged as a promising method among various actuation strategieis, offering distinct advantages such as programmability, light weight, low actuation voltage, and untethered operation. This review provides a comprehensive overview of soft thermal actuators, focusing on their heating mechanisms, material innovations, structural designs, and emerging applications. Heat generation mechanisms including Joule heating, electromagnetic induction, and electromagnetic radiation and heat transfer mechanisms such as fluid convection are discussed. Advances in materials are grouped into two areas: heating materials, primarily based on nanomaterials, and thermally responsive materials including hydrogels, liquid crystal elastomers, and shape&#8208;memory polymers. Structural designs, such as extension, bending, twisting, and 3D deformable configurations, are explored for enabling complex and precise movements. Applications of soft thermal actuators span environmental exploration, gripping and manipulation, biomedical devices for rehabilitation and surgery, and interactive systems for virtual/augmented reality and therapy. The review concludes with an outlook on challenges and future directions, emphasizing the need for further improvement in speed, energy efficiency, and intelligent soft robotic systems. By bridging fundamental principles with cutting&#8208;edge applications, this review aims to inspire further advancements in the field of thermally actuated soft robotics.

         <title>Dual Optimization of Electrolyte and Interface in Na&#8208;&#946;&#8243;&#8208;Al2O3 via Ga3+ Doping for Advanced Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study incorporates Ga3+ into Na&#8208;&#946;&#8243;&#8208;Al2O3, effectively suppressing the formation of the low&#8208;conductivity &#946;&#8242; phase and significantly reducing stacking faults in the sintered samples, while also enhancing the wettability between the electrolyte and sodium metal. The in situ formed Na&#8208;Ga alloy interface further strengthens the stability of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte contact.








Abstract
Na&#8208;&#946;&#8243;&#8208;Al2O3 is a highly promising solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) for solid&#8208;state sodium batteries (SSSBs) with a wide electrochemical stability window and excellent stability against metallic sodium. However, its practical application is hindered by the instability of &#946;&#8243; phase (R3&#175;$\bar 3$m) during sintering, low polycrystalline ionic conductivity at room temperature, and poor interfacial contact with sodium anodes. In this study, a stablized SSSB is obtained via doping Ga3+ into Na1.67Mg0.67Al10.33O17 (NMAO), which also suppresses the formation of the &#946;&#8242; phase (P63/mmc) and decreases stacking faults. After sintering at 1550 &#176;C for 2 h, Na1.67Mg0.67Al9.33GaO17 (NMA9.33GO) exhibits an ionic conductivity of 9.2 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 30 &#176;C, &#8776;1.7 times greater than NMAO. Furthermore, Ga3+ doping enhances the wettability with sodium, achieving superior contact stability and the formation of Na&#8208;Ga alloys at the interface significantly improves electrode&#8208;electrolyte contact stability, achieving a high critical current density (CCD) of 0.8 mA cm&#8722;2 and a low interfacial impedance of 16 &#937; cm2. A quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery assembled with Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) as the cathode demonstrates excellent cycling stability and rate performance, retaining a high discharge capacity of 91 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 C, and maintaining 87% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1 C. This work provides new insights into improving electrolyte performance and interfacial engineering through doping strategies, thereby promoting the development of efficient and long&#8208;term SSSBs.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Electroluminescent Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Efficient Hot&#8208;Exciton Emission from Carbon Quantum Gear Rack</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electroluminescent LED fabricated using DB&#8208;CQG exhibits deep&#8208;blue emission with good color purity, chromaticity coordinates of (0.158, 0.048), a maximum luminance of 4560 cd m&#8722;2, and an EQE of 10.45%, which is aligned with the Rec. 2020 standard for the primary blue color.








Abstract
The quest for exemplary color purity, superior efficiency, and nontoxic deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence remains paramount for developing wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut displays. However, achieving a Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage y value below 0.05, an exceptional external quantum efficiency (EQE), and a low&#8208;efficiency droop in deep&#8208;blue emitters presents a significant challenge. Here, the study reports a deep&#8208;blue emitting carbon quantum gear rack (DB&#8208;CQG) characterized by an emission wavelength of 406 nm and a high quantum yield of 80%. DB&#8208;CQG comprises nine benzene rings and four embedded nitrogen&#8208;centered tripods and exhibits a quasi&#8208;planar configuration that leads to hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) excited&#8208;state characteristics. Both experimental investigations and theoretical calculations revealed the activation of the reverse intersystem crossing channel between the high&#8208;lying triplet state and lowest excited singlet state in DB&#8208;CQG via hot&#8208;exciton mechanism. DB&#8208;CQG exhibits characteristic HLCT behavior with deep&#8208;blue emission owing to the partial overlap of holes and electrons, which is facilitated by the formation of nitrogen&#8208;centered tripods in the quasi&#8208;planar configuration. The electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) fabricated using DB&#8208;CQG exhibit a deep&#8208;blue color with chromaticity coordinates of (0.158, 0.048), a maximum luminance of 4560 cd m&#8722;2, and an EQE of 10.45%, which is one of the highest reported efficiencies for solution&#8208;processable deep&#8208;blue LEDs.

         <title>Personalized 3D Vaccine Integrates Immunotherapy and Antiangiogenic Therapy to Prevent Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Recurrence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ToC Figure Ren et&#160;al. develop 3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L, a 3D&#8208;printed hydrogel vaccine integrating tumor lysates and lenvatinib to mimic lymph node functions. This vaccine recruits immune cells, inhibits angiogenesis, and prevents oral cancer recurrence, ultimately enhancing survival and preserving facial integrity post&#8208;surgery. It represents a novel, clinically translatable approach for postoperative OSCC recurrence treatment.








Abstract
The immune&#8208;suppressive microenvironment and extensive tumor angiogenesis are key contributors to the high recurrence and mortality rates of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). To address these challenges, a personalized 3D&#8208;printed anti&#8208;tumor vaccine (3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L) is developed that integrates whole tumor antigens from postoperative tissue lysates with the angiogenesis inhibitor, lenvatinib. This vaccine not only possesses inherent adjuvant properties but also mimics the functions of lymph nodes through its porous structure, facilitating the recruitment and maturation of immune cells. In vivo studies in OSCC animal models, including mice and rabbits, demonstrate that 3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L effectively recruits and matures immune cells at postoperative sites, inhibits angiogenesis and tumor recurrence, and extends survival time, all while maintaining a stable morphology and an excellent biosafety. Furthermore, 3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L supports facial integrity post&#8208;surgery, addressing physical challenges by preventing collapse and reducing the risk of aesthetic&#8208;related disorders. These findings suggest that 3D&#8208;Vax&#8208;L is a promising therapeutic technique for preventing post&#8208;surgical OSCC relapse, particularly as it offers a new strategy for immune system activation and demonstrates significant potential for clinical translation.

&lt;p&gt;ToC Figure Ren et&#160;al. develop 3D-Vax-L, a 3D-printed hydrogel vaccine integrating tumor lysates and lenvatinib to mimic lymph node functions. This vaccine recruits immune cells, inhibits angiogenesis, and prevents oral cancer recurrence, ultimately enhancing survival and preserving facial integrity post-surgery. It represents a novel, clinically translatable approach for postoperative OSCC recurrence treatment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immune-suppressive microenvironment and extensive tumor angiogenesis are key contributors to the high recurrence and mortality rates of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). To address these challenges, a personalized 3D-printed anti-tumor vaccine (3D-Vax-L) is developed that integrates whole tumor antigens from postoperative tissue lysates with the angiogenesis inhibitor, lenvatinib. This vaccine not only possesses inherent adjuvant properties but also mimics the functions of lymph nodes through its porous structure, facilitating the recruitment and maturation of immune cells. In vivo studies in OSCC animal models, including mice and rabbits, demonstrate that 3D-Vax-L effectively recruits and matures immune cells at postoperative sites, inhibits angiogenesis and tumor recurrence, and extends survival time, all while maintaining a stable morphology and an excellent biosafety. Furthermore, 3D-Vax-L supports facial integrity post-surgery, addressing physical challenges by preventing collapse and reducing the risk of aesthetic-related disorders. These findings suggest that 3D-Vax-L is a promising therapeutic technique for preventing post-surgical OSCC relapse, particularly as it offers a new strategy for immune system activation and demonstrates significant potential for clinical translation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conformal Electrochemical Nanoimprinting of Silicon: Toward Bio&#8208;Inspired Hierarchical Infrared Meta&#8208;Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conformal Mac&#8208;imprint technology employs stretchable porous polymer stamps coated with a gold catalyst that are pneumatically actuated against curved silicon lenses, electrochemically carving micrometer, hierarchical sharklet patterns in a single maskless step. The centimeter&#8208;scale metasurfaces exhibit &lt;1% pitch error, broadband anti&#8208;reflection, offering a durable and robust monolithic pathway to micro&#8208;machining multifunctional photonic coating for harsh environments such as space exploration and the battlefield.








Abstract
Nanostructured anti&#8208;reflection metasurfaces for infrared lenses are designed for imaging in harsh environments such as dust (e.g., moon or battlefield), micrometeorites (e.g., Lagrange points), and high&#8208;radiation fluctuations (e.g., Mars) with limited lifetimes. These multifunctional optical meta&#8208;surfaces (MOMS) simultaneously deliver high thermal stability and anti&#8208;fouling behavior due to their monolithic nature (e.g., no mismatch in the coefficient of thermal expansion), hydrophobicity, and low dust adherence. However, the incompatibility of inorganic semiconductor micromachining with non&#8208;planar substrates has limited MOMS to polymeric and glass lenses. Here, a new method of conformal electrochemical nanoimprinting is presented to directly micromachine a nature&#8208;inspired MOMS onto a silicon lens. Uniquely, stretchablegold&#8208;coated&#160;patterned&#160;porous PVDF stamps are made by lithographically templated thermally induced phase separation (lt&#8208;TIPS), which simultaneously embeds it with (i) interconnected porosity for promoting mass transport, (ii) HF&#8208;resistance for increasing operational lifetime, and (iii) stretchable electronic nanocoatings (i.e., Au) that can catalyze the electrochemical process. In a demonstration of its hierarchical micromachining capability, a sharklet microscale pattern is successfully transferred to a silicon lens with anti&#8208;reflective and hydrophobic properties. This work paves the way for MOMS&#8217; extension onto inorganic semiconductors and IR lenses.

         <title>Strain Engineering of Magnetoresistance and Magnetic Anisotropy in CrSBr</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biaxial compressive strain significantly enhances magnetoresistance and critical saturation fields in thin flakes of the 2D magnet CrSBr, along all three crystallographic axes. First&#8208;principles calculations link these effects to strain&#8208;induced increases in exchange interactions and magnetic anisotropy. These findings establish strain engineering as a powerful route to fine&#8208;tune magnetic properties in 2D materials.









Abstract
Tailoring magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy in van der Waals magnetic materials is essential for advancing their integration into technological applications. In this regard, strain engineering has emerged as a powerful and versatile strategy to control magnetism at the 2D limit. Here, it is demonstrated that compressive biaxial strain significantly enhances the magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy of few&#8208;layer CrSBr flakes. Strain is efficiently transferred to the flakes from the thermal compression of a polymeric substrate upon cooling, as confirmed by temperature&#8208;dependent Raman spectroscopy. This strain induces a remarkable increase in the magnetoresistance ratio and in the saturation fields required to align the magnetization of CrSBr along each of its three crystalographic directions, reaching a twofold enhancement along the magnetic easy axis. This enhancement is accompanied by a subtle reduction of the N&#233;el temperature by &#8776;10 K. The experimental results are fully supported by first&#8208;principles calculations, which link the observed effects to a strain&#8208;driven modification in interlayer exchange coupling and magnetic anisotropy energy. These findings establish strain engineering as a key tool for fine&#8208;tuning magnetotransport properties in 2D magnetic semiconductors, paving the way for implementation in spintronics and information storage devices.

         <title>Mechanochemistry for Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks and Covalent&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs, COFs): Methods, Materials, and Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview is provided of the mechanochemistry of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs), highlighting opportunities and strategies for discovery, synthesis and reactivity studies of these materials. Mechanistic studies and comparisons to the mechanochemistry of organic solids are outlined, showcasing how advances in mechanochemistry promoted the development of MOF chemistry, and vice versa.








Abstract
The mechanochemistry of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is a well&#8208;established field whose development has advanced the understanding and the design of both MOF materials and mechanochemical reactions. This review outlines the close and mutually beneficial interplay of these two fields over the past two decades, including the description of mechanochemical strategies to access MOFs as well as the response of these materials to mechanical treatment and/or stress. Furthermore, we highlight how the use of MOFs as model targets for mechanochemical synthesis simultaneously improves the accessibility and understanding of this class of materials and, conversely, advances the experimental and fundamental understanding of mechanochemical reactions. Similarly, we show the reciprocal benefits of comparing the mechanochemistry of organic molecular solids to that of MOFs. Finally, this review also portrays the rapid emergence of mechanochemistry of covalent&#8208;organic frameworks, a young area that promises to deliver new, rapid, efficient, solventless, and room&#8208;temperature access to these materials.

         <title>Invoking Hybrid&#8208;Ion Correlation Electrochemistry to Enable Optimal Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach that combines phase&#8208;field simulations and thermodynamic calculations is proposed, capturing ionic correlations in electrolytes/electrodes to activate the ionic electrodeposition (left) and (de)intercalation (right) performances in a hybrid&#8208;ion battery. This offers a potent approach to exceed the energy density and cycle life benchmarks set by single&#8208;ion battery technologies.








Abstract
As a generation beyond conventional batteries based on mono&#8208;/poly&#8208;valent ions, hybrid&#8208;ion batteries (HIBs) offer more opportunities to build battery prototypes because they utilize the merits of multiple ions. However, the limited understanding of ionic correlations in these heterogeneous systems experimentally and theoretically brings a great challenge in exploring their performance limits. Here, an approach is proposed combining electrochemical phase&#8208;field simulation with thermodynamic calculation, where ionic correlation in the electrolyte and electrode is addressed using the linearized Poisson&#8208;Boltzmann equation embedded with Debye&#8208;H&#252;ckel theory and ion&#8208;occupied sub&#8208;lattice model, to invoke the ionic electrodeposition and (de)intercalation advantages. This approach is independent of specific HIB electrolytes or electrodes. A &#8220;Seesaw&#8208;Inhibition&#8221; mechanism is uncovered, operating under hybrid&#8208;ion concentration regulation to determine the electrodeposition morphology in three types of HIBs, and simultaneously predict a general ion competitive behavior during their intercalation. Following this, a prototype of Na3V2(PO4)3||1&#160;M NaTfO+1&#160;M Zn(TfO)2||Zn aqueous HIB is built, surpassing pure Zn&#8208;ion batteries by 32% in measured energy density (128.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and exhibiting low capacity decay (0.10% per cycle over 300 cycles). The scalability of the approach for regulating hybrid&#8208;ion electrochemistry demonstrates its practical viability for designing HIBs.

Following this, a prototype of Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;||1&#160;M NaTfO+1&#160;M Zn(TfO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||Zn aqueous HIB is built, surpassing pure Zn-ion batteries by 32% in measured energy density (128.3&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and exhibiting low capacity decay (0.10% per cycle over 300 cycles). The scalability of the approach for regulating hybrid-ion electrochemistry demonstrates its practical viability for designing HIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Architected Soft Actuators for Artificial Musculoskeletal Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An architected soft actuator uses a servo motor and a combination of 3D printed architected elastomers to extend and contract. The actuator exhibits high actuation stroke, force output, and power density for constructing bioinspired artificial musculoskeletal systems. Human&#8208;scale legs with bone&#8208;inspired links, tendons, and three architected soft actuators as artificial muscles can kick and operate continuously on portable battery supplies.








Abstract
Vertebrates depend on their musculoskeletal system for locomotion, manipulation, interaction with their environment, and more. The robustness and efficiency of animal locomotion are difficult to achieve in robots because their hardware does not replicate the mechanics and performance of animal bodies. Moreover, many state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art soft actuators are ill&#8208;suited as muscles in artificial musculoskeletal systems for deployable, task&#8208;capable robots. This study presents an electrically&#8208;driven, architected soft actuator that can be assembled into artificial musculoskeletal systems. The fully 3D printed actuators linearly extend and contract through the rotation of an integrated servo motor. They comprise a thermoplastic polyurethane handed shearing auxetic (HSA) and origami bellows structure. Together, these structures transmit torque, stretch, and resist torsional deflection in a manner that produces large linear actuation and force output up to 59 mm (or 30% strain) and 75 N, respectively. It showcases the actuator's performance as artificial muscles in a battery&#8208;powered, human&#8208;scale leg that can use three muscles to kick a ball. When accounting for the weight of auxiliary hardware, the actuators exhibit power and energy densities that are four orders of magnitude higher than for leading soft artificial muscles. The soft actuators represent a step toward providing robots with bioinspired musculoskeletal systems for animal&#8208;like abilities.

         <title>Playing Hard with Si: Challenges and Opportunities for New Materials in Radiation Therapy Dosimetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon has been a cornerstone material of radiation therapy dosimetry for many decades, providing somewhat unchallenged performance. However, there are caveats to its use, requiring complex designs and, often, correction factors to provide accurate measurements. Alternative materials may provide previously unachievable capabilities, ushering in a new generation of radiation detectors suitable for the ever&#8208;changing landscape of radiation&#160;therapy.








Abstract
The sophistication and diversity of radiation medicine modalities continue to increase significantly in both cancer imaging and cancer radiation therapy. With over 50% of cancer patients receiving some form of radiation procedure as part of their cancer management plan, the importance and impact of quantitative radiation detector systems for quality assurance in radiation medicine should not be underestimated. There are numerous challenges faced by silicon&#8208;based detector systems used for dosimetry in radiation therapy that are discussed in this review article, especially considering emerging radiation therapy modalities that incorporate ultra&#8208;high irradiation dose&#8208;rates (e.g., MRT, FLASH&#8208;RT, VHEE&#8208;RT), while others utilize mixed radiation fields (e.g., proton&#8208;RT, heavy ion therapy) or diffusion&#8208;based dose delivery techniques (e.g., Alpha DaRT). Such challenges create exciting opportunities for new radiation detector materials. This concise review paper explores the role of silicon in radiation detection applications and highlights the challenges it faces in achieving optimal performance. Additionally, this review discusses new materials that are emerging as strong candidates for the next generation of radiation detectors, emphasizing both the opportunities and challenges associated with these&#160;materials.

         <title>Nanometer Resolution Structure&#8208;Emission Correlation of Individual Quantum Emitters via Enhanced Cathodoluminescence in Twisted Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanometer&#8208;resolution mapping of individual quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride is achieved, allowing us to identify the 440&#160;nm blue emitter as a substituted vertical carbon dimer. Leveraging this atomic&#8208;level insight, the deterministic creation of isolated single 440&#160;nm blue emitters is demonstrated through localized electron beam irradiation of carbon&#8208;coated hexagonal boron nitride.








Abstract
Understanding the atomic structure of quantum emitters, often originating from point defects or impuritie, is essential for designing and optimizing materials for quantum technologies such as quantum computing, communication, and sensing. Despite the availability of atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and nanoscale cathodoluminescence microscopy, experimentally determining the atomic structure of individual emitters is challenging due to the conflicting needs for thick samples to generate strong cathodoluminescence signals and thin samples for structural analysis. To overcome this challenge, significantly enhanced cathodoluminescence at twisted interfaces is leveraged to achieve sub&#8208;nanometer localization precision for the first time in mapping individual quantum emitters in carbon&#8208;implanted hexagonal boron nitride. This unprecedent spatial sensitivity, together with correlative electron energy loss spectroscopy quantitative scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging, and first principles density functional theory calculations, enables the identification of the atomic structure of the 440&#160;nm blue emitter in hexagonal boron nitride as a substituted vertical carbon dimer. Building on the atomic structure insights, nanoscale spatially precise creation of blue emitters is demonstrated by electron beam irradiation of carbon&#8208;coated hexagonal boron nitride. This advancement in correlating atomic structures with optical properties lays the foundation for a deeper understanding and precise engineering of quantum emitters, significantly advancing the development of cutting&#8208;edge quantum information technologies.

         <title>Deterministic Memristive Polarization Switching in Relaxor Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work emphasizes the achievement of deterministic multilevel polarization in rhombohedral PMN&#8208;PT through crystallographically &#8208; guided domain engineering, precisely controlling domain switching, overcoming the bistable limitations of traditional ferroelectrics, and providing an innovative strategy for next&#8208;generation ferroelectric memristors and neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
The burgeoning field of neuromorphic computing demands ferroelectric materials exhibiting memristive multilevel polarization to enable high&#8208;density memory storage and brain&#8208;inspired devices. Here, it is demonstrated deterministic multilevel polarization in a relaxor ferroelectric&#8208;rhombohedral PMN&#8208;PT through domain engineering, achieving precise control over stepwise domain switching. Using reciprocal space mapping (RSM) and in situ second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), it is shown that optimized electric pulses guide multi&#8208;domain switching to a 4R engineered domain state, stabilizing memristive behavior. In situ characterization techniques, including transmission electron microscopy and piezoelectric force microscopy, reveal that the memristive behavior arises from local domain rearrangements rather than crystal structure transitions. The resulting multilevel polarization states with up to 20 levels exhibit robust retention (&gt;104 s) and fatigue resistance (&gt;105 cycles) while maintaining high polarizability. Phase&#8208;field simulations corroborate these findings, offering microscopic insights into the repeatability of multilevel polarization. This approach overcomes the bistable limitations of conventional ferroelectrics, enabling stable multilevel polarization states that modulate mechanical, electrical, and optical properties. This results provide a versatile strategy for next&#8208;generation ferroelectric memristors, advancing neuromorphic and reconfigurable computing with minimal compromise in ferroelectric performance.

The resulting multilevel polarization states with up to 20 levels exhibit robust retention (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; s) and fatigue resistance (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cycles) while maintaining high polarizability. Phase-field simulations corroborate these findings, offering microscopic insights into the repeatability of multilevel polarization. This approach overcomes the bistable limitations of conventional ferroelectrics, enabling stable multilevel polarization states that modulate mechanical, electrical, and optical properties. This results provide a versatile strategy for next-generation ferroelectric memristors, advancing neuromorphic and reconfigurable computing with minimal compromise in ferroelectric performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#8220;Rigid&#8208;Flexible&#8221; Strategy Realizes Robust Ultralong Phosphorescence for Multifunctional Display Unit and Photoreceptor Synapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous phosphorescent polymer is realized with a narrow band, long lifetime, and high efficiency by introducing a planar chromophore BCz into polymer PVB through a rigid&#8208;flexible approach. The film has a phosphorescence lifetime of 4.71 s, a phosphorescence efficiency of 42.1%, and a FWHM of 24 nm. Surprisingly, the films exhibit unique photoactivation properties and good environmental stability, enabling storage in high humidity environments for extended periods of time and even in aqueous environments. Full&#8208;color stable phosphorescence emission is achieved through a triplet&#8208;FRET strategy and applied to luminescent displays, 3D printing, and simulation of photoreceptor synapses.








Abstract
Amorphous materials are highly attractive for the development of ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (URTP) due to their ease of processing, scalability, and flexibility. However, the realization of stable URTP polymers remains a great challenge. Here, it is reported a robust and flexible approach to realize high&#8208;quality URTP polymers by doping the organic phosphor into the polymer matrix with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic components. This unique structure enables double confinement of the triplet exciton of phosphor, resulting in ultra&#8208;bright amorphous URTP films. URTP films exhibit narrow&#8208;band emission, ultra&#8208;long phosphorescence lifetime, ultra&#8208;high phosphorescence efficiency, and distinctive photoactivation properties, with intense phosphorescence emission observable even in daylight. Furthermore, it is demonstrated color&#8208;tunable emission through f&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and explores its potential applications in 3D printing, patterned displays, and bionic photoreceptor synapses. The work provides valuable insights into the design of robust, high&#8208;quality phosphorescent materials, which could pave the way for a wide range of applications in display and bionic technologies.

         <title>Fast Potassium&#8208;Ion Conduction in K3LnSi3O9 (Ln = Y and Gd) Enabled by P&#8208;Doping Toward Ultrastable Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

A new silicate electrolyte and synthesized K2.8GdP0.2Si2.8O9 is is developed which exhibits an ionic conductivity of 2.9 &#215; 10&#8722;5 S cm&#8722;1 via a rational vacancy design strategy. DFT calculations show that potassium ions diffuse on the ac plane. The assembled quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state KC/K2.8GdP0.2Si2.8O9/PB cell achieves a remarkable cycling performance at a high current density of 1 C.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state potassium&#8208;ion batteries are promising options for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their high safety and abundance of potassium resources. However, solid&#8208;state potassium&#8208;ion batteries are still in their infancy and the reported electrolyte materials are very limited, making the exploration of solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and physical/electrochemical stability a major challenge. Here novel triclinic K3LnSi3O9 (Ln = Y and Gd) potassium&#8208;ion solid electrolyte is reported with low activation energy and high stability. A rational vacancy design strategy is adopted to synthesize K3&#8722;xGdPxSi3&#8722;xO9 and the result of DFT calculation shows that the diffusion pathways of potassium ions on the ac plane exhibit a fish scale&#8208;like network structure. Specifically, the K2.8GdP0.2Si2.8O9 delivers a high ionic conductivity of 2.9 &#215; 10&#8722;5 S cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C, accompanied by a stable potassium stripping/plating (a long&#8208;life cycle over 2000&#160;h). As a result, the assembled quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state KC/K2.8GdP0.2Si2.8O9/PB cell achieves a remarkable cycling performance at a high current density of 1 C (500 cycles, 95.9% capacity retention). These results would no doubt boost research for high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state potassium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Multigrain Ruthenium Nanocrystals with Enriched (101&#175;${{\bar{1}}}$1) Facets for Enhanced Hydrogen Oxidation in Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multigrain Ru nanocatalyst with abundant (101&#175;${{\bar{1}}}$1) facets shows&#160;exceptional hydrogen oxidation activity and stability up to 0.3 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode in alkali. It achieves peak power densities of 1.06 and 1.31 W cm&#8315;2 in hydrogen&#8208;air and hydrogen&#8208;oxygen fuel cells, respectively, and retains performance over 60 h with negligible decay.








Abstract
Ruthenium&#8208;based materials are promising alternatives to expensive platinum for the anodic hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), but face stability issues due to the strong oxophilicity. Here, an oxidation&#8208;resistant ruthenium multigrain catalyst is reported that exposes rich (101&#175;${{\bar{1}}}$1) facets for high&#8208;performing HOR catalysis in alkaline electrolytes. The catalyst exhibits a high kinetic current density of 61&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of 50&#160;mV, which is 25.6&#8208; and 7.8&#8208;times higher than that of commercial ruthenium&#8208;carbon and platinum&#8208;carbon catalysts, respectively. Moreover, it also demonstrates a wide stability window up to 0.3&#160;V versus the reverse hydrogen electrode and enhanced tolerance to carbon monoxide. An AEMFC containing this catalyst at the anode achieves peak power densities of 1.31 and 1.06&#160;W cm&#8722;2 under hydrogen&#8208;oxygen and hydrogen&#8208;air conditions at 90&#160;&#176;C, respectively, and operates steadily. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the (101&#175;${{\bar{1}}}$1) facet possesses a higher oxidation barrier and lower hydrogen oxidation barrier than the common (0002) facets, enabling the exceptional HOR performances in alkali.

         <title>Rational Design of High&#8208;Entropy Garnet Electrolytes via Computational Screening for Stable Lithium Interfaces in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design strategy stabilizes HE&#8208;LLZO by combining thermodynamic assessments and compositional engineering. Through degradation mechanism exploration, lithium&#8208;compatible elements are selected, and unstable dopants (e.g., Nb, Mo, W, Cr, Bi) are excluded. A novel HE&#8208;LLZO (Li6.6La3Zr0.4Sn0.4Hf0.4Sc0.2Ta0.6O12) exhibits high ionic conductivity (3.69 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1) and stable cycling over 2,500 h.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries offer enhanced safety and energy density by replacing flammable liquid electrolytes with solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). High&#8208;entropy (HE) SSEs, leveraging multi&#8208;principal&#8208;element compositions, present a vast design space to achieve exceptional ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. However, the chemical complexity of HE SSEs introduces challenges in interfacial instability with lithium metal anodes due to the unavoidable inclusion of reactive elements. While conventional garnet&#8208;type SSEs are considered stable, it is revealed that five HE garnets (HE&#8208;LLZOs) undergo corrosion and partial dissolution upon lithium contact. Here, a rational design strategy is introduced to stabilize HE&#8208;LLZO by combining thermodynamic assessments of interfacial reactivity with targeted compositional engineering. Through systematic exploration of element&#8208;specific degradation mechanisms, selection criteria for lithium&#8208;compatible principal elements are established. Guided by computational screening, unstable dopants are excluded (e.g., Nb, Mo, W, Cr, Bi) that drive interfacial degradation and synthesize a novel HE&#8208;LLZO (Li6.6La3Zr0.4Sn0.4Hf0.4Sc0.2Ta0.6O12) that exhibits high ionic conductivity (3.69 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1) and stable cycling over 2,500 h. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the interfacial stability of Zr, Sn, and Ta while identifying Nb as a destabilizing element. This work provides an integrated computational&#8208;experimental framework for understanding element&#8208;property relationships in HE oxides, advancing durable SSEs design.

&lt;p&gt;All-solid-state lithium metal batteries offer enhanced safety and energy density by replacing flammable liquid electrolytes with solid-state electrolytes (SSEs). High-entropy (HE) SSEs, leveraging multi-principal-element compositions, present a vast design space to achieve exceptional ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. However, the chemical complexity of HE SSEs introduces challenges in interfacial instability with lithium metal anodes due to the unavoidable inclusion of reactive elements. While conventional garnet-type SSEs are considered stable, it is revealed that five HE garnets (HE-LLZOs) undergo corrosion and partial dissolution upon lithium contact. Here, a rational design strategy is introduced to stabilize HE-LLZO by combining thermodynamic assessments of interfacial reactivity with targeted compositional engineering. Through systematic exploration of element-specific degradation mechanisms, selection criteria for lithium-compatible principal elements are established. Guided by computational screening, unstable dopants are excluded (e.g., Nb, Mo, W, Cr, Bi) that drive interfacial degradation and synthesize a novel HE-LLZO (Li&lt;sub&gt;6.6&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Hf&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Sc&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) that exhibits high ionic conductivity (3.69 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and stable cycling over 2,500 h. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the interfacial stability of Zr, Sn, and Ta while identifying Nb as a destabilizing element. This work provides an integrated computational-experimental framework for understanding element-property relationships in HE oxides, advancing durable SSEs design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harnessing Rapid Li+/H&#948;+ Exchange within the Electric Double Layer for High Performance Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At charged interfaces, the electropositive aprotic hydrogen (H&#948;+) and lithium &#8208; ions (Li+) exhibit comparable electrostatic responses, resulting in their competitive coordination with the solvent oxygen sites. The electric double layer&#8208;governed Li+/H&#948;+ exchange substantially promotes interfacial Li&#8314; de&#8208;solvation to suppress graphite exfoliation and contributes to an expanded oxidation stability window of the electrolyte.








Abstract
The electric double layer (EDL) plays a pivotal role in governing interfacial composition and electrode behavior in electrochemical systems. However, the intricate relationship between EDL architectures and electrochemical processes remains elusive. Here the fundamental significance of hydrogen bond polarity within the EDL in orchestrating the interfacial lithium&#8208;ions (Li+) exchange dynamics is elucidated. At charged interfaces, the electropositive aprotic hydrogen (H&#948;+) and Li+ ions exhibit comparable electrostatic responses, resulting in their competitive effect for the solvent oxygen sites, which modulates the de&#8208;solvation process and ultimately impacts battery performance. Based on this, a solvent&#8208;centered de&#8208;solvation mechanism is proposed, wherein the microenvironment with enhanced hydrogen polarity in the EDL facilitates solvent displacement from Li+ coordination shells. Furthermore, the presence of polar hydrogen at charged cathode interface can effectively anchor uncoordinated solvents molecules, increasing the energy barrier for detrimental dehydrogenation reaction. As a result, electrolytes design based on this strategy enables remarkable electrochemical stability, achieving over 2000 cycles in a 5&#160;V dual&#8208;ion battery. In addition, the Gr||NCM811 pouch cell exhibits exceptional longevity, retaining 90.2% of its initial capacity after 1000 cycles.

Polarization Sensitive Vacuum&#8208;Ultraviolet Photodetectors
In article number 2503846, Le Chen, Hongwei Liang, Hong Yin, and colleagues develop wafer&#8208;scale low&#8208;symmetry m&#8208;plane h&#8208;BN epitaxial films with strong anisotropy, achieving polarization detection in the VUV region. The anisotropic m&#8208;plane h&#8208;BN harvests a polarization ratio of 6.2 for 188 nm polarized light, reaching the short&#8208;wavelength limit of existing direct detection technologies. This work demonstrates a novel strategy for polarized VUV photodetectors and paves the way for novel integrated optoelectronics based on traditional 2D materials.

Concentric Supraparticle Architecture
Precise concentric layers define self&#8208;assembled multilayered supraparticles (SAMS), a novel architecture achieved through a three&#8208;way interaction of gold nanoparticles, gelatin, and lipidoid. This unique design facilitates environmentally triggered disassembly and efficient in vivo siRNA delivery for gene silencing. SAMS represent an efficient integration of structural control and therapeutic function, marking a significant step forward in nanomedicine and complex supraparticle synthesis. More details can be found in article number 2502055 by Raghuraman Kannan and co&#8208;workers.

Multiferroic Materials
Electric&#8208;field driven reversal of magnetization in (110)&#8208;oriented Co&#8208;substituted BiFeO3 thin films at room temperature is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated by Takuma Itoh, Kei Shigematsu, Hena Das, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2419580. The frontispiece shows that an in&#8208;plane electric field through the thin film leads to the reversal of the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane component of magnetization, which is particularly desirable for memory device applications.

Magnetic Properties
Ultrasensitive mechanical detection of antiferromagnetic spin texture in a 2D magnetic crystal MnPS3 is achieved through nanomechanical resonators. Collective magnetic domain transitions were observed from the abrupt frequency jumps in both the linear and nonlinear resonator responses. The results indicate rich and fluid&#8208;like dynamics between the coupled spin and lattice at the transition field, and will inspire the next&#8208;generation nanomechanical devices coupled with spin textures for both classical and quantum information technologies. More details can be found in article number 2420168 by Elton J. G. Santos, Philip X.&#8208;L. Feng, Xiao&#8208;Xiao Zhang, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>All&#8208;Inorganic Tin&#8208;Containing Perovskite Solar Cells: An Emerging Eco&#8208;Friendly Photovoltaic Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent progress of all&#8208;inorganic Sn&#8208;containing PSCs in the aspects of efficiency and stability, including the basic properties and degradation mechanisms/pathways of pristine Sn and mixed Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites, as well as various strategies to improve the photovoltaic performance of devices, discuss the existing challenges in this field, and look forward to the prospects for further improvement.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic tin (Sn)&#8208;containing perovskites have emerged as highly promising photovoltaic materials for single&#8208;junction and tandem perovskite solar cells (PSCs), owing to their reduced toxicity, optimal narrow bandgap, and superior thermal stability. Since their initial exploration in 2012, significant advancements have been achieved, with the highest efficiencies of single&#8208;junction and tandem devices now surpassing 17% and 22%, respectively. Nevertheless, the intrinsic challenges associated with the oxidation susceptibility of Sn2+ and the uncontrolled crystallization dynamics impede their further development. Addressing these issues necessitates a comprehensive and systematic understanding of the degradation mechanisms inherent to all&#8208;inorganic Sn&#8208;containing perovskites, as well as the development of effective mitigation strategies. This review provides a detailed overview of the research progress in all&#8208;inorganic Sn&#8208;containing PSCs, with a particular focus on the basic properties and degradation pathways of both pristine Sn and mixed Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites. Furthermore, various strategies to improve the efficiency and stability of Sn&#8208;containing PSCs are thoroughly discussed. Finally, the existing challenges and perspectives are provided for further improving the photovoltaic performance of eco&#8208;friendly PSCs.

         <title>Mechanostimulatory Platform for Improved CAR T Cell Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel T&#8208;cell mechanostimulatory platform with controlled elasticity and nanotopography optimize T&#8208;cell activation by reducing T&#8208;cell exhaustion and enhancing central memory T&#8208;cell differentiation. This platform is utilized for the generation of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells, demonstrating improved antitumor efficacy, as validated through ex vivo and in vivo studies.








Abstract
Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CAR T) cell immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, yet it is hindered by rapid T&#8208;cell exhaustion caused by uncontrolled activation during CAR generation. Leveraging insights into T&#8208;cell mechanosensing, a novel mechanostimulatory platform is engineered for T&#8208;cell activation based on an antigen&#8208;carrying surface with controlled elasticity and nanotopography. The platform is designed to optimize and balance T&#8208;cell exhaustion, proliferation, and CAR expression. It enhances the differentiation of T cells into the central memory subset, which is crucial for the persistence of CAR T cell therapy's anticancer effects. The platform produces CAR T cells with higher antitumor efficacy, as validated through ex vivo experiments, and with higher in vivo persistence and ability to suppress tumor proliferation, as compared to CAR T cells generated by standard protocols. RNA&#8208;seq analysis confirmed an increased transcriptional signature of central memory T cells. Furthermore, this platform completely eliminates T&#8208;cell toxicity associated with the non&#8208;viral transfection process typically observed with standard activation methods. This platform presents a promising pathway for improving the efficiency and safety of CAR T cell therapy.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Photodetectors Based On Band Engineering and Ferroelectric Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ga2O3&#8208;based deep&#8208;ultraviolet photodetectors achieve high&#8208;sensitivity detection under low operating voltage and ultraweak light intensity conditions, enabled by effective carrier separation and transport through BaTiO3 interlayer modulation.








Abstract
Wide bandgap semiconductors have emerged as a class of deep&#8208;ultraviolet sensitive materials, showing great potentials for next&#8208;generation integrated devices. Yet, to achieve a high photoresponse of deep&#8208;ultraviolet detector without complicated designs at low supply voltage and weak light intensity is challenging. Herein, a new way is designed to fabricate an ultrasensitive vertical&#8208;structured photodetector with epitaxial 7&#160;nm BaTiO3 interlayer and 10&#160;nm Ga2O3 photosensitive layer, realizing the detection to a rare weak deep UV light intensity (0.1&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) at a voltage under 4.8&#160;V and demonstrating a surge in responsivity up to 1.1&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 with ultrafast response of 0.24 &#181;s/33.4 &#181;s (rise/decay). A responsivity of 3.8&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1 at 0&#160;V also has been reached. The dark current is suppressed by enlarged conduction band offset and meanwhile the photocurrent is enhanced by unidirectional conducting valance band offset, which formed by BaTiO3 interlayer. BaTiO3 also contributes most to the photoresponse at 0&#160;V through its ferroelectric depolarization electric field. These results provide a path toward high&#8208;sensitive, low&#8208;power&#8208;consumption, and highly&#8208;integrated deep&#8208;ultraviolet detection, beyond conventional ones.

         <title>Ultrafast Laser Synthesis of Zeolites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study presents a novel ultrafast laser&#8208;driven synthesis technique for zeolites directly in liquid. Laser pulses create a microscopic reactor that controls reaction kinetics at femto&#8208; and picosecond timescales. Nonlinear light&#8208;matter interactions drive nucleation and growth, allowing the process to be paused at any stage of self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
Research demonstrates that zeolite nucleation and growth can be controlled by fine&#8208;tuning chemical composition, temperature, and pressure, resulting in structures with diverse porosities and functionalities. Nevertheless, current energy delivery methods lack the finesse required to operate on the femto&#8208; and picosecond timescales of silica polymerization and depolymerization, limiting their ability to direct synthesis with high precision. To overcome this limitation, an ultrafast laser synthesis technique is introduced, capable of delivering energy at these timescales with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision. Unlike conventional or emerging approaches, this method bypasses the need for specific temperature and pressure settings, as nucleation and growth are governed by dynamic phenomena arising from nonlinear light&#8211;matter interactions, such as convective flows, cavitation bubbles, plasma formation, and shock waves. These processes can be initiated, paused, and resumed within fractions of a second, effectively &#8220;freezing&#8221; structures at any stage of self&#8208;assembly. Using this approach, the entire nucleation and growth pathway of laser&#8208;synthesized TPA&#8208;silicate&#8208;1 zeolites is traced, from early oligomer formation to fully developed crystals. The unprecedented spatiotemporal control of this technique unlocks new avenues for manipulating reaction pathways and exploring the vast configurational space of zeolites.

         <title>Multifunctional Logic Gates via Coexistent Positive and Negative Photoconductivity of a Single Bi2Se3 Photodetector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional optoelectronic logic gate is presented based on the coexistence of PPC (Positive Photoconductivity) and NPC(Negative Photoconductivity) in the 2D material Bi2Se3 at different wavelengths. Five logic gate signals (OR, AND, NOT, NOR, and NAND) can be modulated by inputting different wavelengths of light through a single Bi2Se3 photodetector, offering a new method for simple&#8208;structured OELGs.








Abstract
Because existing electronic logic gates have some limitations in the era of information explosion, the demand for substantial amounts of data processing has aroused interest in new types of logic gates. The use of optoelectronic materials to prepare logic gates is popular; however, they often have complex structures, high power consumption, and low reliability. Herein, a new optoelectronic logic gate (OELG) is presented based on the coexistence of positive and negative photoconductivities in the 2D material Bi2Se3 at different wavelengths. Five logic gate signals (OR, AND, NOT, NOR, and NAND) can be modulated by inputting different wavelengths of light (405 and 808 nm) through a single Bi2Se3 photodetector, offering a new method for simple&#8208;structured OELGs. For practical applications, five logic gate output signals are modulated with 100% accuracy on an 8 &#215; 8 pixel array, and simple imaging and logical processing of the images are demonstrated.

Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) emitters based on Tr&#246;ger's base analogues bearing two peripheral fluorophores (anthracene, pyrene or 9,9&#8208;dimethylfluorene) are prepared following a straightforward and versatile synthetic approach from common precursors. The use of configurationally stable ethano&#8208;bridged Tr&#246;ger's base analogs leads to an acid/base&#8208;driven CPL switch.








Abstract
A way to prevent the fast configurational interconversion of tertiary amines is to invoke Tr&#246;ger's base analogs, which display methano&#8208; or ethano&#8208;bridged diazocine cores fused to aromatic rings. These derivatives are configurationally stable, even in acidic media when their structures bear ethylene bridges. Here, a two&#8208; to three&#8208;step synthesis is presented of methano&#8208; and ethano&#8208;bridged Tr&#246;ger's base analogs with two peripheral fluorophores, i.e., anthracene, pyrene, and 9,9&#8208;dimethylfluorene units. These compounds, possessing two nitrogen stereogenic centers, exhibit good circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) dissymmetry factors (|glum| up to 1.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3) and brightnesses (BCPL up to 26.3 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1), as well as excellent fluorescence quantum yields, demonstrating the Tr&#246;ger&#180;s base core to be a convenient scaffold to prepare CPL emitters upon functionalization with simple achiral fluorophores. Furthermore, the configurationally stable ethano&#8208;bridged Tr&#246;ger's base analogs are employed to modulate their CPL response, generating a CPL switch through their protonation/deprotonation by consecutive additions of acid and base. The reversibility of the switching process is demonstrated for two cycles without altering the CPL performance of the molecule. It is believed that this straightforward and efficient approach to building CPL emitters employing the Tr&#246;ger's base core could lead to its incorporation in CPL&#8208;based sensors and materials.

         <title>Acoustic Moir&#233; Flat Bands in Twisted Heterobilayer Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research proposes a heterobilayer moir&#233; acoustic metasurface using two distinct lattice structures. The heterobilayer design contributes to divergent dispersion curves for the upper and lower layers and allows for greater flexibility in tuning their hybridization through interlayer twisting. This metasurface enables tunable magic angles and topological states, significantly broadening the potential applications of acoustic wave manipulation.








Abstract
Twisted bilayer systems enable a fundamental platform for engineering novel physical phenomena, such as topological phase transitions, polaritons, flat bands, and superconductivity. However, previous reports mainly focused on homobilayer structures, where each layer has identical configurations. In this work, a twisted heterobilayer (tHB) metasurface with strong anisotropy is presented. It is shown that hybridizing the dispersion curves of two different profiles significantly enhances the application potential of bilayer structures. It is observed that when two stacked heterogeneous metasurfaces are rotated to a specific angle, a topological phase transition occurs, which is accompanied by hyperbolic to elliptical wave propagation characteristics. At a specific &#8220;magic angle&#8221;, the dispersion curves of the two layers merge into a flat band with drastically reduced diffraction, enabling sound waves to propagate with minimal energy dissipation. Furthermore, the performance of the tHB system is robust to defects or disorders, manifested by minimal changes before and after introducing line defects into the layers. Our findings overcome the limitations of homogeneous metasurface and provide new ideas for controlling sound&#8208;material interactions.

         <title>Mechanochromic, Low&#8208;Cost, and Structurally Colored Displays Using Biodegradable Hydroxypropyl Cellulose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochromic hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) integrated with microfluidic devices creates scalable, eco&#8208;friendly reflective color displays. We demonstrate mechanochromic displays with 500 &#181;m pixel size and 5Hz switching rates with room for optimisation. The proposed mechanochromic HPC displays are an initial step toward more environmentally responsible color display and pixel technologies.








Abstract
Mechanochromic materials have garnered significant interest over the past decade due to their ability to change color in response to mechanical cues. While it is known that hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) self&#8208;assembles into biodegradable and low&#8208;cost mechanochromic materials, with a wide range of applications from edible colorants to optical strain sensors, mechanochromic HPC displays themselves are not reported. Here we address this challenge by combining thin mechanochromic HPC films with microfluidic arrays of inflatable microactuators that exert controlled forces. With these devices, the mechanochromic strain sensitivity, color resolution, response times, and operating frequencies of photonic aqueous HPC films are measured at decreasing length scales for the first time. Various pixel sizes, geometry, and input frequencies are also assessed to investigate mechanochromic HPC as a potential low&#8208;cost, biodegradable display. Potential applications range from dynamic color pixels for soft robotics to more environmentally responsible RGB display technology.

Electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced magnetization reversal is a long&#8208;sought&#8208;after achievement in materials engineering for use in next&#8208;generation, ultra&#8208;low power consumption memory devices. This work demonstrates fully electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven switching of the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane component of magnetization in (110)&#8208;oriented Co&#8208;substituted BiFeO3 thin films at room temperature, enabled through careful engineering of thin film boundary conditions and crystallography.








Abstract
While multiferroic materials are attractive systems for the promise of ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power&#8208;consumption computational technologies, electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced magnetization reversal is a key challenge for realizing devices at scale. Though significant research efforts have been working toward the realization of a material which couples ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, there are few, even composite, systems which are practical for device scale applications at room temperature. Co&#8208;substituted multiferroic BiFe0.9Co0.1O3 is a promising candidate system, due to coupled ferroelectricity and weak ferromagnetism at room temperature. Here, it is theoretically indicated that the ferroic orders in this material are statically coupled, where an in&#8208;plane 109&#176; ferroelectric switching event can result in the reversal of this out&#8208;of&#8208;plane component of magnetization, and the electric field&#8208;induced magnetization reversal is experimentally observed. Such an in&#8208;plane poling configuration is particularly desirable for device applications.

         <title>Characterization and Inverse Design of Stochastic Mechanical Metamaterials Using Neural Operators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a DeepONet&#8208;based machine learning framework for designing stochastic mechanical metamaterials with tailored nonlinear mechanical properties. By leveraging sparse but high&#8208;quality experimental data from in situ micro&#8208;mechanical tests, high predictive accuracy and enable efficient inverse design are achieved. This approach integrates experimental mechanics and AI, advancing next&#8208;generation metamaterials for aerospace, healthcare, and energy applications.








Abstract
Machine learning (ML) is emerging as a transformative tool for the design of mechanical metamaterials, offering properties that far surpass those achievable through lab&#8208;based trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods. However, a major challenge in current inverse design strategies is their reliance on extensive computational and/or experimental datasets, which becomes particularly problematic for designing micro&#8208;scale stochastic architected materials that exhibit nonlinear mechanical behaviors. Here, a comprehensive end&#8208;to&#8208;end scientific ML framework, leveraging deep neural operators (including DeepONet and its variants) is introduced, to directly learn the relationship between the complete microstructure and mechanical response of architected metamaterials from sparse but high&#8208;quality in situ experimental data. Various neural operators and standard neural networks are systematically compared to identify the model that offers better interpretability and accuracy. The approach facilitates the efficient inverse design of structures tailored to specific nonlinear mechanical behaviors. Results obtained from stochastic spinodal microstructures, printed using two&#8208;photon lithography, reveal that the prediction error for mechanical responses is within a range of 5 &#8208; 10%. This work underscores that by employing neural operators with advanced nano&#8208; and micro&#8208;mechanical experiments, the design of complex micro&#8208;architected materials with desired properties becomes feasible, even in scenarios constrained by data scarcity. This work marks a significant advancement in the field of materials&#8208;by&#8208;design, potentially heralding a new era in the discovery and development of next&#8208;generation metamaterials with unparalleled mechanical characteristics derived directly from experimental&#160;insights.

Here, a comprehensive end-to-end scientific ML framework, leveraging deep neural operators (including DeepONet and its variants) is introduced, to directly learn the relationship between the complete microstructure and mechanical response of architected metamaterials from sparse but high-quality in situ experimental data. Various neural operators and standard neural networks are systematically compared to identify the model that offers better interpretability and accuracy. The approach facilitates the efficient inverse design of structures tailored to specific nonlinear mechanical behaviors. Results obtained from stochastic spinodal microstructures, printed using two-photon lithography, reveal that the prediction error for mechanical responses is within a range of 5 - 10%. This work underscores that by employing neural operators with advanced nano- and micro-mechanical experiments, the design of complex micro-architected materials with desired properties becomes feasible, even in scenarios constrained by data scarcity. This work marks a significant advancement in the field of materials-by-design, potentially heralding a new era in the discovery and development of next-generation metamaterials with unparalleled mechanical characteristics derived directly from experimental&#160;insights.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanical Resonant Sensing of Spin Texture Dynamics in a 2D Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detection of antiferromagnetic spin texture in a 2D magnetic crystal is achieved through nanomechanical resonators at radio frequencies. Sharp magnetic transitions that lead to abrupt changes in mechanical linear and nonlinear responses are assigned to antiferromagnetic domain motions. The results indicate rich and fluid&#8208;like dynamics between the coupled spin and lattice at the transition field.








Abstract
The coupling between the spin degrees of freedom and macroscopic mechanical motions, including striction, shearing, and rotation, has attracted wide interest with applications in actuation, transduction, and information processing. Experiments so far have established the mechanical responses to the long&#8208;range ordered or isolated single spin states. However, it remains elusive whether mechanical motions can couple to a different type of magnetic structure, the non&#8208;collinear spin textures, which exhibit nanoscale spatial variations of spin (domain walls, skyrmions, etc.) and are promising candidates to realize high&#8208;speed computing devices. Here, collective spin texture dynamics is detected with nanoelectromechanical resonators fabricated from&#160;2D antiferromagnetic (AFM) MnPS3 with 10&#8722;9 strain sensitivity. By examining radio frequency mechanical oscillations under magnetic fields, new magnetic transitions are identified with sharp dips in resonant frequency. They are attributed to collective AFM domain wall motions as supported by the analytical modeling of magnetostriction and large&#8208;scale spin&#8208;dynamics simulations. Additionally, an abnormally large modulation in the mechanical nonlinearity at the transition field infers a fluid&#8208;like response due to ultrafast domain motion. The work establishes a strong coupling between spin texture and mechanical dynamics, laying the foundation for electromechanical manipulation of spin texture and developing quantum hybrid devices.

         <title>Controlled Formation of Skyrmion Bags</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates stabilization of complex magnetic skyrmion bags in ferromagnetic thin films through precisely engineered anisotropy defects using ion irradiation. The researchers achieve controlled field&#8208; and laser&#8208;induced generation of skyrmionia, target skyrmions, and higher&#8208;order skyrmion bags at room temperature. This reliable platform opens opportunities for studying the dynamics of these topological textures and their implementation in advanced spintronic devices.








Abstract
Topologically non&#8208;trivial magnetic solitons are complex spin textures with a distinct single&#8208;particle nature. Although magnetic skyrmions, especially those with unity topological charge, have attracted substantial interest due to their potential applications, more complex topological textures remain largely theoretical. In this work, the stabilization of isolated higher&#8208;order skyrmion bags beyond the prototypical &#960;&#8208;skyrmion in ferromagnetic thin films is experimentally demonstrate, which has posed considerable challenges to date. Specifically, controlled generation of skyrmionium (2&#960;&#8208;skyrmion), target skyrmion (3&#960;&#8208;skyrmion), and skyrmion bags (with variable topological charge) are achieved through the introduction of artificially engineered anisotropy defects via local ion irradiation. They act as preferential sites for the field&#8208; or laser&#8208;induced nucleation of skyrmion bags. Remarkably, ultrafast laser pulses achieve a substantially higher conversion rate transforming skyrmions into higher&#8208;order skyrmion bags compared to their formation driven by magnetic fields. High&#8208;resolution x&#8208;ray imaging enables direct observation of the resulting skyrmion bags. Complementary micromagnetic simulations reveal the pivotal role of defect geometry&#8211;particularly diameter&#8211;in stabilizing closed&#8208;loop domain textures. The findings not only broaden the experimental horizon for skyrmion research, but also suggest strategies for exploiting complex topological spin textures within a unified material platform for practical&#160;applications.

         <title>In Situ Tailored Frustrated Lewis Pairs on Asymmetric Bi&#9472;Ov&#9472;In Motifs Domino&#8208;Direct High&#8208;Efficiency Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A domino&#8208;oriented electrosynthesis strategy to access urea of unprecedented selectivity from CO2 and NO3&#8722; is implemented over a Bi&#8208;doped In2O3 catalyst with asymmetric Bi&#9472;Ov&#9472;In sites. The kinetically preferred NO3RR driving the tandem CO2 activation and C&#9472;N coupling by in situ tailored controllable SFLPs (Bi&#9472;Ov&#9472;In&#9472;NH2) to complete urea electrosynthesis does not involve CO2RR.








Abstract
The green urea synthesis via co&#8208;electrolysis of waste nitrate and CO2 is alluring but challenging, especially with insufficient selectivity caused by thermodynamic differences and kinetic mismatch between multi&#8208;step conversion processes. Here, a domino effect&#8208;oriented electrosynthesis strategy is showcased to steer cascade reactions in upgrading nitrate and CO2 toward urea of high selectivity on Bi&#8208;doped In2O3 with asymmetric oxygen vacancies (Ov). The conventionally arbitrary reaction mode can be vectored and re&#8208;customized by stable and cumulative *NH2 intermediates in situ derived from priority nitrate reduction reaction, which not only form surface frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLPs, Bi&#9472;Ov&#9472;In&#9472;NH2) with Bi Lewis acid sites to synergistically adsorb and activate CO2 but also provide more opportunities for sluggish C&#9472;N coupling, delivering an unprecedented urea Faradic efficiency of 80.2% and an impressive urea yield of 2.38 &#215; 103&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.4&#160;V versus RHE. The atomically dispersed Bi sites promote the protonation of *NO to form nucleophilic *NH2 intermediates, which can be stabilized in the electrophilic region mediated by asymmetric Ov, permitting two nucleophilic attacks to complete the C&#9472;N coupling. The domino modeling protocol via positioning a specific intermediate in situ tailors the parallel conversion process and may guide selectivity control of electrosynthesis.

         <title>Strain Gradient Induced Skyrmion in a van der Waals Magnet by Wrinkling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 enables field&#8208;free skyrmion generation via wrinkling&#8208;induced deformation. The opposing in&#8208;plane strain gradients across the wrinkle's peak/valley drive asymmetric domain evolution: skyrmion nucleation occurs on one flank while labyrinthine domain patterns persist on the counterpart. This asymmetry originates from strain&#8208;gradient&#8208;mediated differential modulation of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction.








Abstract
Magnetic structures are profoundly influenced by mechanical deformation. In particular, strain has been employed to achieve the reconstruction of magnetic domains, paving a mechanical pathway to manipulate magnetic domains. However, experimentally applied strains typically exhibit non&#8208;uniform distributions. Therefore, how to distinguish the role of non&#8208;uniform strains (strain gradients) and uniform strains is crucial for understanding the mechanical manipulation of magnetic structures. Here, by directly comparing to strain tuning, it is revealed that strain gradient induced by mechanical wrinkles is critical for magnetic domain manipulation in van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2. A ground&#8208;state labyrinthine domain transforms into a skyrmion state in the presence of an in&#8208;plane strain gradient. Additionally, an asymmetric evolutionary behavior of the magnetic domain occurs on both sides of wrinkle peaks. Theoretical simulations uncover that though opposite in&#8208;plane strain gradient hosts C2 rotational symmetry, this asymmetric domain evolution can be achieved through the coupling of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. The finding highlights the vital role of strain gradient in manipulating magnetic properties, and also offers a new mechanism for generating field&#8208;free skyrmion.

Here, by directly comparing to strain tuning, it is revealed that strain gradient induced by mechanical wrinkles is critical for magnetic domain manipulation in van der Waals ferromagnet Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GaTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A ground-state labyrinthine domain transforms into a skyrmion state in the presence of an in-plane strain gradient. Additionally, an asymmetric evolutionary behavior of the magnetic domain occurs on both sides of wrinkle peaks. Theoretical simulations uncover that though opposite in-plane strain gradient hosts &lt;i&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; rotational symmetry, this asymmetric domain evolution can be achieved through the coupling of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. The finding highlights the vital role of strain gradient in manipulating magnetic properties, and also offers a new mechanism for generating field-free skyrmion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Suppression of Tin Oxidation via Sn&#8594;B Bonding Interactions for High&#8208;Resolution Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Neuromorphic Imaging Sensors</title>

         <dc:description>
Boric acid&#8208;added 2D layered tin&#8208;based perovskite ((4&#8208;Cl&#8208;PEA)2SnI4) films utilize new Sn&#8594;B donor&#8208;acceptor interactions to suppress Sn2+ oxidation, resulting in reduced nonradiative recombination, low trap density, and high uniformity. This enables a vertical optoelectronic synapse with excellent synaptic performance. Finally, a high&#8208;resolution neuromorphic imaging array for image recognition, memory, and processing surpasses traditional image sensors.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free tin&#8208;based perovskites, specifically (4&#8208;Cl&#8208;PEA)2SnI4, possess significant potential for the development of high&#8208;performance, robust neuromorphic imaging sensors, owing to their superior optoelectronic properties and compatibility with conventional complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor fabrication techniques and silicon&#8208;based readout circuits. However, the excessive oxidation of Sn2+ remains a significant obstacle, leading to suboptimal synaptic performance and low resolution in the neuromorphic imaging sensors due to increased recombination losses and poor film uniformity. This study first demonstrates that the introduction of novel Sn&#8594;B donor&#8211;acceptor bonding interactions effectively suppresses Sn2+ oxidation, enhancing uniformity, reducing nonradiative recombination, and improving synaptic plasticity. A vertical optoelectronic synapse demonstrates diverse synaptic behaviors, attributed to hole trapping and detrapping at the device interface. Additionally, the device enables applications in associative learning, neuromorphic computation, letter encoding, and handwritten digit recognition. Ultimately, integration with silicon circuits results in a high&#8208;resolution (32 &#215; 32) neuromorphic imaging array, one of the highest reported resolutions for perovskite optoelectronic synapse arrays. The improved uniformity of boric acid&#8208;added (4&#8208;Cl&#8208;PEA)2SnI4 perovskite films significantly reduces photo response non&#8208;uniformity, enhances resolution, and improves memory capabilities. This neuromorphic imaging array successfully integrates sensing, storage, and computation, enabling advanced functionalities like letter recognition, memory, and processing, surpassing conventional image sensors.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Multilayered Concentric Supraparticle Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces Self&#8208;Assembled Multilayered Supraparticle (SAMS), the first concentric lamellar spherical structures formed from synergistic interactions between gold nanoparticles, lipidoid, and gelatin. SAMS exhibits unique interlayer spacing, enabling efficient environment responsive delivery of labile payloads like siRNA and mRNA. This work advances complex supraparticle design leveraging self&#8208;limiting self&#8208;assembly and demonstrates potential applications in nanomedicine.








Abstract
Supraparticles (SPs) with unique properties are emerging as versatile platforms for applications in catalysis, photonics, and medicine. However, the synthesis of novel SPs with complex internal structures remains a challenge. Self&#8208;Assembled Multilayered Supraparticles (SAMS) presented here are composed of concentric lamellar spherical structures made from metallic nanoparticles, formed from a synergistic three&#8208;way interaction phenomenon between gold nanoparticles, lipidoid, and gelatin, exhibiting interlayer spacing of 3.5&#160; &#177;&#160;0.2&#160;nm within a self&#8208;limited 156.8&#160; &#177;&#160;56.6&#160;nm diameter. The formation is critically influenced by both physical (including nanoparticle size, lipidoid chain length) and chemical factors (including elemental composition, nanoparticle cap, and organic material), which collectively modulate the surface chemistry and hydrophobicity, affecting interparticle interactions. SAMS can efficiently deliver labile payloads such as siRNA, achieving dose&#8208;dependent silencing in vivo, while also showing potential for complex payloads such as mRNA. This work not only advances the field of SP design by introducing a new structure and interaction phenomenon but also demonstrates its potential in nanomedicine.

         <title>Fluoroethylene Carbonate&#8208;Enabled Gel Polymer Electrolyte for Stable High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triangular synergistic strategy employed in the designed hybrid gel polymer electrolyte (HGPE) enhances Li+&#160;transport in FEC, inhibits electrolyte oxidation and decomposition on the NCM811 cathode, and facilitates the formation of a LiDFOB&#8208;derived mixed cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer at the interface, thereby enabling stable cycling of Li||NCM811 quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state cells for 400 cycles at 4.5 V.








Abstract
The stable operation of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) at high voltages is currently limited by&#160;the performance of conventional electrolytes. Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) exhibits unique physicochemical properties that positively impact interfacial chemistry, positioning it as a promising candidate to enhance the performance of LMBs. However, FEC is prone to the formation of corrosive HF under high voltage, which leads to the degradation of&#160;electrode interface. In this study, a hybrid gel polymer electrolyte (HGPE) based on pure FEC solvent with pentafluorophenyl methacrylate (PFPMA) monomer is presented to extend the voltage operating range. The PFPMA monomer forms a mixed&#8208;layer solid electrolyte interphase with lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) on electrode surface, effectively inhibiting the decomposition of FEC. The triangular synergistic strategy involving FEC, PFPMA, and polymer segments improves the transport of&#160;Li ions&#160;in FEC, achieving&#160;a high Li+&#160;transference number of 0.87. The designed electrolyte demonstrates good compatibility with Li metal and stabilizes&#160;LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2&#160;(NCM811) cathodes. As&#160;a result, the Li||NCM811 battery based&#160;HGPE exhibits a capacity retention of 83.4% after 300 cycles and 74.2% after 400 cycles, under a cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#160;V. This study provides a promising strategy for the development of GPE for high&#8208;voltage LMBs applications.

         <title>Effects of Interfacial Adhesion on Lithium Plating Location in Solid&#8208;State Batteries with Carbon Interlayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon interlayers can promote the stable cycling of anode&#8208;free solid&#8208;state batteries, but their underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. In this study, a direct correlation is observed between the interfacial adhesion of the carbon interlayer and the location of lithium plating. By conducting quantitative peel tests, a threshold interfacial toughness is found to be a determining factor that directs plating toward specific interfaces.








Abstract
Carbon interlayers have been implemented in &#8220;anode&#8208;free&#8221; solid&#8208;state batteries to improve the uniformity and reversibility of lithium deposition by controlling the location of Li plating. However, there remains a lack of fundamental understanding of the detailed role of how these interlayers function during in situ Li formation. In this study, the relationships between the interfacial adhesion of the carbon interlayer to the solid electrolyte and the location of Li plating are investigated. By varying the lamination pressure used during manufacturing, the ability to systematically tune the resulting interfacial adhesion is demonstrated. Mechanical peel tests are performed, and a 4&#8208;fold increase in interfacial toughness is measured as the lamination pressure increases from 100 to 400&#160;MPa. Post&#8208;mortem electron microscopy revealed that the location of Li plating with respect to the carbon interlayer transitions from the interface with the solid electrolyte to the current collector above a threshold interfacial toughness, which is consistent when the interlayer material is changed from amorphous to hard carbon. These findings highlight the role of electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical relationships in systematically controlling Li deposition in solid&#8208;state batteries when interlayers are present.

Post-mortem electron microscopy revealed that the location of Li plating with respect to the carbon interlayer transitions from the interface with the solid electrolyte to the current collector above a threshold interfacial toughness, which is consistent when the interlayer material is changed from amorphous to hard carbon.

         <title>All&#8208;Optically Modulated In&#8208;Sensor Computing Device Based on Ionic&#8208;Conducting CuInP2Se6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;optical in&#8208;sensor computing device is presented based on the unique optoelectronic and ion&#8208;conducting properties of two&#8208;dimensional material CuInP2Se6. Light intensity&#8208;adaptive modulation of ionic conductivity is achieved within the 400 to 700 nm wavelength range. This architecture provides a novel solution in RGB&#8208;noise image processing and recognition by leveraging the intricate ion&#8208;electron coupling effect.








Abstract
Inspired by the human visual system, in&#8208;sensor computing has emerged as a promising approach to address growing demands for real&#8208;time image processing while overcoming constraints in computational resources. However, existing in&#8208;sensor computing optoelectronic devices still face challenges such as complex heterostructures or limited optical modulation for operational efficiency, restricting their practical use. Here, a simple two&#8208;terminal optoelectronic device has been fabricated using the 2D material CuInP2Se6, achieving neuromorphic functionalities through all&#8208;optical modulation. The device exhibits a tunable photoresponse across the visible spectrum (400 to 700 nm) and enables bidirectional conductance modulation in response to light stimuli, driven by the interaction between Cu&#8314; ions and photogenerated electrons. It shows high linearity with 300 discrete conductance states under red, green, and blue light, enabling color&#8208;specific image feature extraction, processing, and recognition across three channels. This approach significantly enhances color image recognition accuracy by 4.6% when integrated with a three&#8208;channel convolutional neural network. Additionally, the bidirectional photoresponse allows for efficient noise suppression during color image preprocessing, leading to a 490% improvement in signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. These findings highlight the potential of CuInP2Se6&#8208;based architecture for robust performance, paving the way for in&#8208;sensor neuromorphic vision systems in artificial intelligence and biomimetic computing.

LIBs used for aviation exhibit rapid aging and shortened service life due to the harsh conditions of aviation, posing significant risks to flight safety. This study reveals the degradation mechanisms and quantifies the relative impact of temperature and pressure factors, providing critical insights for optimizing future electric aircraft battery designs.








Abstract
The widespread adoption of electric vehicles has spurred the exploration of airworthy lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) for electric&#8208;powered aircraft. However, LIBs used for aviation exhibit rapid aging and shortened service life due to the harsh conditions of aviation, posing significant risks to flight safety. In this study, a comprehensive analysis is conducted under simulated flight conditions to reveal the degradation mechanism of aviation batteries. Low&#8208;temperature and low&#8208;pressure lead to a sluggish kinetics and hinder thermodynamic process. As the reversibility of Li&#8208;ions insertion and extraction is deteriorates, residual Li&#8208;ions accumulate and plated&#8208;Li on the anode, accelerating the aging process and arising the issue of internal short circuits. Additionally, the interatomic distance of Ni&#8208;coordination induces significant stress variations, which drives an expanded occupation of porosity in the electrode under flight conditions, with 2.13% void spaces of cathode and 13.39% of anode. The formation and growth of cracks elongate the charge transfer pathway, increasing resistance and reducing rate capability. As a result, this study quantifies the degradation mechanisms of aviation batteries and establishes the relative impact weights of temperature and pressure factors, offering critical insights for optimizing future electric aircraft power battery designs.

         <title>Icing on the Cake: Integrating Optical Fiber with Second Near&#8208;Infrared Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen for Exceptional Phototheranostics of Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By elaborate electron donor/&#960;&#8208;bridge manipulation, a versatile NIR&#8208;II AIE luminogen is constructed. Experimental and theoretical studies both demonstrate that the AIE luminogen is unambiguously advantageous to implement optical fiber&#8208;mediated treatment of bladder cancer under the guidance of NIR&#8208;II fluorescent&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging.








Abstract
Bladder cancer is a common urological malignancy characterized by high morbidity, high recurrence rate and high mortality, imposing heavy burdens on patients mentally and financially. The research pioneers a diagnostic and therapeutic approach that integrates a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) multimodal phototheranostic platform with optical fiber&#8208;mediated interventional phototherapy strategy, to implement a comprehensive diagnosis and &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; treatment of bladder cancer. The proposed molecule, namely BTO&#8208;TTQ, is elaborately designed through electron donor/&#960;&#8208;bridge engineering and demonstrates satisfying NIR&#8208;II emission with aggregation&#8208;induced emission features, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and prominent generation of type I reactive oxygen species. Quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations are employed to deeply elucidate the energy dissipation pathways of the excited state and the impact of intramolecular motion on their photophysical properties. Furthermore, under the guidance of NIR&#8208;II fluorescent&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging, hyaluronic acid&#8208;modified BTO&#8208;TTQ nanoparticles exhibit exceptional performance in optical fiber&#8208;mediated interventional phototherapy for air&#8208;pouch bladder cancer models. This study thus brings a new insight into the development of superior versatile phototheranostics for clinical theranostics of bladder cancer.

         <title>Electrochromic Smart Windows with On&#8208;Demand Photothermal Regulation for Energy&#8208;Saving Buildings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
WO3//MnO2&#8208;based electrochromic smart windows with highly selective visible and near&#8208;infrared regulation are achieved by decoupling the mechanisms of reversible deposition and ion adsorption. It is found that the hybrid Cu2+/Mn2+ ions promote proton adsorption while hampering proton insertion on the WO3 surface for the first time, endowing the windows with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art properties.








Abstract
Electrochromic smart windows with dynamic photothermal management can enhance living comfort and reduce building energy consumption. However, they usually suffer from low selectivity and optical modulation in visible (VIS) and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions owing to the coupled mechanism restriction. Here, the reversible deposition and ion adsorption in WO3//MnO2&#8208;based smart windows are decoupled using a hybrid electrolyte, realizing their independent and efficient VIS&#8211;NIR regulation. The Cu2+/Mn2+ ions in the hybrid electrolyte enhance proton adsorption on the WO3 surface while impeding proton insertion, imparting state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NIR regulation to the WO3 electrode. Moreover, the synergy of protons and Cu2+/Mn2+ ions facilitates reversible MnO2 electrodeposition on the electrode, triggering independent tuning of VIS light with an optical modulation of 94%. The outdoor test and simulation reveal that the smart window achieves cooling at 5&#8211;10&#160;&#176;C, an energy savings of 73.2&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;2 and a reduction of 14.4&#160;kg of CO2 emissions per square meter of the building annually. This work would contribute to energy&#8208;saving and emission&#8208;reduction solutions in widespread applications.

Femtosecond X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (fs&#8208;XAS) at PAL&#8208;XFEL captures ultrafast electronic and structural dynamics in epitaxial LaFeO3 thin films. Combined with DFT and multiplet calculations, the study reveals photoinduced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer, followed by polaron formation and reduced oxygen 2p&#8208;iron 3d hybridization, explaining key spectral changes.








Abstract
Conducting real&#8208;time, element&#8208;specific studies of photo&#8208;excited systems is a long&#8208;standing challenge. The development of X&#8208;ray free&#8208;electron lasers (XFELs) has paved the way for the emergence of a promising technique: femtosecond X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (fs&#8208;XAS). This powerful technique reveals electronic and geometric characteristics, providing unprecedented insight into their dynamic interactions under nonequilibrium conditions. Herein, the&#160;fs&#8208;XAS technique is employed at PAL&#8208;XFEL to unravel light&#8208;driven ultrafast electronic and structural changes in epitaxial lanthanum iron oxide (LaFeO3) thin films. Density functional theory (DFT) and multiplet calculations are utilized to expound on the experimental results. The analyses reveal that photoexcitation initially induces high&#8208; and intermediate&#8208;spin Fe2+ states through ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT), followed by polaron formation. It is demonstrated that the reduced overlap between the oxygen 2p and iron 3d orbitals accounts for all experimental observations, including 1) the XAS shifts to lower energies, 2) the decrease in the crystal field splitting, and 3) the relatively larger shifts observed in the oxygen 1s XAS.

         <title>Friction Tuning of Interlayer Exciton Recombination in Van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is revealed how friction alters exciton dynamics in MoS&#8322;/WS&#8322; heterostructures. Using time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence combined with atomic force microscope, it is shown that friction&#8208;induced defects shorten interlayer exciton lifetimes by trapping electrons, which increases friction by affecting charge density evolution in turn. Density functional theory calculations confirm this mechanism, offering new insight into energy dissipation in nano&#8208;opto&#8208;electromechanical systems.








Abstract
Van der Waals heterostructures combine low friction with excellent optoelectronic properties, making them suitable for opto&#8208;nano&#8208;electromechanical systems. While the long lifetime of interlayer excitons in these materials helps reduce energy loss, friction in mechanical systems is unavoidable and can shorten the exciton recombination lifetime, undermining the low&#8208;friction benefits. Despite its importance, the fundamental mechanism underlying friction&#8208;induced changes in exciton recombination remains unexplored, mainly due to the difficulty of probing long&#8208;lifetime exciton recombination at friction interfaces. Here, time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence combined with an atomic force microscope is used to detect exciton recombination at the friction interface of MoS2/WS2 heterostructures. The findings show that friction generates defects, which trap electrons and create additional recombination pathways, shortening exciton recombination lifetimes. This, in turn, increases friction by altering charge density evolution and raising the friction sliding barrier. Density functional theory calculations confirm this mechanism. These results reveal how friction influences exciton recombination, paving the way for advancements in low&#8208;friction nano&#8208;opto&#8208;electromechanical devices.

         <title>Sandwich Engineering Advances Ductile Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative sandwich engineering is developed to realize n&#8208;type Ag2(S, Se)&#8208;Ag2Se ductile thermoelectric films, exhibiting a record&#8208;high thermoelectric performance near room&#8208;temperature among n&#8208;type ductile semiconductors. The as&#8208;fabricated in&#8208;plane F&#8208;TED achieves an exceptional power density of 26.5&#160;W m&#8722;2 at a temperature difference of 50 K, ranking among the highest for ductile TEDs, demonstrating promising application potential.








Abstract
Flexible thermoelectrics offer the possibility of utilizing human body heat to generate electricity, enabling self&#8208;powered wearable electronics. Ductile and plastic semiconductors are promising materials for flexible thermoelectrics due to their inherent ductility and tunable electrical properties. However, balancing ductility with high thermoelectric performance remains challenging, especially for n&#8208;type materials. Here, a novel n&#8208;type ductile Ag2(S, Se)&#8208;Ag2Se sandwich&#8208;like thermoelectric film is designed with different functional layers, where the Ag2(S, Se) core layer provides ductile deformation ability and low thermal conductivity, while epitaxially grown highly oriented Ag2Se shell layers ensure superior electrical transport performance. This architecture achieves a record high figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit near room&#8208;temperature range, 0.91 at 323 K, among n&#8208;type ductile semiconductors while preserving excellent flexibility. Additionally, a flexible in&#8208;plane device fabricated from this material delivers an exceptional power density of 26.5&#160;W m&#8722;2 at a temperature difference of 50 K, demonstrating its great application potential for wearable electronics. Importantly, such novel sandwich engineering can pave the way to alleviate the compromise between thermoelectric performance and ductility in inorganic semiconductors.

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Reinforced Multifunctional Hydrogel for the Treatment of Enterocutaneous Fistula</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ECFGel is a multifunctional hydrogel engineered to treat infection&#8208;associated ECFs. ECFGel demonstrates outstanding mechanical and biological properties, facilitating easy application, reliable occlusion, and sterilization, while promoting effective healing of infected fistula tracts. A choline and geranate&#8208;based ionic liquid hydrogel is used to concurrently enhance mechanical performance and confer antimicrobial functionality.








Abstract
Enterocutaneous fistulas (ECFs) profoundly impact patients&#8217; quality of life, contributing to high morbidity rates and increased mortality due to ineffective treatment options. To address this challenge, ECFGel, a multifunctional, tissue adhesive injectable hydrogel, designed to occlude, sterilize, and promote healing of ECF tracts, is developed. ECFGel is formulated using gelatin and oxidized dextran (O&#8208;Dex) as base components, which form chemical crosslinks within the hydrogel and with surrounding biological tissues, ensuring tissue adhesiveness. A choline and geranate&#8208;based ionic liquid (IL) is incorporated to provide dual functionality, potent antimicrobial activity, and mechanical enhancement. By optimizing IL concentration, ECFGel achieves rapid gelation, enhanced mechanical strength, and improved elastic recoverability. Additionally, iohexol (IOH) is added for radiopacity, enabling real&#8208;time imaging and further strengthening the hydrogel's mechanical properties. ECFGel demonstrates antiswelling properties, biodegradability, and effective tract occlusion in porcine soft tissues. It shows strong antimicrobial activity against highly resistant, patient&#8208;derived pathogens isolated from clinical ECF cases. In a porcine perianal fistula model, ECFGel enables rapid occlusion and complete healing, promoting tissue maturation, reducing bacterial load, and increasing markers of cell proliferation and vascularization compared to untreated controls. These promising results highlight ECFGel's potential as a new therapeutic option for treating infected ECFs.

         <title>Built&#8208;in Electric Field in Ru/CoP Bifunctional Electrocatalyst Enhances Hydrazine&#8208;Assisted Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of Ru/CoP heterostructure induces interfacial interaction, which mitigates the strong adsorption of *H on Ru sites while promoting hydrogen spillover and enhancing *H coverage on Co sites. Moreover, the adsorption of N2H4 is improved on Ru sites. This Ru/CoP heterostructure greatly improves the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of HER and HzOR and realizes efficient and energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrazine&#8208;assisted water splitting, incorporating the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), offers a promising avenue for hydrogen production. Herein, a Ru/CoP heterostructure is introduced, which enhances bifunctional catalytic activity through interfacial interaction induced by the built&#8208;in electric field between Ru nanoparticles and CoP nanosheets. This interaction optimizes the adsorption of intermediates and facilitates improved HER performances by weakening the strong adsorption of active hydrogen species (*H) on Ru and enhancing *H coverage on CoP through hydrogen spillover. Additionally, this electron interaction promotes the adsorption of N2H4 and its subsequent dehydrogenation, vital for HzOR activity.

&lt;p&gt;The construction of Ru/CoP heterostructure induces interfacial interaction, which mitigates the strong adsorption of *H on Ru sites while promoting hydrogen spillover and enhancing *H coverage on Co sites. Moreover, the adsorption of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is improved on Ru sites. This Ru/CoP heterostructure greatly improves the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of HER and HzOR and realizes efficient and energy-saving hydrogen production.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic hydrazine-assisted water splitting, incorporating the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), offers a promising avenue for hydrogen production. Herein, a Ru/CoP heterostructure is introduced, which enhances bifunctional catalytic activity through interfacial interaction induced by the built-in electric field between Ru nanoparticles and CoP nanosheets. This interaction optimizes the adsorption of intermediates and facilitates improved HER performances by weakening the strong adsorption of active hydrogen species (*H) on Ru and enhancing *H coverage on CoP through hydrogen spillover. Additionally, this electron interaction promotes the adsorption of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and its subsequent dehydrogenation, vital for HzOR activity. The heterostructure's significant reduction in required potentials for both reactions underscores its efficiency and potential economic benefits over traditional systems. Furthermore, the study validates the feasibility of using this approach for practical applications in sustainable hydrogen production, emphasizing its lower operational costs and enhanced catalytic stability and activity. This work not only showcases the practical applications of Ru/CoP but also underscores the broader applicability of heterostructure strategy in designing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Environmentally Responsive Molecular Engineering Framework for Subcellular Drug Translocalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome lysosomal barriers, an OVDS framework is provided features a fluorescence visualization unit, a drug&#8208;loading unit, and a mitochondria localization unit to switch HCPT from the lysosomal&#8208;to&#8208;mitochondrial localization, achieving targeted subcellular drug distribution and fundamentally solving the technical problem of tumor drug resistance, offering a promising tool for overcoming lysosome&#8208;mediated drug resistance in clinical oncology.








Abstract
The power of drugs lies in their ability to reach their target sites and remain in place for a sufficient duration to exert their therapeutic effects. However, for some drugs, lysosomal phagocytosis presents ongoing challenges. In this study, an engineered organelles visualization drug&#8208;delivery system (OVDS) is introduced as a subcellular drug visualization and redistribution framework that facilitates the movement of drug molecules from one organelle, specifically lysosomes, to another, such as the mitochondria. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, an OVDS is developed to facilitate the translocation of 10&#8208;hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) from the lysosomes to mitochondria. This modification of subcellular HCPT distribution allows the evasion of lysosome&#8208;mediated HCPT resistance in cancer cells. Unlike traditional chemotherapeutic approaches, when HCPT is incorporated into the OVDS framework (HCPT&#8208;OVDS), the positive charge of the OVDS facilitates protonation, thereby enabling HCPT to escape lysosomes and enter mitochondria. Using HCPT&#8208;OVDS, substantial drug accumulation is achieved at the target sites in HCPT&#8208;resistant cells, with up to 70 &#177; 6% efficient subcellular translocalization and a 12.8 fold enhancement in cytotoxicity. Overall, the HCPT&#8208;OVDS represents an innovative engineering framework for subcellular spatial redistribution and offers a promising solution for addressing cancer drug resistance.

         <title>Realizing Uniform Defect Passivation via Self&#8208;Polymerization of Benzenesulfonate Molecules in Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzenesulfonate monomers undergo&#160;in situ self&#8208;polymerization during the crystallization process of perovskite, providing more uniform passivation for perovskite defects than single molecules. The in situ formed polymer also facilitates the growth of large grain domains and the charge transport, offering an efficiency of 25.34% for small&#8208;area perovskite solar cells and 21.54% for mini&#8208;modules with an active area of 14.0 cm2.








Abstract
Realizing high&#8208;quality perovskite films through uniform defect passivation and crystallization control is pivotal to unlocking the potential of scalable applications. However, prevalent small&#8208;molecule additives are inherently susceptible to the crystallization dynamics of perovskites, resulting in non&#8208;uniform distribution within the crystalline film and impeding consistent passivation and precise crystallization control. While polymers offer improved uniformity, their poor solubility restricts practical applications. To overcome this limitation, an in situ self&#8208;polymerization strategy is employed, enabling homogeneous coordination between sulfonate&#8208;containing additives and undercoordinated lead cations. This approach enhances perovskite film quality, promotes larger crystalline grain domains, and facilitates more efficient charge transport across grain domain boundaries. As a result, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 25.34% in small&#8208;area devices and 21.54% in 14.0 cm2 mini&#8208;modules, accompanied by exceptional operational stability. These findings highlight in situ polymerization as an effective strategy for leveraging sulfonate additives to overcome distribution challenges, advancing the scalable fabrication of efficient and stable PSCs.

         <title>Formation Mechanism and Molecular Structure of Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation mechanism of SPAN begins with the production of the S2 diradical, followed by the dehydrogenation and cyclization of PAN, resulting in the formation of SPAN. Its molecular structure is multilayered, featuring two twisted layers (&#8776;30&#8211;40&#176;) interconnected by C&#9472;Sx&#9472;N bonds. This structure has the potential to chemically confine sulfur up to 63.5 wt.% (&#8776;1000 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1).








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have attracted considerable attention due to their high theoretical energy density and abundant sulfur resources. Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) effectively suppresses polysulfide dissolution and demonstrates excellent cycling stability, making it a promising candidate for cathode materials in practical Li&#8208;SPAN batteries. This study elucidates the formation mechanism, chemical bonds, and spatial structures of SPAN. The reaction begins with the generation of &#183;S2&#183; diradicals, followed by the dehydrogenation and cyclization of polyacrylonitrile (PAN), ultimately resulting in the formation of C&#9472;S and N&#9472;S bonds. The multilayered structure of SPAN, characterized by C&#8208;S and N&#8208;S layers twisted at angles of &#8776;30 to 40 degrees and interconnected by C&#9472;Sx&#9472;N bonds, has the potential to chemically confine sulfur up to a maximum of 63.5 wt.%, corresponding to a theoretical capacity exceeding 1000 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. These findings provide fundamental insights for the design of SPAN materials for advanced X&#8208;SPAN batteries.

The development of ultra&#8208;soluble 1&#8208;azaphenothiazine (1&#8208;APT) marks a significant advancement in additive chemistry for high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 cathodes, surpassing traditional additives and facilitating large&#8208;scale battery production. Li||LiCoO2&#8208;1&#8208;APT pouch cells demonstrate impressive performance with specific energies of 515.7, 497.4, and 484.9 Wh kg&#8722;1 at discharge rates of 0.5C, 1C, and 2C, respectively.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 is a promising cathode candidate for achieving high&#8208;energy lithium metal pouch cells. However, further application is still hindered by irreversible structural degradation and severe interfacial side reactions that accelerate capacity decay. Herein, 1&#8208;Azaphenothiazine (1&#8208;APT) is incorporated as a cathode slurry additive (1&#160;g mL&#8722;1 in N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone) to promote the optimization of the LiCoO2 interface during the electrode coating process. The ultra&#8208;soluble 1&#8208;APT promotes the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich components within the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI), mitigates the reaction of Co4+ with the electrolyte, and enhances the interfacial stability of LiCoO2, thereby enabling 4.7&#160;V LiCoO2 with an initial capacity of 229.8 mAh g&#8722;1 and 73.2% capacity retention after 200 cycles. More importantly, Li||LiCoO2&#8208;1&#8208;APT pouch cells exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance, achieving specific energies of 515.7&#160;, 497.4&#160;, and 484.9&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at discharge rates of 0.5C, 1C, and 2C, respectively. Notably, the 5 Ah pouch cell exhibited the capability to maintain an energy density of 411.4&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.5C. This work presents a practical and effective strategy for optimizing cathode interfaces, thereby enabling the stabilization of high&#8208;voltage cathodes.

Li||LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-1-APT pouch cells demonstrate impressive performance with specific energies of 515.7, 497.4, and 484.9 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at discharge rates of 0.5C, 1C, and 2C, respectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-voltage LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a promising cathode candidate for achieving high-energy lithium metal pouch cells. However, further application is still hindered by irreversible structural degradation and severe interfacial side reactions that accelerate capacity decay. Herein, 1-Azaphenothiazine (1-APT) is incorporated as a cathode slurry additive (1&#160;g mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone) to promote the optimization of the LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface during the electrode coating process. The ultra-soluble 1-APT promotes the formation of inorganic-rich components within the cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI), mitigates the reaction of Co&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; with the electrolyte, and enhances the interfacial stability of LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thereby enabling 4.7&#160;V LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with an initial capacity of 229.8 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 73.2% capacity retention after 200 cycles. More importantly, Li||LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-1-APT pouch cells exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance, achieving specific energies of 515.7&#160;, 497.4&#160;, and 484.9&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at discharge rates of 0.5C, 1C, and 2C, respectively. Notably, the 5 Ah pouch cell exhibited the capability to maintain an energy density of 411.4&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 100 cycles at 0.5C. This work presents a practical and effective strategy for optimizing cathode interfaces, thereby enabling the stabilization of high-voltage cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This work reports Rec. 2020 compliant pure&#8208;green mixed&#8208;cation perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes, presenting a champion EQE of 31.89%, average EQE of 29.5%, maximum luminance of 2 &#215; 105 cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and half&#8208;lifetime of &#8776;3500 h at an initial luminance of 100 cd&#160;m&#8722;2. The results are enabled by synergistic co&#8208;additives, which can manipulate nanograin crystallization and mitigate crystal defects effectively.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) compliant with Rec. 2020 standards have raised increasing attention for next&#8208;generation displays. As a class of pure&#8208;green emitters, the mixed&#8208;cation FAxCs1&#8208;xPbBr3 perovskites exhibit compatible band emission, but suffer from inferior luminescence performance. The approach to tackling this issue is hindered by a lack of in&#8208;depth understanding of their crystallization manipulating mechanism. This work unveils the crystallization process of mixed&#8208;cation FA0.7Cs0.45GA0.1PbBr3 perovskites, demonstrating the fast spontaneous growth readily induces severe crystal defects accompanied by poor charge confinement. This motivates us to introduce additional kinetic barriers to manipulate the perovskite crystallization via the synergistic co&#8208;additives of 3&#8208;((2&#8208;(methacryloyloxy)ethyldimethyl)ammonio)&#8208;propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate (DMAPS) and 1,4,7,10,13,16&#8208;hexaoxacyclooctadecane (crown). The multifunctional groups in the co&#8208;additives afford robust chemical affinities with the diverse organic and inorganic precursor ions simultaneously, which enable decent nanograin growth with effective crystal defect healing and charge confinement. Ultimately, mixed&#8208;cation FA0.7Cs0.45GA0.1PbBr3 perovskites with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 96% are achieved. The resultant pure&#8208;green PeLEDs with the Rec. 2020 compliance exhibit a champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 31.89%, average EQE of 29.5%, maximum luminance of 2 &#215; 105 cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and operational half&#8208;lifetime of 3.2 h at an initial luminance of 7000 cd&#160;m&#8722;2 (extrapolated: &#8776;3500 h at 100 cd&#160;m&#8722;2).

         <title>Linear Annulation Engineering of Indolocarbazole Multiple Resonance Emitter to Overcome Efficiency&#8208;Stability&#8208;Color Purity Trilemma in Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An indolocarbazole emitter employing a linear annulation strategy is developed, not only narrowing spectral bandwidth with redshifted emission through multiple resonance framework extension to afford ultrapure electroluminescence peaking at 458&#160;nm with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 19&#160;nm, but also enhancing device longevity and efficiency with a long LT80 of 101&#160;h and high maximum external quantum efficiency of 34.3%.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;blue emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) still confront the critical challenge of balancing high efficiency, operational stability, and color purity, particularly for the ones with peak wavelengths (&#955;max) &#8804; 460&#160;nm. Here, the study demonstrates deep&#8208;blue devices featuring ultrapure emission (&#955;max = 458&#160;nm, full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum = 19&#160;nm), high maximum external quantum efficiency of 34.3% with small roll&#8208;off (26.9% at 1&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2; 20.9% at 5&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2), and long operational LT80 (time to 80% of the initial luminance) of 101 hours at 1,000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, being one of the longest lifetime among OLEDs with &#955;max &#8804; 460&#160;nm and EQE &gt;20%. This breakthrough stems from an indolocarbazole narrowband emitter employing a linear annulation strategy, which not only narrows spectral bandwidth while red&#8208;shifting emission peak through multiple resonance framework extension, but also energetically and dynamically enhances device longevity via triplet energy reduction. Furthermore, strategic integration of steric hindrance on the emitting backbone suppresses intermolecular interactions and directs reactivity pathways. This emitter concurrently achieves a &#955;max of 456&#160;nm, FWHM of 15&#160;nm and photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield of 98% in dilute toluene. The work highlights linear annulation engineering as a potential approach to resolve the efficiency&#8208;stability&#8208;color purity trilemma in deep&#8208;blue OLEDs.

The wafer&#8208;scale hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) epitaxial film exhibits pronounced anisotropy in optical absorption and carrier transport stemming from its distinct m&#8208;plane surfaces, greatly favoring its polarized vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) detection. The device demonstrates excellent polarization&#8208;sensitive performance under 188 nm linearly polarized light, along with a remarkable polarization ratio, thus extending the short&#8208;wavelength limit of existing lensless polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection technologies based on anisotropic semiconductor materials.








Abstract
Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) detection plays an essential role in space science, radiation monitoring, electronic industry, and fundamental research. Integrating polarization characteristics into VUV detection enriches the comprehension of the target attributes and broadens the signal dimensionality. Polarization detection has been widely developed in visible and infrared regions; however, it is still relatively unexplored in VUV light due to the lack of photoactive materials with low&#8208;symmetry structures, VUV selective response and radiation resistance. Here, the wafer&#8208;scale hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) epitaxial films with the distinct m&#8208;plane surfaces are demonstrated that exhibit significant anisotropy due to space symmetry breaking, instead of the routinely obtained high&#8208;symmetry c&#8208;planes governed by the most thermodynamically stable growth mode. This results in notable anisotropy in light absorption and charge density distributions, yielding a dichroic ratio greater than 10 and a carrier transport efficiency ratio (&#956;&#964;a&#8208;axis/&#956;&#964;c&#8208;axis) of 24. The h&#8208;BN based detector achieves a high polarization ratio of 6.2 for 188 nm VUV polarized light, reaching the short&#8208;wavelength limit of the reported polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors. This work presents an effective strategy for designing polarized VUV photodetector from h&#8208;BN, and paves the road towards the novel integrated optoelectronics, photonics and electronics based on traditional 2D materials.

         <title>Detecting Cr6+ at &#8776;100 pM Concentration with Fluorescence Enhancement Signatures in a Novel Eco&#8208;Fluorophore: Matching WHO's 96 pM Recommended Standard for Drinking Water</title>

         <dc:description>
Through a dual&#8208;functionalization strategy, carbon quantum dots (CQD) with exceptional fluorescence properties are engineered. These CQD are integrated with graphitic carbon nitride to form a 2D/2D heterostructure via both covalent and non&#8208;covalent modification. This integration enables ultra&#8208;trace Cr&#8310;&#8314; detection with a limit of detection &#8776;70 pM&#8212;surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cr&#8310;&#8314; sensors.








Abstract
Hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) ions in drinking water pose a significant risk to human health, being a leading cause for neurological disorders, organ damage, and infertility. This study introduces an ultrasensitive method for detecting trace Cr6+ over a wide concentration range (&#8776; 100 pM &#8211; 100&#160;&#181;M) through fluorescence enhancement signatures via integration of both covalent and non&#8208;covalent interaction strategies on carbon quantum dots (CQD). The covalent functionalization is achieved from dual&#8208;functionalized CQD (CQD&#8208;(NH2, COOH)) derived from coffee&#8208;waste. Additionally, the covalent and non&#8208;covalent approach integrates CQD&#8208;(NH2, COOH) with graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) to form a 2D/2D heterostructure. The synergy between CQD&#8208;(NH2, COOH) and g&#8208;C3N4 introduces a mid&#8208;gap band in their band structure, allowing multiple carrier excitation and recombination states, significantly&#160;enhancing the fluorescence quenching signal. This combination allows to achieve Cr6+ detection sensitivity down to &#8776;100 pM concentration&#8212;matching the World Health Organization's 96 pM permissible limit of total Cr in drinking water. Furthermore, a 70 pM detection limit is reported for Cr6+ in a mixture of twelve ions, including cations and anions, surpassing current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art detection limits. These results highlight the potential of dual covalent and non&#8208;covalent modification strategy in nanomaterials to set new standards in ultrasensitive and wide&#8208;range fluorescent sensing applications.

         <title>Decoupling Interlayer Interactions Boosts Charge Separation in Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Efficiency Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The weak interlayer coupling suppresses the recombination of photogenerated electron and hole, facilitating charge separation. The optimized PY&#8208;CN&#8208;BIP&#8208;Ni achieves 553.3&#160;&#181;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185; CO production (94% selectivity), eightfold faster than its isomer with strong interlayer interactions under visible light.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising photocatalysts owing to their structural diversity, tunable bandgaps, and exceptional light&#8208;harvesting capabilities. While previous studies primarily focus on developing narrow&#8208;bandgap COFs for broad&#8208;spectrum solar energy utilization, the critical role of interlayer coupling in regulating charge transfer dynamics remains unclear. Conventional monolayer&#8208;based theoretical models inadequately address interlayer effects that potentially hindering intralayer electron transport to catalytic active sites. This work employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the influence of interlayer interactions on intralayer charge transfer in imine&#8208;based COFs. Theoretical analyses reveal that bilayer architectures exhibit pronounced interlayer interference in intramolecular charge transfer processes which has not been observed in monolayer models. Based on these mechanistic insights, this work designs two isomeric pyrene&#8208;based COFs incorporating identical electron donor (pyrene) and acceptor (nickel bipyridine) units but with distinct interlayer coupling strengths. Strikingly, the optimized COF with weakened interlayer interactions demonstrates exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance, achieving a CO evolution rate of 553.3&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 with 94% selectivity under visible light irradiation without additional photosensitizers or co&#8208;catalysts. These findings establish interlayer engineering as a crucial design principle for developing high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar energy conversion applications.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Triggered Nanoparticles Induce Cuproptosis for Enhancing Immunogenic Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic polymers Poly RA and Poly MPN are self&#8208;assembled into biodegradable nanocarriers (RC NPs), which are evaluated for their antitumor performance in pancreatic cancer models. Upon accumulation at the tumor site, the RC NPs can be activated by ultrasound for SDT, generating ROS capable of killing cancer cells and promoting the release of Cu2+, which in turn induces cuproptosis and suppresses tumor progression. Notably, both processes are capable of inducing ICD and enhancing antitumor immune responses.








Abstract
Cuproptosis, as a novel mechanism of cell death, holds significant promise for tumor therapy. However, existing studies typically employ methods to induce cuproptosis through endogenous or exogenous pathways, which often fail to achieve precise control in both space and time. Herein, polymeric nanoparticles (RC NPs) are developed that enable precise activation of cuproptosis through acoustic control for tumor&#8208;specific treatment. The nanoparticles are fabricated via self&#8208;assembly of a degradable, acoustic&#8208;sensitive polymer (Poly RA) and a metal&#8208;ion&#8208;loadable polyphenol&#8208;structured polymer (Poly MPN). Ultrasound stimulation cleaved the RC NPs, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promoting the release of copper ions from Poly MPN, leading to the aggregation of lipoylated proteins and depletion of iron&#8208;sulfur cluster proteins to introduce cuproptosis. Subsequently, the RC NPs successfully activated the immune system of mice, promoting the maturation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells and the activation of T lymphocytes. The nanoparticles exhibited good biosafety and significant tumor inhibition in both orthotopic and patient&#8208;derived xenograft (PDX) models. These novel nanoparticles provide a promising modality for the treatment of highly aggressive cancers and a valuable avenue for future clinical applications.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Charging Phosphorus Anodes Enabled by Fluorinated Weakly Solvated Electrolytes for Stable and High&#8208;Rate Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal weakly&#8208;solvated electrolyte design principle is established for phosphorus&#8208;based anodes through systematic evaluation. Based on this criterion, the fluorinated solvent of FEC emerges as the optimal co&#8208;solvent, effectively suppressing the dissolution of lithium polyphosphides while enhancing desolvation/charge&#8208;transfer kinetics and simultaneously fostering a stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI layer. This rational strategy addresses critical interfacial challenges in high&#8208;performance phosphorus&#8208;based battery systems.








Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;based anodes hold promise for energy storage due to their high theoretical capacity and favorable lithiation potential. However, their practical application is hindered by sluggish reaction kinetics and irreversible capacity loss, primarily attributed to multiphase lithiation/delithiation reactions and the dissolution of lithium polyphosphide intermediates. Herein, a universal design principle of weakly solvated electrolytes (WSEs) tailored for phosphorus&#8208;based anodes is proposed. Combined with a high dielectric constant, and significant dipole moment, a fluorinated cosolvent is incorporated into a WSE to effectively suppress the dissolutions of lithium polyphosphides, enhance interfacial stability, and accelerate reaction kinetics. With this electrolyte, a phosphorus&#8208;based anode achieves a remarkable capacity of 2615.2 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 1C, maintaining 91.7% capacity retention over 1000 cycles. Even at a high rate of 4 C, it delivers 2210.7 mAh g&#8315;&#185; with an exceptional retention of 96.7% after 1500 cycles. Furthermore, at 0 &#176;C, the anode sustains a capacity of 2016.7 mAh g&#8315;&#185;, with 97% retention after 300 cycles at 1C. This study provides a novel electrolyte design strategy to regulate the solvation sheath, paving the way for high&#8208;rate, long&#8208;cycle phosphorus&#8208;based anodes suitable for fast&#8208;charging applications.

         <title>Biomimetic Hybrid PROTAC Nanovesicles Block Multiple DNA Repair Pathways to Overcome Temozolomide Resistance Against Orthotopic Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>

A biomimetic nanotechnology, drug delivery, glioblastoma, PROTAC, temozolomide resistance. A biomimetic PROTAC nanovesicle (M@TP) combining temozolomide (TMZ) with GSH&#8208;activatable prodrug (PC&#8208;ss&#8208;Pro) has been developed, which can penetrate the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and target glioblastoma (GBM) through homotypic recognition, and restore sensitivity to TMZ by inducing BRD4 degradation. M@TP effectively inhibits the growth of TMZ&#8208;resistant GBM and postoperative GBM, offering a feasible strategy to overcome TMZ resistance and improve the prognosis of GBM.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) remains one of the deadliest forms of cancer due to its high rates of postoperative recurrence and resistance to treatment. Temozolomide (TMZ) is the standard chemotherapy for GBM. However, the therapeutic efficacy of TMZ is significantly compromised by the activation of various intracellular DNA repair mechanisms that facilitate TMZ resistance. Herein, the upregulation of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4) expression is demonstrated to be a key contributor to TMZ resistance in GBM. To address this challenge, a biomimetic hybrid PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTAC) liposome delivery system (M@TP) is developed. This system efficiently penetrates the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and specifically targets GBM cells through homotypic recognition. Once within TMZ&#8208;resistant GBM cells, the released PROTAC from M@TP can specifically degrade BRD4, effectively inhibiting multiple DNA repair pathways and restoring sensitivity to TMZ treatment. In vivo, studies showed that M@TP demonstrated significant efficacy in suppressing tumor growth in both TMZ&#8208;resistant and postoperative GBM, with prolonged mouse survival times. These findings highlight the potential of M@TP as a promising strategy to overcome TMZ resistance and improve therapeutic outcomes in GBM.

         <title>Luminescent Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Promoted Self&#8208;Adaptive Smart Active Optical Waveguide with Ultra&#8208;Low Optical Loss</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart optical waveguides with ultra&#8208;low optical loss have been fabricated using luminescent liquid crystalline elastomers. These waveguides exhibit excellent self&#8208;adaptive properties, making them promising for integrated photonic systems enabling low&#8208;loss, high&#8208;speed data transmission.








Abstract
Currently, optical waveguides show extensive application in photonics and optoelectronic devices due to their high information capacity and transmission capabilities. However, developing self&#8208;adaptive, smart optical waveguide materials with ultra&#8208;low optical loss remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, luminescent liquid crystalline elastomers (LLCEs) with remarkable flexibility and minimal optical loss through one&#8208;pot synthetic method is synthesized, marking the first example of such an approach. The resultant organic optical waveguide materials (OOWMs) demonstrate exceptional mechanical performance and low optical loss, even under significant deformation. An optical loss coefficient of 0.0375&#160;dB&#160;mm&#8722;1 has been achieved in LLCE&#8208;based OOWMs through synergistic F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. Additionally, these flexible OOWMs can endure large deformations and be shaped into arbitrary forms within macro&#8208;scale dimensions. Notably, LLCE&#8208;based OOWMs demonstrate smart, self&#8208;adaptive behavior with ultra&#8208;low optical loss when exposed to heat or light. Consequently, these OOWMs can be used to fabricate photo switches of various shapes. This work provides a feasible approach to achieving integrated photonic systems with low optical loss for intelligent high&#8208;speed data transmission.

         <title>Improving the Dynamic Stability of High&#8208;Efficiency Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes by Core&#8211;shell Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism behind the poor dynamic stability of quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes is revealed, and their dynamic stability is significantly improved through core&#8211;shell engineering of quantum dots. With over 10 000 voltage scanning cycles in the range of 0&#8211;2.6&#160;V, this advancement brings quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes closer to commercialization.








Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QD&#8208;LEDs) hold great potential for enabling ultra&#8208;clear and ultra&#8208;bright display technologies. Although the operational life of QD&#8208;LEDs under static conditions has reached commercial standards, their dynamic stability, i.e., performance consistency while being switched on and off, remains largely behind that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art III&#8208;V inorganic LEDs. In this work, the degradation mechanism of red&#8208;emitting CdZnSe/ZnSe QD&#8208;LEDs with high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and long static operating lifetime is studied. Surprisingly, it is found that the accelerated EQE decline is mainly due to the fast&#8208;increasing electron leakage into the organic hole transport layer (HTL) under continuous voltage scans. To improve the dynamic stability of QD&#8208;LEDs, these findings inspired us to refine the size and architecture of CdZnSe/ZnSe QDs by introducing a ZnSeS/ZnS outer shell, where the ZnS shell improves the electron confinement and the ZnSeS mitigates the lattice mismatch between ZnSe and ZnS. Consequently, the electron leakage into the HTL is significantly inhibited, leading to QD&#8208;LEDs with minimal EQE drop of &lt;4% after &gt;5000 voltage cycles within a 0&#160;&#8722;&#160;4.5&#160;V voltage range, while the devices still possessed excellent static stability, as their T95 at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for over 61 000&#160;h.

         <dc:description>
An intriguing orderly&#8208;oxidization strategy is proposed to construct semi&#8208;metallic catalytic units in the topology&#8208;sensitive half&#8208;antiperovskites, in which the spin renormalization from low&#8208;spin state to high&#8208;spin state of active sites can simultaneously improve spin&#8208;dependent acidic OER reactivity and stability. These findings provide new inspirations for steering the spin&#8208;related acidic OER pathway and further promoting the application of topological materials in energy/environmental science.








Abstract
Developing inexpensive catalysts for acidic water oxidation plays a critical role in energy conversions and storages, but which have to trade off their catalytic activity and electrochemical stability. Different from traditional nano&#8208;engineering, herein we focus onto manipulating the spin&#8208;dependent topological quantum interactions to facilitate acidic water splitting at half&#8208;antiperovskite (Ni2Co1In2S2) with orderly&#8208;oxidized Kagome lattices, in which spatial wave functions of the triangular metal units (M3) are spontaneously converted to the anti&#8208;symmetry feature due to the symmetry breaking from controllable bridged&#8208;oxygen decorations (M3O), leading to a spin&#8208;selecting&#8208;dependent electronic reconfiguration. This topology&#8208;sensitive symmetry breaking makes the super&#8208;exchange interactions among neighboring metal sites switch to the indirect out&#8208;plane configuration (M&#9472;O&#9472;M) from the direct in&#8208;plane form (M&#9472;M), meanwhile the spin&#8208;dependent transformation from antiferromagnetic states to ferromagnetic states causes these metal sites to demonstrate a semi&#8208;metallic property for optimizing their bonding interactions with reactants. As a result, the capacity of carrier migration and intermediate diffusion in the inner Helmholtz region is significantly improved, which makes mass activity increase to 20.5 A g&#8722;1 at an overpotential of &#8776;356&#160;mV, demonstrating an obvious superiority over the other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts without noble metals. This work provides a new insight for designing topology&#8208;dependent catalysts to better understand spin&#8208;related reaction kinetics.

In situ polymerized polyfluorinated crosslinked polyether electrolytes are engineered for high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries. Electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorinated groups enhance oxidative stability, improve interfacial compatibility, and promote inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase formation for uniform Li deposition. Ah&#8208;level Li||NCM811 pouch cells achieve&#160;401.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 specific energy, showcasing promise for practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.








Abstract
In situ polymerized polyether electrolytes are promising for solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries due to their high ionic conductivity and excellent interfacial contact. However, their practical application is hindered by Li dendrite formation, interfacial degradation, and limited oxidative stability. Herein, we propose an in situ polymerized polyfluorinated crosslinked polyether electrolyte (PDOL&#8208;OFHDBO), synthesized by copolymerizing 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5&#8208;octafluorohexane&#8208;1,6&#8208;diyl)bis(oxirane) (OFHDBO) as a polyfluorinated crosslinker. The electron&#8208;withdrawing polyfluorinated groups endow PDOL&#8208;OFHDBO with enhanced oxidative stability and interfacial compatibility, while reducing the solvation power of the polymer matrix to promote an anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase for uniform Li deposition. Consequently, PDOL&#8208;OFHDBO exhibits a wide electrochemical stability window (&gt;5.6&#160;V) and enables long&#8208;term stable Li plating/stripping for over 1100&#160;h. Furthermore, Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) full cells utilizing PDOL&#8208;OFHDBO demonstrate outstanding cycling stability with high&#8208;loading cathodes (&#8776;3.8 mAh cm&#8722;2) and thin Li anodes (50&#160;&#181;m), achieving capacity retention of 95.5% and 89.1% over 100 cycles at cut&#8208;off voltages of 4.3 and 4.5&#160;V, respectively. Remarkably, Ah&#8208;level Li||NCM811 pouch cells deliver an impressive specific energy of 401.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, highlighting their potential for practical solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.

         <title>Mechanical Homogenization Promoting Dual&#8208;Directional Upcycling of Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an efficient dual&#8208;directional upcycling scheme enabled through a mechanical homogenization pretreatment. It enables various layered oxide cathodes to be reprocessed into fresh NCM cathodes with tailored Ni contents through boosted atomic diffusion in just 4&#160;h of solid&#8208;state sintering. Delivering upcycled cathodes with comparable electrochemical performances to their commercial counterparts, this approach excels itself from the cost&#8208;effectiveness over conventional acid&#8208;leaching resynthesis approaches.








Abstract
Upcycling is regarded as a sustainable and promising recycling solution for spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, current upcycling strategies such as converting Ni&#8208;lean to Ni&#8208;rich cathodes struggle to change the composition of the spent cathodes to meet the diverse market demands. In addition, the commonly employed molten&#8208;salts method requires tens of&#160;hours of high&#8208;temperature treatment, restricting its sustainability. Herein, this study reports an efficient, flexible dual&#8208;directional upcycling strategy to upcycle a broad family of layered oxide cathodes into fresh LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM) cathodes with tailored Ni&#8208;contents&#8212;either increased or decreased&#8212;in just 4&#160;h via mechanical homogenization pretreatment. This study confirms that the bulk diffusion of transition metals (TMs) is the rate&#8208;determining step in the resynthesis process, and the mechanical homogenization can shorten the diffusion pathway of TMs, thus reducing the sintering duration effectively. The as&#8208;upcycled NCM cathodes can deliver electrochemical performance on par with commercial counterparts. Notably, a systematic technoeconomic analysis shows that upcycling spent LiCoO2 into NCM622 can yield a profit up to 35 US$/kg, 30% higher than the conventional acid&#8208;leaching resynthesis approach. This work provides an energy&#8208;saving, widely adaptable, flexible, and cost&#8208;efficient method for regenerating spent cathode materials, paving the way for the sustainable recycling of LIBs.

         <title>Monitoring &#945;/&#946; Particles Using a Copper Cluster Scintillator Detector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper cluster scintillator with excellent stability and scintillation performance, which shows high sensitivity response to &#945;/&#946; particles, is constructed. By coupling it with PMT and nuclear electronics system, a surface contamination monitor for precise detection of &#945;/&#946; particles is successfully fabricated.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy radiation is widely used in medicine, industry, and scientific research. Meanwhile, the detection of environmental ionizing radiation is essential to ensure the safe use of high&#8208;energy radiation. Among radiation detectors, scintillator detectors offer multiple advantages, including simple structure, high sensitivity, excellent environmental adaptability, and a favorable performance&#8208;to&#8208;price ratio. However, the development of high&#8208;performance scintillators that can provide highly sensitive responses to environmental radiation, especially &#945;/&#946; particles, remains a challenge. In this work, a copper cluster (Cu4I4(DPPPy)2) with excellent water&#8208;oxygen stability is prepared using a simple one&#8208;pot method at room temperature. Cu4I4(DPPPy)2 not only exhibits excellent X&#8208;ray excited luminescence (XEL) under X&#8208;ray irradiation but also demonstrates a highly sensitive scintillation response to &#945;/&#946; particles. By integrating Cu4I4(DPPPy)2 with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and nuclear electronics, an &#945;/&#946; surface contamination monitor is successfully developed. This monitor enables the sensitive detection of excessive &#945;/&#946; particles in real&#8208;world environments. The detection frequency and signal intensity of Cu4I4(DPPPy)2 significantly surpass those of commercial scintillator of YAP:Ce, BGO, PbWO4, and anthracene under identical conditions, highlighting the promising application of metal clusters in low&#8208;dose environmental radiation detection.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Sintering Ni&#8208;W Catalytic Layer on Reductive Tungsten Carbides for Superior High&#8208;Temperature CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;sintering catalyst with efficient and ultra&#8208;stable Ni&#8208;W catalytic layer on reductive WC (NiAWC) with stabilized Ni&#948;+ sites for superior high&#8208;temperature RWGS reaction. Here the concept of design of high&#8208;performance catalysts through metal&#8208;substrate synergistic effects offers a promising path to engineering superior high&#8208;temperature thermal catalysis.








Abstract
The reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction stands out as a promising approach for selectively converting CO2 into CO, which can then be upgraded into high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. While designing high selectivity and stability catalysts for RWGS reaction remains a significant challenge. In this study, an efficient and ultra&#8208;stable Ni&#8208;W catalytic layer on reductive WC (NiAWC) is designed as an anti&#8208;sintering catalyst for superior high&#8208;temperature RWGS reaction. Benefiting from the unique structures, the NiAWC catalyst exhibits exceptionally high performances with a CO production rate of 1.84 molCO&#160;gNi&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and over 95% CO selectivity, maintaining stability for 120 h at 500&#160;&#176;C. Even after 300 h of continuous testing at 600&#160;&#176;C and five aging cycles at 800&#160;&#176;C, the activity loss is only 0.34% and 0.83%, respectively. Unlike the conventional mechanism in RWGS reaction, it is demonstrated that the Ni&#8208;W limited coordination can stabilize the Ni sites and allow a pre&#8208;oxidation of Ni&#948;+ by CO, which produces an O* electronic reservoir and hinders the charge transfer from Ni to W&#8208;O, thereby avoiding the dissolution of Ni atoms. The design of new, efficient, and selective catalysts through metal&#8208;substrate synergistic effects is suggested to offer a promising path to engineering superior thermal catalysts.

Unlike the conventional mechanism in RWGS reaction, it is demonstrated that the Ni-W limited coordination can stabilize the Ni sites and allow a pre-oxidation of Ni&lt;sup&gt;&#948;+&lt;/sup&gt; by CO, which produces an O* electronic reservoir and hinders the charge transfer from Ni to W-O, thereby avoiding the dissolution of Ni atoms. The design of new, efficient, and selective catalysts through metal-substrate synergistic effects is suggested to offer a promising path to engineering superior thermal catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Aluminum Oxyhydroxide Supraparticles as Adjuvants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral flower&#8208;like aluminum oxyhydroxide (AlOOH) supraparticles (SPs) are fabricated as an adjuvant, indicating that that L&#8208;SPs enters dendritic cells (DCs) via Toll&#8208;like receptor 2 (TLR2) to enhance NOD&#8208;like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation.








Abstract
Aluminum&#8208;based adjuvants dominate global vaccine formulations owing to their proven efficacy in humoral immunity induction. However, their inherent limitations in activating cellular immunity pose critical challenges for vaccine development. In this study, chiral flower&#8208;like aluminum oxyhydroxide (AlOOH) supraparticles (SPs) are synthesized via a one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method using cysteine (Cys) enantiomers as chiral ligands, achieving a g&#8208;factor of 0.004. L&#8208;AlOOH SPs (L&#8208;SPs) demonstrate significantly greater enhancement in dendritic cell (DC) maturation and antigen cross&#8208;presentation efficiency compared to D&#8208;AlOOH SPs (D&#8208;SPs), indicating its potential as an adjuvant. Mechanistic studies reveal that L&#8208;SPs enter DCs via Toll&#8208;like receptor 2 (TLR2), thereby enhancing NOD&#8208;like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation. In vivo experiments show that L&#8208;SPs generate 21.59&#8208;fold higher OVA&#8208;specific antibody titers than commercial aluminum adjuvants. Further studies show that L&#8208;SPs, after mixed with H9N2 virus proteins, enhance influenza virus antibody titers by 15.28&#8208;fold, with sustained protection, confirming its translational potential. This study demonstrates the performance of chiral AlOOH SPs to simultaneously amplify humoral and cellular immunological responses, entering it as a promising next&#8208;generation adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy and pandemic preparedness.

         <title>Bioactive Glass Microscaffolds Fabricated by Two&#8208;Photon Lithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microstructuring of bioactive glasses offers great potential to influence cell behavior for bone tissue engineering. By utilizing two&#8208;photon lithography of a nanocomposite and thermal post&#8208;processing, single&#8208;micron features and complex structures are achieved. The processed glass showed in vitro bioactivity and cytocompatibility toward human mesenchymal stem cells, making it suitable for culturing such cell types.








Abstract
Porous scaffolds made of bioactive glass (BG) are of great interest for tissue engineering as they can bond to bone rapidly and promote new bone formation. Pores and channels between 100 and 500&#160;&#181;m provide space for cell intrusion and nutrient supply, facilitating bone ingrowth and vascularization. Furthermore, smaller pores and structural features of a few microns in size influence cell behavior, such as adhesion and osteogenic differentiation. Additive manufacturing (AM) is well suited to fabricate such geometries. However, microstructuring BG is demanding and common AM techniques are unable to achieve features below 100&#160;&#181;m. In this work, two&#8208;photon lithography (TPL) is used for the first time to structure BG with single&#8208;micron features. A composite containing BG nanoparticles is structured using TPL and thermally processed to receive glass scaffolds. The glass used in this study demonstrates in vitro bioactivity in simulated body fluid (SBF) and cytocompatibility toward human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), making it a suitable material for tissue engineering. This process will open a toolbox for a variety of existing BG particles to be shaped with features as small as 6&#160;&#181;m and will broaden the understanding of the influence of scaffold design on cell behavior.

         <title>Harnessing Spin&#8208;Lattice Interplay in Metal Nitrides for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of Mo triggers a high&#8208;spin to low&#8208;spin transition in Co centers, achieving efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion. This spin&#8208;engineered catalytic system establishes a transformative platform for sustainable energy technologies, advancing frontier applications in electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Metal nitrides, renowned for their spin&#8208;lattice&#8208;charge interplay, offer vast potential in catalysis, electronics, and energy conversion. However, spin polarization manipulation in these nitrides remains a challenge for multi&#8208;electron electrocatalytic processes. This study introduces Co3Mo3N with a low&#8208;spin polarization configuration, achieved by incorporating spin&#8208;free lattice Mo with 4d orbitals into high&#8208;spin polarization Co4N. This innovation delivers outstanding nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia electrosynthesis, ranking among the best to date. Mo inclusion induces competing magnetic exchange interactions, reducing the spin polarization degree and enabling rate&#8208;determining step of NO2* to NO&#8208;OH* conversion via vertex&#8208;sharing NMo6 octahedra. A paired electro&#8208;refinery with a Co3Mo3N cathode achieves 2&#8201;000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 2.28&#160;V and sustains an industrial&#8208;scale current of 1&#8201;000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 2,100&#160;h, with an NH3 production rate of &#8776;70&#160;mg NH3&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2. This work establishes a transformative platform for spin polarization degree&#8208;engineered electrocatalysts, driving breakthroughs in energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer Interface with Reconstructed Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Network for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) with reconstructed hydrogen&#8208;bond network to form an efficient three&#8208;phase interface that facilitates CO2 mass transport and maintained an ideal H+/e&#8722; transfer pathway. The optimized catalyst maintains a high current density of 502.5 mA cm&#8722;2 with over 85% C2+ Faradaic efficiency and operated very stably.








Abstract
CO2 electrolysis is a promising approach to reduce CO2 emissions while achieving high&#8208;value multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products. Except for the key role of electrocatalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), Reaction microenvironment is another critical factor influencing catalytic performance for these catalysts. Herein, a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) is proposed with reconstructed hydrogen&#8208;bond network to form an efficient three&#8208;phase interface that admins mass transport and ion&#8208;electron transfer. This approach is realized by co&#8208;assembly of the fluorinated SAM (F&#8208;SAM) and siloxane on commercial Cu catalyst (Cu@F&#8208;Si composite catalyst). Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) and interfacial species analysis show that the F&#8208;SAM effectively facilitates CO2 mass transport,&#160;while the siloxane hydrogen bond network maintains an ideal H+/e&#8722; transfer pathway. Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, this strategy reveals the mechanism by which optimizing *H/*CO coverage enhances C2+ product selectivity. Ultimately, the Cu@F&#8208;Si catalyst maintains a high current density of 502.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with over 85% C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) and operates stably for more than 100&#160;h at &#8776;300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This interface engineering strategy offers a promising solution for improving the efficiency of CO2RR, with broader applications in multiphase catalytic systems.

This interface engineering strategy offers a promising solution for improving the efficiency of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR, with broader applications in multiphase catalytic systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bifacially Reinforced Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer Interfaces for Minimized Recombination Loss and Enhanced Stability in Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric &#960;&#8208;extended self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM), 4&#8208;PhCz, is designed to bifacially reinforce transparent conductive electrode/SAM and SAM/perovskite interfaces. It exhibits enhanced surface coverage on indium tin oxide (ITO) and excellent energy&#8208;level alignment with 1.67&#160;eV perovskite, ultimately achieving a 31.26% power conversion efficiency in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, retaining 92% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h of maximum power point tracking (MPPT).








Abstract
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells have shown higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) than single&#8208;junction cells. However, their record PCE still falls short of the theoretical maximum, and their stability is significantly lower than that of crystalline silicon solar cells. These challenges stem from the substantial losses in open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) and the instability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite devices, which are mainly caused by nonradiative recombination and degradation at the heterojunction interfaces, respectively. Specifically, the weak adhesion between indium tin oxide (ITO) and self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs), along with inadequate interactions between the SAMs and the perovskite, contributes to this instability. Herein, a novel SAM material, 4&#8208;(11H&#8208;benzo[a]carbazol&#8208;11&#8208;yl)butyl (4&#8208;PhCz), has been developed to bifacially reinforce interfaces by enhancing SAM coverage on ITO and strengthening the interactions between SAM and perovskites. The resulting 1.67&#160;eV perovskite solar cell (PSCs) achieves a VOC of 1.273&#160;V with a low voltage loss of 0.397&#160;V relative to the bandgap and a PCE of 22.53%. The 4&#8208;PhCz&#8208;based perovskite/silicon tandem cell achieves a VOC of 1.96&#160;V and a PCE of 31.26%, retaining 92% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under 1&#8208;sun illumination in a nitrogen atmosphere at 25 &#176;C.

         <title>Ionic Liquid MPII3 Elevates Electrochromic Battery Capacity to Practical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic liquid 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;propylimidazolium triiodide (MPII3) based electrochromic battery is developed, achieving a high areal capacity of 56&#160;396&#160;mAh&#160;m&#8722;2, which is substantially higher than those of previously reported electrochromic batteries.








Abstract
Electrochromic batteries are multifunctional devices that integrate optical modulation with energy storage capabilities through electrochemical reactions. Traditional electrochromic batteries rely on solid&#8208;state thin films, but their limited material loading constrains capacity to &#8776;100&#8211;300&#160;mAh&#160;m&#8722;2, failing to meet practical demands. Herein, an electrochromic battery based on ionic liquid 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;propylimidazolium triiodide (MPII3) is proposed, where the color&#8208;changing mechanism is based on the reversible redox reaction of I&#8722;/I3&#8722; in solution, with 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;propylimidazolium cation (MPI+) forming a complex with I3&#8722; to suppress its shuttle effect. More importantly, the resulting ionic liquid MPII3 demonstrates exceptional reaction kinetics, enabling rapid and extensive charge transfer, thereby significantly enhancing the energy storage potential of electrochromic batteries. The fabricated devices achieve a high capacity of 56396&#160;mAh&#160;m&#8722;2 at a current density of 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Additionally, these MPII3 electrochromic batteries exhibit an optical modulation as high as 68.1% and excellent cycling stability, with 92.3% capacity retention after 20&#160;000 cycles. These findings represent a significant advancement and are expected to promote the practical application of electrochromic batteries in smart windows, energy&#8208;efficient buildings, and other fields.

         <title>A High&#8208;Throughput Approach to Identifying Environment&#8208;Friendly Artificial Antisolvents for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput approach is used to screen 40 perovskite antisolvents and pinpoint specific regions favorable for the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films based on Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs). The low&#8208;toxicity candidates are obtained by adjusting the HSPs and validated for different perovskite compositions.








Abstract
Rapid crystallization facilitated by antisolvents is widely employed for producing high&#8208;quality perovskite films, but constrained by the limited variety and high toxicity of conventional solvents, underscoring the need for sustainable and low&#8208;toxicity solvent systems for large&#8208;scale production. In this study, a systematic screening of over 40 antisolvents is conducted using a high&#8208;throughput platform, uncovering a significant correlation between the antisolvent properties within Hansen solubility space and the structural and optoelectronic characteristics of the resultant perovskite films. A Hansen solubility sphere is subsequently constructed, pinpointing a specific region within this space that is most conducive to the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films. The underlying mechanism is further elucidated: antisolvents situated outside this optimal region either induce a rapid extraction of N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF), thereby limiting grain growth due to insufficient crystallization time or fail to adequately extract DMF. Since no ideal low&#8208;toxicity single antisolvent is found, a general concept based on solvent combinations with ultra&#8208;low&#8208;toxicity is introduced to solve the issues. The design rule for environment&#8208;friendly &#8220;artificial&#8221; solvents, which is validated for different perovskite compositions, paves the way for sustainable development and production of perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic technologies.

         <title>An Atomically Dispersed Pd Sub&#8208;Metallene: Intermediate State of Single Atoms and Metal Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work fabricates abundant vacancy defects on the MXene surface for anchoring neighboring metal single atoms, to construct atomically dispersed sub&#8208;metallene (Pd ADSM) on the nanoscale. Pd ADSM combines the advantages of 2D structures, single atoms, and metal bonds, which makes it excellent and active in alkaline hydrogen evolution reactions and room&#8208;temperature hydrogen sensing.









Abstract
Despite the metal coordination and single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) have been extensively investigated in surface science over the past decade, their overall activity in involving multi&#8208;step reactions remains unsatisfactory owing to the metal bond and single atom being irreconcilable. Here, a stable atomically dispersed Pd sub&#8208;metallene (Pd ADSM) layer supported on the 2D MXene (Mo2TiC2) is reported, which combines the advantages of 2D structures, single atoms, and metal bonds. Pd ADSM shows covalent structures along the z&#8208;coordination and highly coordinated metal bonds in the 2D direction. During the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Pd ADSM shows 7&#8208; and 112&#8208;times higher mass activity than the SAC (Pd SAC) and commercial Pt/C at the overpotential of &#8722;108 mV, respectively. Operando characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the Pd&#9472;Pd interface not only makes the adsorbed water form a flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded skeleton closer to the catalytic center but also reduces the energy barrier for the HER rate&#8208;determining step. Moreover, the moderate adsorption energy of Pd&#9472;Pd bonds in ADSM can rapidly activate, dissociate, and desorb hydrogen molecules at room temperature, resulting in record&#8208;high hydrogen sensing performances (Response time, Recovery time, and Sensitivity for 100 ppm H2 are 4.8, 1.6 s, and 43.5%, respectively).

Here, a stable atomically dispersed Pd sub-metallene (Pd ADSM) layer supported on the 2D MXene (Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is reported, which combines the advantages of 2D structures, single atoms, and metal bonds. Pd ADSM shows covalent structures along the z-coordination and highly coordinated metal bonds in the 2D direction. During the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Pd ADSM shows 7- and 112-times higher mass activity than the SAC (Pd SAC) and commercial Pt/C at the overpotential of &#8722;108 mV, respectively. &lt;i&gt;Operando&lt;/i&gt; characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the Pd&#9472;Pd interface not only makes the adsorbed water form a flexible hydrogen-bonded skeleton closer to the catalytic center but also reduces the energy barrier for the HER rate-determining step. Moreover, the moderate adsorption energy of Pd&#9472;Pd bonds in ADSM can rapidly activate, dissociate, and desorb hydrogen molecules at room temperature, resulting in record-high hydrogen sensing performances (Response time, Recovery time, and Sensitivity for 100 ppm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are 4.8, 1.6 s, and 43.5%, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Toward the Ideal Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalyst: a Noble Metal&#8208;Free Antiperovskite Optimized with A&#8208;Site Tuning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free antiperovskite CdNNi3 is for the first time reported to fulfill the essential criteria for an ideal alkaline HER electrocatalyst with excellent performance, benefiting from the inherent metallic characteristics and unique multifunction&#8208;site synergy whereby Ni sites facilitate the H2O dissociation/OH&#8722; desorption and Cd&#8211;Ni bridge sites are active for the optimal H* adsorption and H2 evolution.








Abstract
To achieve the ideal non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal HER electrocatalyst in alkaline media, developing conductive systems with multiple active sites targeting every elementary step in the alkaline HER, is highly desirable but remains a great challenge. Herein, a conductive noble metal&#8208;free antiperovskite CdNNi3 is reported with intrinsic metallic characteristics as a highly efficient alkaline HER electrocatalyst, which is designed by the facile A&#8208;site tuning strategy with the modulation the electronic structures and interfacial water configurations of antiperovskites. Impressively, the HER performance of CdNNi3 antiperovskite is superior to various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;noble metal catalysts ever reported, and also outperforms the commercial Raney Ni catalyst when assemble as the cathode in the practical anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) device. With insights from comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations, the CdNNi3 can create synergistic dual active sites for catalyzing different elementary steps of the alkaline HER; namely, the Ni site can effectively facilitate the H2O dissociation and OH&#8722; desorption, while the unusual Cd&#8211;Ni bridge site is active for the optimal H* adsorption and H2 evolution. Such multifunction&#8208;site synergy, together with inherent high electrical conductivity, enables the CdNNi3 antiperovskite to fulfill the essential criteria for an ideal non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal alkaline HER electrocatalyst with excellent performance.

         <title>Thermodynamically Self&#8208;Assembly Hydration&#8208;Cycle Crystals for Multidimensional Off&#8208;Grid Water&#8208;Energy Nexus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recyclable hydrophilic coordination scaffolds (RHCS) for sustainable water&#8208;energy systems are presented. The Ca2+&#8208;SO42&#8722; bilayer, stabilized by dynamic hydrogen bonds, enables: 1) 44% lower evaporation enthalpy via asymmetric hydration, 2) ambient self&#8208;assembly of superhydrophilic substrates, and 3) temperature&#8208;responsive regeneration. RHCS reduces energy use by 1&#8211;2 orders versus conventional systems, which offer a closed&#8208;loop solution to global water&#8208;energy challenges.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) technology shows water&#8208;energy solution potential but faces industrialization barriers from substrate scalability limits. Here, a regenerative hydrated coordination scaffold (R&#8208;HCS) is presented that redefines material design by leveraging water molecules as dynamic structural directors throughout the material lifecycle. Unlike conventional hydrogel/aerogel systems requiring energy&#8208;intensive crosslinking (&#8722;&#916;E = 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude) or freeze&#8208;drying processes, R&#8208;HCS forms spontaneously through water&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly of calcium sulfate under ambient conditions. Hydration shells drive hierarchical crystallization while fundamentally restructuring hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, achieving a 44% reduction in water evaporation enthalpy. The framework demonstrates unique thermal reconfiguration, exhibiting reversible dissociation&#8208;reassembly behavior (&gt;100 &#176;C threshold) that enables full material regeneration (performance decay &lt; 5%) using solar thermal energy/waste heat without chemical additives. Crucially, RHCS maintains exceptional ligand stability even when utilizing natural seawater. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an R&#8208;HCS integrated passive evaporation module achieves 77.2% water recovery under 1 sun irradiation, coupled with 30 &#176;C thermal assembly temperature reduction at 1.5 sun intensity. Concurrently, crystallizer units maintain stable 2.31&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 evaporation rates in 3.5 wt% brine. This water&#8208;centric design paradigm establishes a new class of adaptive materials where solvent&#8211;solute interactions become the driving force for circular water&#8208;energy systems, potentially redefining sustainable infrastructure for off&#8208;grid regions.

         <title>Steric Hindrance&#8208;Induced Amorphous Lithium Sulfide Deposition Accelerates Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong coordination between benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 and Li+ generates the steric hindrance effect, successfully enabling the amorphous deposition of lithium sulfide (Li2S). This approach restructures the energy level distribution of Li2S, synchronously optimizing its molecular orbital energies and inducing uniform nucleation and growth. Consequently, it significantly reduces the kinetic barriers along the Li2S deposition pathway.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#9472;S) batteries are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density. However, their practical application is severely hindered by the sluggish conversion kinetics, particularly during the crystalline lithium sulfide (Li2S) formation stage. Herein, a steric hindrance&#8208;mediated engineering strategy is proposed that induces an amorphous Li2S deposition process, effectively boosting the sulfur redox kinetics in Li&#9472;S batteries. By introducing benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (B15C5) as an electrolyte additive, a strong coordination between B15C5 and lithium ion (Li+) is established, which creates spatial confinement around Li2S and disrupts the crystallinity of Li2S during its deposition. Synchrotron pair distribution function analysis combined with in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the deposited Li2S with B15C5 exhibits significant local disorder with irregular Li&#9472;S bond oscillations, confirming the generation of an amorphous phase. This strategy not only ensures a uniform Li2S layer at the cathode/electrolyte interface but also lowers the energy barrier of sulfur species at the molecular scale, enabling the Li&#9472;S batteries with excellent cycling stability and overall enhanced sulfur reaction kinetics. This work provides a novel pathway for overcoming the intrinsic limitations of sluggish cathode conversion kinetics of Li&#9472;S batteries, paving the way for their practical deployment in high&#8208;performance energy storage applications.

         <title>eg Electron Occupancy as a Descriptor for Designing Iron Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eg electron occupancy descriptor for Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C is proposed to link the reaction rate of the electrocatalytic reduction reaction. This descriptor provides guidelines for the rational design of single&#8208;atom catalysts for the ORR as well as various other processes, showing great promise for advancing metal&#8208;air batteries to practical applications.








Abstract
A quantitative electronic structure&#8208;performance relationship is highly desired for the design of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). The Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts supported by ordered mesoporous carbon with the eg electron occupancy from 1.7 to 0.7 are synthesized. A linear relationship has been established between the eg electron occupancy of the Fe site and the catalytic activity/activation entropy of oxygen&#8208;related intermediates. Fe SAC with an eg electron occupancy of 0.7 alters the rate determining step from *OH desorption to *OOH formation. The value of the turn&#8208;over frequency is &#8776;28 times that of the Fe SAC site with an eg electron occupancy of 1.7 e, and the mass activity is &#8776;6.3 times that of commercial Pt/C. When used in a zinc&#8211;air battery, the Fe SAC gives a remarkable power density of 196.3&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and a long&#8208;term stability exceeding 1500&#160;h. The discovery of eg electron occupancy descriptor provides valuable insights for designing single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; electron occupancy descriptor for Fe-N-C is proposed to link the reaction rate of the electrocatalytic reduction reaction. This descriptor provides guidelines for the rational design of single-atom catalysts for the ORR as well as various other processes, showing great promise for advancing metal-air batteries to practical applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quantitative electronic structure-performance relationship is highly desired for the design of single-atom catalysts (SACs). The Fe single-atom catalysts supported by ordered mesoporous carbon with the &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; electron occupancy from 1.7 to 0.7 are synthesized. A linear relationship has been established between the &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; electron occupancy of the Fe site and the catalytic activity/activation entropy of oxygen-related intermediates. Fe SAC with an &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; electron occupancy of 0.7 alters the rate determining step from &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;OH desorption to &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;OOH formation. The value of the turn-over frequency is &#8776;28 times that of the Fe SAC site with an &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; electron occupancy of 1.7 e, and the mass activity is &#8776;6.3 times that of commercial Pt/C. When used in a zinc&#8211;air battery, the Fe SAC gives a remarkable power density of 196.3&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a long-term stability exceeding 1500&#160;h. The discovery of &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; electron occupancy descriptor provides valuable insights for designing single-atom electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redox Oscillation Enhanced Water&#8208;Enabled Electric Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the bioelectrical phenomena based on the membrane potential variations and the glucose oxidation/reduction reactions, a redox oscillation enhanced water&#8208;enabled electric generator is proposed. The oscillating redox process not only boosts the ion&#8208;electron conversion at the interface but also realizes the synergy between the non&#8208;Faraday and Faraday current. The generator achieves an impressive peak electric output of 1.20 mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.41 W m&#8722;2 for 60 days.








Abstract
The energy crisis driven by the widespread use of fossil fuels highlights the urgent need for green energy solutions. A variety of green electric generators based on interfacial ion regulation have emerged in recent years. However, conventional electricity generation methods that rely solely on ion movement at interfaces suffer from a rapid decline in electrical signals due to poor ion&#8208;electron conversion at the interface. Inspired by the bioelectrical phenomena based on the variations in membrane potential and the glucose oxidation/reduction reactions, a redox oscillation enhanced water&#8208;enabled electric generator is herein proposed. The oscillating redox process not only boosts the ion&#8208;electron conversion at the interface but also enables the synergy between the non&#8208;Faraday current and the Faraday current. As a result, the generator achieves an impressive peak electric output of 1.20 mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.41 W m&#8722;2 for 60 days, outperforming various water&#8208;enabled electric generators. Furthermore, this generator can be integrated into a flexible unit for both portable and large&#8208;scale applications. This work presents a novel approach for enhancing the output of green energy devices based on interfacial ion migration.

         <title>Modularized Cathode with Neural Network Topology for High Rate and Fault&#8208;Tolerant Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

In this study, a modular electrode system is designed by employing nanozyme&#8208;embedded microreactor units as independent reaction modules and establishing a fully connected cascaded neural network topology to enable efficient inter&#8208;module interconnection and synergistic optimization.








Abstract
Enhancing the redox kinetics of electrodes, achieving synergistic optimization of local energy conversion and overall charge transfer, and overcoming the technical bottleneck of significant performance degradation due to local unit failure in traditional electrode systems are crucial for developing high&#8208;rate lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Here, a modular cathode system (CoB1N3&#8208;MR/FNN) with a fully connected cascade neural network topology (FNN) is designed by constructing microreactor modules (CoB1N3&#8208;MRs) with embedded nanozymes (Co&#8208;B1N3), ordering and efficiently interconnecting them. This system not only enables efficient energy conversion within individual microreactors but also significantly enhances the long&#8208;range charge transport efficiency and energy aggregation capacity of the electrodes. Furthermore, CoB1N3&#8208;MR/FNN achieves fault tolerance to local damage through its distributed energy storage units and redundant charge transport channels. This synergistically enhanced modular electrode system for energy conversion and charge transport exhibits high specific discharge capacity (0.2 C, 1211 mAh g&#8722;1) and excellent rate capability (5 C, 731.26 mAh g&#8722;1; 10 C, 471.05 mAh g&#8722;1), and shows outstanding electrochemical performances in high sulfur loading, low electrolytes, and flexible pouch batteries (0.2 C, 1165 mAh g&#8722;1), fully demonstrating its practical application value.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Out&#8208;Of&#8208;Plane Ferroelectricity in 1T&#8242;/1H MoS2 Heterophase Bilayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity is observed in 1T&#8242;/1H MoS2 bilayers synthesized via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The phenomenon is confirmed through structural analysis using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), as well as switching behavior characterized by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) measurements. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the ferroelectricity originates from interlayer sliding. This discovery extends the scope of 2D ferroelectrics to vertically stacked heterophase systems, offering new opportunities for exploring coupled phenomena in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs).








Abstract
The emergence of heterophase 2D materials, distinguished by their unique structures, has led to the discovery of a multitude of intriguing physical properties and a broad range of potential applications. Here, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity is uncovered in a heterophase structure of 1T&#8242;/1H MoS2, which is synthesized via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) by tuning the formation energies for MoS2 with varied phases. The atomically resolved structures of the obtained 1T&#8242;/1H MoS2 bilayers are captured using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and are confirmed to be non&#8208;centrosymmetric using second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) characterizations. The intrinsic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization is visualized by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), which reveals that ferroelectric domains can be manipulated under an applied electric field. Ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) devices fabricated on these bilayers exhibit reversible switching between a high resistance state (HRS) and a low resistance state (LRS). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate that the intrinsic ferroelectricity in 1T&#8242;/1H bilayers is attributed to interlayer sliding and lattice mismatch. The findings not only expand the scope of 2D ferroelectrics to include vertically stacked heterophase bilayers but also open avenues for exploring the coupling effect between ferroelectricity and other phenomena such as magnetism, superconductivity, and photocatalysis in 2D heterophase TMDCs.

         <title>Retarding the Growth Kinetics of Chemical Bath Deposited Nickel Oxide Films for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Minimodules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amino&#8208;alcohol ligand with strong binding affinity to Ni2+ is employed to modulate the growth kinetics of chemical bath deposited NiOx for preparing compact NiOx film with superior coverage, enhanced conductivity and reduced defect density, finally realizing the highest efficiency of 26.53% along with great operational stability and scalability for the champion device based on NiOx/SAM hole transport layer.








Abstract
The interfacial contact between the hole transport layer (HTL) and perovskite layer plays a critical role in determining the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, to address the limitations of commercial NiOx nanoparticles and realize low temperature fabrication of compact NiOx film, a chemical bath deposition (CBD) approach is employed and strategically modified. By introducing an amino&#8208;alcohol ligand of triisopropanolamine (TPA) into the precursor, the deposition process is effectively controlled. TPA binds strongly with Ni2+ ions, facilitating their gradual release and promoting the in situ formation of a compact Ni(OH)2 intermediate. This retarded growth kinetics yield high&#8208;quality NiOx films with enhanced coverage, increased conductivity, and reduced trap&#8208;state. The films also feature abundant hydroxyl groups, providing sufficient anchoring sites for MeO&#8208;2PACz. Based on this bilayer HTL, a PCE of 26.53% (certified 26.44%) with improved operational stability is achieved for the 0.09&#160;cm2 device, marking the highest efficiency for inverted PSCs based on CBD NiOx. Furthermore, the strategy demonstrates excellent scalability, delivering efficiencies of 24.75% for a 1&#160;cm2 device and 22.96% for a 12.96&#160;cm2 minimodule. This work provides a facile but effective CBD approach for preparing high&#8208;quality NiOx films, offering a promising and scalable pathway for inverted PSCs.

Herein, to address the limitations of commercial NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles and realize low temperature fabrication of compact NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; film, a chemical bath deposition (CBD) approach is employed and strategically modified. By introducing an amino-alcohol ligand of triisopropanolamine (TPA) into the precursor, the deposition process is effectively controlled. TPA binds strongly with Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, facilitating their gradual release and promoting the in situ formation of a compact Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate. This retarded growth kinetics yield high-quality NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; films with enhanced coverage, increased conductivity, and reduced trap-state. The films also feature abundant hydroxyl groups, providing sufficient anchoring sites for MeO-2PACz. Based on this bilayer HTL, a PCE of 26.53% (certified 26.44%) with improved operational stability is achieved for the 0.09&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; device, marking the highest efficiency for inverted PSCs based on CBD NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, the strategy demonstrates excellent scalability, delivering efficiencies of 24.75% for a 1&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; device and 22.96% for a 12.96&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; minimodule. This work provides a facile but effective CBD approach for preparing high-quality NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; films, offering a promising and scalable pathway for inverted PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Charge Transfer in ZnO/COF S&#8208;Scheme Photocatalyst via Zn&#9472;N Bond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the role of interfacial Zn&#9472;N bonds in enhancing charge transfer and optimizing energy band alignment in S&#8208;scheme ZnO/covalent organic framework heterojunctions. Theoretical calculations, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy confirm the mechanism, providing molecular&#8208;level insights into charge transfer processes and guiding the design of efficient photocatalysts for artificial photosynthetic systems.








Abstract
Photocatalysis is a promising solution to global energy shortage and environmental problems. Inspired by photosynthesis, multicomponent heterostructured photocatalysts are extensively investigated, and step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) heterojunction has emerged as the theoretical basis for delineating charge transfer processes in predominant heterostructured photocatalysts. However, the specific charge transfer pathway across an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction remains elusive from an atomic/molecular perspective. Herein, it is demonstrated that in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts composed of imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks and nanostructured zinc oxide, interfacial Zn&#9472;N bonds are formed between the two components and play critical roles as a charge transfer gateway in the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction, based on theoretical calculations, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Moreover, mechanisms for enhanced charge transfer across the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction are elucidated using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. This work provides new insights into molecular&#8208;level understanding of charge transfer mechanisms in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts for promoting energy and environmental applications of artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Fast Screening Suitable Doping Transition Metals to Na3V2(PO4)2F3 for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries with High Energy Density in Wide&#8208;Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new computational prediction&#8208;assisted chemical synthesis&#160;strategy&#160;quickly screens for Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF), and verified by experiments with dopants like Ru, Fe, Ni, and others. The mechanism follows a multi&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;solution reaction with minimal strain variation. Compromising the cost and performance, NVPF&#8208;Fe is regarded as the optimized cathode candidate for sodium&#8208;ion batteries with high energy density features for wide&#8208;temperature application.








Abstract
Screening the suitable doping elements for Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) through the traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error method to enhance its intrinsic electronic conductivity and electrochemical performance is a time&#8208;exhausted task. Here, a new strategy of theoretical prediction&#8208;assisted chemical synthesis is proposed to fast filter the suitable doping elements to NVPF by first calculating the band gaps of various transition metals doped NVPF and then verifying by the experimental results. Single crystal NVPF&#8208;M (Na3V1.85M0.15(PO4)2F3, M = Ru, Fe, Ni, Ti, and Cd, etc.) materials are synthesized to compare their electrochemical performances. Excellent cycling performance (2000 cycles with high Coulombic efficiencies), remarkable rate capacity (20 C), and wide&#8208;temperature range (&#8722;30&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C) application capability are witnessed in the NVPF&#8208;Ru/Fe cathodes in both half and full cells. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns have confirmed that they followed the consisting of multi&#8208;phase reactions (Na3 &#8596; Na2.4 &#8596; Na2.2 &#8596; Na1) and a solid&#8208;solution reaction (Na1.8 &#8596; Na1.3) with small changes of lattice volume and strains. Compromising the cost and performance, the NVPF&#8208;Fe cathode is regarded as the optimized cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries with a high energy density and wide temperature application features.

         <title>Selective Urea Electrosynthesis from CO2 and Nitrate on Spin&#8208;Polarized Atomically Ordered PdCuCo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically ordered, spin&#8208;polarized Co&#8208;doped PdCu intermetallic compound is rationally synthesized. The introduction of spin&#8208;polarized Co atoms can enhance the *NO binding and hydrogenation on its N&#8208;side to form *HNO, which further produces *NH2OH. The subsequent coupling of *CO and *NH2OH leads to the efficient and stable formation of urea.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic conversion of NO3&#8722; and CO2 into urea features a potential means of reducing carbon footprint and generating value&#8208;added chemicals. Nonetheless, due to the limited efficiency of carbon&#8722;nitrogen (C&#9472;N) coupling and the competing side reaction that forms ammonia, the urea selectivity and production yield have remained low. In this work, a spin&#8722;polarized cobalt&#8722;doped, atomically ordered PdCu intermetallic compound (denoted as PdCuCo) is developed as an efficient urea electrosynthesis catalyst. The Pd and Cu serve as the adsorption sites for CO2 and NO3&#8722;, respectively, and the spin&#8722;polarized Co sites promote the adsorption of *NO intermediate, followed by hydrogenation of *NO at its N&#8722;terminal to form *HNO, instead of at its O&#8722;terminal. The difference in the hydrogenation position switches the subsequent reaction pathway to produce urea, in contrast to the PdCu or Ni&#8722;doped PdCu intermetallic compounds with main product selectivity of ammonia. The PdCuCo electrocatalyst exhibited an outstanding electrosynthesis of urea from NO3&#8722; and CO2, including a Faradaic efficiency of 81%, a high urea yield of 227&#160;mmol gcat.&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, and a notable electrochemical stability of &gt;260 h, suggesting the attractive potential of designing spin&#8722;polarized catalytic sites for carbon&#8722;nitrogen coupling processes.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Rigid Ultra&#8208;Micropore Membranes for Ultrahigh&#8208;Power Osmotic Energy Harvesting from High&#8208;Temperature Hypersaline Brine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rigid ultra&#8208;micropores are constructed by confining the semi&#8208;rigid sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) molecules in graphene oxide nanochannels and fixing them with an amphiphilic molecule. The power density of the membrane can reach up to 371.65 W m&#8722;2 with high temperature (60 &#176;C) hypersaline brine (5M/0.5M), which can be obtained from a solar stiller.








Abstract
Osmotic energy is a promising renewable energy source for its giant reserves and can be easily harvested with ion selective membranes. However, the output power density in membrane&#8208;scale applications is always below 10 W m&#8722;2 due to the high resistance from low salinity solution and the serious concentration polarization phenomenon. Here, this study shows that rigid ultra&#8208;micropores can greatly improve the output power density of the osmotic energy conversion process with high&#8208;temperature hypersaline brine. The membrane with rigid ultra&#8208;micropores is constructed by confining the high&#8208;content semi&#8208;rigid sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) molecules in graphene oxide nanochannels and fixing them with amphiphilic molecules. The output power density of the membrane can be as high as 175.1 W m&#8722;2 with an energy conversion efficiency of 44.5% at the salinity gradient of 5 M/0.5 M, which can further increase to 371.65 W m&#8722;2 when the solution temperature is up to 60 &#176;C. This study also demonstrates that the high&#8208;temperature hypersaline brine can be obtained from a passive solar stiller. The molecular engineering of ion selective membranes and the optimization strategy of the reverse electrodialysis process will inspire the development of a next&#8208;generation osmotic energy harvesting system.

&lt;p&gt;The rigid ultra-micropores are constructed by confining the semi-rigid sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) molecules in graphene oxide nanochannels and fixing them with an amphiphilic molecule. The power density of the membrane can reach up to 371.65 W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with high temperature (60 &#176;C) hypersaline brine (5M/0.5M), which can be obtained from a solar stiller.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osmotic energy is a promising renewable energy source for its giant reserves and can be easily harvested with ion selective membranes. However, the output power density in membrane-scale applications is always below 10 W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; due to the high resistance from low salinity solution and the serious concentration polarization phenomenon. Here, this study shows that rigid ultra-micropores can greatly improve the output power density of the osmotic energy conversion process with high-temperature hypersaline brine. The membrane with rigid ultra-micropores is constructed by confining the high-content semi-rigid sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) molecules in graphene oxide nanochannels and fixing them with amphiphilic molecules. The output power density of the membrane can be as high as 175.1 W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with an energy conversion efficiency of 44.5% at the salinity gradient of 5 M/0.5 M, which can further increase to 371.65 W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; when the solution temperature is up to 60 &#176;C. This study also demonstrates that the high-temperature hypersaline brine can be obtained from a passive solar stiller. The molecular engineering of ion selective membranes and the optimization strategy of the reverse electrodialysis process will inspire the development of a next-generation osmotic energy harvesting system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Coupled Polyhedral Distortion in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes for Synergistically Inhibiting Capacity and Voltage Decay</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on density functional theory calculations, machine learning, and experimental validation, a general design approach is provided to suppress performance degradation by modulating coupled polyhedral distortion in layered cathode materials. The developed Li&#8208;rich cathode exhibits remarkable long&#8208;term capacity and voltage stability, with 95.8% capacity retention after 300 cycles and 0.02% voltage decay per cycle.








Abstract
Achieving significant enhancements in both capacity and voltage stability remains a formidable challenge for Li&#8208;rich layered cathodes. The severe performance degradation is attributed to large lattice strain, irreversible oxygen release and transition metal migration, but the most critical factor responsible for structural destabilization is still elusive. Here, based on density functional theory calculations, machine learning and experimental validation, a multi&#8208;hierarchy screening of complex multi&#8208;element doping systems is developed from electrochemical activity, lattice strain, oxygen stability and transition metal migration barrier. It is further identified that the coupled polyhedral distortion parameter D+&#963;2 of the substitution element is the most significant feature that affects the structural stability during cycling. The Li&#8208;rich layered cathode developed based on the predicted results exhibits remarkable long&#8208;term capacity stability (95.8% capacity retention over 300 cycles) and negligible voltage loss (0.02% voltage decay per cycle). This study provides a general approach by modulating coupled polyhedral distortion for the rational design of cathode materials and can be expanded to the discovery of other advanced electrodes.

         <title>Significantly Enhanced Density and Mechanical Strength of Carbon/Graphite Blocks by Waste Gas Pressurized Sintering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The waste gas generated during carbonization in an enclosed space forms a high internal pressure, thereby effectively promoting the polymerization and densification of the carbon block. This self&#8208;generated pressure, known as waste gas pressurization (WGP), ensures tighter bonding between carbon particles, lower porosity, and obviously higher mechanical strength without the participation of external gas or mechanical compression.








Abstract
Carbonization under pressure is crucial for enhancing carbon/graphite materials. However, conventional pressure sintering, relying on mechanical or external gas pressure, often results in incomplete densification and structural defects due to uncontrolled volatile gas release. Herein, high&#8208;density and high&#8208;strength self&#8208;sintered carbon block in enclosed&#8208;space (SCB&#8208;E) are produced using waste gas pressurization (WGP) derived from green petroleum coke (GPC). This method can enhance the formation of C&#9472;O&#9472;C and C&#9552;O bonds by promoting dehydration polymerization reaction, which induces interfacial bonding in the carbonization process. Consequently, a decreased mass loss, increased volume shrinkage, and reduced porosity are observed, thereby endowing the obtained SCB&#8208;E with significantly improved density and mechanical strength. Specifically, the compressive and flexural strengths of SCB&#8208;E are 6.36 and 5.77 times higher than SCB&#8208;O sintered in open&#8208;space, respectively, while the corresponding graphite block (SG&#8208;E) achieves 7.74 and 4.58 times greater compressive and flexural strengths than SG&#8208;O. Notably, WGP not only enhances the yield of crack&#8208;free carbon blocks and supports scale&#8208;up production but also integrates seamlessly with traditional kneading processes to produce high&#8208;density, high&#8208;strength carbon blocks (CB&#8208;E). The current approach offers an innovative and important platform for enhancing the density and mechanical properties of bulk materials.

         <title>Conjugated Side&#8208;Chains Optimize Giant Acceptor Compatibility with Low&#8208;Cost Polymer Donor to Overcome the Cost&#8208;Efficiency&#8208;Stability Trilemma in Polymer Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency and stable polymer solar cells typically rely on expensive oligomeric small&#8208;molecule acceptors and high&#8208;cost polymer donors. To overcome this limitation, conjugated side chains are strategically employed to modulate and dimerize acceptors, precisely tuning their thermodynamic properties for optimal compatibility with the low&#8208;cost polymer donor PTQ10. This approach provides a viable pathway toward sustainable and renewable energy solutions.








Abstract
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) rely on blends of small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) and polymer donors, but the thermodynamic relaxation of SMAs requires an oligomeric approach to enhance operational stability. However, high&#8208;efficiency devices often depend on the expensive synthesis of oligomeric SMAs and costly polymer donors, posing a significant barrier to achieving sustainable and renewable energy. Here, the challenge is addressed through a thermodynamically derived compatibility of giant acceptors with the low&#8208;cost polymer donor PTQ10. This is achieved by strategically employing conjugated side chains to modulate and dimerize acceptors, thereby precisely tuning their thermodynamic properties to optimize compatibility. Our synthetic&#160;route avoids toxic reagents, halogenated solvents, and harsh conditions. The dimer (DYBT) incorporating an n&#8208;type linker enhances crystallinity, absorption, and intramolecular superexchange coupling compared to its p&#8208;type counterpart, and achieves a device efficiency of 19.53%. Considering efficiency, stability, and material cost, the potential cost per kilowatt for the PTQ10:DYBT device is 0.10 $&#160;kW&#8722;1, while most systems exceed 10 $&#160;kW&#8722;1. These findings offer valuable insights for the cost&#8208;effective oligomeric acceptors, to well pair with low&#8208;cost donors and reduce the overall material cost of the photo&#8208;active layer for sustainable and durable energy.

         <title>Multidimensional Modulation via&#160;Tailored Covalent Organic Frameworks Enables Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with 26.21% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrazinelinked covalent organic framework (COF) is synthesized for the first time and integrated into perovskite for multidimensional regulation of crystallization, defect states, and charge separation, synergistically. Benefiting from the oriented crystallization, which eliminates defects, together with the optimized interfacial charge transfer, the optimal device achieves an excellent efficiency of 26.21% with greatly improved humidity, thermal, and illumination stabilities.








Abstract
Despite the remarkable advancements in inverted perovskite solar cells, their commercialization remains hindered by critical bottlenecks in efficiency and stability stemming from inadequate crystallization and unfavorable interfacial states. Herein, for the first time, a judiciously designed hydrazine&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) with long alkane phosphate branch chains, named 12&#8208;SD&#8208;COF, is synthesized and integrated into the perovskite precursor to achieve multidimensional regulation of crystallization, defect states, and charge separation synergistically. It is found that the 12&#8208;SD&#8208;COF featuring periodic pores, large planar structure, and abundant binding groups is extruded from the precursor solution onto the buried interface, surface, and grain boundaries, facilitating oriented crystallization while eliminating defects of perovskites, thereby yielding high&#8208;quality crystals with suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination. Simultaneously, the interfacial charge separation is synergistically facilitated by the p&#8208;type doping&#8208;optimized energy level alignment and the induced intramolecular electric field, ultimately achieving an exceptional power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.21%, the highest yet reported for COF&#8208;modified. Impressively, the non&#8208;encapsulated resultant device delivers greatly improved stabilities, with maintaining over 92% of initial PCE after being aged under 85&#160;&#176;C continuous heating stress for 800&#160;h, 1000&#160;h in 50&#177;3% relative humidity air, and 1200&#160;h under continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination, respectively.

Impressively, the non-encapsulated resultant device delivers greatly improved stabilities, with maintaining over 92% of initial PCE after being aged under 85&#160;&#176;C continuous heating stress for 800&#160;h, 1000&#160;h in 50&#177;3% relative humidity air, and 1200&#160;h under continuous 1-sun illumination, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Melt&#8208;Processable Polymer Semiconductors with Large&#8208;Ring Crown Ether Side Chains for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large&#8208;ring crown ether side chain is introduced to conjugated polymers to enable low&#8208;temperature melt processing while retaining high charge transport performance. The resulting polymers form highly aligned films via melt friction transfer, achieving enhanced mobility in organic transistors. This ecofriendly strategy supports scalable fabrication of high&#8208;performance polymer electronics with reduced solvent reliance.








Abstract
Polymer semiconductors are crucial components in organic electronics and have shown remarkable progress in recent years. However, their dependence on halogenated solvents for film processing raises environmental concerns and introduces risks of defects caused by residual solvent molecules during film drying. Melt processing has emerged as a sustainable alternative for fabricating polymer semiconductor films. Despite its potential, balancing low melting temperatures with high charge transport performance remains challenging, as high&#8208;performance polymers typically exhibit high melting points due to their rigid conjugated backbones. This study introduces a molecular design strategy incorporating large&#8208;ring crown ether (LCE) side chains to enhance the melt processability of conjugated polymers. This approach reduces the melt temperature to as low as 70 &#176;C while maintaining excellent charge transport performance. Highly aligned polymer films are fabricated using melt friction transfer processing and employed in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), achieving a carrier mobility of up to 1.06 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in the channel&#8208;parallel direction, approximately 2.5 times greater than their non&#8208;oriented counterparts. Aggregation structure characterizations reveal that these LCE side chains not only enable low melting temperature but also facilitate bimodal texture formation, creating 3D pathways for efficient charge transport. This strategy offers a scalable, eco&#8208;friendly approach to produce high&#8208;performance electronics.

         <title>Tailoring Cold&#8208;Resilient Electrolytes Driven by Mechanisms Underlying Ice Melting for Cryogenic Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a fresh perspective from mechanisms of chemical ice melting identifies key criteria influencing the selection of effective solutes for the development of more reliable cold&#8208;resilient electrolytes. The screened ice&#8208;melting chemical potassium formate effectively enables the realization of ultra&#8208;stable reversibility in a low&#8208;temperature environment.








Abstract
The freezing and melting behaviors of aqueous solutions are strongly influenced by the presence of chemical substances, yet the criteria for screening effective chemicals remain poorly defined. This study introduces a novel perspective to designing cold&#8208;resilient electrolytes by focusing on the mechanisms underlying ice melting and identifying the key screening criteria, providing new insights into how specific chemicals can enhance the cryogenic properties of aqueous solutions. A series of theoretical and experimental tools highlight its superior low&#8208;temperature tolerance endowed by the screened chemical solute, and the pouch full cell Zn//pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone with cathode loading up to 7.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 delivers an impressively high capacity of 110 mAh g&#8722;1 and excellent rate performance at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. This special work would enrich the design concepts and expand the paradigms of developing water&#8208;based energy storage systems in extreme environments.

         <title>Smart Lanthanide Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Multicolor Luminescence Switching Induced by the Dynamic Adaptive Antenna Effect of Molecular Rotors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic molecular rotors are used to construct smart lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) emitters with adaptive antenna effects for the first time and precisely regulated the energy transfer pathways of Ln&#8208;MOFs to achieve efficient multicolor luminescence switching behavior, upconversion luminescence, multiple smart anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications, purity monitoring of commercial gadolinium salts, smart photoresponsive specific antibiotics and amino acids.








Abstract
In this work, dynamic molecular rotors are used to construct smart lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) emitters with adaptive antenna effects for the first time. The movement or distortion of the molecular rotors can be easily regulated by temperature changes, thereby inducing a dynamically changing antenna effect that can automatically match different lanthanide ions, achieving cyclic multicolor luminescence switching behavior and extremely complex multiple encryption anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology. In addition, by regulating the doping ratios of Gd(III) and Tb(III) with Eu(III) within the Ln&#8208;MOFs, differentiated energy transfer pathways are discovered, and red light emission very close to the BT.2020 color gamut standard is obtained. Gd0.99Eu0.01&#8208;MOF containing only 1% Eu(III) can show bright red luminescence, and in the range of 1&#8211;9% Eu(III) content, the characteristic emission intensity of Eu(III) ions and the content show an excellent linear relationship with a slope k as high as 2299. This can be used to identify the content of Eu(III) ions impurities in gadolinium salts from different manufacturers. Eu/Tb&#8208;MOF showed highly sensitive and visualized smart photoresponse behaviors to specific antibiotics and amino acids, respectively, with detection limits of 3.2/2.7&#160;nM (tetracycline), 1.7/15.5&#160;nM (oxytetracycline), 0.13/0.97&#160;nM (aspartic acid), and 0.26/1.16&#160;nM (glutamic acid).

         <title>Efficient Interfacial Electrical Energy Extraction of a Triboelectric Nanogenerator by the Charge Lock&#8208;Free Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge lock&#8208;free TENG is proposed, which has excellent electrical output performance and durability. This study provides a charge&#8208;lock&#8208;free strategy to effectively release the charge locked on the interface, which realizes efficient electrical energy extraction from sliding frictional interfaces.








Abstract
Sliding&#8208;mode triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) generate electricity by utilizing dynamic friction on the surface of dielectric materials, demonstrating notable potential for low&#8208;frequency mechanical energy harvesting. However, conventional device structures are limited by interface charge locking and low inherent capacitance, which results in a relatively low power density. Herein, the charge&#8208;locking mechanism is explored, and propose an innovative strategy for the dynamic interface shift between two materials with different polarities. When the interfaces overlap in the same materials, the locked interface charges are fully released. Based on this concept, a charge lock&#8208;free TENG (LF&#8208;TENG) is constructed. The output energy of the LF&#8208;TENG is 4.44 times that of the traditional sliding TENG. The rotating LF&#8208;TENG achieves an output charge and a current of 5 &#181;C, 100 &#181;A at 60 rpm, and an average power density of 9 W m&#8722;2 Hz&#8722;1 at 70 M&#937;. Furthermore, the equivalent circuit model is analyzed and it is found that the capacitance change of the LF&#8208;TENG is twice that of traditional devices, which is the main factor for the increase in the output power. This study provides valuable insights into efficient electrical energy extraction from sliding frictional interfaces and paves the way for the development of low&#8208;frequency mechanical energy&#8208;collection technologies.

         <title>Dual Active Site Engineering in Porous NiW Bimetallic Alloys for Enhanced Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous NiW bimetallic alloy with dual active site engineering is reported as an efficient electrocatalyst for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. The alloying of Ni with W enhances H2O dissociation and *OH desorption at the W site, while also facilitating the generation of more available H* intermediates at the Ni2W1 hollow site, thereby improving the hydrogen evolution activity of the porous NiW bimetallic alloy. Notably, a high solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of 16.59% is achieved in a NiW&#8208;incorporated solar&#8208;driven water splitting system.








Abstract
Utilizing dual active sites in electrocatalysts creates a synergistic effect, enabling the independent optimization of H2O dissociation and intermediate adsorption/desorption, which in turn enhances the efficiency of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a porous NiW bimetallic alloy electrocatalyst using a dynamic H2 bubble template (DHBT) strategy is fabricated. This electrocatalyst capitalizes on the synergistic effect of dual active sites, achieving industrial&#8208;level current densities of 500 and 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for HER in 1.0&#160;M KOH, with low overpotentials of 198 and 264&#160;mV, respectively. It also demonstrates excellent stability over a 200&#160;h test. Theoretical studies reveal that alloying Ni with W shifts the d&#8208;band center (&#949;d) of the W 5d orbital downward, which enhances *OH intermediate desorption and promotes H2O adsorption and dissociation at the W site, leading to increased active site availability. Meanwhile, this shift provides more accessible H* intermediates, further enhancing H2 production at the Ni2W1 hollow site. When the porous NiW bimetallic alloy electrocatalyst is implemented in a solar&#8208;driven water splitting system, it achieves a high solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 16.59%. This work underscores the effectiveness of dual active site electrocatalysts for sustainable H2 production.

         <title>Ultrathin Electrolyte Membranes With Reinforced Concrete Structure for Fast&#8208;Charging Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an ultrathin solid electrolyte inspired by reinforced concrete is developed, which integrates a nanostructured ceramic conductor and crosslinked polymer chains to induce a rapid multidimensional lithium&#8208;ion transport network. The synergistic ceramic&#8208;polymer framework uniformly stabilizes the structure, enabling dendrite&#8208;free plating/stripping and excellent interfacial stability. The optimized unique ion migration hopping mechanism facilitates the rapid transport of lithium&#8208;ion within the electrolyte, resulting in both stable and fast charging/discharging performance.








Abstract
Realizing solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) metal batteries with fast charging capability and desirable energy density remains a key challenge for emerging applications for drones and consumer electronics, which require solid electrolytes to maintain good ionic conductivity and mechanical integrity with fast reaction kinetics. Herein, an 8.4&#160;&#181;m ultrathin solid electrolyte membrane is manifested with a reinforced concrete structure and expedited ion hopping migration capability, enabling the solid&#8208;state battery with fast charging capability. The rapid multi&#8208;dimensional Li&#8208;ion transportation network is well&#8208;constructed based on nanosized ceramic conductor aggregation and polymer chain induction, which allows homogenized Li+ distribution on the interface with a continuous uniform and steady plating/stripping process, thereby enhancing interfacial stability and inhibiting dendrite growth. Attributed to its structural superiorities, the assembled solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery maintains an excellent capacity retention rate of 89.2% after 1300 cycles at 10 C. A 1.2 Ah pouch cell is fabricated with a high energy density of 415.2&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and also capable of cycling at 5 C, showing great potential for the practical application of solid&#8208;state batteries for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.

         <title>An Implantable In&#8208;Hydrogel Wireless Supercapacitor&#8208;Activated Neuron System Enables Bidirectional Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An implantable wireless supercapacitor&#8208;activated neuro (W&#8208;SCAN) system consisting of the coil, diode bridge circuit, in&#8208;hydrogel supercapacitor, and stimulation electrodes has been developed for neuronal excitation and inhibition. By applying an adjustable electric field to stimulation electrodes, a spontaneously induced ionic oscillatory stimulation within tissue fluids is generated, which enables electro&#8208;interventional therapy for brain&#8208;related neurological disorders.








Abstract
The bidirectional modulation of cerebral neurons in the brain possesses enhancement and inhibition of neural activity, which is of great interest in the treatment of motor nerve disorders and emotional disorders, and cognitive defects. However, existing approaches usually rely on electrical/electrochemical stimulations, which show low security by implanting metal probes and unidirectional currents with single modulation. Herein, an implantable in&#8208;hydrogel wireless supercapacitor&#8208;activated neuron system consisting of the coil, diode bridge circuit, in&#8208;hydrogel supercapacitor, and stimulation electrodes is fabricated, which provides a bidirectional and adjustable ion diffusion current to safely and effectively excite and inhibit brain neurons. The designed in&#8208;hydrogel supercapacitor exhibits a high storage charge ability of &#8776;90 times larger than the devices without hydrogel encapsulation, owing to the in situ radical addition mechanism. Moreover, the in&#8208;hydrogel electrodes are implanted into the thalamus, amygdala, and prefrontal lobes of the brain to evoke the corresponding changes in potential intensity and frequency through the external chargeable coil and diode bridge circuit, which verifies the potential of the multimodule supercapacitor in amelioration and treatment Parkinson's, severe depression, and Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State Manipulation of Atomic Manganese Center by Phosphide&#8208;Support Interactions for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 29, July 24, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic configuration of Mn single&#8208;atom sites is regulated from low&#8208;spin to high&#8208;spin states by embedding well&#8208;defined molybdenum phosphide nanocrystals nearby (MoP@MnSAC&#8208;NC). The electronic phosphide&#8208;support interaction between MoP and Mn single atoms drives the electronic structure transition in Mn sites from low&#8208;spin to high&#8208;spin states, and this transition expedites both O2 adsorption and OH&#8722; desorption. The MoP@MnSAC&#8208;NC displays an outstanding alkaline oxygen reduction reaction performance.








Abstract
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics are closely related to the electronic structure of active sites. Herein, a single&#8208;atomic Mn catalyst decorated with adjacent MoP nanocrystals (MoP@MnSAC&#8208;NC) is reported. The decoration of MoP drives the electronic structure transition of Mn sites from low&#8208;spin to high&#8208;spin states through an electronic phosphide&#8208;support interaction. The rearranged electron occupation in 3dxz&#8208;yz and 3dz2 orbitals of Mn sites leads to electrons occupying the &#963; orbital in Mn&#9472;*O2, thereby favoring O2 adsorption to initiate the ORR mechanism. In situ characterizations confirm that Mn 3dz2 orbital occupation state can activate molecular O&#8322; and optimize the adsorption of the *OOH intermediate. As a result, the MoP@MnSAC&#8208;NC displays an outstanding alkaline ORR half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2 = 0.894 V), excellent peak power densities (173/83 mW cm&#8722;2 for liquid/solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air batteries, respectively), and long&#8208;term stability (840 h) superior to commercial Pt/C. This work provides profound insights into spintronics&#8208;level engineering, guiding the design of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance ORR catalysts.

         <title>Anchoring Unimolecular Metal Chloride as a Sterically Active Site for Conformal Zinc Electrodeposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An octahedrally coordinated MnCl2N4 structure anchored on hard carbon tailors the electronic environment of single atoms to lower zinc nucleation barriers. Chloride&#8208;assisted Zn adsorption with Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and residual Zn enables reduced overpotential. The resulting Zn&#8211;carbon composite anode delivers enhanced cycling stability and electrochemical performance in full cells.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, the practical application of zinc metal anodes is hindered by the challenge of uncontrollable zinc&#8208;dendrite growth. Herein, axial&#8208;coordinated manganese single atoms, anchored by N, Cl co&#8208;coordinating on self&#8208;standing carbon nanofibers, are designed to guide uniform Zn deposition. The MnCl2N4 octahedral sites act as effective nucleation centers, significantly reducing the Zn adsorption energy of the carbon matrix, achieving a nucleation overpotential of 17&#160;mV. The strong interaction between Zn and MnCl2N4 sites stabilizes the initially adsorbed Zn2+ through John&#8208;Teller distortions, which in turn promotes subsequent zinc adsorption. In symmetric cells, the Mn&#8208;modified carbon nanofiber electrodes exhibit excellent cycling stability with a lifespan of 200 h under a high current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, a full cell coupling a MnO2 cathode with a Mn&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber anode delivers outstanding cycling performance over 1400 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. This work highlights the potential of axially coordinated single&#8208;atom metals in regulating zinc deposition, offering a pathway toward durable and high&#8208;performance ZIBs.

         <title>Non&#8208;Drying Hydrogel Polyelectrolytes via Polymer&#8208;Assisted Cation Solvation&#8208;Confinement Toward H2O for Ultrahigh&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Micro&#8208;Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;assisted cation solvation&#8208;confinement strategy is reported to create non&#8208;drying poly(acrylamide&#8208;hydroxypropyl acrylate) polyelectrolytes, enabling aqueous symmetric micro&#8208;supercapacitors with a record&#8208;breaking 2.5&#160;V voltage and unprecedented areal energy density of 187.9&#160;&#181;Wh&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Conventional hydrogel electrolytes often encounter challenges such as poor water retention and a limited electrochemical window due to inadequate control over water molecules, leading to a low operational voltage and an undesirable low energy density of pure aqueous micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs). Herein, a polymer&#8208;assisted cation solvation&#8208;confinement strategy is presented to enhance both water retention and the electrochemical window of poly(acrylamide&#8208;hydroxypropyl acrylate) (PAM&#8208;HPA) polyelectrolytes. Remarkably, PAM&#8208;HPA polyelectrolytes, without any organic additives, exhibit no water evaporation after over 3.5 months of air exposure at room temperature. Owing to the strong confinement toward H2O in PAM&#8208;HPA polyelectrolyte, activated carbon&#8208;based aqueous symmetric MSCs achieve a record&#8208;breaking voltage of 2.5&#160;V and the highest areal energy density of 187.9&#160;&#181;Wh&#160;cm&#8722;2 among all reported pure aqueous carbon&#8208;based MSCs. Even coupling with low&#8208;voltage MXene&#8208;based microelectrodes, the microdevice still maintains a high voltage exceeding 2&#160;V, a significant areal energy density, and an ultra&#8208;long cycle life. Impressively, after exposing PAM&#8208;HPA polyelectrolytes to an oven at 60&#160;&#176;C for 24 h, the constructed MSCs retain nearly 90% of their capacitance compared to non&#8208;heat&#8208;treated polyelectrolytes. This work introduces a novel approach for developing non&#8208;drying polyelectrolytes with a wide electrochemical window, boosting the development of high&#8208;performance and safe micro&#8208;power sources.

         <title>Organic&#8210;Inorganic Multiscale Crosslinking Assembly for Ultrahigh&#8208;Toughness Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium phosphate oligomers (CPO), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and sodium alginate (SA) molecular chains are employed to achieve multiscale crosslinking assembly, progressing from the ionic&#8208;molecular level to nanolines, nanorods, nanofibers, microfibers, and ultimately to nanocomposite films and bulk. The resulting organic&#8210;inorganic molecular interactions and highly integrated hierarchical ordered structure endow the nanocomposites with exceptional ultrahigh toughness, significantly outperforming conventional counterparts.








Abstract
Strength and toughness have traditionally been regarded as mutually exclusive, but simultaneously achieving both high strength and high toughness in organic&#8210;inorganic nanocomposites remains a significant challenge. Inspired by natural nacre and bone, inorganic ionic oligomers and organic molecular chains are employed to achieve multiscale crosslinking assembly, advancing from the ionic&#8208;molecular level to nanolines, nanorods, nanofibers, microfibers, and ultimately to nanocomposite films and bulk nanocomposite materials. This process results in a highly integrated organic&#8210;inorganic hierarchical ordered structure, imparting exceptional record&#8208;breaking ultrahigh toughness (558.90&#160;&#177;&#160;34.84&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), excellent tensile strength (353.84&#160;&#177;&#160;18.77&#160;MPa), and fracture energy (2.93&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;2) to the nanocomposite films. The resulting bulk nanocomposite exhibits outstanding bending mechanical properties (a maximum bending stress of 207.17&#160;&#177;&#160;12.37&#160;MPa, and a bending energy of 37.62&#160;&#177;&#160;7.33&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 without fracture), exceptional fatigue resistance, and remarkable toughness in extreme environments (e.g., &#8722;196 and 200&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, the nanocomposites can undergo hydrothermal&#8208;induced recycling and regeneration owing to their noncovalent crosslinking nature. Consequently, these nanocomposites exhibit significant potential for applications in high&#8208;performance structural engineering materials. The proposed organic&#8210;inorganic multiscale crosslinking assembly tactic based on inorganic ionic oligomers presents a promising approach for the fabrication of ultrahigh&#8208;toughness nanocomposites.

         <title>A Scalable Fishbone Nanowire Array (FINE) for 3D Quasi&#8208;Intracellular Recording in Intact Brains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fishbone Intracellular Nanowire Electrode (FINE) with ultra&#8208;sharp nanowire tips strategically integrated at slanted angles on the sides of an implantable shank records 3D intracellular potentials from ensembles of neurons in intact brain. FINE's 3D quasi&#8208;intracellular recording holds the potential to unlock detailed investigations of the intricate ionic potential fluctuations of transmembrane potentials that drive behavior and cognition.








Abstract
Intracellular recordings provide unique access to the submillisecond neuronal membrane potential changes, revealing dynamics that orchestrate cellular, local, and large&#8208;scale brain activity. However, technical requirements limit the scalability of intracellular recordings to large populations of neurons, especially within intact brains. To overcome this limitation, a Fishbone Intracellular Nanowire Electrode (FINE) is developed with ultra&#8208;sharp nanowire tips strategically integrated at slanted angles along an implantable shank to record 3D intracellular potentials from ensembles of neurons in intact brain. A novel fabrication process is developed to integrate reverse&#8208;angled platinum silicide (PtSi) nanowires to preserve the structural integrity of FINE during insertion. As&#8208;implanted or sub&#8208;micron retraced FINE spreads the PtSi nanowires away from the shank to establish intimate nanowire&#8208;neuron interfaces that yield quasi&#8208;intracellular potentials. Comparative analyses of nanowire recordings versus adjacent planar recordings on the same shank validate their distinctive quasi&#8208;intracellular recording characteristics. The scalability of FINE is demonstrated to a 3D 24&#8208;shank array with 594 nanowires and 430 planar contacts and successfully identified quasi&#8208;intracellular potentials across 127 distinct nanowires in the intact brain. FINE's 3D quasi&#8208;intracellular recording holds the potential to unlock detailed investigations of the intricate ionic potential fluctuations and patterns of transmembrane potentials that drive behavior and cognition.

Topological Semimetal Nanowires
TaAs2 nanowires in situ encapsulated with a SiO2 shell display giant magnetoresistance, coherent surface transport, Aharonov&#8208;Bohm oscillations, and various signatures of intertwined topological phases: a weak topological insulator with a pair of quantized surface Dirac cones, bulk Weyl cones, and a C2&#8208;protected pair of surface Dirac cones. The frontispiece shows the structure of a core&#8208;shell TaAs2&#8208;SiO2 nanowire with the topological phases as insets, and a micrograph of the real as&#8208;grown nanowires at the background. More details can be found in article number 2418279 by Anand Roy, Ernesto Joselevich, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Halide Perovskite Photocatalysts for Clean Fuel Production and Organic Synthesis: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art overview of halide perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water and halogen acid solutions, CO2 reduction into value&#8208;added chemicals, and organic chemical transformations. Different types of halide perovskite photocatalysts and their relative efficiencies for hydrogen generation and CO2 reduction, design strategies to overcome the instability issues in polar solvents and outstanding challenges are discussed.








Abstract
The need to constrain the use of fossil fuels causing global warming is motivating the development of a variety of photocatalysts for solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel generation and chemical synthesis. In particular, semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysts have been extensively exploited in solar&#8208;driven organic synthesis, carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion into value&#8208;added products, and hydrogen (H2) generation from water (H2O) splitting. Recently, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as an important class of semiconductors for heterogeneous photocatalysis owing to their interesting properties. Despite key issues with long&#8208;term stability and degradation in polar solvents due to their ionic character, there has been significant progress in halide perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts with improving their stability and performance in the gas and liquid phases. This review discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for using halide perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts and photoelectrocatalysis in hydrogen production from water and halogen acid solutions, CO2 reduction into value&#8208;added chemicals, and various organic chemical transformations. The different types of halide perovskites used, design strategies to overcome the instability issues in polar solvents, and the efficiencies achieved are discussed. Furthermore, the outstanding challenges associated with the use of polar electrolytes and how the stability and performance can be improved are discussed.

         <title>Engineering Flow&#8208;Through Hollow Fiber Gas&#8208;Diffusion Electrodes for Unlocking High&#8208;Rate Gas&#8208;Phase Electrochemical Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advancing gas&#8208;phase electrolysis toward industrial&#8208;scale applications requires not only the development of advanced electrocatalysts but also the design of the electrodes to optimize gas&#8208;electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces and facilitate efficient mass transport, thereby reinforcing gas win the electrons to promote reaction kinetics and suppress side reactions. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the design criteria, fabrication methods, and design strategies for emerging flow&#8208;through hollow fiber gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes.








Abstract
Designing advanced electrodes with efficient contact with gas, electrolytes, and catalysts presents significant opportunities to enhance the accessibility of concentrated gas molecules to the catalytic sites while mitigating undesirable side reactions such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which advances the gas&#8208;phase electrochemical reduction toward industrial&#8208;scale applications. Traditional planar electrodes face challenges, including limited gas solubility and restricted mass transport. Although commercial flow&#8208;by gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes can reduce mass transfer resistance by enabling direct diffusion of gas molecules to active sites, the reliance on diffusive gas flow becomes insufficient to meet the rapid consumption demands of gas reactants at high current density. Flow&#8208;through hollow fiber gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes (HFGDEs) or hollow fiber gas penetration electrodes (HFGPEs) provide a promising solution by continuously delivering convective gas flow to active sites, resulting in enhanced mass transport and superior gas accessibility near the catalytic sites. Notably, HFGDEs have demonstrated the ability to achieve current densities exceeding multiple amperes per square centimeter in liquid electrolytes. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the design criteria, fabrication methods, and design strategies for porous metallic HFGDEs. It highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advancements in HFGDEs composed of various metals (e.g., Cu, Ni, Ag, Bi, Ti, and Zn), with a particular focus on their utilization in the electrochemical conversion of CO2. Finally, future research directions are discussed, underscoring the potential of porous metallic HFGDEs as a versatile and scalable electrode architecture for diverse electrochemical applications.

It highlights the innovative membrane design methods and membrane separation performance, along with current challenges and perspectives on the future directions in the field of microporous membranes.








Abstract
Advancements in membrane&#8208;based separation hinge on the design of materials that transcend conventional limitations. Microporous materials, including metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs), macrocycles, and porous organic cages (POCs) offer unprecedented control over pore architecture, chemical functionality, and transport properties, making them promising candidates for next&#8208;generation membrane technologies. The well&#8208;defined and tunable micropores provide a pathway to directly address the permeability&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off inherent in conventional polymer membranes. Here, this review explores the latest advancements in these four representative microporous membranes, emphasizing their breakthroughs in hydrocarbon separation, liquid&#8208;phase molecular sieving, and ion&#8208;selective transport, particularly focusing on their structure&#8208;performance relationships. While their tailored structures enable exceptional performance, practical adoption requires overcoming hurdles in scalability, durability, and compatibility with industrial processes. By offering insights into membrane structure optimization and innovative design strategies, this review provides a roadmap for advancing microporous membranes from laboratory innovation to real&#8208;world implementation, ultimately supporting global sustainability goals through energy&#8208;efficient separation processes.

         <dc:description>
The advantages, applications, challenges, and prospects of current collectors have been comprehensively reviewed, covering various types of metal current collectors, carbonaceous current collectors, conductive polymer current collectors, and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid current collectors. The high&#8208;performance, multi&#8208;structured, and functionalized novel current collectors play a crucial role in advancing batteries with high performance, safety, and intelligence for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.









Abstract
The rapid advancement of rechargeable batteries is hindered by insufficient energy density, limited design flexibility, and safety concerns, which pose significant challenges to their practical application. This review summarizes the crucial yet often overlooked role of current collectors in addressing these challenges. Recent progress across four types of current collectors, deriving from metal foils, carbonaceous substrates, conductive polymers, and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids is systematically analyzed. Metal foils, as the most widely used current collectors, now face challenges including corrosion susceptibility and high volumetric density. Carbonaceous and polymer&#8208;based alternatives offer lightweight design and structural flexibility, but face limitations in conductivity and scalable production. Notably, organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid current collectors, leveraging material engineering and hierarchical design, offer a promising avenue to enhance battery safety and intelligence. Further, potential directions for current collector development, emphasizing 1) enhanced battery performance, 2) multiscale structural adaptability, and 3) integrated multifunctional design, providing prospective insights for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices are outlined.

         <title>Inorganic Dielectric Materials Coupling Micro&#8208;/Nanoarchitectures for State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;Art Biomechanical&#8208;to&#8208;Electrical Energy Conversion Devices</title>

Biomechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion devices are uniquely suited for self&#8208;driven physiological information monitoring and powering human&#8211;computer interaction systems. These devices based on micro&#8208;/nanoarchitectured inorganic dielectric materials (MNIDMs) have shown ultrahigh electromechanical performance and thus great potential for practical deployment. This review constructs a nexus among MNIDMs and all kinds of biomechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion nanogenerators in terms of material development.








Abstract
Biomechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion technology rapidly developed with the emergence of nanogenerators (NGs) in 2006, which proves promising in distributed energy management for the Internet of Things, self&#8208;powered sensing, and human&#8211;computer interaction. Recently, researchers have increasingly integrated inorganic dielectric materials (IDMs) and micro&#8208;/nanoarchitectures into various types of NGs (i.e., triboelectric, piezoelectric, and flexoelectric NGs). This strategy significantly enhances the electrical performance, enabling near&#8208;theoretical energy harvesting capability and precise multiple physiological information detection. However, because micro&#8208;/nanoarchitectured IDMs function differently in each type of NG, numerous studies have focused on a single NG type and lack a unified perspective on their role across all types of biomechanical energy NGs. In this review, from an overall theoretical root of NGs, the performance enhancement mechanisms and effects of designs of IDMs coupling micro&#8208;/nanoarchitectures of various kinds of biomechanical energy NGs are systematically summarized. Next, advanced applications in human energy scavenging and physiological signal sensing are delved into. Finally, challenges and rational guidelines for designing future devices are discussed. This work provides researchers with in&#8208;depth insight into the development of high&#8208;performance personalized high&#8208;entropy power supplies and sensor networks via biomechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion technologies based on IDMs coupling micro&#8208;/nanoarchitectures.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Patterned Delivery of Chemical Signals From 3D&#8208;Printed Picoliter Droplet Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;printed picoliter droplet networks have been fabricated that control gene expression in bacterial populations by releasing chemical signals with precise spatial definition and high temporal resolution. This system of effector release is widely applicable, offering diverse applications in biology and medicine.









Abstract
Synthetic cells, such as giant unilamellar vesicles, can be engineered to detect and release chemical signals to control target cell behavior. However, control over the targeting of cell populations is limited due to poor spatial or temporal resolution and the inability of synthetic cells to deliver patterned signals. Here, 3D&#8208;printed picoliter droplet networks are described that direct gene expression in underlying bacterial populations by patterned release of a chemical signal with temporal control. Shrinkage of the droplet networks prior to use achieves spatial control over gene expression with &#8776;50 &#181;m resolution. Ways to store chemical signals in the droplet networks and to activate release at controlled points in time are also demonstrated. Finally, it is shown that the spatially&#8208;controlled delivery system can regulate competition between bacteria by inducing the patterned expression of toxic bacteriocins. This system provides the groundwork for the use of picoliter droplet networks in fundamental biology and in medicine in applications that require the controlled formation of chemical gradients (i.e., for the purpose of local control of gene expression) within a target group of cells.

         <title>A Microgel&#8211;Hydrogel Hybrid for Functional Compensation and Mechanical Stability in 3D Printed Cell&#8208;Dense Vascularized Liver Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous microgel&#8211;hydrogel hybrid is developed&#160;to construct a multiscale vascular network through embedded bioprinting and guided vascular morphogenesis. With a high density of hepatocytes, a bioengineered thick vascularized liver tissue model achieves a rapid and&#160;promising functional compensation in rats with 85% hepatectomy via direct vascular integration, providing a theraputi paradigm for physiological&#8208;related engineered tissue in animals with acute disease.








Abstract
3D bioprinting of liver tissue with high cell density (HCD) shows great promise for restoring function in cases of acute liver failure, where a substantial number of functional cells are required to perform essential physiological tasks. Direct vascular anastomosis is critical for the successful implantation of these bioprinted vascularized tissues into the host vasculature, allowing for rapid functional compensation and addressing various acute conditions. However, conventional hydrogels used to encapsulate high&#8208;density cells often lack the mechanical properties needed to withstand the shear forces of physiological blood flow, often resulting in implantation failure. In this study, a heterogeneous microgel&#8211;hydrogel hybrid is developed to carry HCD hepatocytes and support the embedded bioprinting of hierarchical vascular structures. By optimizing the ratio of microgel to biomacromolecule, the covalently crosslinked network offers mechanical integrity and enables&#160;direct vascular anastomosis, ensuring efficient nutrient and oxygen exchange. The bioprinted thick, vascularized constructs, containing HCD hepatocytes, are successfully implanted in rats after 85% hepatectomy, leading to swift functional recovery and prolonged survival. This study presents a strategy to enhance regenerative therapy outcomes through advanced bioprinting and vascular integration techniques.

         <dc:description>
Emulating skin&#8208;texturing capabilities of cephalopods, a magnetic shape&#8208;morphing platform (MMP) is developed to enable systems that reversibly modulate their morphology and stiffness. The MMP, consisting of polymer composites embedded with liquid metal droplets and ferromagnetic particles, achieves complex and sophisticated 3D configurations through thermo&#8208;magnetic stimuli under programmed magnetization profiles. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstrations suggest potential applications in 3D displays and soft robotics.








Abstract
Shape&#8208;morphing systems capable of actively achieving diverse three&#8208;dimensional (3D)&#160;configurations are essential for advancements in 3D electronics and soft robotics. However, current shape&#8208;morphing technologies encounter challenges such as iterative shape reconfiguration with high geometrical complexity, mechanical stability, and slow response times. Inspired by the 3D skin texturing abilities of cephalopods, 3D magnetic shape&#8208;morphing systems are introduced, enabling reversible and continuous transformation with a broad range of complex reconfigurable shapes. This is achieved through thermo&#8208;magnetoactive actuation, guided by magnetization profiles created via a 3D magnetic encoding strategy. The system leverages magnetic shape&#8208;morphing platforms (MMPs) built with a composite containing elastomer mixed with low melting point alloy (LMPA) particles comprising ferromagnetic particles. The MMP can produce intricate, robust 3D configurations using multimodal magnetic actuation facilitated by tunable stiffness and magnetoactive reconfigurability. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstrations of 3D visio&#8208;tactile displays and light&#8208;responsive flower robots highlight the potential of bioinspired 3D magnetic shape&#8208;morphing systems, suggesting promising applications in 3D electronics, soft robotics, and visio&#8208;haptic human interfacing.

         <title>Intertwined Topological Phases in TaAs2 Nanowires with Giant Magnetoresistance and Quantum Coherent Surface Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of topological semimetal TaAs2 nanowires in situ encapsulated with a thin SiO2 shell unravel a richness of intertwined topological phases manifested by their magnetotransport features: A near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition, strong expressions of topologically nontrivial surface transport, giant magnetoresistance with direction&#8208;dependent sign reversal, chiral anomaly, and a unique double pattern of Aharonov&#8211;Bohm oscillations.








Abstract
Nanowires (NWs) of topological materials are emerging as an exciting platform to probe and engineer new quantum phenomena that are hard to access in bulk phase. Their quasi&#8208;1D geometry and large surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk ratio unlock new expressions of topology and highlight surface states. TaAs2, a compensated semimetal, is a topologically rich material harboring nodal&#8208;line, weak topological insulator (WTI), C2&#8208;protected topological crystalline insulator, and Zeeman field&#8208;induced Weyl semimetal phases. We report the synthesis of TaAs2 NWs in situ encapsulated in a dielectric SiO2 shell, which enable to probe rich magnetotransport phenomena, including metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition and strong signatures of topologically nontrivial transport at remarkably high temperatures, direction&#8208;dependent giant positive, and negative magnetoresistance, and a double pattern of Aharonov&#8211;Bohm oscillations, demonstrating coherent surface transport consistent with the two Dirac cones of a WTI surface. The SiO2&#8208;encapsulated TaAs2 NWs show room&#8208;temperature conductivity up to 15 times higher than bulk TaAs2. The coexistence and susceptibility of topological phases to external stimuli have potential applications in spintronics and nanoscale quantum technology.

         <title>Highly Efficient Wavelength Red&#8208;Shift Regulating Strategy of Carbon Dots Composites via the Effective Conjugated Domain and the Hydrogen Bonding Synergy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study uses a structurally fixed conjugation molecule as a precursor. It efficiently forms carbon core states of carbon dots. This approach optimizes the control over the conjugated domain size of the carbon core. It also significantly enhances the synthetic efficiency of CDs and the tunability of the optical properties.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials hold significant potential for applications in lighting, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and multi&#8208;level information encryption. However, regulating RTP emission wavelengths, especially shifting into the red spectral region, remains challenging due to the spin&#8208;forbidden transitions of triplet&#8208;state excitons and non&#8208;radiative decay. To address this issue, carbon dots (CDs) with different conjugated domain sizes and phosphorescent potential are designed and synthesized. The CDs are then encapsulated in polyacrylamide (PAM), resulting in multicolored RTP emission ranging from cyan to red (465&#8211;635 nm), with cyan and red phosphorescence exceeding 10 s and 2 s, respectively. The mechanism suggests that the enhanced conjugation effect leads to energy level splitting and strengthened electron coupling, which lowers the energy gap between singlet and triplet excitons, ultimately causing a redshift in the phosphorescent emission wavelength. Meanwhile, the introduction of hydrogen bonding protects the excited state of the electrons, suppresses non&#8208;radiative transitions, and induces RTP in the CDs. These materials are applied in multi&#8208;level information encryption and time&#8208;delayed LED illumination, offering novel strategies for high&#8208;security technologies and advanced optical devices.

         <title>Electrochemical Anodization for the Fabrication of Wafer&#8208;Scale p&#8208;Type Organic Permeable Base Transistors Arrays with MHz Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a wafer&#8208;scale fabrication method for high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type organic permeable base transistors (OPBTs) using electrochemical anodization. The anodized OPBTs achieve high on&#8208;current density, low leakage, MHz&#8208;range operation, and exceptional current gain. With a 96.3% yield in large&#8208;area arrays, these devices enable scalable organic electronics and advanced complementary circuits, demonstrating potential for future display and logic applications.








Abstract
Organic thin&#8208;film transistors (OTFTs) are promising for flexible, low&#8208;cost, and biocompatible electronics. However, conventional planar OTFTs are hindered by the large channel length limiting the transconductance and switching frequencies. Vertical OTFTs, particularly organic permeable&#8208;base transistors (OPBTs), address these challenges with short channel lengths defined by the layer thickness. While n&#8208;type OPBTs have advanced significantly, p&#8208;type OPBTs face challenges such as lower transmission, higher leakage currents, and unreliable fabrication processes. This work introduces a wafer&#8208;scale method for fabricating p&#8208;type OPBTs using electrochemical anodization of the base electrode. The anodization process applied directly atop the organic semiconductor, preserves electrical properties while suppressing base leakage. The resulting anodized OPBTs exhibit high&#8208;performance characteristics, including an on&#8208;current density of 301 mAcm&#8722;2, low leakage current of 4.32 &#215; 10&#8722;9 A, maximum transmission of 99.9999%, and a maximum current gain of 1.89 &#215; 106&#8212;a 100,000&#8208;fold improvement over prior methods. Small signal analysis reveals a cutoff frequency of 1.49 MHz, with a voltage&#8208;normalized cutoff frequency of 0.54 MHzV&#8722;1. Large&#8208;scale arrays show 96.3% fabrication yield and excellent uniformity. Complementary inverters integrating n&#8208; and p&#8208;type OPBTs exhibit superior switching, highlighting the potential of anodized OPBTs for advanced applications in displays and&#160;circuits.

The detailed mechanisms governing the adsorption dynamics between SAMs and ITO delve into and promote homogeneous and stable SAMs film by converting the originally weak bonds anchored through physical interactions into strong bonds, helping PSCs achieve a high power conversion efficiency of 26.37%.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) serve as the hole&#8208;transporting layer (HTL) in perovskite solar cells, yet their instability on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates poses a challenge in practical. The typical SAMs are susceptible to solvents during the perovskite layer deposition process which can result in being washed or dislodged, thereby impeding the formation of a dense SAM. Here, a novel guanidine&#8208;modified polyurethane siloxane elastomers is synthesized to enhance the anchoring capability of SAMs on ITO, which exhibits strong interactions with [2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl] phosphonic acid (MeO&#8208;2PACz) SAMs, to co&#8208;construct a self&#8208;assembled composite structure (SACS). By utilizing this anchor strategy, the weakly bonded MeO&#8208;2PACz adhering to ITO can be converted into a strongly bonded form, thereby curtailing the migration of MeO&#8208;2PACz on the ITO surface during the spin&#8208;coating process, as well as inhibiting shedding that may occur due to solvent washing during the device preparation process. SACS SAMs heighten the charge collection ability of SAMs and suppress interfacial recombination, as well as enhance the growth of the upper perovskite layer. Finally, the SACS&#8208;based SAMs device with a power conversion efficiency of 26.37%. The unencapsulated device based on SACS SAMs can be stored for at least 5000&#160;h with little degradation in performance.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Polymer Monolayer Transistors with Sub&#8208;20 nm Channel Lengths</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing the body thickness scaling and channel length scaling strategies, polymer monolayer transistors with a channel length of 18 nm are demonstrated, which exhibit good operational stability and reliability with the on&#8208;state current density of 2.4 &#215; 10&#8722;4 A mm&#8722;1 and the intrinsic gate delay of 0.79 ps. Moreover, the short channel effect is investigated by varying the dielectric thickness.








Abstract
The scaling strategy is widely used to achieve much improved performance and reduced cost in a single chip with more devices for field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) based on Si and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D materials. However, the downscaling of polymer FETs with high performance has not been achieved. Here both the body thickness scaling and channel length scaling strategies are employed, and demonstrate a 2.4&#8208;nm&#8208;thick polymer monolayer FET, where the shortest channel length (L) of 18&#160;nm is achieved that is comparable to the smallest technology node (&#8776;20&#160;nm) for planar Si FETs. Such short&#8208;channel FETs, with good operational stability and reliability, exhibit only slightly lower field&#8208;effect mobility than the device with micrometer&#8208;long channel, but the on&#8208;state current density reaches 2.4 &#215; 10&#8722;4 A &#181;m&#8722;1. More importantly, a high intrinsic gate delay of 0.79&#160;ps is achieved, while maintaining the on/off current ratio up to 109. Additionally, by increasing the thickness of gate dielectric a remarkable short channel effect is observed, which is in excellent agreement with natural scale length evaluated by the Scale Length Theory.

         <title>In Situ Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation of Peptides Into Droplets Targeting Membraneless Organelles for Enhanced Cancer Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) of peptides in living cells is developed for enhancing cancer chemotherapy through targeting membraneless organelle stress granules. The peptide underwent sulfatase&#8208;induced phase separation into droplets upon sulfate hydrolysis. Decorated with protein ligands, the in situ&#8208;formed droplets coacervated with stress granules, thereby enhancing cancer chemotherapy with sorafenib via activating caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis.








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins and nucleic acids into membraneless organelles (MLOs) plays a critical role in sustaining fundamental physiological processes. However, creating artificial coacervate droplets in living cells from exogenous molecules and modulating the functions of MLOs remain challenging. To address this concern, here we reported enzyme&#8208;induced in situ phase separation of peptides into droplets targeting MLO stress granule (SG) for enhanced cancer chemotherapy. The peptide YSO4F containing two sulfated tyrosine residues undergoes sulfatase&#8208;responsive LLPS into droplets. Cellular studies confirm in situ phase separation of YSO4F selectively in sulfatase&#8208;overexpressing cancer cells. By integrating with appropriate ligands, the in situ&#8208;formed droplets d&#8208;YF&#8208;LSG coacervate with SGs driven by association between the ligand with SG key component protein G3BP2. Mechanistic studies illustrate that the in situ&#8208;formed droplets enhance the cytotoxicity of sorafenib via activating caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, animal experiments confirm that administration of the in situ&#8208;formed droplets with sorafenib significantly inhibits tumor growth in murine models bearing tumors, accompanied by an excellent biosafety profile. The findings in this study&#160;elucidate an innovative approach for in situ formulation of coacervate droplets within tumor cells and a new material for targeting membraneless organelles, thus providing a promising new strategy for disease organelle&#8208;targeted therapy in the future.

         <title>A Facile Strategy for Textile&#8208;Based Highly Sensitive and Water&#8208;Resistant Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new amplified micro&#8208;deformation strategy is proposed to develop a 3D fabric&#8208;based F&#8208;TENG with 3D conductive PPy network and a water&#8208;resistant WPU layer. The device enables highly sensitive and real&#8208;time physiological monitoring, maintains stable performance in both in vivo and skin surface wet conditions, and exhibits excellent antibacterial properties. F&#8208;TENG is expected to achieve the application of integrated diagnosis and treatment.









Abstract
The demand for real&#8208;time physiological monitoring drives innovation in triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). TENGs offer promise for real&#8208;time dynamic monitoring, but they are often complicated to manufacture, have low sensitivity, and are easily disturbed by ambient humidity. Herein, a fabric&#8208;based integrated triboelectric nanogenerator (F&#8208;TENG) is developed, employing waterborne polyurethane (WPU) as both a water&#8208;resistant encapsulation and friction layer, and polypyrrole (PPy) as a friction and conductive layer. This design simplifies the fabrication process while simultaneously improving the device's resistance to environmental factors. The micro&#8208;filament structure enables localized contact&#8208;separation during deformation, initiating the triboelectric effect, while the 3D architecture amplifies local strain, further enhancing sensitivity to weak signals. F&#8208;TENG demonstrates effective voltage output during carotid and respiratory monitoring, highlighting its capability to detect subtle physiological signals. Furthermore, F&#8208;TENG maintains stable performance under humid conditions, retaining 78.78% of its output voltage as relative humidity increased from 20% to 80%. When implants in the moist environment of a rat's leg, F&#8208;TENG exhibits a notable output of 21&#160;V. In addition, the inherent antibacterial properties of F&#8208;TENG further enhance its application potential. These findings position F&#8208;TENG as a robust and versatile platform for dynamic monitoring, wearable electronics, and integrated diagnostic and therapeutic systems.

         <title>Rational Regulation of Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Processed Active Layer via Trimer&#8208;Induced Pre&#8208;Swelling Strategy for Efficient and Robust Thick&#8208;Film Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition technology is combined with a trimer&#8208;induced pre&#8208;swelling (TIP) strategy by incorporating a 3D star&#8208;shaped trimer (BTT&#8208;Out) into the buried D18 donor layer to construct thick&#8208;film OSCs. A best performance of 20.3% (thin&#8208;film) and 18.8% (thick&#8208;film) with upgraded stability is achieved in TIP devices, among one of the highest performances reported of thick&#8208;film OSCs.








Abstract
Thick&#8208;film (&gt;300 nm) organic solar cells (OSCs) have garnered intensifying attention due to their compatibility with commercial roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll printing technology for the large&#8208;scale continuous fabrication process. However, due to the uncontrollable donor/acceptor (D/A) arrangement in thick&#8208;film condition, the restricted exciton splitting and severe carrier traps significantly impede the photovoltaic performance and operability. Herein, combined with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition technology, a twisted 3D star&#8208;shaped trimer (BTT&#8208;Out) is synthesized to develop a trimer&#8208;induced pre&#8208;swelling (TIP) strategy, where the BTT&#8208;Out is incorporated into the buried D18 donor layer to enable the fabrication of thick&#8208;film OSCs. The integrated approach characterizations reveal that the exceptional configuration and spontaneous self&#8208;organization behavior of BTT&#8208;Out trimer could pre&#8208;swell the D18 network to facilitate the acceptor's infiltration and accelerate the formation of D/A interfaces. This enhancement triggers the elevated polarons formation with amplified hole&#8208;transfer kinetics, which is essential for the augmented exciton splitting efficiency. Furthermore, the regulated swelling process can initiate the favorable self&#8208;assembly of L8&#8208;BO acceptors, which would ameliorate carrier transport channels and mitigate carrier traps. As a result, the TIP&#8208;modified thin&#8208;film OSC devices achieve the champion performance of 20.3% (thin&#8208;film) and 18.8% (thick&#8208;film) with upgraded stability, among one of the highest performances reported of thick&#8208;film OSCs.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Stabilization of Noble Metal Single Atoms: Advancing Ammonia Synthesis and Energy Output in Zinc&#8208;Nitrate Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposed an innovative entropy&#8208;driven strategy, demonstrating that the (CePrYZrHf)Ox high&#8208;entropy oxide substrate can accommodate more Ru single atoms than the traditional low&#8208;entropy single oxides such as CeO2, and achieve excellent performance in ammonia electrosynthesis and energy output of zinc&#8208;nitrate batteries.








Abstract
Noble metal single atoms (NMSA) offer exceptional atom utilization and catalytic activity but face challenges like limited stability, low atomic loading, and complex synthesis. This study presents an innovative entropy&#8208;driven strategy to stabilize Ru single atoms (SA) on a (CePrYZrHf)Ox high&#8208;entropy oxide substrate (Ru&#945;%&#8208;HEO). Due to their defect&#8208;rich structure and significant lattice distortion, HEO substrates can accommodate and stabilize more Ru SA than traditional low&#8208;entropy oxides (LEO) like CeO2. This strategy is also effective for achieving high loadings&#160;of other NMSAs, such as Pd and Pt. Ru3%&#8208;HEO, as an electrocatalyst for nitrate reduction, achieves a high ammonia yield (5.79 mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1) and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 91.3%. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Ru3%&#8208;HEO exhibits favorable thermodynamics for nitrate reduction, with a lower energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of first hydrogenation (*NO + H+ + e&#8315; &#8594; *NOH) and stronger intermediates adsorption compared to RuO2, enhancing its catalytic efficiency. As a cathode material in a zinc&#8208;nitrate battery, Ru3%&#8208;HEO demonstrates a high NH3 yield rate (1.11 mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2) and FE value (93.4%). This study provides an efficient strategy to produce stable and high&#8208;loading SA using high&#8208;entropy materials, showcasing their broad applicability in advanced electrocatalysis.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Therapy Through Skeleton&#8208;Homologous Nanoparticles: a Rational Material Design for High&#8208;Efficient and High&#8208;Contrast Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design of skeleton&#8208;homologous nanoparticles for highly efficient and high&#8208;contrast theranostics is reported. The nanoparticles synchronously exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (40&#160;&#181;s) and generate multiple ROS, enabling TRI&#8208;guided PDT, where TRI eliminates the background noise and guides PDT accurately.








Abstract
Although photoluminescence imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) is promising for theranostics, it easily suffers from tissue autofluorescence and PDT photoproducts. To develop time&#8208;resolved imaging (TRI)&#8208;guided PDT with long&#8208;lived emission pathways, like thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), is urgent but challenging, because of the triplet competition between radiative transition and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Herein, skeleton&#8208;homologous nanoparticles are designed and constructed to address this dilemma, thereby achieving in vivo TRI&#8208;guided PDT for the first time. This system is formed with a lipophilic TADF core (as a TRI probe) encapsulated by an amphiphilic photosensitizer shell (as the corona exposed to oxygen for PDT), both of which are derived from the same donor&#8211;acceptor skeleton to minimize phase separation in the single entity, and enable the same long&#8208;wavelength photoexcitation for TRI and PDT. The chloropropylamine group is helpful for endoplasmic reticulum targeting to enhance PDT upon minimizing the ROS transmission path. Synchronously, the TADF core exhibits a delayed fluorescence of 40 &#181;s for a clear TRI. The NPs are eventually applied in vivo with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (45.25) and outstanding PDT effects in a mouse model of deep&#8208;seated kidney cancer. Such a material design is beneficial for developing high&#8208;efficient and high&#8208;contrast theranostic approaches.

         <title>Artificial Cells Capable of NO&#160;Generation with Light Controllable Membraneless Organelles for Melanoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;induced membraneless organelles (MLOs) are formed in artificial cells upon light irradiation. The enrichment of iNOS+ in MLOs increases the production rate of NO 3.2 times of that without MLOs. Artificial cells containing light&#8208;induced MLOs are utilized to treat melanoma efficiently.









Abstract
Membraneless organelles (MLOs) formed by liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation exhibit diverse important biofunctions in cells. The construction of artificial cells containing MLOs with enhanced complexity and functions is still challenging. Here a light&#8208;responsive protein, Cry2olig&#8208;IDRs, is designed and purified to form MLOs upon light (488&#160;nm) irradiation. They are capable of rapidly recruiting positively charged inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS+) from surroundings to regulate its activity for NO production. NO&#8208;artificial cells are constructed by encapsulating Cry2olig&#8208;IDRs and iNOS+ into giant unilamellar vesicles, which are capable of rapid production of NO with high concentration due to the formation of MLOs upon light irradiation. NO&#8208;artificial cells are confirmed to possess the ability for melanoma tumor therapy in mice. These findings provide an efficient method for remotely regulating enzyme activity inside artificial cells, paving the path to build more sophisticated artificial cells for their biomedical applications.

         <title>Shape Memory Networks With Tunable Self&#8208;Stiffening Kinetics Enabled by Polymer Melting&#8208;Recrystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape recovery of traditional shape memory polymers (SMPs) is often accompanied by a monotonic decrease in mechanical stiffness, thereby impacting their practical applications. Herein, a novel strategy is developed to construct the self&#8208;stiffening SMP triggered by single thermal stimulus by harnessing polymer melting&#8208;recrystallization. Conceptual application of self&#8208;stiffening SMP as a shape memory stent with self&#8208;enhancing supporting function is successfully demonstrated.








Abstract
Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are deformable materials capable of recovering from a programmed temporary shape to a permanent shape under specific stimuli.

&lt;p&gt;Shape recovery of traditional shape memory polymers (SMPs) is often accompanied by a monotonic decrease in mechanical stiffness, thereby impacting their practical applications. Herein, a novel strategy is developed to construct the self-stiffening SMP triggered by single thermal stimulus by harnessing polymer melting-recrystallization. Conceptual application of self-stiffening SMP as a shape memory stent with self-enhancing supporting function is successfully demonstrated.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are deformable materials capable of recovering from a programmed temporary shape to a permanent shape under specific stimuli. However, shape recovery of SMPs is often accompanied by the evolution of materials from a stiff to soft state, leading to a significant decrease in strength/modulus and thereby impacting their practical applications. Although some attempts are made to pursue the SMPs with self-stiffening capability after shape recovery, the modulus increase ratio is much limited. Inspired by the recrystallization process of CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; during crab molting, a novel and universal strategy is developed to construct water-free self-stiffening SMPs by using a single thermal stimulus through harnessing the polymer melting-recrystallization. The shape recovery is achieved through the melting of polymer primary crystals, followed by the self-stiffening via polymer recrystallization at the same recovery temperature, in which the modulus increase rate and ratio can be programmed in a wide range.

         <title>Organic Solar Cell with Efficiency of 20.49% Enabled by Solid Additive and Non&#8208;Halogenated Solvent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a feasible solid additive strategy to enhance the performance of organic solar cells. The 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;benzonitrile (NBN)&#8208;treated device owned enhanced molecular crystallinity, more efficient exciton dissociation, suppressed charge recombination, and more favorable morphology. Record efficiency of 20.22% and 20.49% are obtained in binary and ternary devices processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvent. NBN is applicable to multiple efficient systems.








Abstract
Recently, benzene&#8208;based solid additives (BSAs) have emerged as pivotal components in modulating the morphology of the blend film in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, since almost all substituents on BSAs are weak electron&#8208;withdrawing groups and contain halogen atoms, the study of BSAs with non&#8208;halogenated strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups has received little attention. Herein, an additive strategy is proposed, involving the incorporation of non&#8208;halogenated strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the benzene ring. An effective BSA, 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;benzonitrile (NBN), is selected to boost the efficiency of devices. The results demonstrate that the NBN&#8208;treated device exhibits enhanced light absorption, superior charge transport performance, mitigated charge recombination, and more optimal morphology compared to the additive&#8208;free OSC. Consequently, the D18:BTP&#8208;eC9+NBN&#8208;based binary device and D18:L8&#8208;BO:BTP&#8208;eC9+NBN&#8208;based ternary OSC processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvent achieved outstanding efficiencies of 20.22% and 20.49%, respectively. Furthermore, the universality of NBN is also confirmed in different active layer systems. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that the introduction of non&#8208;halogenated strong electron&#8208;absorbing moieties on the benzene ring is a promising approach to design BSAs, which can tune the film morphology and achieve highly efficient devices, and has certain guiding significance for the development of BSAs.

         <title>In Situ Real&#8208;Time Quantitative Characterization of Nanofiltration Membrane Pore Orientation for Enhanced Ion Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel in situ real&#8208;time fluorescence technique enables the quantitative monitoring of pore arrangement in nanofiltration membranes and provides design guidance. The membrane is guided to achieve a Mg2+/Li+ separation factor of 15.55 and a permeate flux of 35.85 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1 through optimization of the membrane structure.








Abstract
Nanofiltration membranes hold great promise for ion separation but often suffer from a trade&#8208;off between selectivity and flux, limiting their use in precise separation processes. A key challenge is achieving precise control over pore orientation, as existing methods fail to provide real&#8208;time, quantitative insights for optimizing membrane structure and performance. To address this, an innovative in situ, real&#8208;time quantitative technique is developed that links pore alignment directly to separation efficiency. Using &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin as a model pore&#8208;forming compound, fluorescent labeling enables continuous monitoring of pore orientation and distribution during membrane fabrication. This method enables the capture of the complete distribution of pore orientation across the entire membrane surface, allowing for precise adjustments in membrane design. This approach provides the real&#8208;time quantification of pore alignment, facilitating the design of NF membranes with enhanced ion selectivity and permeability. The optimized membranes demonstrate exceptional Mg2+/Li+ separation efficiency, with a separation factor of 15.55 and permeance of 35.85 L m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1, representing a significant step forward in high&#8208;performance nanofiltration membranes with broad applications in resource recovery, environmental remediation, and water treatment.

         <title>Ultrapure Graphite from Solid Refining</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;purity graphite serves as a fundamental material for scientific research and technological applications. Here, an effective solid refining process is developed utilizing the nickel (Ni) atomic lattice to eliminate both intrinsic and extrinsic impurities, producing ultrapure graphite. The resultant graphite exhibits the highest elemental, structural, and doping purity among all the known natural and artificial graphite, enabling its excellent transport properties.








Abstract
Graphite has sparked extensive quantum physical discoveries and demonstrated numerous cutting&#8208;edge applications. However, existing graphite typically contains considerable impurities, and effective purification is still lacking. Here, a solid refining purification method is reported for obtaining ultrapure graphite. Through this design, impurities are filtered by the atomic lattice of a solid&#8208;state nickel (Ni). Suitable absorption, diffusion, and precipitation energy barriers are utilized in this method, allowing only carbon (C) atoms to effectively migrate through the Ni lattice to form high&#8208;quality graphite. The obtained ultrapure graphite shows the lowest elemental impurity density (&lt;10 parts per million (ppm), which is one order of magnitude lower than that of the best available graphite), the highest structural purity (&lt;0.2 parts per billion (ppb) of in&#8208;plane structural defect density and &gt;99% Bernal stacking), and the highest doping purity (carrier doping density &lt;2.0 &#215; 1010 cm&#8722;2). Such superior purity of graphite facilitates the all&#8208;integer visible Landau levels and the ultralow quantum transition magnetic field in the fabricated graphene device. This solid refinement technique should inspire the purification of various layered crystals, leading to the discovery of new phenomena and the development of advanced applications.

         <title>Interphasial Chemistry Design for Seamless Lithium Deposition in Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an ultrathin ion&#8208;conducting membrane (ICM) to enhance interfacial stabilization in anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries (AFLMBs). This ICM enhances charge separation, builds stable anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphases (SEI), and inhibits dendritic growth by guiding lithium lateral deposition through ionic nano&#8208;channels. Therefore, this design achieves exceptional Coulombic efficiency (99.82%) in Li||Cu cells and long&#8208;term stability (80.72% capacity retention over 100 cycles) in Li||NCM811 cells, offering a promising path for high&#8208;performance, safe battery systems.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries (AFLMBs) are promising due to ultrahigh energy density, reduced manufacturing costs, and enhanced safety through active lithium elimination. However, their practical implementation remains challenged by unstable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces and the resulting rapid active species depletion. Herein, an ultrathin ion&#8208;conducting membrane (ICM) is designed, featuring uniformly distributed rigid benzenesulfonimide anionic groups and flexible lithiophilic groups containing ether oxygen groups. The constrained benzenesulfonimide anions enable exceptional charge separation and reduced spatial resistance, boosting lithium&#8208;ion mobility, while the integrated lithophilic network directs lateral lithium deposition through ionic nanochannels. This ICM layer effectively promotes the enrichment of anions at the interface and constructs stable anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interphases (SEI). Meanwhile, ICM layers with electron&#8208;insulating and ion&#8208;conducting properties can further prevent side reactions, and suppress dendritic Li growth acting as a natural shield, resulting in seamless lithium deposition. Specifically, the Li||Cu coin cells with ICM achieve 99.82% Coulombic efficiency. The AFLMBs assembled with ICM&#8208;coated copper foil (ICM Cu) and NCM811 deliver an energy density of 495&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with 80.72% capacity retention after 100 cycles. The interphasial chemistry design strategy provides insights into the precise interfacial engineering to realize high&#8208;performance, high&#8208;safety battery systems and facilitates their development for practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;Anode-free lithium metal batteries (AFLMBs) are promising due to ultrahigh energy density, reduced manufacturing costs, and enhanced safety through active lithium elimination. However, their practical implementation remains challenged by unstable electrode-electrolyte interfaces and the resulting rapid active species depletion. Herein, an ultrathin ion-conducting membrane (ICM) is designed, featuring uniformly distributed rigid benzenesulfonimide anionic groups and flexible lithiophilic groups containing ether oxygen groups. The constrained benzenesulfonimide anions enable exceptional charge separation and reduced spatial resistance, boosting lithium-ion mobility, while the integrated lithophilic network directs lateral lithium deposition through ionic nanochannels. This ICM layer effectively promotes the enrichment of anions at the interface and constructs stable anion-derived solid electrolyte interphases (SEI). Meanwhile, ICM layers with electron-insulating and ion-conducting properties can further prevent side reactions, and suppress dendritic Li growth acting as a natural shield, resulting in seamless lithium deposition. Specifically, the Li||Cu coin cells with ICM achieve 99.82% Coulombic efficiency. The AFLMBs assembled with ICM-coated copper foil (ICM Cu) and NCM811 deliver an energy density of 495&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with 80.72% capacity retention after 100 cycles. The interphasial chemistry design strategy provides insights into the precise interfacial engineering to realize high-performance, high-safety battery systems and facilitates their development for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Room&#8208;Temperature Spin Lifetimes in Molecular Semiconductors by Designing Intramolecular Dipole Orientations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A record spin lifetime of 106 &#181;s at room temperature has been observed in reg&#8208;PAzE with a regular dipole orientation. Integrated theoretical and experimental results reveal that the extended spin lifetime arises from variations in the hyperfine interaction strength induced by intramolecular dipole orientations. The findings will provide valuable insights for designing molecular materials with long spin lifetimes.








Abstract
In spintronics, achieving long spin lifetimes, particularly at room temperature (RT), is a key objective for spin transport materials. Molecular semiconductors (MSCs), with their inherently weak spin relaxation mechanisms, have emerged as promising candidates for realizing long RT spin lifetimes. However, effective strategies to suppress spin relaxation through the design of molecular structures in MSCs are still not well understood, and as a result, spin lifetimes remain limited (&#8776; 10&#8208;&#181;s level at RT). In this study, the impact of intramolecular dipole orientations on spin lifetimes in MSCs has been explored for the first time. Both theoretical and experimental results have demonstrated that dipole orientation influences the hyperfine interaction (HFI) effect (a main causation for spin relaxation), and thus, spin lifetime. By adjusting dipole arrangements through molecular design, it is demonstrated that the poly(2,6&#8208;azuleneethynylene) with a regular dipole orientation served to reduce the HFI strength and ultimately extended the spin lifetime to 106 &#181;s in a spintronic device, much higher than that of the random arrangement, setting a new RT record. This work provides new insights into the spin relaxation mechanism and offers a valuable strategy for extending spin lifetimes in MSCs for future RT spintronic applications.

         <title>Double&#8208;side Interfacial Engineering of Hole Transport Layer Enables Efficient and Operationally Stable Colloidal Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;side interfacial engineering of the hole transport layer (HTL) is presented for lead sulfide colloidal quantum dot solar cells. This strategy achieves a record efficiency of 14.28% by using classic P3HT as HTL and exhibits exceptional stability with unencapsulated devices retaining 90% initial efficiency for over 520 hours at maximum power point in ambient air, doubling the previous best 260 hours.








Abstract
Although lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solar cells demonstrate excellent storage stability under ambient conditions, the operational stability is still rather poor for devices based on both organic or inorganic hole transport layer (HTL), seriously limiting their practical applications. In this work, it is find that both the CQD/polymer HTL bottom interface and the polymer HTL/electrode top interface are critical factors limiting device performance and operational stability. By proposing a double&#8208;side interfacial engineering strategy to achieve surface energy matching and energy level grading, a high efficiency of 14.28% is realized using the classic P3HT HTL material, which is the highest reported efficiency for PbS CQD solar cells with organic HTLs. More importantly, the unencapsulated device can maintain 90% of its initial power (T90) after &#8776;520 hours at the maximum power point (MPP) in ambient air, far exceeding the highest value previously reported in the literature (260 hours). This work provides new insights into the development of stable CQD&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Evolving Structured Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic system mimics essential functions of living cells&#8212;migration, division, and reconfiguration&#8212;by encapsulation of active magnetic particles within a nanoparticle&#8212;surfactant membrane. This membrane preserves its shape after deformations, which can be tuned with surfactant concentrations. The resulting biomimetic, reconfigurable, and responsive material paves the way for autonomous synthetic machines.








Abstract
Migration, division, and reconfiguration &#8211; functions essential to living systems &#8211; are driven by active processes. Developing synthetic mimics is an outstanding challenge. Lipid bilayers that bound natural systems are locally deformed by active species, e.g., microtubules, but the resulting non&#8208;equilibrium shapes relax when active species motion ceases, and the shape changes lack immediate control. A fully synthetic system is described, driven by active particles encapsulated by a reconfigurable nanoparticle&#8208;surfactant membrane that undergoes shape fluctuations reminiscent of living cells. These shape changes are preserved after particle activity stops. Surfactant concentration tunes the interfacial tension over three orders of magnitude, making on&#8208;demand shape evolution possible. Directional migration, division, and reconfiguration across multiple scales are possible, leading to a new class of biomimetic, reconfigurable, and responsive materials, paving the way for autonomous synthetic machines.

         <title>Golden Single&#8208;Atom Alloys Selectively Boosting Oxygen Reduction and Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic design and control of golden single&#8208;atom alloys (PdAu1 and PtAu1 SAAs) are achieved by taking full advantage of the intrinsically isolated Bi atoms in fully ordered PdBi and PtBi matrixes, serving as highly selective, active, and stable cathode oxygen reduction and anode methanol oxidation electrocatalysts, respectively, to trigger a direct methanol fuel cell with high power density.








Abstract
Engineering electrocatalysts at a single&#8208;atomic site can enable unprecedented atomic utilization and catalytic activity, yet it remains challenging in multimetallic active centers to simultaneously achieve high catalytic selectivity and stability. Herein, the atomic design and control of golden single&#8208;atom alloys (PdAu1 and PtAu1 SAAs) based on fully ordered PdBi and PtBi matrixes is presented, serving as highly selective, active, and stable cathode and anode electrocatalysts, respectively, to trigger direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). The octahedral PdAu1 SAA exhibits ultrahigh mass&#8208;activity of 5.37 A mgPd + Au&#8722;1 without noticeable decay for 12&#160;0000 cycles toward oxygen reduction. While PdAu1 SAA is inactive for methanol oxidation, PtAu1 SAA exhibits an ultrahigh mass&#8208;activity of 28.59 A mgPt + Au&#8722;1. The selective electrocatalysts drive a practical DMFC with a high&#8208;power density of 155.0&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory calculations reveal the desired regulation of selectivity via reducing the energy barrier for potential&#8208;determining steps (PDS) of *OH to H2O and *HCOO to CO2. This work provides a general strategy to engineer multimetallic alloys at the atomic level, advancing the development of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Co&#8211;Ru Dimer Catalyst Boosts Conversion of Polysulfides toward High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Co&#8722;Ru dimer catalyst synthesized by a confined pyrolysis strategy shows the orbital coupling effect derived from the atomic pair, which could reduce energy barrier of lithium polysulfides conversion and Li2S dissociation, thus accelerating the catalytic kinetics and achieving the enhanced Li&#8722;S battery performance.








Abstract
The sluggish sulfur redox reaction in lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries triggers the development of highly active electrocatalysts for accelerating the polysulfides conversion kinetics. Rational design of catalysts with satisfactory active sites and high atom utilization toward multistep sulfur&#8208;based conversion is much desired but remains challenging. Here, it is shown that the well&#8208;designed Co&#8722;Ru dimer sites confined on carbon matrix could effectively manipulate the sulfur&#8208;involved conversion reactions and thus improve Li&#8722;S batteries performance. The orbital coupling of Co&#8722;Ru dimer induces the orbital regulation for the atomic pair, resulting the favored lithium polysulfides adsorption strength and lowed conversion energy barrier, as confirmed by systematic electrochemical characterizations and theoretical calculation. Besides, the intrinsic catalytic activity of Ru from Co&#8211;Ru moiety also accelerates the Li2S dissociation reaction. Taken together, the as&#8208;constructed Co&#8211;Ru dimer sites render the Li&#8722;S battery with excellent performance, delivering energy density of 468&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 of total assembled pouch cell. This study offers a rational design of catalysts for boosting the catalytic performance in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Phagocytosis&#8208;Activating Nanocomplex Orchestrates Macrophage&#8208;Mediated Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>

A pro&#8208;phagocytic polymer&#8208;based nanocomplex, MNCCD47i&#8208;CALRt, is designed to enhance macrophage&#8208;mediated tumor cell engulfment by modulating both the pro&#8208; and anti&#8208;phagocytic signals. Comprising a PAMAM derivative to induce calreticulin exposure and an RNAi to inhibit CD47 expression, MNCCD47i&#8208;CALRt effectively delays tumor growth and prolongs survival in mice, offering a potent strategy to potentiate macrophage&#8208;mediated cancer immunotherapy.









Abstract
The phagocytosis of macrophages to tumor cells represents an alluring strategy for cancer immunotherapy; however, its effectiveness is largely hindered by the detrimental upregulation of anti&#8208;phagocytic signals and insufficient expression of pro&#8208;phagocytic signals of tumor cells. Here, a pro&#8208;phagocytic polymer&#8208;based nanocomplex is designed to promote the macrophage engulfment of tumor cells through concurrent modulation of both the &#8220;eat me&#8221; and &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signals. The nanocomplex MNCCD47i&#8208;CALRt is formed by complexing a synthetic PAMAM derivative (G4P&#8211;C7A) that is capable of intrinsically inducing the exposure of calreticulin (CALR, a crucial pro&#8208;phagocytic protein) and a small inference RNA that can inhibit the expression of CD47 (a primary anti&#8208;phagocytic protein). MNCCD47i&#8208;CALRt can significantly delay tumor growth and prolong the survival of tumor&#8208;bearing mice with negligible hematopoietic toxicity in multiple murine colorectal cancer models. Furthermore, the pro&#8208;phagocytic capacity of MNCCD47i&#8208;CALRt is validated in the patient&#8208;derived tumor organoid model. Collectively, the phagocytosis&#8208;promoting nanocomplex provides a simple and potent strategy for boosting macrophage&#8208;mediated cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Cation Synergistic Regulation of Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Passivation Layer for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sulfur&#8208;hybridized aniline&#8208;like molecule thiomorpholine (SMOR) forms n = 1 2D perovskite and is preferred to transfer into 1D perovskite instead of high n&#8208;valued 2D perovskite after aging. Due to larger formation energy, chlorine anion is better than iodine anion to accelerate the formation of 1D phase. The PCE of the SMOR&#8208;based 1D/3D perovskite passivated device reaches 25.5% and shows T90 lifetime over 1000 h at 85&#176;C without encapsulation.









Abstract
Mixing 2D and 3D perovskite together is an effective strategy to enhance the stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This strategy has been widely used in many recent works. Typically, 2D layer is formed by introducing 2D spacer onto 3D surfaces through in situ intercalation reaction. However, this intercalation may not stop after the 2D layer is formed. Progressive migration of 2D spacer into 3D bulk leads to increased n&#8208;values of 2D phases and deviation from optimized structural design. The high n&#8208;value 2D perovskite is less stable than the low n&#8208;value 2D perovskite and may be prone to degradation under external stresses. Here, a heteroatom ammonium ligand, thiomorpholine (SMOR) is found, which can effectively passivate the perovskite surface, and form a 1D phase or 2D phase depending on cation to anion ratio and the type of anions. Due to lower formation energy at 1:1 cation to anion ratio, 1D phase can prevent the formation of high&#8208;n&#8208;value 2D phase and show excellent thermal stability. The passivation of SMOR&#8208;based 1D perovskite boosts the device efficiency to 25.6% (certified 24.7%). More importantly, the unpackaged device can maintain &gt;80% of its initial efficiency after stable operation at 85 &#176;C for 1000 h.

         <title>Developing Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Ether&#8208;Based Electrolytes with Trifluorotoluylation Ionic Liquids for High Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes molecular design strategies to develop trifluorotoluylation ILs that enable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ether&#8208;based electrolytes for high&#8208;voltage LMBs. The designed ILs greatly enhance the oxidative stability of the electrolyte and effectively suppress the dissolution of transition metal ions, facilitating the formation of a LiF&#8208;rich interfacial layer on the lithium anode, promoting uniform distribution of Li+ and regular deposition of lithium.








Abstract
The practical application of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ether&#8208;based electrolytes is hindered by lithium dendrite formation and poor oxidation stability, which reduce the cycle life and energy density of the battery. Here, taking advantage of the ionic liquids&#8217; high ionic interactions and structural flexibility in forming an optimized electrode/electrolyte interface, a pyrrolidinium&#8208;based ionic liquids with trifluorotoluylation cationic segment is designed and developed. The oxidation of anions in the electrolytes is induced to form a robust inorganic LiF&#8208;rich interphase at the cathode, thereby effectively achieving high oxidation stability and suppressing the dissolution of transition metal ions. In addition, the LiF interphases derived from the trifluorotoluylation cations increase the modulus of the anode interface and suppress the growth of lithium dendrites. Therefore, the Li&#8208;LiFePO4, Li&#8208;LiCoO2, and Li&#8208;LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cells with the optimized electrolytes demonstrate remarkable performance improvements at high current density (10 C), a wide voltage range of 4.5&#160;V, a high mass loading of 11.1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, and a wide temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;80&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, a 2.66 Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density of exceeding 356&#160;Wh kg&#8210;1 and excellent cyclic stability demonstrates the potential of the strategy in providing a path for the practical application of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ether&#8208;based electrolytes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

Inspired by glow&#8208;worms, a high&#8208;performance multifunctional fluorescent actuator is fabricated by combining ultra&#8208;stable perovskite quantum dots with self&#8208;healing materials. It integrates large deformation, high brightness, high color&#8208;purity, color&#8208;changing function and full&#8208;device self&#8208;healing function together. The full&#8208;device self&#8208;healing function enables reconfigurable on&#8208;demand fluorescent patterns. This actuator opens new paths to soft robots and reconfigurable information encryption.








Abstract
Fluorescent actuators with light&#8208;emitting and shape&#8208;deformation properties are promising in bionics and soft robotics. However, current fluorescent actuators barely balance actuation performances with fluorescence properties, as they exhibit insufficient brightness, poor color&#8208;purity, low&#8208;stability, and few functional&#8208;integrations, limiting their applications in complex scenarios. Herein, inspired by glow&#8208;worms, a multifunctional fluorescent actuator by combining ultra&#8208;stable perovskite quantum dots with polyurethane and graphene oxide composites is reported, which integrates large deformation, high brightness, high color&#8208;purity, color&#8208;changing function and full&#8208;device self&#8208;healing function together. The actuator shows a large bending curvature of 2.48&#160;cm&#8722;1. It exhibits excellent fluorescence performances, such as quantum yields as high as 58.88% and full&#8208;widths at half&#8208;maximum as narrow as 21&#160;nm. The actuation and fluorescence properties show long&#8208;term stability during more than 1100 cycles of near&#8208;infrared irradiation and 12&#160;h of ultraviolet exposure. Moreover, the actuator is integrated with color&#8208;changing and full&#8208;device self&#8208;healing functions, enabling a synergetic color/shape change and reconfigurable on&#8208;demand fluorescent patterns. Then, a smart gripper and a crawling robot with crawling/rollover motions are demonstrated. Finally, a non&#8208;contact dynamic display of reconfigurable encrypted information driven by light is fabricated to mimic light communications of glow&#8208;worms. This actuator demonstrates unprecedented multifunctionality, opening new avenues for fluorescent soft robotics.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Autocatalyzed Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Element Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a simple and controllable gold&#8208;autocatalyzed synthesis method to incorporate multiple metal elements into a single&#8208;phase multi&#8208;element nanoparticle regardless of its immiscibility at room temperature. This reaction occurs among molecules and can be predicted according to frontier molecular orbital theory.








Abstract
The incorporation of multiple metal elements into a nanoparticle without phase separation holds promise for versatile applications, yet a facile synthetic strategy is lacking. Herein, a simple and facile approach is presented, i.e., gold&#8208;autocatalyzed synthesis, in which multiple miscible or immiscible metal elements are incorporated into single&#8208;phase nanoparticles at atmospheric pressure and temperature. This study reveals the autocatalytic reduction behavior of gold and the corresponding growth process of multi&#8208;element alloy nanoparticles. The mechanism of autocatalytic synthetic reactions is revealed on the basis of molecular orbitals. Furthermore, quinary multi&#8208;element nanoparticles were prepared and applied as high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolytes (with overpotentials of 24 and 42&#160;mV to deliver 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively) to demonstrate the application of this strategy. This strategy enables the synthesis of multi&#8208;element materials with high tolerance of synthetic conditions for versatile applications.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Scale Hydration&#8208;Induced Electrical and Mechanical Torsional Energy Harvesting in Heterophilically Designed CNT Yarns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the abundance and vast energy potential of water, its efficient utilization is hindered by single&#8208;mode energy conversion. Herein, heterophilic CNT yarns that allow for simultaneous energy harvesting by means of dual&#8208;scale hydration&#8212;electrical energy harvesting through proton gradients and mechanical torsional harvesting through microchannel absorption are presented.








Abstract
Water holds vast potential for a useful energy source, yet traditional approaches capture only a fraction of it. This study introduces a heterophilically designed carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn with an asymmetric configuration. This yarn is capable of both electrical and mechanical torsional energy harvesting through dual&#8208;scale hydration. Fabricated via half&#8208;electrochemical oxidation, the yarn contains a hydrophilic region enriched with oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups and a hydrophobic pristine CNT region. Molecular&#8208;scale hydration triggers proton release in the hydrophilic region. Consequently, a concentration gradient is established that generates a peak open&#8208;circuit voltage of 106.0&#160;mV and a short&#8208;circuit current of 20.6&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Simultaneously, microscale hydration induces water absorption into inter&#8208;bundle microchannels, resulting in considerable yarn volume expansion. This process leads to hydro&#8208;driven actuation with a torsional stroke of 78.8&#176;&#160;mm&#8722;1 and a maximum rotational speed of 1012 RPM. The presented simultaneous harvesting results in electrical and mechanical power densities of 3.5&#160;mW&#160;m&#8722;2 and 34.3&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1, respectively, during a hydration cycle. By integrating molecular and microscale hydrations, the proposed heterophilic CNT yarns establish an unprecedented platform for simultaneous electrical and mechanical energy harvesting from water, representing a groundbreaking development&#160;for sustainable applications.

         <title>Zwitterionic Brush&#8208;Grafted Interfacial Bio&#8208;Lubricant Evades Complement C3&#8208;Mediated Macrophage Phagocytosis for Osteoarthritis Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrophage&#8208;evading nano&#8208;lubricant is designed to enhance osteoarthritis (OA) treatment by suppressing complement C3 adsorption and subsequent macrophage phagocytosis. Through a zwitterionic PMPC brush layer, this strategy reduces inflammation, preserves joint lubrication, and prevents OA progression. This work highlights the pivotal role of complement C3 in nanoparticle clearance and offers a novel therapeutic approach for OA management.









Abstract
Administering a bio&#8208;lubricant is a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), in particular, if it can both manage symptoms and halt disease progression. However, the clearance of these bio&#8208;lubricants mediated by synovial macrophages leads to reduced therapeutic efficiency and adverse inflammatory responses. Herein, it is shown that this process is predominantly mediated by the specific binding of complement C3 (on nanoparticle) and CD11b (on macrophage). More importantly, through a systematic evaluation of various interface modifications, a macrophage&#8208;evading nanoparticle strategy is proposed, which not only minimizes friction, but also largely suppresses C3 adsorption. It involves employing a zwitterionic poly&#8208;2&#8208;methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (PMPC) brush layer grafted from a crosslinked gelatin core. In vitro studies demonstrate that such a nanoparticle lubricant can evade macrophage phagocytosis and further prevent the pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 polarization and subsequent harmful release of cytokines. In vivo studies show that the designed PMPC brush layer effectively mitigates synovial inflammation, alleviates OA&#8208;associated pain, and protects cartilage from degeneration, thus preventing OA progression. These findings clarify the pivotal role of complement C3&#8208;mediated macrophage recognition in nanoparticles clearance and offer a promising nanoparticle design strategy to restore joint lubrication.

         <title>Solid Polymer Electrolyte with Dual Lewis&#8208;Acid Filler for Ultra&#8208;Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study reveals that Li+ transference number (t+), concentration (C0), and diffusion coefficient (D) critically influence dendrite growth in SPEs. By developing dual&#8208;Lewis&#8208;acid fillers, these parameters are simultaneously enhanced, and constructed a stable inorganic SEI layer. The optimized electrolyte enables high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;metal batteries with NCM811/NCM622/LFP cathodes under demanding operating conditions.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are regarded as promising candidates that could address the safety concerns associated with liquid electrolytes.

&lt;p&gt;Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are regarded as promising candidates that could address the safety concerns associated with liquid electrolytes. Nonetheless, SPEs are still confronting serious lithium dendrite issues, and there is a lack of systematic studies regarding the formation of lithium dendrites within SPEs. Herein, Sand equation is employed to elucidate the determinants of dendrite growth in SPEs, revealing that three factors including the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number, Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion coefficient, and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration are positively correlated with Sand's time (&#964;) which determine the plating/striping behaviors of Li anode.

         <title>Anisotropy&#8208;Dependent Decay of Room Temperature Metastable Skyrmions and a Nascent Double&#8208;q Spin Texture in Co8Zn9Mn3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastable skyrmions in chiral cubic Co8Zn9Mn3 are shown to exhibit decay dynamics influenceable by varying the magnetic anisotropy at room temperature, revealing a new avenue for control of topological magnetism. This study further uncovers a nascent square&#8208;coordinated spin texture that coexists with hexagonal skyrmion lattices, highlighting a rich topological landscape. The findings may enable advanced applications based on dynamic and customizable properties of topological spin textures at room temperature.








Abstract
Chiral cubic Co&#8208;Zn&#8208;Mn magnets exhibit diverse topological spin textures, including room&#8208;temperature skyrmion phases and robust far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium metastable states. Despite recent advances in understanding metastable skyrmions, the interplay between compositional disorder and varying magnetic anisotropy on the stability and decay of metastable textures, particularly near room temperature, remains incompletely understood. In this work, the equilibrium and metastable skyrmion formation in Co8Zn9Mn3 is examined, revealing transformations between distinct metastable spin textures induced by temperature and magnetic field. At room temperature, the decay dynamics of metastable skyrmions exhibits a strong dependence on magnetic anisotropy, showcasing a route towards tailoring relaxation behavior. Furthermore, a nascent double&#8208;q spin texture, characterized by two coexisting magnetic modulation vectors q, is identified as a minority phase alongside the conventional triple&#8208;q hexagonal skyrmion lattice. This double&#8208;q texture can be quenched as a metastable state, suggesting both its topological character, and its role as a potential intermediary of metastable skyrmion decay. These findings provide new insights into the tunability of equilibrium and metastable topological spin textures via chemical composition and magnetic anisotropy, offering strategies for designing materials with customizable and dynamic skyrmion properties for advanced technological&#160;applications.

         <title>Biomimetic Gradual Helical Structure for Enhancing the Strength and Toughness of Fiber&#8208;Reinforced Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving synergistic strengthening and toughening of natural fiber&#8208;reinforced composites remains a significant challenge. Drawing inspiration from multi&#8208;layer helical structures observed in natural organisms, a green, facile, and versatile transitional unit design strategy is designed to construct a gradual helical structure. This approach helps successfully achieve simultaneous strengthening and toughening of natural fiber&#8208;reinforced composites.








Abstract
Multilayered helical arrangements are commonly observed in natural creatures to enhance their strength and toughness. A biomimicry of such an intricate structure has thus far been challenging. Herein, a green, facile, and versatile design strategy is proposed for transitional units. The proposed strategy is applied to develop a gradual helical (GH) structure that can reinforce thermoplastics using bamboo fibers (&#8776;20&#160;cm). A transitional unit is constructed through a combination of rolling and twisting. Following hot pressing, a biomimetic fiber&#8208;reinforced composite with a GH structure is fabricated. The GH structure is made up of 3D helical fibers with a gradual variation in the helical angle from the surface to the core, achieving minimal staggered angles and bridging of different fiber layers. Owing to stress decomposition and transfer as well as the coupling effect of the helical fibers, the GH structure exhibits outstanding tensile and bending strengths. Moreover, owing to the staggered arrangement, bridging, and deformation behavior of the fibers, the GH structure achieves remarkable impact toughness through crack deflection and fiber uncoiling. The GH structure and transitional unit assembly strategy can facilitate the development of advanced composites with superior mechanical properties through an environmentally friendly, simple, and versatile structural design approach.

         <title>Two&#8208;Layer Graphite Anode for Energy and Power Densified LiFePO4 Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work identifies the lithium plating failure mechanism in energy&#8208;type and power&#8208;type single&#8208;layer graphite electrodes. Based on this, a two&#8208;layer graphite anode is designed and scaled up, with energy&#8208;type graphite on the top and power&#8208;type graphite on the bottom. This design inhibits lithium plating and greatly extends the lifespan of energy and power&#8208;densified LFP batteries.








Abstract
Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries are increasingly adopted in grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their superior performance and cost metrics. However, as the desired energy and power are further densified, the lifespan of LiFePO4 batteries is significantly limited, mainly because the lithium plating severely occurs on the graphite anode. Here, first the lithium plating characteristics of both energy&#8208;type and power&#8208;type graphite electrodes in single&#8208;layer design are deciphered. Based on these findings, a suitable two&#8208;layer design with energy&#8208;type graphite on the top layer and power&#8208;type one on the bottom layer, is disclosed. Such configuration effectively inhibits lithium plating throughout the graphite electrode, drastically increasing the lifespan in an energy&#8208; and power&#8208;densified LiFePO4 battery. The assembled pouch cell with an energy density of 161.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, delivers a capacity retention rate of 90.8% after 2000 cycles at 2&#160;C. This work provides valuable insights into the failure mechanism of graphite electrodes, but also innovative strategies of electrode engineering for extending batteries&#8217; performance horizon.

         <title>Processable and Recyclable Covalent Organic Framework Gel Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of COF gels is demonstrated and presents a method for solution&#8208;based reconstruction of COF gel electrolytes, inspired by the operational principle of wedges. By introducing oxygen atoms into the framework, the interaction forces are modulated between the framework layers and introduce active sites for trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). This approach enables the exfoliation of COF layers, allowing them to be effectively dispersed as a nanosheet in an aqueous&#8208;TFA solution. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the dynamic nature of imine bond and controlling the ratio of TFA to water, this manages the competitive interactions between TFA, COF, and water molecules, enabling the reconfiguration of COF materials from nanosheet dispersions back to gels. The obtained gel material demonstrated exceptional cycling stability, and sustaining performance.








Abstract
Covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based electrolytes with abundant ordered channels and accessible interaction sites have shown great potential in energy storage and transformation, although their practical applications are strongly impeded by their inherent insolubility and non&#8208;melt processability. Developing processable COF gel electrolytes and recycling them remains a formidable challenge. In this study, the processing of COF to gels demonstrated through interlayer interaction manipulation and enable solution&#8208;reconstruction of COF gel electrolytes for the first time, inspired by the working principle of wedges. Good solution&#8208;processability of the COF powders in strong acid mediums is achieved by inserting oxygen atoms into its framework to promote the interlayer charge repulsion. This modification enabled the COF readily dispersable as colloidal nanosheets in an aqueous solution of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Starting from here, this is modulated competitive interactions among TFA, COF, and water molecules, to reconfigure COF materials between their gelified and colloidally dispersed states. The reconfigured COF gel maintains their mechanical properties and long cycle life as an electrolyte in the battery (&gt;800&#160;h). This approach realizes solution processing of COF powders and can recycle COF out of gels for repeated use, offering new insights and strategies for their preparation and sustainable recycling.

&lt;p&gt;The preparation of COF gels is demonstrated and presents a method for solution-based reconstruction of COF gel electrolytes, inspired by the operational principle of wedges. By introducing oxygen atoms into the framework, the interaction forces are modulated between the framework layers and introduce active sites for trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). This approach enables the exfoliation of COF layers, allowing them to be effectively dispersed as a nanosheet in an aqueous-TFA solution. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the dynamic nature of imine bond and controlling the ratio of TFA to water, this manages the competitive interactions between TFA, COF, and water molecules, enabling the reconfiguration of COF materials from nanosheet dispersions back to gels. The obtained gel material demonstrated exceptional cycling stability, and sustaining performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic framework (COF)-based electrolytes with abundant ordered channels and accessible interaction sites have shown great potential in energy storage and transformation, although their practical applications are strongly impeded by their inherent insolubility and non-melt processability. Developing processable COF gel electrolytes and recycling them remains a formidable challenge. In this study, the processing of COF to gels demonstrated through interlayer interaction manipulation and enable solution-reconstruction of COF gel electrolytes for the first time, inspired by the working principle of wedges. Good solution-processability of the COF powders in strong acid mediums is achieved by inserting oxygen atoms into its framework to promote the interlayer charge repulsion. This modification enabled the COF readily dispersable as colloidal nanosheets in an aqueous solution of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Starting from here, this is modulated competitive interactions among TFA, COF, and water molecules, to reconfigure COF materials between their gelified and colloidally dispersed states. The reconfigured COF gel maintains their mechanical properties and long cycle life as an electrolyte in the battery (&amp;gt;800&#160;h). This approach realizes solution processing of COF powders and can recycle COF out of gels for repeated use, offering new insights and strategies for their preparation and sustainable recycling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Graphene&#8208;skinned Alumina fiber Fabric for Diverse Electrothermal and Electromagnetic Compatibility and Its Mass Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene&#8208;skinned alumina fiber fabric (GAFF) with widely tunable electrical and electromagnetic properties is developed by graphene chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on each fiber in alumina fiber fabric (AFF). GAFF offers broad tunability in sheet resistance, electrothermal capability, as well as electromagnetic reflectivity and transmissivity. GAFF with widely tunable multifunction promises significant advancements in diverse applications in modern electronics and instrumentation.








Abstract
As electronics and instrumentation grow increasingly complex, multifunctional materials are essential for simplifying designs. Electrothermal and electromagnetic functions are commonly used, typically supplied by separate materials. Integrating them into a single material can reduce components and miniaturize systems. Meanwhile, materials with widely tunable electrical and electromagnetic properties are needed to meet diverse application requirements, from electromagnetic waves transmitting to shielding, and electric heating across a wide temperature range. Graphene&#8208;skinned alumina fiber fabric (GAFF) with widely tunable electrical and electromagnetic properties is developed by graphene chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on each fiber in alumina fiber fabric (AFF). GAFF offers broad tunability in sheet resistance (1&#8211;10&#160;000 &#937;&#183;sq&#8722;1), electrothermal capability (up to &#8776;1400&#160;&#176;C), as well as electromagnetic reflectivity (&#8776;0.003 to &#8776;0.91) and transmissivity (&#8776;0.98 to &#8776;0.0001) by adjusting graphene thickness and AFF pore size. Mass production of GAFFs in various specifications is realized, enabling diverse applications. Heating&#8208;shielding&#8208;integrated device (GAFF&#8208;HS) featuring high electromagnetic reflectivity and low transmissivity, and heating&#8208;transmitting&#8208;compatible device (GAFF&#8208;HT) with low electromagnetic reflectivity and high transmissivity, are both fabricated to target distinct applications: electrothermal anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing for electromagnetic interference shielding systems and radar systems, respectively. GAFF with widely tunable multifunction promises significant advancements in diverse applications in modern electronics and instrumentation.

         <title>Superwetting&#8208;Enabled In Situ Silicification for Artificial Silicified Wood</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superwetting&#8208;enabled in situ silicification strategy is proposed to fabricate artificial silicified wood without high pressure and high temperature. The artificial silicified wood exhibits super flexural strength (&#8776;216.49 MPa) and resistance to termites (98.70% mass retention) and fungi (over 90.64% mass retention), meeting the highest AWPA and ASTM standards. This method offers a promising approach to the conservation of wooden artifacts.








Abstract
Wooden artifacts have attracted comprehensive concern as the witnesses of human civilization; however, their conservation suffers from many difficulties, such as natural degradation and biological invasion. Silicified wood, as a fossil material that has existed for millions of years, provides a valuable clue for the long&#8208;term conservation of wooden materials. In this work, a superwetting&#8208;enabled in situ silicification strategy is reported to silicify wood in a confined way, fabricating artificial silicified wood within 100 h. The superwetting process of the silica sol enables multi&#8208;scale high silica filling throughout the entire wood from the nanoscale to the macroscale. The artificial silicified wood shows a high flexural strength of &#8776;216.49&#160;MPa and super resistance against termites and fungi. The artificial silicified wood retains 98.70% of its mass against termites, and over 90.64% of its mass against fungi, meeting the safest level in the global standards. The finding provides a general silicification approach for wood&#8208;like materials with complex hierarchical structures and a promisingly alternative solution for the conservation of wooden artifacts.

         <title>Rational Design of Highly Stable and Active Single&#8208;Atom Modified S&#8208;MXene as Cathode Catalysts for Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) and Li&#8322;S oxidation process on single&#8208;atom&#8208;modified S&#8208;functionalized MXenes (SA&#8208;S&#8208;MXenes) monolayers are investigated. Five SA adsorption sites are considered: fcc (I), hcp (II), top (III), M substitution by SA (IV), and S substitution by SA (V). Among these, Ni, Cu, and Zn at the IV site exhibit the best electrocatalytic performance, characterized by the lowest Gibbs free energy for the SRR process and the decomposition barrier for Li&#8322;S.








Abstract
The practical application of Li&#8208;S batteries is hindered by the shuttle effect and sluggish sulfur conversion kinetics. To address these challenges, this work proposes an efficient strategy by introducing single atoms (SAs) into sulfur&#8208;functionalized MXenes (S&#8208;MXenes) catalysts and evaluate their potential in Li&#8208;S batteries through first&#8208;principles calculations. Using high&#8208;throughput screening of various SA&#8208;modified S&#8208;MXenes, this work identifies 73 promising candidates that exhibit exceptional thermodynamic and kinetic stability, along with the effective immobilization of polysulfides. Notably, the incorporation of Ni, Cu, or Zn as SAs into S&#8208;MXenes results in a significant Gibbs free energy barrier reduction by 51%&#8211;75%, outperforming graphene&#8208;based catalysts. This reduction arises from SA&#8208;induced surface electron density that influences the adsorption energies of intermediates and thereby disrupts the scaling relations between Li&#8322;S&#8322; and other key intermediates. Further enhancement in catalytic performance is achieved through strain engineering by shifting the d&#8208;band center of metal atoms to higher energy levels, increasing the chemical affinity for intermediates. To elucidate the intrinsic adsorption properties of intermediates, this work develops a machine learning model with high accuracy (R2 = 0.88), which underscores the pivotal roles of SA electronegativity and local coordination environment in determining adsorption strength, offering valuable insights for the rational design of catalysts.

         <title>Biophysical&#8208;Inspired Interpenetrated Fibrillar and Reticular Collagen Scaffold with Vascular Endothelial Cell Membrane Incorporation for Guided In Situ Spleen Tissue Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spleen's complex structure limits its regenerative capacity after injury, significantly impacting patient quality of life. This work develops an inducible scaffold mimicking spleen parenchyma, enhancing in situ regeneration. This scaffold reduces oxidative stress, recruits cells, and promotes tissue integration, while proteomics reveal activation of key metabolic pathways, enhancing splenic function and blood vessel regeneration.








Abstract
The spleen's complex structure and limited regenerative ability hinder its regrowth at the site of injure, affecting patient quality of life and risk severe complications. The spleen's stroma primarily consists of reticular and fibrillar collagen, supporting its microvascular network. Inspired by such biophysical environment, this work develops an inducible scaffold featuring an interpenetrating network structure of fibrous and reticular collagen, which is loaded with vascular endothelial cell membranes to facilitate in situ regeneration. The regenerated parenchyma includes red pulp, white pulp, and a vascular system. The scaffold effectively reduces oxidative stress at the injury site, recruits cells to degrade the scaffold, and promotes tissue integration, thereby accelerating spleen regeneration. Additionally, the regenerated tissue compensates for the spleen's functions, enhancing its ability to clear abnormal red blood cells and platelets. Proteomics and RNA sequencing analyses reveal that the scaffold induced the upregulation of key pathways, including the Wnt signalling pathway, Statin pathway, and amino acid metabolism pathway. This activation mobilizes splenic cells metabolism, enhances immune cell activity, and facilitates the remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Moreover, the incorporated cell membrane components promote splenic blood vessels regeneration by upregulating the neural crest cell differentiation pathway within the tissue.

         <title>A Microphase Separation&#8208;Driven Supramolecular Tissue Adhesive with Instantaneous Dry/Wet Adhesion, Alcohol&#8208;Triggered Debonding, and Antibacterial Hemostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microphase separation&#8208;driven supramolecular tissue adhesive based on guanidinium&#8208;functionalized polydimethylsiloxane exhibits instantaneous adhesion in both dry and wet environments. In the meantime, this material demonstrates the capacity for antibacterial hemostasis upon application to biological tissues and can be readily removed from tissue surfaces through wet wiping with medical&#8208;grade alcohol.








Abstract
Tissue adhesives are promising materials for expeditious hemorrhage control, while it remains a grand challenge to engineer a superior formulation with instantaneous adhesion, on&#8208;demand debonding, and the integration of multiple desirable properties such as antibacterial and hemostatic capabilities. Herein, a multifunctional supramolecular tissue adhesive based on guanidinium&#8208;modified polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is introduced, driven by a reversible microphase separation mechanism. By optimizing the content of guanidinium ions, precise control over cohesive strength, adhesion, and wettability is achieved, resulting in strong instantaneous adhesion under both dry and wet conditions. Notably, the supramolecular nature of the adhesive allows for convenient on&#8208;demand removal using medical&#8208;grade alcohol, offering a critical advantage for easy debonding. Additionally, the adhesive exhibits remarkable antimicrobial properties while maintaining excellent biocompatibility and hemocompatibility. Its underwater injectability supports minimally invasive surgical procedures. Furthermore, the adhesive's ability to incorporate solid particles enhances its versatility, particularly for the development of drug&#8208;embedded bioadhesives. This work addresses key challenges in tissue adhesive design via a microphase separation&#8208;driven working principle, thereby opening promising new avenues for the development of advanced bioadhesives with tailored properties and enhanced surgical and wound care outcomes.

         <title>Lowering Toxicity of Solvent in Organic Solar Cells Manufacturing for 20% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acute toxicological properties of the solvents commonly used in the organic photovoltaic (OPV) are evaluated. The preparation technology of devices and micro&#8208;modules by developing solvent processing methods are committed to optimizing with low ecological impact. Finally, an optimized solvent formulation of TCE:OXY blend is arrived to yield a module efficiency of 17.6% with area of 18.4 cm2.








Abstract
Thin film organic photovoltaics (OPVs) aim to harness solar energy environmentally friendly, highly efficient, and cost&#8208;effective means, thereby offering a sustainable solution for energy production and ecological preservation. Efforts are undertook to optimize engineering preparation technology for OPV devices and mini&#8208;modules, through the development of low&#8208;ecological&#8208;impact solvent processing method. A newly developed solvent engineering strategy employing environmentally benign o&#8208;xylene (OXY) with synergistic dual additives (DIM and DIB) achieved an optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.0% (JSC of 26.6 mA cm&#8722;2, VOC of 0.935 V, FF of 80.3%) alongside exceptional stability metrics (82%&#8211;1500h). The mini&#8208;module processed with optimized TCE:OXY (1:3 v/v) solvent demonstrated scalable performance reaching 17.6% (18.4 cm2), representing the highest performance achieved in the development safe solvent based OPVs. Suitable microscale patterns contributed to a broader range of receiving angles, enabling more flexible installation geometries for building&#8208;integrated applications.

         <title>Photoinduced, Swift, and Reversible Spatiotemporal Programming of Double Dynamically Bonded Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating anthracene&#8208;based dynamic bonds into a supramolecular liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) enables swift and reversible alternation of its local nematic&#8208;isotropic transition temperature and global actuation strain. The morphing behavior of the LCE actuator can be spatiotemporally programmed by varying the local UV exposure. This empowers precise motion control to accomplish intricate tasks, such as the aligning, threading, and locking mechanism.








Abstract
Spatiotemporal programming of the morphing behavior of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) by local tailoring of the nematic to isotropic temperature (TNI) can empower the precise design of their versatile motions. The current approach and materials design to achieve this process are either slow or irreversible, limiting its efficiency and efficacy. Here, a dynamic bond of anthracene and ethyl acrylate (An&#8208;A) is introduced to enable photoinduced topology transformation to alter the TNI of the LCE, into a hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular LCE network, where the actuation modes can already be reconfigured upon annealing. Experiments and molecular dynamics simulation demonstrate that the An&#8208;A bonds undergo reversible cycloaddition with 365&#160;nm UV exposure for as short as 10&#160;min, and depolymerization with 254&#160;nm UV. The resulting topological transformations of the network give rise to changes in the TNI, actuation strain, and mechanical properties, which can be programed and erased by light. With that, a spatiotemporally reprogrammable LCE actuator: a single LCE that morphs into different shapes, especially those that are far more achievable when the trajectory can be designed by sequential actuation, is developed. This system offers a promising strategy for swift and reversible morphing behavior with custom&#8208;designed trajectory in future smart soft robots.

         <title>Efficient Kinetic Separation of Carbon Dioxide from Acetylene Using Mordenites Featuring Modified 1D Channels with Excellent Selectivity and Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the precise recognition of gas molecules with similar kinetic sizes while maintaining high gas diffusivity through the modification of the 1D channels of micrometer&#8208;sized mordenite. The weak acid salt&#8208;modified mordenite NaAlO2@MOR(0.5) exhibits remarkable carbon dioxide/acetylene kinetic selectivity (534.3), and high carbon dioxide capacity and diffusion constant.








Abstract
The design of physical adsorbents for a precise recognition of gas molecules with similar kinetic sizes is of importance as adsorptive separation can serve as an alternative to energy&#8208;intensive distillation processes. However, it is challenging to balance the selectivity, capacity, and adsorption kinetics of the adsorbents. Herein, an efficient kinetic separation of acetylene and carbon dioxide is reported, which have nearly identical kinetic sizes, achieved through modification of the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) channels of a micrometer&#8208;sized mordenite. Under ambient conditions, the weak acid salt&#8208;modified mordenite denoted as NaAlO2@MOR(0.5), exhibits a remarkable kinetic separation selectivity of 534.3 while retaining an excellent diffusivity for CO2. Compared to other adsorbent materials, its dynamic column performance for carbon dioxide significantly exceeds those of molecular sieve materials. In terms of separation selectivity, it is superior to thermodynamic separation adsorbents. The high efficiency of NaAlO2@MOR(0.5) in CO2/C2H2 kinetic separation is validated by column breakthrough experiments. Furthermore, NaAlO2@MOR(0.5) has a low cost and high thermal stability. This study can guide the design of adsorbents that balance selectivity, capacity, and gas diffusivity, to provide a highly efficient kinetic separation of gas molecules with similar kinetic diameters.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, by synergistically modulating carrier dynamics, both the separation efficiency and the quantity of electrons and holes transferred to ferroelectrics are optimized in parallel. As a result, the highest apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 5.78% at 365 nm for overall water splitting among ferroelectric materials is achieved and reported to date.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials, known for their non&#8208;inversion symmetry, show promise as photocatalysts due to their unique asymmetric charge separation, which separates hydrogen and oxygen evolution sites. However, the strong depolarized field induces a relaxed surface structure, which in turn directly leads to slow hole charge transfer dynamics, hindering their efficiency in water splitting. In this study, a fundamental breakthrough in dramatically enhancing the overall water&#8208;splitting activity is presented, through the synergistically regulating of the surface behaviors of photogenerated carriers,&#160;resulting in nearly perfect parallel dynamics and balanced amounts. By depositing atomic layers of TiO2 onto the surface of PbTiO3, surface vacancies are effectively passivated, significantly prolonging the hole lifetime from 10&#8722;6 to 10&#8722;3 s. Spatially resolved transient photovoltage spectroscopy showed that improved hole dynamics led to a 180&#176; phase shift between photogenerated electrons and holes, indicating nearly identical extraction dynamics. Notably, hole and electron concentrations increased to equivalent levels. This leads to a nearly 578&#8208;fold increment in the apparent quantum yield, resulting in significantly increased overall water&#8208;splitting rates, with a quantum yield of 5.78% at 365&#160;nm. The strategy is also effective with Al2O3 and SiO2, demonstrating its versatility across varied materials, providing&#160;a valuable method for creating high&#8208;performance ferroelectric photocatalysts.

         <title>Active Hydrogen Enrichment on Cu6Sn5&#8208;type High Entropy Intermetallics for Efficient Nitrate Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous (Cu0.25Ni0.25Fe0.25Co0.25)6Sn5 high entropy intermetallic compound achieves excellent performance for ammonia electrosynthesis, allowing electrocatalytic nitrate reduction in a wide concentration range, excellent stability, and direct production of ammonium product. The high intrinsic catalytic activity is attributed to improved H* generation, inhibited hydrogen evolution reaction, and low reaction free energy of the hydrogenation process.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) provides a feasible strategy for green ammonia production and the treatment of nitrate pollution in wastewater. The generation of active hydrogen (H*) plays an important role in improving the selectivity, yield rate, and Faradaic efficiency of ammonia products. Here, structurally ordered nanoporous Cu6Sn5&#8208;type high entropy intermetallics (HEI) with extremely superior performance toward NO3RR is demonstrated. The optimal nanoporous (Cu0.25Ni0.25Fe0.25Co0.25)6Sn5 HEI delivers a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 97.09 &#177; 1.15% and excellent stability of 120 h at the industrial level current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2, accordingly directly converting NO3&#8210; to high&#8208;purity (NH4)2HPO4 with near&#8208;unity efficiency. Theoretical calculations combined with experimental results reveal that the ordered multi&#8208;site nature of the nanoporous HEI can simultaneously promote water dissociation, reduce the reaction&#8208;free energy of the hydrogenation process, and suppress hydrogen evolution. This work provides the design of the precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free HEI for sustainable NH3 synthesis and paves insights into the H* enrichment mechanism.

         <title>A Durable and Highly Active Oxygen Electrode for Solid Oxide Cells: New Insight into Segregation Suppression of Layered Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High entropy oxides (HEOs) have attracted significant attention in the field of Solid oxide cells (SOCs) owing to their outstanding advantages. However, there is a lack of studies on mechanism through which entropy increases in HEO oxygen electrodes affects segregation suppression. Based on PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (PBSCF), a novel (La0.25Pr0.25Nd0.25Sm0.25)Ba0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (LPNSBSCF) oxygen electrode is designed and fabricated in this work to claim the mechanism of entropy&#8208;enhanced in layered perovskite.








Abstract
One challenge to realize the commercialization of solid oxide cell technology is the instability and poor catalytic activity of the oxygen electrode during stack operation caused by Cr&#8208;containing alloy interconnect. Particularly well&#8208;known Sr/Ba&#8208;containing perovskite oxides can easily segregate Sr/Ba to the surface, reacting with vaporized Cr and causing Cr poisoning. To address this challenge, this work designs an entropy&#8208;driven layered structural strategy to suppress the surface segregation of cations and realize substantial enhancement of catalysis activity and Cr tolerance. The investigations suggest that the planar strain generated by entropy increase in the rare earth layer plays a pivotal role in suppressing alkaline earth segregation. Consequently, the half&#8208;cells with (La0.25Pr0.25Nd0.25Sm0.25)Ba0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (LPNSBSCF) oxygen electrode exhibit significantly improved stability in various operation conditions with Cr containment. Furthermore, LPNSBSCF shows the high power density of 2.12 W cm&#8722;2 at 800&#160;&#176;C and 1.41 W cm&#8722;2 at 650&#160;&#176;C in the single cells of oxygen ion and proton type, respectively. This paper provides new insights into segregation suppression in layered perovskite and offers theoretical guidance for the rational design of oxygen electrodes to achieve high Cr&#8208;tolerance and catalytic activity.

         <title>In Situ Formation of a Bi/Mg&#8208;Based Hybrid Interphase for Highly Reversible Magnesium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bi/Mg&#8208;based hybrid interphase protective layer is formed on the Mg foil via an in situ quasi&#8208;solid&#8722;solid redox reaction. Magnesiophilic components enhance Mg ion transfer, desolvation, and nucleation kinetics, whereas magnesiophobic species confer passivation&#8208;free and corrosion&#8208;resistant properties. Consequently, the smooth anode&#8208;electrolyte interphase facilitates homogeneous charge/ion distribution, promoting a highly reversible Mg plating/stripping process.








Abstract
Magnesium (Mg) is a promising anode material for magnesium metal batteries (MMBs) owing to its high specific capacity, excellent safety profile, and abundant availability. However, pristine Mg anodes suffer from uneven plating/stripping and surface passivation/corrosion, limiting the safety and cycling stability of MMBs. This study introduces a Bi/Mg&#8208;based hybrid interphase protective layer on Mg foil (denoted Bi&#8208;Mg@Mg) through an in situ quasi&#8208;solid&#8211;solid redox reaction by immersing the foil in a bismuth oxybromide suspension. The resulting interphase layer consists of magnesiophilic components (Bi metal and Bi2Mg3 alloy) and magnesiophobic species (MgO, MgBr2, and BiBr3). These components synergistically enhance the desolvation, nucleation, and deposition kinetics, mitigate side reactions, and promote uniform electric field and ion flux distributions. As a result, the Bi&#8208;Mg@Mg electrodes exhibit superior Mg plating/stripping reversibility, maintaining stable performance for over 4100&#160;h in the all&#8208;phenyl complex electrolyte and 2900&#160;h in the Mg(TFSI)2 electrolyte, significantly outperforming pristine Mg electrodes. Furthermore, full cells paired with Mo6S8 and S cathodes demonstrate excellent capacities, rate capabilities, and long lifespans, highlighting the exceptional electrochemical performance of the Bi&#8208;Mg@Mg anode. This study offers a promising strategy for developing highly reversible Mg anodes, paving the way for practical long&#8208;cycle MMBs.

         <title>Bioinspired O2&#8208;Evolution Catalysts with Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer Pathway for Portable Oxygen Generation</title>

Bioinspired Ru&#8208;doped metal hydroxide (Ru&#8208;Co(OH)x) is developed as an O2&#8208;evolution catalyst with proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) pathway for efficient and low&#8208;energy O2 generation. The lattice H species in Ru&#8208;Co(OH)x optimizes Ru&#8208;oxygen intermediates interactions, thereby enhancing O2 production performance. This technique ensures an uninterrupted O2 supply during emergencies and in regions with limited O2 availability, providing significant societal benefits.









Abstract
Producing high&#8208;purity oxygen (O2) has a wide range of applications across diverse sectors, such as medicine, tunnel construction, the chemical industry, and fermentation. However, current O2 production methods are burdened by complexity, heavy equipment, high energy consumption, and limited adaptability to harsh environments. Here, to address this grand challenge, the de novo design of Ru&#8208;doped metal hydroxide is proposed to serve as bioinspired O2&#8208;evolution catalysts with proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) pathway for low&#8208;energy, environmentally friendly, cost&#8208;effective, and portable O2 generation. The comprehensive studies confirm that the lattice H species in Ru&#8208;Co(OH)x&#8208;based O2&#8208;evolution catalyst can trigger a PCET pathway to optimize Ru&#8208;oxygen intermediates interactions, thus ultimately reducing reaction energy barriers and improving the activities and durabilities. Consequently, the prepared Ru&#8208;Co(OH)x&#8208;loaded membrane catalysts exhibit rapid and long&#8208;term stable O2 production capabilities. Furthermore, the proposed material design strategy of lattice H&#8208;species shows remarkable universality and adaptability to broad Ru&#8208;doped metal hydroxides. This efficient, portable, and cost&#8208;effective O2 generation technique is suggested to ensure an uninterrupted O2 supply during emergencies and in regions with limited O2 availability or air pollution, thus offering significant societal benefits in broad applications.

         <title>Precision Synthesis of a Single Chain Polymorph of a 2D Solid within Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise synthesis of 1D materials has enabled the discovery of physical properties only accessible in length scales close to the atomic scale. Herein, it is demonstrated that encapsulation within single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes with matching diameters leads to a stoichiometric quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals polymorph of a 2D pnictogen chalcogenide, Sb2Te3, with a blue&#8208;shifted band gap in the short&#8208;wave infrared regime.








Abstract
The discovery and synthesis of atomically precise low&#8208;dimensional inorganic materials have led to numerous unusual structural motifs and nascent physical properties. However, access to low&#8208;dimensional van der Waals (vdW)&#8208;bound analogs of bulk crystals is often limited by chemical considerations arising from structural factors like atomic radii, bonding or coordination, and electronegativity. Using single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as confinement templates, we demonstrate the synthesis of a short&#8208;wave infrared&#8208;absorbing quasi&#8208;1D (q&#8208;1D) chain polymorph of Sb2Te3 ([Sb4Te6]n) that is structurally and electronically distinct from its 2D counterpart. It is found that the q&#8208;1D chain polymorph has both three&#8208; and five&#8208;coordinate Sb atoms covalently bonded to Te and is thermodynamically stabilized by the electrostatic interaction between the encapsulated chain and the model SWCNT. The complementary experimental and computational results demonstrate the synthetic advantage of vdW nanotube confinement in the discovery of low&#8208;dimensional polytypes with drastically altered physical properties and potential applications in energy conversion processes.

         <title>Mechanophysical Synthesis of Core/Shell Hybrid Supraparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collision&#8208;driven mechanophysical synthesis enables rapid, chemical&#8208;free assembly of core/shell hybrid supraparticles (HSPs) by embedding inorganic nanomaterials onto polymer microparticles. Governed by collision and interfacial energies, this scalable, solvent&#8208;free method accommodates diverse material combinations, allowing multifunctional HSPs for pollutant removal with easy recovery and reuse&#8211;offering a sustainable alternative to conventional surface modification techniques, which often require excessive chemicals and multi&#8208;step processes.








Abstract
Surface modification of polymer microparticles (MPs) is often essential to impart functionalities beyond their inherent properties. However, decorating these surfaces typically requires complex, multi&#8208;step wet chemistry processes to direct assembly and bonding between surfaces, which are not only challenging to control and scale up but also pose significant environmental concerns. Inspired by asteroid impact events, assembly of core/shell hybrid supraparticles (HSPs) is demonstrated via collision&#8208;driven, one&#8208;step dry mixing of inorganic nanoparticles (NPs)&#160;and polymer MPs with a significant contrast in elastic moduli&#8212; a process termed &#8220;mechanophysical synthesis.&#8221; Through the interplay of interfacial energy and collision energy, NPs are stably embedded onto the MP surface. The degree of surface coverage depends on mixing velocity and duration, aligning with results from particle collision simulations. HSPs can be created from a diverse combination of MPs and NPs, regardless of their shapes or chemistry. Furthermore, different types of functional NPs&#8212;such as magnetic, photocatalytic, and ion&#8208;adsorptive&#8212;can be simultaneously introduced onto the MPs. The resulting HSPs can not only remove toxic water pollutants, but also be easily recovered and reused. The mechanophysical synthesis approach opens a new direction for sustainable and versatile self&#8208;assembly of heterogeneous MPs, minimizing the use of excessive chemicals and solvents.

         <title>Decoding Directional Control in Metal&#8208;Assisted Chemical Etching via Catalyst Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;assisted chemical etching (MaCE) enables silicon nanostructure fabrication but suffers from isotropic undercutting. This study highlights the critical role of catalyst morphology in etching directionality. High&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio catalysts induce lateral etching, while thermal treatment at 450&#160;&#176;C stabilizes catalyst geometry, promoting vertical etching. These findings offer a strategy for precise silicon nanostructure control, advancing semiconductor and nanofabrication applications.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;assisted chemical etching (MaCE) has emerged as a promising technique for fabricating silicon nanostructures, yet the presence of anomalous isotropic etching poses significant challenges for precise dimensional control. Here, it is demonstrated that catalyst morphology, particularly its aspect ratio, plays a crucial role in determining etching directionality. Through systematic investigation of the initial stages of MaCE, it is revealed that significant undercutting occurs within seconds of etching initiation, persisting across all solution compositions. This phenomenon is quantitatively analyzed using the Degree of Undercutting (DoU) and Degree of Anisotropy (DoA) metrics, establishing that conventional solution chemistry control alone cannot suppress lateral etching. These findings reveal that high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio dendrite catalysts, formed at elevated AgNO3 concentrations, undergo physical separation during etching, leading to residual catalysts that promote localized isotropic etching. To address this, a thermal treatment approach is developed that effectively transforms these problematic structures into stable, low&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio catalysts. A critical transition at 450&#160;&#176;C, where enhanced silver atom mobility coincides with surface defect formation, enables nearly perfect vertical etching. This work not only provides fundamental insights into the relationship between catalyst geometry and etching behavior but also presents a practical solution for achieving precise control over silicon nanostructure fabrication.

         <title>Enabling Targeted Zinc Growth via Interface Regulation Toward Binder Free and High Areal Capacity Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D self&#8208;assembled SiO2@SiO2/C nanorods crosslinked nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon fiber (SSA/NCF) networks are prepared by electrostatic spinning to promote the preferential deposition of (101) crystalline surfaces to obtain dense and flat zinc anodes. Uniform zinc ion transport and enhanced ion transfer kinetics are also achieved toward flexible, binder&#8208;free, and high&#8208;performance APLs.








Abstract
Owing to the low redox potential, abundant nature, and widespread availability, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have attracted extensive investigation. Nevertheless, the commercialization of the batteries is severely hindered by negative side reactions, catastrophic dendrite growth, and uneven Zn2+ diffusion. Here, 3D self&#8208;assembled necklace&#8208;like nanofibers are developed by a simple electrospinning technique, in which SiO2@SiO2/C nanospheres are sequentially aligned on interconnected nitrogen/carbon networks (SSA/NCF) to achieve binder&#8208;free, high&#8208;performance, and dendrite&#8208;free growth of APLs. The design structure combines excellent interfacial ion transfer, corrosion resistance, and unique planar deposition regulation. The protective layer of SSA/NCF paper exhibits a high affinity for Zn2+, thereby reducing the nucleation barrier of Zn2+ and ensuring a more homogeneous Zn deposit. More importantly, this multifunctional interfacial layer induces preferential crystalline (101) oriented electroplating growth and promotes oriented dense Zn deposition. Consequently, the SSA/NCF paper layer endowed the cell with remarkable cycling stability, achieving an extended cycle life of 3000&#160;h at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/1.25&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. This study offers novel insights into the development of high&#8208;performance zinc anodes.

         <title>In Situ Engineering of Grain Boundary Phase toward Superior Thermoelectric Performance in Mg3(Sb,Bi)2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of grain boundary phases with low resistivity can effectively enhance the thermoelectric performance of Mg3(Sb,Bi)2. This work proposes an in situ engineering approach inducing TiO2&#8208;n to reduce interfacial barriers, which is attributed to the formation of Ti3Sb. These secondary phases significantly enhance the power factor while simultaneously reducing the lattice thermal conductivity, thereby resulting in a superior figure of merit (zT) and conversion efficiency.








Abstract
As a promising thermoelectric material for electronic cooling and power generation, Mg3(Sb,Bi)2 has received extensive attention. Despite efforts to enhance its performance through composite modulation, challenges such as secondary phase refinement, dispersion, and interfacial mismatch, particularly at grain boundaries, remain critical. In this work, by incorporating TiO2&#8208;n into the Mg3(Sb,Bi)2&#8208;based matrix, the grain boundary phases are in situ engineered, yielding a superior figure of merit (zT) exceeding 2 at 798 K. The electrical conductivity is significantly enhanced with only slight changes to the Seebeck coefficient over the entire temperature range, mainly due to the contribution to carrier concentration and mobility from the newly generated Ti3Sb at grain boundaries. Benefiting from the remarkably enhanced power factor and the diminished lattice thermal conductivity, the zT value shows an overall increase within the temperature range of 300&#8211;798 K, leading to a considerable conversion efficiency of 15% for the single&#8208;leg device.

         <title>Regulating Charge Distribution to Achieve High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Single&#8208;Component Organic Neuromorphic Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A torsion&#8208;polarization synergy strategy utilizing cyano&#8208;functionalized thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;3,6&#8208;dicarbonitrile (2CNTT) achieves intramolecular decoupling and intermolecular polarization, optimizing exciton dissociation and charge transport. The single&#8208;component phototransistor based on 2CNTT exhibits ultralow energy consumption, high photoresponse, and synaptic functionalities, providing an efficient design strategy for multifunctional optoelectronic devices and neuromorphic applications.








Abstract
Organic optoelectronic devices are advancing toward miniaturization and integration, demanding high performance, low energy consumption, and simplified manufacturing. The development of single&#8208;component phototransistors is still in its early stages, particularly for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors. Here, thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;3,6&#8208;dicarbonitrile (2CNTT) is developed and a cyano&#8208;mediated torsion&#8208;polarization synergy strategy is proposed to construct conjugated polymers via direct (hetero)arylation polycondensation. This structural modification promotes intramolecular decoupling and enhances intermolecular interactions, enabling intra&#8208;/interchain charge distribution to be regulated. N&#8208;type copolymers based on 2CNTT exhibited broad visible&#8208;light absorption range and small exciton binding energy, capable of stable exciton generation and stepwise dissociation. The PFIID2NTT&#8208;based single&#8208;component phototransistor showed stable unipolar electron mobility and strong photoresponse with light&#8208;current/dark&#8208;current ratio as high as 9.02 &#215; 104, and a paired&#8208;pulse facilitation index over 236% under visible light. The devices also operate at an ultra&#8208;low energy consumption (13.23 aJ), mimicking neural synapse behavior and enabling long&#8208;term memory functionality. The strategy optimizes charge distribution and exciton utilization in n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors, presenting a new paradigm for developing multifunctional organic optoelectronics.

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Ratiometric Fluorescence Nanothermometer for Real&#8208;Time Endoscopic Temperature Guidance during Tumor Ablation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a time&#8208;resolved ratiometric fluorescence nanothermometer with high quantum yield and exceptional thermal sensitivity, enabling rapid and accurate in vivo temperature imaging by eliminating the interference of wavelength&#8208;dependent signal attenuation and autofluorescence. A further developed fluorescence temperature endoscopy system overcomes the light penetration limitation, realizing real&#8208;time temperature guidance during liver tumor ablation in rabbit model.








Abstract
Thermal ablation is a common treatment option for early&#8208;stage cancers, but the lack of real&#8208;time temperature imaging feedback method increases the risk of incomplete or excessive ablation. Although ratiometric nanothermometer offers a rapid temperature imaging solution, accurate in vivo signal extraction remains challenging due to the autofluorescence and wavelength&#8208;dependent tissue absorption and scattering. Herein, a time&#8208;resolved ratiometric fluorescence nanothermometer composed of europium and iridium complex with identical working wavelength but distinguishing lifetimes is reported, whose well&#8208;designed structures enable 450&#160;nm excitation of both complexes with a high quantum yield (57.8%). Based on the nanothermometer, accurate signal extraction is realized in whole blood, beneath a 2 cm tissue phantom and a 5 mm pork slice through a time&#8208;resolved ratiometric method. By leveraging the exceptional thermal sensitivity (6.9% K&#8722;1), high temperature resolution (0.02 K), and clinically relevant temperature range (30&#8211;96&#160;&#176;C) of the nanothermometer, a fluorescence temperature endoscopy system is further designed with a real&#8208;time temperature imaging speed of 10 fps, which is applied to minimally invasive temperature monitoring during microwave ablation of liver tumors in rabbits, realizing precise ablation control through dynamic ablation power adjustment. The real&#8208;time and accurate temperature imaging performance of the nanothermometer may offer a new perspective for intraoperative guidance.

         <title>Robust Imaging through Light&#8208;Scattering Barriers via Energetically Modulated Multispectral Organic Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study examines universal strategies for electron&#8208;blocking layers in high&#8208;performance organic photodetectors by introducing a newly designed self&#8208;assembled monolayer. These strategies enable robust imaging of objects across thick light&#8208;scattering barriers under near&#8208;infrared illumination, a previously only theorized challenge in photodetection.








Abstract
Emerging technologies, such as biomedical imaging and autonomous driving, rely on low&#8208;noise near infrared (NIR) photodetectors. Organic photodetectors (OPDs) offer tremendous potential for these applications because of their seamless integration and NIR photosensing capabilities; however, their high noise levels have constrained widespread commercialization. Herein, the study demonstrates a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) NIR OPD featuring an ultralow noise current of 2.18 fA, enabled by a newly synthesized electron&#8208;blocking layer (EBL), ((2,7&#8208;dicyano&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene&#8208;9,9&#8208;diyl)bis(propane&#8208;3,1&#8208;diyl))bis(phosphonic acid) (3PAFCN). Through diverse energetic modulative design strategies, 3PAFCN enables the OPD to achieve homogenous surface properties, an elevated interfacial energy barrier, and optimized BHJ morphology, culminating in a notable specific detectivity of 2.50 &#215; 1014&#160;cm Hz0.5&#160;W&#8722;1 at 808&#160;nm illumination under white&#8208;noise conditions. These EBL design principles are broadly applicable for various photoactive materials. Demonstrations in single&#8208;pixel imaging highlight the exceptional clarity of the 3PAFCN&#8208;based OPD in low&#8208;light and foggy environments, underscoring the potential of OPD technology for advanced imaging applications.

&lt;p&gt;This study examines universal strategies for electron-blocking layers in high-performance organic photodetectors by introducing a newly designed self-assembled monolayer. These strategies enable robust imaging of objects across thick light-scattering barriers under near-infrared illumination, a previously only theorized challenge in photodetection.

         <title>Nanofibrous Guidance Conduits with Multiple Gradient Cues for Spinal Cord Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel guidance conduits are fabricated through electrospinning and masked coaxial electrospraying, integrating topological, haptotactic, and chemotactic cues to promote cell migration, neural stem cell differentiation, and axonal extension. In rat models, these conduits inhibited fibroblast proliferation, preserved microglial homeostasis, and promoted neuronal regeneration, significantly improving functional recovery and offering a promising strategy for spinal cord injury treatment.








Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating condition that leads to severe disabilities and imposes significant economic and social burdens. Current therapeutic strategies primarily focus on symptom management, with limited success in promoting full neurological recovery. In response to this challenge, the design of novel guidance conduits incorporating multiple gradient cues, inspired is reported by biological processes, to enhance spinal cord repair. These conduits are fabricated using electrospinning and masked coaxial electrospraying, a simple yet effective method that integrates topological, haptotactic, and chemotactic cues into a single scaffold. The synergy of these cues significantly promoted cell migration, neural stem cell differentiation into neurons, and axonal extension, resulting in substantial improvements in spinal cord regeneration and functional recovery in a rat model. Single&#8208;nucleus RNA sequencing further demonstrated that the guidance conduit inhibited fibroblast proliferation, preserved microglial homeostasis, restored cellular proportions, and facilitated the regeneration of neuronal axons, dendrites, and synapses. This work presents an innovative, versatile platform for fabricating tissue scaffolds that integrate multiple gradient cues, offering a promising strategy for SCI treatment and broader tissue regeneration applications.

         <title>Crosslinked Hetero&#8208;Chain Polymeric Interphase Enables the Stable Cycling of Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of &#8220;crosslinked hetero&#8208;chain polymeric CEI&#8221; (CHP&#8208;CEI) is particularly tailored for LRMO cathode. This CHP&#8208;CEI is homogeneous and shows a balanced combination of high robustness, flexibility, and mechanical energy dissipation ability, which can not be achieved by conventional additives. Therefore, the cracking of LRMO cathode, gas release, and transition metal dissolution are largely mitigated during cycling at aggressive voltages.








Abstract
The lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based layered oxide (LRMO) cathode shows grar promise for high&#8208;energy density and environment&#8208;friendly batteries due to its cation and anion redox. However, it suffers from continuous electrolyte consumption and capacity decay, especially at high mass loadings (&gt;10 mg cm&#8722;2). Conventional electrolyte/interphase strategies fail to address the structural characteristics of LRMO, limiting its practical application. Here, we reveal the specific requirements for cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) of LRMO and accordingly design a non&#8208;fluorinated additive, 2,4,6&#8208;trivinyl&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylcyclotrisiloxane (TVTMS). TVTMS could form a crosslinked hetero&#8208;chain polymeric CEI (CHP&#8208;CEI) through ring&#8208;opening polymerization and ethylene group crosslinking, offering a unique balance of high robustness, flexibility, and mechanical energy dissipation, which could not be achieved by conventional additives. Therefore, the cracking of LRMO cathode, gas release and transition metal dissolution were effectively mitigated. It should be noted that, for the first time to our knowledge, we employed the single&#8208;particle aerosol mass spectrometry (SPAMS) to study CEI components, especially the organic/polymer species. The Li|LRMO cells based on CHP&#8208;CEI display a lifespan &gt;825 cycles with remained capacity of 204 mAh g&#8722;1 and the cells with high&#8208;loading cathode (12 mg cm&#8722;2) achieve stable cycling &gt;145 cycles with 80% capacity retention, which surpasses the performance of previously reported electrolytes.

         <title>Spatiotemporally Programming Microenvironment to Recapitulate Endochondral Ossification via Greenhouse&#8208;Inspired Bionic Niche</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drawing inspiration from the functionality of the greenhouse ecosystem, this study develops a bionic niche capable of spatiotemporal programming the microenvironment to recapitulate the process of endochondral ossification (ECO). The niche successfully orchestrates the key stages of ECO, including immunomodulation, revascularization, chondrogenesis, and osteogenesis, offering a promising strategy for designing next&#8208;generation ECO&#8208;driven biomaterials in bone tissue engineering.








Abstract
Various biomaterials have been developed to address challenging critical&#8208;sized bone defects. However, most of them focus on intramembranous ossification (IMO) rather than endochondral ossification (ECO), often resulting in suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. Drawing inspiration from the functionality of the greenhouse ecosystem, herein a bionic niche is innovatively crafted to recapitulate the ECO process. This niche consists of three hierarchical components: an embedded microchannel network that facilitates cell infiltration and matter exchange, a polydopamine surface modification layer with immunomodulatory functions, and an ECO&#8208;targeted delivery system based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles. Through spatiotemporally programming of the microenvironment, the bionic niche effectively recapitulates the key stages of ECO. Notably, even in the rat calvaria, a region well&#8208;known for IMO, the bionic niche is capable of initiating ECO, evident by cartilage template formation, leading to efficient bone regeneration. Taken together, this study introduces prospective concepts for designing next&#8208;generation ECO&#8208;driven biomaterials for bone tissue engineering.

         <title>Substitution Index&#8208;Prediction Rules for Low&#8208;Potential Plateau of Hard Carbon Anodes in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substitution index of precursor (&#916;) is established as an effective predictor for the low&#8208;potential plateau performance of hard carbon (HC) anodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Three carbon models&#8212;disordered carbon, closed&#8208;pore&#8208;dominated carbon, and turbostratic carbon&#8212;are constructed to validate the accuracy of &#916; and investigate the mechanisms of closed pore formation and sodium storage.








Abstract
Establishing prediction rules for the low&#8208;potential plateau (LPP) of hard carbon (HC) anodes is crucial for constructing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). While current studies suggest that the closed pores of HC can enhance the LPP performance, the rules for directly predicting the LPP from precursors have yet to be established. Here, prediction rules for the LPP of HC anodes in SIBs&#8212;the substitution index (&#916;) of precursor are introduced. Three carbon models (disordered carbon, closed&#8208;pore&#8208;dominated carbon, and turbostratic carbon) are constructed to verify the accuracy of &#916; and to explore the closed&#8208;pore formation and LPP mechanism. In detail, as the &#916; increases from 0.06 to 0.22, the LPP capacity rises from 25 to 278&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, revealing a strong linear correlation between &#916; of precursor and LPP capacity. In situ XRD, Raman, and ex situ SAXS, EPR further confirm that sodium storage in HC can be categorized into adsorption (&gt;0.4&#160;V), interlayer storage (0.4 to 0.15&#160;V), and pore&#8208;filling (below 0.15&#160;V). This work not only elucidates the sodium storage mechanisms, but also provides one efficient design guideline for advanced carbon anodes in SIBs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establishing prediction rules for the low-potential plateau (LPP) of hard carbon (HC) anodes is crucial for constructing high-energy-density sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). While current studies suggest that the closed pores of HC can enhance the LPP performance, the rules for directly predicting the LPP from precursors have yet to be established. Here, prediction rules for the LPP of HC anodes in SIBs&#8212;the substitution index (&lt;i&gt;&#916;&lt;/i&gt;) of precursor are introduced. Three carbon models (disordered carbon, closed-pore-dominated carbon, and turbostratic carbon) are constructed to verify the accuracy of &lt;i&gt;&#916;&lt;/i&gt; and to explore the closed-pore formation and LPP mechanism. In detail, as the &lt;i&gt;&#916;&lt;/i&gt; increases from 0.06 to 0.22, the LPP capacity rises from 25 to 278&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, revealing a strong linear correlation between &lt;i&gt;&#916;&lt;/i&gt; of precursor and LPP capacity. In situ XRD, Raman, and ex situ SAXS, EPR further confirm that sodium storage in HC can be categorized into adsorption (&amp;gt;0.4&#160;V), interlayer storage (0.4 to 0.15&#160;V), and pore-filling (below 0.15&#160;V). This work not only elucidates the sodium storage mechanisms, but also provides one efficient design guideline for advanced carbon anodes in SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interface&#8208;Controlled Redox Chemistry in Aqueous Mn2&#8314;/MnO&#8322; Batteries</title>

The study explores how interfacial redox mediation influences Mn2&#8314;/MnO&#8322; conversion, focusing on local environmental regulation. It is found that the VO2&#8314;/VO&#8322;&#8314; redox couple stabilizes pH, controls H&#8322;O activity, and mediates Mn3&#8314;, enabling 100% Mn2&#8314;/MnO&#8322; conversion. This approach suppresses Mn degradation, extends electrode lifespan, and achieves record&#8208;high electrode capacity (100&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2), offering a breakthrough for static Mn2+/MnO2 batteries.








Abstract
Manganese dioxide (MnO2) deposition/dissolution (Mn2+/MnO2) chemistry, involving a two&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer process, holds promise for safe and eco&#8208;friendly large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, challenges like electrode/electrolyte interface environment fluctuations (H+ and H2O activity), irreversible Mn degradation, and limited understanding of degradation mechanisms hinder the reversibility of the Mn2+/MnO2 conversion. This study demonstrates a vanadyl/pervanadyl (VO2+/VO2+) redox&#8208;mediated interface designed for high&#8208;energy Mn2+/MnO2 batteries. Unlike flow systems, this work uncovers, for the first time, the mechanism of a static redox&#8208;mediated interface in regulating interfacial H+ and H2O activities. Significantly, the VO2+/VO2+ chemical redox mediation targets Mn3+ intermediates, suppressing their hydrolysis and enabling 100% Mn2+/MnO2 conversion. The redox&#8208;mediated interface enhances the Mn redox electron transfer process, achieving a stable &#8776;95% coulombic efficiency and ultrahigh capacity of 100&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 with an areal energy density of 111&#160;mWh&#160;cm&#8722;2, outperforming flow systems. The electrode also exhibits an average specific capacity of 593&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, approaching the theoretical limit of 616&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, and a specific energy density of 721&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 at high MnO2 loadings (50&#8211;150&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2). The findings highlight the critical role of interfacial redox mediation in regulating H+ and H2O activities and underscore the significance of interface dynamics.

         <title>Weak Dipole Effect Customized Zinc Ion&#8208;Rich Protective Layer for Lean&#8208;Electrolyte Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zwitterionic protective layer is engineered on Zn surface by weak dipole effect of TMAO. The weak dipole effect realizes Zn ion&#8208;rich environment to alleviate the concentration polarization on electrolyte/Zn interface and exhibits short range interaction with free water to inhibit side reactions, thereby achieving enhanced performance for both symmetrical and full batteries with lean&#8208;electrolyte.








Abstract
The industrial development of Zn&#8208;ion batteries requires high performance even with lean&#8208;electrolyte. Nevertheless, lean&#8208;electrolyte can exacerbate concentration polarization at the interface of electrode/electrolyte, leading to significant Zn corrosion and battery failure. Here, a stable Zn ion&#8208;rich protective layer (TMAO&#8208;Zn) is constructed by a unique zwitterion structure of trimethylamine N&#8208;oxide (TMAO). The TMAO is characterized by the direct connection between positive and negative charges (N+&#8208;O&#8722;) with minimal dipole moment, which renders weak dipole interactions to form the TMAO&#8208;Zn layer with Zn2+, thereby reducing concentration polarization and promoting the rapid and uniform deposition of Zn2+. Furthermore, the O of TMAO&#8208;Zn exhibits the higher electrophilic index, indicating a stronger propensity for stable hydrogen bond interactions with active free water in the inner Helmholtz layer (IHL), thereby mitigating corrosion under extreme conditions of low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio (E/C ratio). Consequently, the symmetrical Zn battery with TMAO&#8208;Zn enables stable cycling for over 250&#160;h with lean&#8208;electrolyte of 15&#160;&#181;L&#160;mA&#160;h&#8722;1. Additionally, Zn/I&#8322; pouch battery with a low E/C ratio of 21.2&#160;&#181;L&#160;mA&#160;h&#8722;1 provides ultra&#8208;high stable specific capacity of 96&#160;mA&#160;h for over 250 cycles (capacity retention rate of 98.3%). This study offers a new concept to propel the practical application of Zn batteries with lean&#8208;electrolyte.

         <title>Quantifying Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance Induced Enhancement on Metal@Cu2O Composites for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal@Cu2O composites are developed as platforms to investigate the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) induced enhancement on photoelectrocatalysis. The contributions of two LSPR mechanisms, plasmon&#8208;induced resonance energy transfer (PIRET) and hot electron transfer (HET), to the photocurrent are quantified using different bands of incident light, providing a quantitative understanding of the role of PIRET and HET in boosting photoelectrocatalysis.








Abstract
The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of metal nanoparticles can substantially enhance the activity of photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) reactions. However, quantifying the respective contributions of different LSPR mechanisms to the enhancement of PEC performance remains an urgent challenge. In this work, Cu@Cu2O composites prepared by annealing Cu2O under an inert atmosphere and electrodeposited metal@Cu2O composites (MED@Cu2O, MED = CuED, AuED, AgED, PdED, PtED) are employed as platform materials to investigate the LSPR effect on the PEC hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). All the composites exhibited remarkably LSPR&#8208;enhanced activity toward PEC HER. The contributions of two LSPR mechanisms, plasmon induced resonance energy transfer (PIRET) and hot electron transfer (HET), to the photocurrent on Cu@Cu2O and CuED@Cu2O are quantified by using different bands of incident light. Moreover, using MED@Cu2O composites, the effects of both the metal species and the applied potential on HET are quantitatively investigated. The results reveal that a pronounced HET enhancement occurs only when the LSPR peak energy is lower than the semiconductor bandgap energy (Eg) and that HET strengthens as the applied potential becomes more negative for PEC HER. This work therefore provides a quantitative understanding of the roles of PIRET and HET in boosting PEC activity.

         <title>Gradient Doping for Stress&#8208;Relief in Vapor&#8208;deposited Perovskite Film to Achieve High&#8208;performance p&#8208;i&#8208;n Perovskite Solar Cells with a 23% Efficiency</title>

A gradient doping strategy based on vapor deposition is proposed, which effectively reduces the crystallization rate at the bottom layer, promotes uniform crystallization, and applies pre&#8208;compressive stress to the surface of the perovskite film, thereby effectively alleviating the residual stress and achieving a PCE of 23.0% for p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs with vapor&#8208;deposited perovskite.








Abstract
Vapor&#8208;deposited p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs) present key advantages such as low cost, excellent stability, low&#8208;temperature fabrication, and compatibility with tandem architectures, positioning them as strong contenders for industrial&#8208;scale solar applications. However, their power conversion efficiency (PCE) remains lower than that of n&#8208;i&#8208;p architectures. Herein, a gradient doping strategy to alleviate the stress in vapor&#8208;deposited perovskite films is introduced. Gradient chloride doping in the perovskite precursor film effectively slows the crystallization rate at the bottom layer, facilitating uniform crystallization and mitigating residual strain. This method yielded high&#8208;quality perovskite films, achieving a PCE of 23.0% for p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs with vapor&#8208;deposited perovskite and 21.43% for entirely vapor&#8208;deposited PSCs. Additionally, the devices demonstrates outstanding stability, showing negligible performance degradation over 1600 h of nitrogen storage and maintaining 87.3% of their initial PCE after 500 h of maximum power point tracking under 1&#8208;sun equivalent illumination at 70% relative humidity. The gradient doping strategy provides valuable insights for advancing large&#8208;area and perovskite&#8208;textured silicon tandem solar cells.

         <title>Highly Coupled Dynamically Modulated Electrocatalysts on Wafer&#8208;Scale InGaN/GaN Nanowires on Silicon for Successive Acidic Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sluggish water oxidation kinetics on photoanodes under strongly acidic conditions not only limit the photocurrent but also induce severe photocorrosion. Here, loading a CoRuOX cocatalyst&#8212;exhibiting a unique dynamic electron modulation effect&#8212;onto wafer&#8208;scale InGaN nanowires achieves a dual breakthrough in both oxidation activity and stability for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation under strongly acidic conditions. This strategy offers a promising pathway for sustained PEC water oxidation in acidic environments.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical water splitting is considered one of the most promising paths for sustainable hydrogen production. However, the sluggish kinetics of the water oxidation reaction and poor stability of the photoanode significantly limit the overall performance of the photoelectrochemical device, particularly under acidic conditions, which poses great challenges for practical applications. Herein, the coupling of unique CoRuOx nanoclusters with dynamic electronic modulation effects to wafer&#8208;scale InGaN nanowires is proposed, demonstrating superior photoelectrochemical activity and stability for acidic water oxidation. Compared with InGaN nanowires loaded with typical RuO&#8322; cocatalysts, CoRuOx/InGaN photoanodes achieve a remarkable improvement in applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency from 0.77% to 2.25%, with stable operation for over 500&#160;min under strongly acidic conditions. Such boosted performance is attributed mainly to Co induced dynamic electronic modulation, which enhances oxygen evolution while maintaining the stable operation of CoRuOx/InGaN photoanodes. Initially, the Co sites increased the oxidation state of Ru, enhancing the activity of oxygen evolution. Moreover, during PEC operation, the Co sites stabilized the Ru sites, preventing dissolution of cocatalyst. This unique self&#8208;adaptive process significantly enhances the stability and activity of the photoanode, opening an effective avenue to achieve efficient and durable photoanodes for PEC applications.

         <title>Dual Doping of N and F on Co3O4 to Activate the Lattice Oxygen for Efficient and Robust Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel plasma strategy is reported to introduce N and F in Co3O4 (N, F&#8208;Co3O4) simultaneously as the heteroatoms, which enables the OER to occur via the lattice oxygen mechanism. The N, F&#8208;Co3O4 sample exhibits superior OER performance with a low overpotential and superior stability.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a pivotal process in numerous renewable energy conversion technologies. However, its sluggish intrinsic kinetics and intricate transfer process impede the efficient conversion of energy. Activating the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is of paramount importance to break through the theoretical scaling relationship and boost the oxygen evolution catalytic activity. In this contribution, N and F are successfully introduced into Co3O4 simultaneously as heteroatoms via a controllable plasma strategy to modulate the covalency property of metal&#8208;oxygen. Theoretical simulations and experiment results demonstrated that the covalency of the cobalt&#8208;oxygen bond is significantly enhanced under the synergistic effect of N and F, successfully triggering the LOM pathway and facilitating the OER process. The N, F&#8208;Co3O4 composite displays an impressive OER performance, exhibiting a low overpotential of 254&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and remarkable stability at 20, 150, and 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In addition, The N, F&#8208;Co3O4 also exhibits&#160;a low overpotential of 285&#160;mV at 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1 m KOH + 0.5&#160;m NaCl solution, and remarkable performance on overall water splitting. This work offers profound insights into the OER mechanism and a crucial strategy for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of spinel oxides.

         <title>Insight into the Role of Closed&#8208;Pore Size on Rate Capability of Hard Carbon for Fast&#8208;Charging Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlation between closed&#8208;pore size and Na&#8208;filling potentials and their influence on fast charging performance is unveiled. Smaller closed pores exhibit higher Na&#8208;filling potentials, thereby preventing Na plating at high current rates. A 2.2 Ah pouch cell incorporating optimizes hard carbon material with closed micropores (1.6 nm) and P2&#8208;type layered oxide positive electrodes enables 10 min charging for &#8776;90% of the capacity.








Abstract
The sluggish Na ion diffusion kinetics and Na metal plating in hard carbon negative electrodes restrict the fast&#8208;charging of sodium&#8208;ion batteries, which is intricately entwined with the crystal structure and pore structure. Here, the pore structures of hard carbon materials are focused on and reveal that the pore size significantly affects the Na&#8208;filling potentials during the sodiation process. Specifically, the micro closed pores exhibit higher Na&#8208;filling potentials, which reduces risks of Na metal plating at high current densities, thus enabling improved rate performance. As a result, the optimized hard carbon with closed micropores (1.6&#160;nm) achieves an initial capacity exceeding 400 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and a plateau retention rate of 73.3% at a current density of 500&#160;mA g&#8722;1. Paired with P2&#8208;type layered oxide positive electrodes, the 2.2 Ah pouch cell shows 10&#160;min charging for &#8776;90% of the capacity and &#8776;90% capacity retention after 1500 cycles at a 6C rate. This work establishes a bridge between pore size and rate performance, offering guidance for the design of fast&#8208;charging sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

A ZVO/RuO2 cathode is designed by coupling Zn0.85V10O24&#183;7.4H2O (ZVO) and RuO2 through interfacial V&#9472;O&#9472;Ru bonds in which a dynamic reversible breakage and reconstruction of V&#9472;O&#9472;Ru, which provide a reversible electron transfer channel between RuO2 and ZVO, making RuO2 as an additional electron acceptor and donor, accelerating the migration kinetics of H+/Zn2+ in ZVO.








Abstract
Intercalation&#8208;type layered vanadium oxides have been widely explored as cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8211;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, attaining both high power density and superior stability remains a formidable challenge. Herein, layered vanadium oxides are pre&#8208;intercalated with Zn2+ to form Zn0.85V10O24&#183;7.4H2O (ZVO), which is then combined with RuO2 nanoparticles to construct a ZVO/RuO2 heterostructure featuring interphase V&#9472;O&#9472;Ru bonds. ZVO/RuO2 heterostructure exhibits a dynamic stable coupling at the interphase via V&#9472;O&#9472;Ru chemical bonds reconstruction during discharging/charging processes. The dynamically reversible reconstruction of interphase V&#9472;O&#9472;Ru bonds provides a fast electron transfer channel between RuO2 and ZVO cathode, as demonstrated by ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, making RuO2 an additional electron acceptor and donor, and accelerating the migration of H+/Zn2+ in layered ZVO cathode. Therefore, an ultra&#8208;high capacity (411 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1, 225 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1) and long cycling stability (a retention of 92.2% at 20 A g&#8722;1 over 20000 cycles) performances are achieved. This interphase reversible reconstruction route provides a promising approach to achieving excellent cycling stability in cathode materials.

         <title>Promoting Phase Transition in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskites For High&#8208;Performance Pure&#8208;Red LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;processed quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films have a wide phase component distribution. Yu et&#160;al. show that introducing acetate anions promote the in situ phase transition from low&#8208;n to high&#8208;n phases. The enhanced phase transformation efficiency enables high&#8208;performance pure&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes with an emission peak of 641 nm and peak external quantum efficiency of 25.3%.








Abstract
Layered quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D)&#160;halide perovskites have emerged as a promising platform for high&#8208;efficiency electroluminescence. Narrowing the multi&#8208;quantum well distribution and eliminating wide&#8208;bandgap 2D phases are crucial for achieving a flat energy landscape, minimizing energy loss, and ensuring high&#8208;color&#8208;purity emission. Here, it is demonstrated that solution&#8208;processed quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films with broad component distributions arise from an incomplete kinetic transition from low&#8208;n (n, quantum well thickness) to high&#8208;n phases. To address this, an acetate anion treatment strategy is proposed, which induces competitive coordination between the acetate anion, the bulky spacer cation, and the inorganic layer, thereby facilitating the insertion of octahedral precursor ions and promoting phase transition. This treatment results in quasi&#8208;2D films with enhanced color purity, efficient energy transfer, and high photoluminescence quantum yield. The fabricated perovskite light emitting diode&#160;(PeLED) exhibits an emission peak at 641&#160;nm and a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 25.3%, representing one of the most efficient pure&#8208;red PeLEDs. The strategy also showcases the versatility of quasi&#8208;2D films for different emission wavelengths.

         <title>Pairing N&#8208;Vacancy and Adjacent Ni&#8208;Sites in the Local Microenvironment to Regulate the Urea Oxidation Reaction Pathway With Enhanced Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nitrogen vacancies&#8208;rich nickel nitride (Ni3N&#8208;VN), a local microenvironment of nitrogen vacancies and adjacent Ni sites is formed. The electron&#8208;rich Ni&#8208;sites can be converted to NiOOH at a lower potential, and urea adsorption on the electron&#8208;deficient nitrogen vacancy region is conducive to its partial dissociation, conceiving to efficient urea oxidation reaction.








Abstract
The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a promising approach for replacing the oxygen evolution reaction in hydrogen production, offering lower energy consumption. However, the kinetics of Ni&#8208;based catalysts for UOR are hindered by the high formation potential of NiOOH and its repeated transition with Ni(OH)2. In this study, a local microenvironment featuring electron&#8208;deficient N&#8208;vacancies (VN) paired with adjacent electron&#8208;rich Ni&#8208;sites on Ni3N (Ni3N&#8208;VN) to enhance UOR kinetics is constructed. The electron&#8208;rich Ni&#8208;sites significantly reduce the energy barrier for NiOOH formation and promote the conversion of Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH. Meanwhile, the VN sites induce low charge transfer resistance in Ni3N, facilitating efficient electron transfer and boosting UOR performance while ensuring the stability of the active NiOOH phase. The VN sites promote the adsorption of the urea N atom at the active site, favoring the reaction pathway toward &#8220;NCO&#8315;&#8221; formation without requiring complete urea dissociation. This pathway alleviates the NiOOH/Ni(OH)2 conversion cycle, lowers charge transfer resistance, and improves reaction kinetics. Ni3N&#8208;VN demonstrates excellent UOR activity (low potential of 1.46&#160;V at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and industrial prospects (integrating into an anion exchange membrane flow electrolyzer with 20% Pt/C, producing 600&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.84&#160;V), highlighting its potential for practical applications.

         <title>A Perspective on the Origin of High&#8208;Entropy Solid Electrolytes</title>

This perspective critically examines HE approaches in SEs, highlighting how compositional complexity induces system disorder and local&#8208;structure evolution to enhance stability and properties. While HE concepts are attractive, establishing rigorous structure&#8208;property relationships requires further investigation. The discussion aims to guide future research in this promising field by clarifying key challenges and opportunities in HE&#8208;based electrolyte design.








Abstract
As the key material for the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), solid electrolytes (SEs) have attracted increasing attention. Recently, a novel design strategy&#8722;high&#8208;entropy (HE) approach is frequently reported to improve the ionic conductivity and electrochemical performance of SEs. However, the fundamental understandings on the HE working mechanism and applicability evaluation of HE concept are deficient, which would impede the sustainable development of a desirable strategy to enable high&#8208;performance SEs. In this contribution, the essence of HE&#8208;related approaches and their positive effects on SEs are evaluated. The reported HE strategy stems from complex compositional regulations. The derived structural stability and enhanced property are originally from the modulated system disorder and subtle local&#8208;structure evolutions, respectively. While HE ardently describes the increased entropy/disorder during the modification of prevailing SEs, rigorous experimental formulations, and direct correlations between the HE structures and desired properties are necessary to be established. This perspective would be a timely and critical overview for the HE approaches in the context of SEs, aiming to stimulate further discussion and exploration in this emerging research direction.

         <title>Halide Chemistry Boosts All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 28, July 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide chemistry is an emerging approach in promoting the kinetics of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries (ASSLSBs). In this perspective, the distinct roles of halide chemistry are discussed at both the cathode and anode, analyzing the atomic arrangement, phase composition, and morphology evolution in various halogenation strategies. further research and broad discussion of halogenation strategies are expected to inspire ASSLSBs.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries (ASSLSBs) are emerging as a promising energy storage solution due to their low cost and high energy density. Their solid&#8208;state configuration effectively eliminates the notorious shuttle effect caused by soluble polysulfides in conventional liquid electrolytes. However, the heterogeneous solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid interfaces introduce significant challenges, including sluggish ion/electron transport and interfacial instability among electrode materials, conductive additives, and solid electrolytes (SEs). Recently, halide&#8208;based strategies have gained attention for enabling high&#8208;performance ASSLSBs. This perspective highlights these strategies, emphasizing the role of halide chemistry in enhancing ASSLSB kinetics. It is contended that halides (e.g., iodides) in sulfur&#8208;based cathode composites&#8212;such as Li2S and transition metal sulfides&#8212;can activate S/Li2S redox reactions, improving both ionic and electronic conductivities. This &#8220;catalytic effect&#8221; of halides accelerates the reversible transition, even in the absence of conductive additives like SEs or conductive carbons. Moreover, halides at the anode interface play a crucial role in preventing Li dendrite formation and SE degradation, owing to their large polarizability and high interfacial energy. This perspective provides a timely and insightful summary of halide chemistry's impact on ASSLSB kinetics, offering inspiration for further research and broader adoption of halide&#8208;based strategies in next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries.

In article number 2501184, Yuqi Tang, Dan Xiang, and Quan Li report a novel near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;based nanomedicine, leveraging an in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly strategy to fabricate highly targeted nanoparticles. These nanomedicines trigger pyroptosis by generating type I reactive oxygen species, while simultaneously activating photoimmunotherapy. This unique structural transformation enhances the nanomedicine accumulation in tumor tissues, enabling robust NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and improving therapeutic efficacy even in hypoxic tumor microenvironments.

Friction Behavior of Hydrogels
In article number 2417177, Kai Zhang, Jiuling Wang, and co&#8208;workers reveal that water evaporation from hydrogel surfaces in open&#8208;air conditions reduces the hydrodynamic layer thickness and increases surface viscosity, leading to a gradual rise in friction. Optimizing pore size and water mobility within the hydrogel enhances water transport from the interior to the surface, mitigating evaporation and enabling consistently low friction. This work provides guidelines for designing hydrogel materials with excellent lubrication properties.

Sprayable Hydrogel
This study designs a sprayable hydrogel based on polypeptide&#8208;modified lipid nanoparticles (PLNs) to treat non&#8208;compressible hemorrhage. Functionalized with GFOGER and GGQQLK peptides, PLNs synergistically mimic natural hemostasis via platelet adherence and aggregation, Ca2+/DSPS&#8208;mediated prothrombin activation and fibrin network stabilization. The biomimetic system enables rapid clot formation by sequential coordinating primary hemostasis, coagulation amplification and fibrin reinforcement. More details can be found in article number 2500908 by Yang Li, Chenhui Zhu, Daidi Fan, and co&#8208;workers.

Multimodal Humidity Adaptive Optical Neuron
In article number 2417793 by Nazek El&#8208;Atab and co&#8208;workers, a multifunctional memristor is demonstrated for in&#8208;memory sensing and computing, leveraging a MoWS2/VOx heterojunction to enable high ON/OFF ratio up to 108 with ultralow operating voltages of &#177;0.2 V. This bio&#8208;inspired multimodal design exhibits tunable synaptic behavior across electrical, optical, and humidity stimuli, enabling in&#8208;situ modulation of conductance for low&#8208;power, real&#8208;time processing of multisensory signals. The reconfigurable humidity&#8208;adaptive neuron and humidity&#8208;mediated optical synaptic learning enable vision clarity control, paving the way for energy&#8208;efficient next&#8208;generation human&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>Engineering Magnetotactic Bacteria as Medical Microrobots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are living microorganisms that produce magnetosomes for navigation using the Earth's geomagnetic field. Their built&#8208;in magnetic components, along with their intrinsic and/or modified biological functions, make them one of the most promising platforms for making future living and programmable microrobots. This review highlights recent advances in MTB&#8208;based microrobotics, detailing their interactions with magnetic fields, propulsion mechanisms, motion control, and emerging strategies for engineering and functionalizing MTB for biomedical applications.








Abstract
Nature's ability to create complex and functionalized organisms has long inspired engineers and scientists to develop increasingly advanced machines. Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), a group of Gram&#8208;negative prokaryotes that biomineralize iron and thrive in aquatic environments, have garnered significant attention from the bioengineering community. These bacteria possess chains of magnetic nanocrystals known as magnetosomes, which allow them to align with Earth's geomagnetic field and navigate through aquatic environments via magnetotaxis, enabling localization to areas rich in nutrients and optimal oxygen concentration. Their built&#8208;in magnetic components, along with their intrinsic and/or modified biological functions, make them one of the most promising platforms for future medical microrobots. Leveraging an externally applied magnetic field, the motion of MTBs can be precisely controlled, rendering them suitable for use as a new type of biohybrid microrobotics with great promise in medicine for bioimaging, drug delivery, cancer therapy, antimicrobial treatment, and detoxification. This mini&#8208;review provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of recent advancements in MTB microrobots, delineates the interaction between MTB microrobots and magnetic fields, elucidates propulsion mechanisms and motion control, and reports state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies for modifying and functionalizing MTB for medical applications.

This review explores the integration of responsive materials and soft robotic actuators with implantable electronics to address key challenges in bioelectronic medicine. By enabling shape actuation, these technologies improve deployment, adaptability, and accuracy in minimally invasive procedures. The review discusses actuation mechanisms, device designs, and future opportunities for intelligent, responsive implants with enhanced therapeutic and diagnostic capabilities.








Abstract
Bioelectronic medicine uses implantable electronic devices to interface with electrically active tissues and transform the way disease is diagnosed and treated. One of the biggest challenges is the development of minimally invasive devices that can be deployed to patients at scale. Responsive materials and soft robotic actuators offer unique opportunities to make bioelectronic devices with shape actuation, promising to address the limitations of existing rigid and passive systems, including difficult deployment, mechanical mismatch with soft tissues, and limited adaptability in minimally invasive settings. In this review, an overview is provided of smart materials and soft robotic technologies that show promises for implantable use, discussing advantages and limitations of underlying actuation mechanisms. Examples are then presented where soft actuating mechanisms are combined with microelectrodes to create shape actuating bioelectronic devices. Opportunities and challenges for next&#8208;generation intelligent bioelectronic devices assisted by responsive materials and soft robotic actuators are then discussed. These innovations may allow electronic implants to safely navigate to target areas inside the body and establish large area and spatiotemporally controlled interfaces for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures that are minimally invasive.

         <title>Deactivation Mechanism and Mitigation Strategies of Single&#8208;Atom Site Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the single&#8208;atom site electrocatalysts (SACs) stability/durability, encompassing both deactivation mechanism at the atomic&#8208;, meso&#8208;, and nanoscale, and mitigation strategies by controlling the catalyst composition, structure, morphology and surface. Moreover, the challenges and prospects of efficient SACs for long&#8208;term use are proposed. This review can provide a unique perspective as well as rational guidelines, with emphasis on stability/durability issues, for future large&#8208;scale applications of SACs and beyond.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom site electrocatalysts (SACs), with maximum atom efficiency, fine&#8208;tuned coordination structure, and exceptional reactivity toward catalysis, energy, and environmental purification, have become the emerging frontier in recent decade. Along with significant breakthroughs in activity and selectivity, the limited stability and durability of SACs are often underemphasized, posing a grand challenge in meeting the practical requirements. One pivotal obstacle to the construction of highly stable SACs is the heavy reliance on empirical rather than rational design methods. A comprehensive review is urgently needed to offer a concise overview of the recent progress in SACs stability/durability, encompassing both deactivation mechanism and mitigation strategies. Herein, this review first critically summarizes the SACs degradation mechanism and induction factors at the atomic&#8208;, meso&#8208; and nanoscale, mainly based on but not limited to oxygen reduction reaction. Subsequently, potential stability/durability improvement strategies by tuning catalyst composition, structure, morphology and surface are delineated, including construction of robust substrate and metal&#8208;support interaction, optimization of active site stability, fabrication of porosity and surface modification. Finally, the challenges and prospects for robust SACs are discussed. This review facilitates the fundamental understanding of catalyst degradation mechanism and provides efficient design principles aimed at overcoming deactivation difficulties for SACs and beyond.

The common thermoplastic and carbon fiber applied in the manufacture of carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics are summarized, and the processing and postprocessing methods are reviewed, with emphasis on state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art welding techniques. The typical applications of carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics in industry are also highlighted.








Abstract
Carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics (CFRTs) have witnessed a resurgence in recent times since their first industrial use over five decades ago, with revitalized interest from aerospace companies and other key sectors including energy and automotive sectors. CFRTs are increasingly gaining footholds in high volume rapid manufacturing in aerospace and nonaerospace sectors owing to their inherent recyclability. However, there has been a lack of contemporary and critical review on this topic so far. This work aims to review the recent advances in CFRTs with emphasis on high performance thermoplastics. Both continuous and discontinuous fiber forms in tape, organosheet and short/long fiber architectures are discussed, their processing and postprocessing methods are reviewed, with emphasis on state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art welding techniques. Typical applications of CFRTs in industry are examined, including fuselage, pressure vessel, and automotive components. Finally, insights are provided into ongoing challenges, future development, and a roadmap for expediting the development of high&#8208;performance CFRTs.

         <title>Materials Advances in Devices for Heart Disease Interventions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the crucial role of materials in heart disease interventions, focusing on strategies for monitoring, managing, and repairing heart conditions. It discusses the material requirements for medical devices, highlighting recent innovations and their impact on cardiovascular health. It aims to provide insights into the challenges in cardiovascular interventions and the essential role of materials in developing effective solutions.








Abstract
Heart disease encompasses a range of conditions that affect the heart, including coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, congenital heart defects, heart valve disease, and conditions that affect the heart muscle. Intervention strategies can be categorized according to when they are administered and include: 1) Monitoring cardiac function using sensor technology to inform diagnosis and treatment, 2) Managing symptoms by restoring cardiac output, electrophysiology, and hemodynamics, and often serving as bridge&#8208;to&#8208;recovery or bridge&#8208;to&#8208;transplantation strategies, and 3) Repairing damaged tissue, including myocardium and heart valves, when management strategies are insufficient. Each intervention approach and technology require specific material properties to function optimally, relying on materials that support their action and interface with the body, with new technologies increasingly depending on advances in materials science and engineering. This review explores material properties and requirements driving innovation in advanced intervention strategies for heart disease and highlights key examples of recent progress in the field driven by advances in materials research.

A high&#8208;performance moisture&#8208;electric generator is fabricated by integrating an ionic hydrogel layer with a graphene oxide film, where the designed ionic hydrogel offers ongoing power output under diverse environments while the intrinsic layering graphene oxide efficiently manages ion diffusion for enhanced electricity production. The developed device can be easily scaled up for powering various electronic devices.








Abstract
Moisture electric generators (MEGs), which can directly convert chemical energy in moisture into electricity have demonstrated great potential for powering wearable electronics and IoT devices. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MEGs suffer from transient power output and rely on high relative humidity (RH) as well as mild temperature, hampering their practical applications. Herein, a novel high&#8208;performance MEG is reported by designing ionic hydrogel and graphene oxide dual&#8208;layered devices, where the water&#8208;enriched hydrogel enables continuous power outputs under various conditions while the inherent layering nanochannels effectively regulate ion diffusion for stable and efficient performance improvement. The MEG can generate a maximum power density of 71.7&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 and continuously output 0.6&#160;V for more than 1400&#160;h at room condition without degradation. Most importantly, the developed generator can operate well from &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C to 50&#160;&#176;C, and an ultrahigh and stable voltage of 1.2&#160;V is realized at RH of 0% owing to the dynamic water equilibrium in the system. The MEG also displays excellent self&#8208;restoration capabilities, demonstrating high cyclic&#8208;performing potential. This work may provide important guidelines in designing long&#8208;life all climate applicable energy harvesting devices through designing synergistic bilayers architecture.

         <title>Wearable Photonic Device for Multiple Biomarker Sampling and Detection without Blood Draws</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable photonic device (PiED) is developed by integrating a microlens array (MLA) and an optic microneedle array (OMNA) functionalized with immunobinding for safe and needle&#8208;free biomarker sampling and multiple blood biomarker detection without blood draw. The MLA&#8208;integrated OMNA amplifies and transmits LED light at 595 nm into skin, evenly distributing it in the capillary&#8208;enriched dermis and inducing biomarker extravasation.








Abstract
Needle&#8208;based blood draws or phlebotomy practice in clinics for centuries, often causing pain, discomfort, and inconvenience. Here, a wearable photonic device is presented by integrating a microlens array (MLA) and an optic microneedle array (OMNA) functionalized with immunobinding for safe and needle&#8208;free biomarker sampling and detection. The MLA&#8208;integrated OMNA amplifies and transmits LED light at 595&#160;nm into skin through the OMNA, bypassing the light&#8208;absorbing melanin in the epidermal layer, and evenly distributing it in the capillary&#8208;enriched dermis independent of the skin colors. The 595&#160;nm light is absorbed by hemoglobin (Hb) and oxygen&#8208;Hb within the capillaries, triggering thermal dilation of capillaries without damaging them or causing petechiae. The light illumination remarkably increases in the concentrations of various blood biomarkers in the skin through biomarker extravasation. These biomarkers bound specifically to the capture antibodies on&#160;OMNA with each microneedle covalently immobilized with one specific antibody. The OMNA is extensively modified to amplify the immunobinding signals and achieve sensitivity superior to that of enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. As proof of concept, the functionality of the prototype for minimally invasive sampling and precise multiplexed blood biomarker detection in two mouse models is validated to quantify acute inflammation and specific antibody production.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Recyclable Polyester Elastomers Through Transient Strain&#8208;Stiffening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient strain&#8208;crystallization simultaneously strengthens and toughens block polyester elastomers while conserving recyclability. Using controlled polymerization catalysis and commercial monomers, block polyester elastomers outperform current commercial elastomers, entering a new region of tensile mechanical property space.








Abstract
Polyester thermoplastic elastomers are promising sustainable materials but their mechanical properties need improvement, in particular, attempts to increase strength often result in compromised elasticity. Strong and tough elastomers are known but require complex polymer formulations together with control over cross&#8208;linking or crystallinity, both of which challenge recycling. Here, the introduction of transient strain&#8208;stiffening approaches into fully amorphous structures show both strengthening and toughening of elastomers while conserving recyclability. The new amorphous block polyester elastomers are prepared by controlled polymerization methods using commercial monomers. The block polymers comprise a central poly(&#603;&#8208;caprolactone&#8208;co&#8208;&#603;&#8208;decalactone) block flanked by poly(cyclohexene oxide&#8208;alt&#8208;phthalate) blocks. Elastomer thermomechanical properties are tuned by varying ratios of &#603;&#8208;caprolactone to &#603;&#8208;decalactone within the mid&#8208;block to access materials with excellent mechanical properties. The best elastomers feature 30&#8211;50 wt.% polycaprolactone and exhibit tensile strengths up to 40&#160;MPa, elongations at break above 2000%, with excellent elastic recovery (&gt;90%). These materials exhibit strain&#8208;induced crystallization and outperform current commercial elastomers, entering a new region of tensile mechanical property space. They have service temperature ranges from &#8722;60 to 140&#160;&#176;C and high temperature stability (&#8805;300&#160;&#176;C), with wide thermal (re)processing windows. These new polyester elastomers also show high resistance to creep, humidity resistance, and excellent recyclability.

         <title>Lipid Nanoparticles Enhance mRNA Delivery to the Central Nervous System Upon Intrathecal Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research explores lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for enhancing mRNA delivery to the central nervous system via intrathecal injection. By chemically engineering brain&#8208;targeting small molecules into ionizable lipids (BLs), the developed BLNPs effectively facilitate mRNA delivery across the brain. Intrathecal administration of Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA using the lead BLNP achieves significant gene editing in the brain with minimal off&#8208;target effects.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticle&#8208;messenger RNA formulations have garnered significant attention for their therapeutic potential in infectious diseases, cancer and genetic disorders. However, effective mRNA delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) remains a formidable challenge. To overcome this limitation, a class of brain&#8208;targeting lipids (BLs) is developed by incorporating brain&#8208;targeting small molecules with amino lipids and formulated them with helper lipids to generate brain&#8208;targeting lipid nanoparticles (BLNPs) for mRNA delivery. Screening studies led to a lead formulation, TD5 BLNPs, outperforming FDA&#8208;approved DLin&#8208;MC3&#8208;DMA LNPs in delivering mRNA to the brain upon intrathecal injection. Specifically, a single intrathecal injection of TD5 BLNP&#8208;GFP mRNA led to GFP expression in 29.6% of neurons and 38.1% of astrocytes across the brain. In an Ai14 mouse model, TD5 BLNP&#8208;Cre recombinase mRNA treatment induced tdTomato expression in &#8776;30% of neurons and 40% of astrocytes across major brain regions. Notably, delivery of Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA complex using TD5 BLNPs achieved effective genome editing in the brain. Additionally, TD5 BLNPs showed comparable safety profiles to MC3 LNPs, indicating promising biocompatibility. Overall, this TD5 BLNP formulation effectively delivers mRNA to brain tissues via intrathecal injection and facilitates efficient expression in both neurons and astrocytes, presenting a potential strategy for treating CNS diseases.

         <title>Friction Behavior and Microscopic Mechanism of Hydrogels in an Open&#8208;Air Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microscopic mechanisms governing the friction characteristics of hydrogels in open&#8208;air environments are revealed through experiments, theoretical analyses, and molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that larger pore sizes and enhanced internal water mobility improve the permeability of hydrogels, allowing them to maintain a low friction coefficient by mitigating surface water loss.









Abstract
Hydrogels composed of a solvent&#8208;saturated, cross&#8208;linked polymer network exhibit unique interfacial rheology and ultralow friction, making them valuable in biomedical applications. Despite their widespread use in open&#8208;air environments, the lubrication behaviors of hydrogels under these conditions remain poorly understood. Here, the microscopic mechanisms underlying the friction characteristics of hydrogels through a combination of experiments, theoretical analyses, and molecular dynamics simulations is explored. It is found that water evaporation from the hydrogel surface reduces the hydrodynamic layer thickness and increases surface viscosity, leading to a gradual rise in friction. On the other hand, optimizing pore size and water mobility within the hydrogel enhances water transport from the interior to the surface, mitigating evaporation and enabling consistently low friction. It is also explored how soaking time, water affinity, and applied normal load influence hydrogel lubrication.

     alt="Friction Behavior and Microscopic Mechanism of Hydrogels in an Open-Air Environment"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microscopic mechanisms governing the friction characteristics of hydrogels in open-air environments are revealed through experiments, theoretical analyses, and molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that larger pore sizes and enhanced internal water mobility improve the permeability of hydrogels, allowing them to maintain a low friction coefficient by mitigating surface water loss.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogels composed of a solvent-saturated, cross-linked polymer network exhibit unique interfacial rheology and ultralow friction, making them valuable in biomedical applications. Despite their widespread use in open-air environments, the lubrication behaviors of hydrogels under these conditions remain poorly understood. Here, the microscopic mechanisms underlying the friction characteristics of hydrogels through a combination of experiments, theoretical analyses, and molecular dynamics simulations is explored. It is found that water evaporation from the hydrogel surface reduces the hydrodynamic layer thickness and increases surface viscosity, leading to a gradual rise in friction. On the other hand, optimizing pore size and water mobility within the hydrogel enhances water transport from the interior to the surface, mitigating evaporation and enabling consistently low friction. It is also explored how soaking time, water affinity, and applied normal load influence hydrogel lubrication. The findings elucidate the microscopic mechanisms governing the friction behaviors of hydrogels and provide guidelines for designing hydrogel systems with sustained exceptional lubrication properties in open-air applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Radical p&#8208;Doping Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD for Efficient, Stable and Self&#8208;Healing Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing nitroxide redical, DT&#8208;TEMPO, has been used to address slow oxidation and mechanical stability limitations of Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD in perovskite solar cells, achieving good power conversion efficiency of 25.69% (rigid, certified 25.30%), 21.23% (rigid mini&#8208;module), and 24.19% (flexible). Most impressively, the flexible devices with DT&#8208;TEMPO show remarkable machnical stability, maintaining &#8764;95% of initial efficiency after 20&#8201;000 bending cycles through a dynamic disulfide bond cleavage and reformation mechanism.








Abstract
Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD is the primary hole transport material (HTM) for high&#8208;efficiency and stable flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs). However, the slow oxidation rate and susceptibility to film cracking under stress in Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD lead to reduced device stability and efficiency. In this paper, a multi&#8208;functional novel self&#8208;healing nitroxide radical monomer, 4&#8208;[[5&#8208;(1,2&#8208;dithiolane&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1&#8208;oxopentyl]amino]&#8208;2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (DT&#8208;TEMPO), has been introduced to address these challenges. DT&#8208;TEMPO, on one side, enhances the hole mobility and conductivity by p&#8208;doping Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, while boosting the charge transfer process from perovskite to Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD with an optimized energy level alignment on the other side. Additionally, DT&#8208;TEMPO endows a self&#8208;healing capability to Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD through the introduction of dynamic breaking and reconstructing disulfide bond. The optimized perovskite solar cells achieve impressive power conversion efficiencies, 25.69% on rigid substrates (certified 25.30%), 21.23% on rigid mini&#8208;modules, and 24.19% on flexible substrates. Remarkably, the FPSCs with DT&#8208;TEMPO retain over 90% of their initial efficiency even after 20&#8201;000 bending cycles (r = 6&#160;mm) and recover to &#8776;95% of their initial value through the self&#8208;healing process.

         <title>Super&#8208;Wide Color Tunability from a Single Electrochromic Device through In Situ Reconstruction of Optical Cavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is proposed utilizing in situ, electrically driven reconstruction of optical cavities on an electrochromic electrode surface to fabricate electrochromic devices with super&#8208;wide color tunability. The device fabricated by this approach can create a wide variety of colors from yellow, orange, red, violet, blue, and cyan to green in a single electrochromic device that almost spans the entire visible region.








Abstract
Electrochromic (EC) displays, as non&#8208;emissive (passive) displays with low energy consumption, have garnered significant attention from both industry and academia in recent years. Nevertheless, traditional EC technology faces challenges in achieving full&#8208;color displays within a single device due to its limited color gamut, even though full&#8208;color capability is highly desirable for eliminating the need for complex RGB subpixel mosaics. Herein, a new strategy is proposed utilizing in situ, electrically driven reconstruction of optical cavities on an electrochromic electrode surface to fabricate EC devices with super&#8208;wide color tunability. The device fabricated by this approach can create a wide variety of colors from yellow, orange, red, violet, blue, and cyan to green in a single EC device that almost spans the entire visible region (&#916;hue approaches 360&#176;). Apart from the super&#8208;wide color tunability, the devices also have small working voltage window (0.2&#8208;1.8 V), outstanding bistability (&gt;8&#160;h), extremely low power consumption (&#8776;2.3 mW cm&#8722;2) and good cycling ability (&#8776;4.3% decay rate after 1,000 cycles). Moreover, the super&#8208;wide color tunability of these EC devices has been demonstrated in diverse applications, including shifting rainbow flower images, color palettes, and information displays.

         <title>Hybrid Formative&#8208;Additive Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid Formative&#8208;Additive Manufacturing (HyFAM) integrates formative processes into additive manufacturing. HyFAM 3D&#8208;prints exterior walls and complex geometries, then formatively fills interior material. By tuning rheological properties, the study can achieve both 3D&#8208;printable ink and self&#8208;leveling, moldable ink of the same material. HyFAM speeds up part production and eliminates internal defects by replacing interior 3D&#8208;printed sections with bulk&#8208;filled material.








Abstract
Material extrusion additive manufacturing (AM) provides extensive design flexibility and exceptional material versatility, enabling the fabrication of complex, multifunctional objects ranging from embedded electronics to soft robotics and vascularized tissues. The bottom&#8208;up creation of these objects typically requires discretization into layers and voxels. However, the voxel size, determined by the nozzle diameter, limits extrusion rate, creating a conflict between resolution and speed. To address these inherent scalability challenges, the study proposes a hybrid formative&#8208;additive manufacturing technology that combines the respective strengths of each method&#8212;speed and quality with complexity and flexibility. The approach involves 3D&#8208;printing complex geometries, multimaterial features, and bounding walls of bulky, lower&#8208;resolution volumes, which are rapidly filled via casting or molding. By precisely controlling the materials&#8217; rheological properties&#8212;while maintaining similar solidified properties and high interfacial strength&#8212;several typical AM flaws, such as bulging and internal voids, are eliminated, achieving exponentially faster production speeds for objects with varying feature sizes.

Abstract
Transition metal sulfur oxides have emerged as promising candidates for advanced energy storage due to their multi&#8208;electron redox activity and tunable nanostructures. Among them, Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;O&#8208;S composites are particularly attractive for supercapacitors owing to their high energy storage density. However, conventional synthesis methods often require prolonged processing times (&gt;10&#160;h) or high&#8208;temperature treatments (&gt;80&#160;&#176;C), which limit their practical applications. This work addresses these challenges by developing amorphous&#8208;nanocrystalline intertwined Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;O&#8208;S nanohybrid nanosheet arrays through a rapid alternating current (AC) electrodeposition method (1&#160;h) under ambient conditions. The unique architecture combines the advantages of amorphous phases (enhanced ion diffusion pathways) and nanocrystalline domains (efficient charge transport), leading to exceptional specific capacitance of 4804&#160;F&#160;g&#8315;&#185; (or 959&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, 2402&#160;C&#160;g&#8722;1) at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, 82.2% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles (5&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;), and a near 100% Coulombic efficiency (CE). The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor achieves an energy density of 199.4&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; at 754&#160;W&#160;kg&#8315;&#185;, bridging the performance gap between batteries and conventional capacitors.

This work addresses these challenges by developing amorphous-nanocrystalline intertwined Co-Ni-O-S nanohybrid nanosheet arrays through a rapid alternating current (AC) electrodeposition method (1&#160;h) under ambient conditions. The unique architecture combines the advantages of amorphous phases (enhanced ion diffusion pathways) and nanocrystalline domains (efficient charge transport), leading to exceptional specific capacitance of 4804&#160;F&#160;g&#8315;&#185; (or 959&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 2402&#160;C&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, 82.2% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles (5&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;), and a near 100% Coulombic efficiency (CE). The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor achieves an energy density of 199.4&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; at 754&#160;W&#160;kg&#8315;&#185;, bridging the performance gap between batteries and conventional capacitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Multimodal Humidity Adaptive Optical Neuron Based on a MoWS2/VOx Heterojunction for Vision and Respiratory Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional memristor is demonstrated for in&#8208;memory sensing and computing, leveraging a MoWS&#8322;/VOx heterojunction to enable high ON/OFF ratio up to 10&#8312; with ultralow operating voltages of &#177;0.2&#160;V. This bio&#8208;inspired multimodal design exhibits tunable synaptic behavior across electrical, optical, and humidity stimuli, enabling in situ modulation of conductance for low&#8208;power, real&#8208;time processing of multisensory signals. The reconfigurable humidity&#8208;adaptive neuron and humidity&#8208;mediated optical synaptic learning enable non&#8208;contact respiratory sensing and vision clarity control, paving the way for energy&#8208;efficient next&#8208;generation human&#8211;machine interfaces.








Abstract
Advancements in computing have progressed from near&#8208;sensor to in&#8208;sensor computing, culminating in the development of multimodal in&#8208;memory computing, which enables faster, energy&#8208;efficient data processing by performing computations directly within the memory devices. A bio&#8208;inspired multimodal in&#8208;memory computing system capable of performing real&#8208;time low power processing of multisensory signals, lowering data conversion and transmission across several modules in conventional chips is introduced. A novel Cu/MoWS2/VOx/Pt based multimodal memristor is characterized by an ON/OFF ratio as high as 108 with consistent and ultralow operating voltages of &#177;0.2 surpassing conventional single&#8208;mode memory functions. Apart from observing electrical synaptic behavior, photonic depression and humidity mediated optical synaptic learning is also demonstrated. The heterojunction with MoWS2 also enables reconfigurable modulation in both memory and optical synaptic functionalities with changing humidity. This behavior provides tunable conductance modulation capabilities emulating synaptic transmission in biological neurons while showing potential in respiratory detection module for healthcare application. The humidity sensing capability is implemented to demonstrate vision clarity using a convolutional neural network (CNN), with different humidity levels applied as a data augmentation preprocessing method. This proposed multimodal functionality represents a novel platform for developing artificial sensory neurons, with significant implications for non&#8208;contact human&#8211;computer interaction in intelligent systems.

         <title>Legumain In Situ Engineering Promotes Efferocytosis of CAR Macrophage to Treat Cardiac Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research article, the authors found that the overwhelming apoptotic cells after myocardial infarction (MI) result in an overburdened efferocytosis in CAR&#8208;M&#934;, which compromises their antifibrotic potency. To address this challenge, an in situ engineered legumain (Lgmn) is developed to elevate the cargo degradation of phagolysosome for promoting the efferocytosis of CAR&#8208;M&#934;s, restoring their antifibrotic capability.








Abstract
Uncontrolled and excessive cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction (MI) is a primary contributor to mortality by heart failure. Chimeric antigen receptor macrophage (CAR&#8208;M&#934;) therapy shows great promise in cardiac fibrosis, however, the overwhelming apoptotic cells after MI results in an overburdened efferocytosis in CAR&#8208;M&#934;, which compromises their antifibrotic potency. This work here reports an in situ engineered legumain (Lgmn) to elevate the cargo degradation of phagolysosome for promoting the efferocytosis of CAR&#8208;M&#934;s, restoring their antifibrotic capability. Specifically, with the in&#8208;house customized macrophages&#8208;targeting lipid nanoparticles, this work first creates an efferocytosis&#8208;boosted fibrosis&#8208;specific CAR&#8208;M&#934;s by introducing dual mRNAs that encode Lgmn, an endolysosomal cysteine protease, along with an anti&#8208;fibroblast activation protein (FAP) CAR, respectively. This data demonstrate these CAR&#8208;M&#934;s displayed a significantly increased phagocytic capacity as well as improved efferocytosis and enhanced antifibrotic capability. Treatment with the in situ reprogrammed CAR&#8208;M&#934;s in MI mice obviously reduced the infarct size and mitigated cardiac fibrosis, leading to significant restoration of cardiac function. In sum, these findings establish that promoting efferocytosis through Lgmn engineering effectively relieved the overburdened efferocytosis of CAR&#8208;M&#934;s, and enhanced their treatment efficacy of cardiac fibrosis with broad application in other fibrotic diseases.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Like Polymers Targeting Keap1/Nrf2 as Therapeutics for Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a Keap1 targeting protein&#8208;like polymer (PLP) which activates Nrf2, an important&#160;cytoprotective transcription factor for&#160;relieving myocardial infarction&#8208;induced oxidative stress. This PLP increases cell survival in vitro in multiple relevant cardiac cell types and elicits pro&#8208;reparative responses, improving cardiac function in a preclinical model. Keap1 inhibiting PLPs&#160;show translational potential for ischemia reperfusion injury.









Abstract
Myocardial infarction (MI) results in oxidative stress to the myocardium and frequently leads to heart failure (HF). There is an unmet clinical need to develop therapeutics that address the inflammatory stress response and prevent negative left ventricular remodeling. Here, the Keap1/Nrf2 protein&#8211;protein interaction is specifically targeted, as Nrf2 activation is known to mitigate the inflammatory response following MI. This is achieved using a Nrf2&#8208;mimetic protein&#8208;like polymer (PLP) to inhibit the Keap1&#8208;Nrf2 interaction. The PLP platform technology provides stability in vivo, potent intracellular bioactivity, and multivalency leading to high avidity Keap1 binding. In vitro and in vivo assays to probe cellular activity and MI therapeutic utility are employed. These Keap1&#8208;inhibiting PLPs (Keap1i&#8208;PLPs) impart cytoprotection from oxidative stress via Nrf2 activation at sub&#8208;nanomolar concentrations in primary cardiomyocytes. Single&#8208;digit mg kg&#8722;1, single&#8208;dose, intravenous PLP administration significantly improves cardiac function in rats post&#8208;MI through immunomodulatory, anti&#8208;apoptotic, and angiogenic mechanisms. Thus Keap1i&#8208;PLPs disrupt key intracellular protein&#8211;protein interactions following intravenous, systemic administration in vivo. These results have broad implications not only for MI but also for other oxidative stress&#8208;driven diseases and conditions.

         <title>Orbital Topology of Chiral Crystals for Orbitronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and constitutional for life. In chiral materials the intrinsic handedness, defined by their crystal structure, becomes a main driver for a novel electronic topology that is based on the orbital angular momentum rather than the electron spin. The pivotal role of the orbital angular momentum makes chiral materials an ideal candidate for orbitronics applications.








Abstract
Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and manifests in a wide range of phenomena including chemical reactions, biological processes, and quantum transport of electrons. In quantum materials, the chirality of fermions, given by the relative directions between the electron spin and momentum, is connected to the band topology of electronic states. This study shows that in structurally chiral materials like CoSi, the orbital angular momentum (OAM) serves as the main driver of a nontrivial band topology in this new class of unconventional topological semimetals, even when spin&#8208;orbit coupling is negligible. A nontrivial orbital&#8208;momentum locking of multifold chiral fermions in the bulk leads to a pronounced OAM texture of the helicoid Fermi arcs at the surface. The study highlights the pivotal role of the orbital degree of freedom for the chirality and topology of electron states, in general, and paves the way towards the application of topological chiral semimetals in orbitronic&#160;devices.

         <title>Observation of Conductive Interstitial Ga Line Defects in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using near&#8208;field infrared and atomic&#8208;resolution transmission electron imaging, a novel phenomenon is observed: the presence of conductive interstitial Ga line defects within &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanoflakes. These defects lead to an associated increase in conductivity, which in turn results in a broadband infrared response and the quenching of cathodoluminescence. Functioning as an antenna, these defects can excite phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride cladding layers, offering exciting prospects for applications in nanophotonic devices.








Abstract
Beta&#8208;phase gallium sesquioxide (&#946;&#8208;Ga2O3), possessing an ultrawide bandgap and high breakdown voltage, exhibits strong potential for deep&#8208;ultraviolet photodetection and high&#8208;power electronics. However, nanometer&#8208;scale line defects, prevalent in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 growth, degrade device performance by increasing leakage currents and reducing breakdown voltages, thus termed &#8220;killer defects&#8221;. Critically, the impact of these defects at the atomic scale remains unclear due to limited characterization and a lack of detailed understanding. Here, the observation of novel conductive atomic line defects is reported within &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanoflakes using near&#8208;field infrared imaging. Combining atomic&#8208;resolution imaging with density functional theory calculations, these defects are identified as interstitial Ga atoms migrating along the c&#8208;axis. These atomic line defects exhibit a broadband infrared response and quenched cathodoluminescence, indicative of significantly enhanced local conductivity. This elevated conductivity enables subsurface near&#8208;field detection of the defects and remote excitation of phonon polaritons in a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) capping layer. These findings underscore the distinct conductivity of atomic&#8208;scale line defects, emphasizing the need for their controlled management during material synthesis and device fabrication, while simultaneously suggesting opportunities for their exploitation in nanophotonic applications.

         <title>Nanoscale Inhomogeneity and Epitaxial Strain Control Metallicity in Single Crystalline Thin Films of High Entropy Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the complex interplay between local structure and physical properties is a key challenge in high entropy oxide (HEO) research, particularly concerning electronic transport. This work demonstrates the profound influence of local chemical inhomogeneity and underlying epitaxial strain on the electronic transport properties of HEO thin film with perovskite structure, paving pathways to tailor electronic properties in high&#8208;entropy regime.








Abstract
Understanding the electronic transport properties of thin films of high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO), having multiple elements at the same crystallographic site, is crucial for their potential electronic applications. However, very little is known about the metallic phase of HEOs even in bulk form. This work delves into the interplay between global and local structural distortion and electronic properties of single crystalline thin films of (La0.2Pr0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2Eu0.2)NiO3, which exhibit metal&#8208;insulator transition under tensile strain. Employing electron microscopy and elemental resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy, we provide direct evidence of nanoscale chemical inhomogeneities at the rare&#8208;earth site, leading to a broad distribution of Ni&#8211;O&#8211;Ni bond angles. However, the octahedral rotation pattern remains the same throughout. The metallic phase consists of insulating patches with more distorted Ni&#8211;O&#8211;Ni bond angles, responsible for higher resistance exponents with increased compositional complexity. Moreover, a rare, fully metallic state of HEO thin film is achieved under compressive strain. We further demonstrate a direct correlation between the suppression of the insulating behavior and increased electronic hopping. Our findings provide a foundation for exploring Mott&#8208;Anderson electron localization physics in the high&#8208;entropy&#160;regime.

         <title>Hybrid Lipoplex Boosts Neuron&#8208;Microglia Crosstalk for Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease through A&#946;&#8208;Targeted&#8208;Autophagy and ApoE2 Gene Supplementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid lipoplex (RMC/pApoE2) composed of guanidine&#8208;rich lipids (metformin&#8208;inspired MLS and arginine&#8208;contained RLS), oleic acid&#8208;modified cerium dioxide (OA@CeO2), and pApoE2 restores neuron&#8208;microglia crosstalk to eliminate A&#946; deposits from temporal and spatial multidimensions. It induces neuronal and microglial autophagy at the upstream and downstream of A&#946; metabolism, along with enhanced pApoE2 transfection for intra&#8208; and extra&#8208;cellular elimination of A&#946; aggregates.








Abstract
Efficient clearance of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) is vital but challenging in Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment due to its complicated regulation mechanisms during generation and metabolism. It necessitates a multidimensional synergistic strategy based on ingenious delivery system design. Herein, guanidine&#8208;rich lipids (metformin&#8208;inspired MLS and arginine&#8208;contained RLS) are devised to trigger selective chaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy for amyloid precursor protein degradation in neurons. They are further co&#8208;assembled with oleic acid&#8208;modified cerium dioxide (OA@CeO2) to form RMC assembly for pApoE2 delivery (RMC/pApoE2 lipoplex). The OA@CeO2 boosts macro&#8208;autophagy, alleviates oxidative stress and inflammatory microenvironment, and promotes the neurons&#8208;microglia crosstalk for A&#946; elimination. Concurrently, both guanidine&#8208;rich lipids and OA@CeO2 benefit pApoE2 transfection in neurons, enabling the transport of A&#946; into microglia, and facilitating enzymatic hydrolysis and cellular digestion of extracellular A&#946;. The lipoplex&#8208;boosted neuron&#8211;microglia interactions ultimately eliminate both intra&#8208; and extra&#8208;cellular A&#946; aggregates. Consequently, the RMC/pApoE2 lipoplex eliminates &#8776;86.9% of A&#946; plaques in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice and restored the synaptic function and neuronal connectivity. Moreover, it recovers the spatial memory of APP/PS1 mice to nearly the level of WT control. The presented hybrid lipoplex showcases an advanced gene delivery system, and offers a promising strategy for A&#946; clearance in AD treatment.

         <title>Phosphatidylcholine Liposome Accelerated Platinum Nanomachines (PLANEs) With Enhanced Penetration Capability for Thrombus Mechanotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposome coating strategy for nanomotors. The isotropic and lubricating PC liposome enhances the linear motion and reduces friction of platinum nanomotors, improving their performance in complex physiological environments. Besides enabling non&#8208;pharmacological thrombolysis, this approach can refine nanomotor delivery systems and boost drug therapy effectiveness.








Abstract
Thrombotic cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide. However, current thrombolytic therapeutics suffer from limited efficacy and a high risk of severe bleeding. Here, a phosphatidylcholine liposome accelerated platinum nanomachine (PLANE) for thrombus mechanotherapy is designed, constructed by encapsulating platinum nanomotors within isotropic, lubricating phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes. The precisely engineered PLANE exhibits superior lubricity and linear motion. Under laser irradiation and hydrogen peroxide treatment, PLANEs achieve significantly higher velocities than conventional platinum nanomotors, facilitating deep penetration into the thrombi. Further functionalization with thrombus&#8208;targeting peptides enables the cPLANEs to selectively accumulate at the thrombotic sites in vivo, demonstrating excellent thrombolytic efficacy. This work presents a novel surface modification strategy for optimizing the motion behavior of platinum nanomotors, offering a promising non&#8208;pharmaceutic approach for thrombotic disease treatment.

         <title>Enhanced Polariton Interactions in Suspended WS2 Monolayer Microcavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayers of transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides exhibit strong exciton resonances for light&#8208;matter interactions at RT, though substrate effects limit performance. This work presents a planar microcavity with a suspended WS2 monolayer, eliminating substrate&#8208;induced losses. The system shows enhancement of strong coupling and preserves the spin&#8208;dependent polaritonic interactions, achieving a record exciton interaction constant close to theoretical predictions. This approach reveals the intrinsic optical and spintronic properties of 2D materials, paving the way for advanced polaritonic.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides monolayers exhibit strong exciton resonances that enable intense light&#8208;matter interactions. The sensitivity of these materials to the surrounding environment and their interactions with the substrate result in the enhancement of excitonic losses through scattering, dissociation and defects formation, hindering their full potential for the excitation of optical nonlinearities in exciton&#8208;polariton platforms. The use of suspended monolayers holds the potential to completely eliminate substrate&#8208;induced losses, offering unique advantages for the exploitation of intrinsic electronic, mechanical, and optical properties of 2D materials&#8208;based polaritonic systems, without any influence of proximity effects. In this work, we report a novel fabrication approach enabling the realization of a planar microcavity filled with a suspended tungsten disulfide (WS2) monolayer in its center. We experimentally demonstrate a 2&#8208;fold enhancement of the strong coupling at room temperature, due to the larger exciton binding energy and reduced overall losses as compared to similar systems based on dielectric&#8208;filled microcavities. As a result, spin&#8208;dependent polaritonic interactions are significantly amplified, leading to achievement of a record exciton interaction constant approaching the theoretically predicted value. This approach holds promises for pushing 2D materials&#8208;based polaritonic systems to their intrinsic limits, paving the way for the realization of novel polaritonic devices with superior performance.

         <title>Rational Ligand Design of Conjugated Coordination Polymers for Efficient and Selective Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated coordination polymer (CoN4&#8208;pyrr) of single&#8208;atom cobalt coordinated with the nitrogen atom of pyrrole ligand can work as an electrocatalyst for efficient and selective nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NH3), where a fast transfer of hydrogen (*H) radicals is induced to accelerate the hydrogenation kinetics of *NO intermediate on the cobalt active site of CoN4&#8208;pyrr at the rate&#8208;determining step.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NRA) offers an attractive route for converting nitrate pollutants to ammonia under mild conditions. Among other catalysts, single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with high metal&#8208;atom&#8208;utilization efficiency and low&#8208;coordinated metal sites hold immense potential to be extensively applied, which unfortunately encounter a formidable challenge to obtain simultaneous improvement of NRA activity and selectivity. Here, a novel and general strategy is reported to achieve efficient and selective NRA catalysis on conjugated coordination polymers featuring with high&#8208;density and well&#8208;defined nitrogen (N)&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom metal sites via precise regulation of N&#8209;heterocyclic ligands toward accelerating the hydrogenation kinetics necessitated in the NRA pathway. Taking cobalt (Co) as an example, two CoN4&#8208;centered conjugated coordination polymer electrocatalysts (CoN4&#8208;pyrr and CoN4&#8208;pyri) are synthesized with pyrrole and pyridine ligands are investigated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. As revealed, the CoN4&#8208;pyrr can markedly outperform the CoN4&#8208;pyri toward NRA electrocatalysis. Experimental and theoretical results suggest that, relative to the N atoms of pyridine ligand in CoN4&#8208;pyri, the N atoms of pyrrole ligand in CoN4&#8208;pyrr can enable a faster transfer of hydrogen radicals to the Co active sites for accelerating the hydrogenation kinetics of *NO intermediate at the rate&#8208;determining step of NRA pathway.

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Tunable Time&#8208;Dependent Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Self&#8208;Protective Carbonized Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color tunable time&#8208;dependent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) is achieved via a self&#8208;doping strategy for simultaneous modulation of their carbon core N&#8208;related and surface oxygen&#8208;related emissive centers. The broad emission color, long lifetime, and excellent luminescence stability of these dynamic afterglow materials promote their practical applications in multimodal anti&#8208;counterfeiting and advanced dynamic information encryption, as well as time&#8208;delay light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs).








Abstract
Achieving full&#8208;color time&#8208;dependent tunable phosphorescence (TDTP) in pure organic materials remains a significant challenge due to the nonradiative transition and modulation puzzle of triplet states. Herein, full&#8208;color TDTP has been realized in self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) under ambient conditions using a self&#8208;doping strategy. These CPDs are generated with dual emission centers of the high&#8208;energy N&#8208;related triplet state and the low&#8208;energy surface oxide triplet state, which are responsible for the slow&#8208;decaying blue afterglow (453&#160;nm) and the fast&#8208;decaying green to red afterglow (513&#8211;609&#160;nm), respectively. These luminescent centers can be activated simultaneously upon CPD aggregation due to the generated rigid networks by intra/intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;band interactions. The detailed experimental characterization and theoretical calculation confirm that the red&#8208;shifted afterglow color is attributed to a gradual reduction of their energy levels with the increasing surface C&#9552;O content and aggregation degree of CPDs. Thus, these matrix&#8208;free CPDs exhibit dynamic TDTP colors over the entire visible spectrum in the solid state after turning off 365&#160;nm UV light. Based on their unusual phosphorescent properties and excellent photostability, these CPDs have been tested for various applications such as multidimensional dynamic information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting, as well as time&#8208;delayed light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs).

         <title>Upcycling Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Constructing Bifunctional Catalysts Featuring Long&#8208;Range Order and Short&#8208;Range Disorder for Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, for the first time, an interesting strategy is proposed for upcycling Ni, Co, and Mn valuable metals from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries into a bifunctional catalyst for lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries by a rapid Joule&#8208;heated thermal shock method. This is a well&#8208;defined catalyst combining both features of long&#8208;range order L12 face&#8208;centered cubic structure and short&#8208;range disorder in M sites. Benefiting from the unique atomic arrangement, the long&#8208;range order L12 structure significantly enhances the long&#8208;term stability of the catalyst, while the short&#8208;range disorder character of the M site triggers the cocktail effect and further activates the Pt catalytic kinetics. Experiments and theoretical results disclose that the local coordination environment and electronic distribution of Pt are both fundamentally modulated via surrounding disordered Ni, Co, and Mn atoms, which greatly optimize the affinity toward oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and facilitate the deposition/decomposition kinetics of the thin&#8208;film Li2O2 discharge products. This distinctly lowers both the energy barriers of the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Upcycling of high&#8208;value metals (M = Ni, Co, Mn) from spent ternary lithium&#8208;ion batteries to the field of lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries is highly appealing, yet remains a huge challenge. In particular, the alloying of the recovered M components with Pt and applied as cathode catalysts have not yet been reported. Herein, a fresh L12&#8208;type Pt3&#160;M medium&#8208;entropy intermetallic nanoparticle is first proposed, confined on N&#8208;doped carbon matrix (L12&#8208;Pt3(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)@N&#8208;C) based on spent 111 typed LiNi1&#8208;x&#8208;yMnxCoyO2 cathode. This well&#8208;defined catalyst combines both features of long&#8208;range order L12 face&#8208;centered cubic structure and short&#8208;range disorder in M sites. The former contributes to enhancing the structural stability, and the latter further facilitates deeply activating the catalytic activity of Pt sites. Experiments and theoretical results demonstrate that the local coordination environment and electronic distribution of Pt are both fundamentally modulated via surrounding disordered Ni, Co, and Mn atoms, which greatly optimize the affinity toward oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and facilitate the deposition/decomposition kinetics of the thin&#8208;film Li2O2 discharge products. Specifically, the L12&#8208;Pt3(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)@N&#8208;C catalyst exhibits an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 0.48&#160;V and achieves 220 cycles at 400&#160;mA g&#8722;1 under 1000 mAh g&#8722;1. The work provides important insights for the recycling of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries into advanced catalyst&#8208;related applications.

Herein, a fresh L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-type Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;M medium-entropy intermetallic nanoparticle is first proposed, confined on N-doped carbon matrix (L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(Ni&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;)@N-C) based on spent 111 typed LiNi&lt;sub&gt;1-x-y&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode. This well-defined catalyst combines both features of long-range order L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; face-centered cubic structure and short-range disorder in M sites. The former contributes to enhancing the structural stability, and the latter further facilitates deeply activating the catalytic activity of Pt sites. Experiments and theoretical results demonstrate that the local coordination environment and electronic distribution of Pt are both fundamentally modulated via surrounding disordered Ni, Co, and Mn atoms, which greatly optimize the affinity toward oxygen-containing intermediates and facilitate the deposition/decomposition kinetics of the thin-film Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; discharge products. Specifically, the L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(Ni&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1/3)&lt;/sub&gt;@N-C catalyst exhibits an ultra-low overpotential of 0.48&#160;V and achieves 220 cycles at 400&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under 1000 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The work provides important insights for the recycling of spent lithium-ion batteries into advanced catalyst-related applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superhigh Magnetostriction in Non&#8208;Equilibrium Grown Fe&#8208;Ga Single&#8208;Crystals by Rapid&#8208;Directional&#8208;Solidification</title>

         <dc:description>
An innovative strategy of rapid&#8208;directional&#8208;solidification is developed to unexpectedly grow non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystals of Fe&#8208;Ga magnetostrictive material with the supersaturation of Tb, leading to an unprecedentedly giant magnetostriction of 489&#160;ppm in bulk Fe&#8208;Ga single&#8208;crystals. This study paves the way for realizing revolutionary material performance by innovating the concept and fabrication method of non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystals.








Abstract
The non&#8208;equilibrium microstructure characterized by Tb supersaturation within Fe&#8208;Ga single&#8208;crystals is deduced to induce a substantial enhancement in magnetostriction. However, the growth of the non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystal remains a formidable obstacle, as existing methods can only produce either non&#8208;equilibrium polycrystal or near&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystal, leading to the stagnation in magnetostriction. Herein, a rapid&#8208;directional&#8208;solidification (RDS) strategy is devised to grow non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystals. The RDS is realized through achieving an ultrahigh temperature gradient of &#8776;106 K&#160;m&#8722;1 at S&#8208;L interface front, accompanied by an ultrafast growth velocity. This results in single&#8208;crystal growth under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions with a giant cooling rate of 102&#8211;103 K&#160;s&#8722;1, which is &#8776;1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude greater than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of directional&#8208;solidification methods. A non&#8208;equilibrium Fe&#8208;Ga single&#8208;crystal, featured with traces of Tb supersaturation, is successfully grown with a significantly enhanced magnetostriction of 489&#160;ppm. This magnitude of magnetostriction sets a record in bulk Fe&#8208;Ga materials, surpassing the maximum value reported for Fe&#8208;Ga single&#8208;crystals by 60%. The advent of RDS strategy opens an avenue for fabricating non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystals with revolutionary performance, and paves the way for fabricating currently unattainable single&#8208;crystals for engineering applications.

         <title>Hybrid Additive Manufacturing of Shear&#8208;Stiffening Elastomer Composites for Enhanced Mechanical Properties and Intelligent Wearable Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve anisotropic structural design of shear stiffening materials, a novel hybrid additive manufacturing strategy is proposed to create a lattice&#8208;structured soft&#8208;hard phase elastomer composite (TPR&#8208;SSE composite) with enhanced mechanical properties. Based on this, an intelligent sports shoe is developed, demonstrating the potential application of the TPR&#8208;SSE composite material in wearable smart protective equipment.








Abstract
Shear&#8208;stiffening materials, renowned for their rate&#8208;dependent behavior, hold immense potential for impact&#8208;resistant applications but are often constrained by limited load&#8208;bearing capacity under extreme conditions. In this study, a novel hybrid additive manufacturing strategy that successfully achieves anisotropic structural design of shear&#8208;stiffening materials is proposed. In this strategy, fused deposition modeling (FDM) is synergistically combined with direct ink writing (DIW) to fabricate lattice&#8208;structured soft&#8208;hard phase elastomer composites (TPR&#8208;SSE composites) with enhanced mechanical properties. Through quasistatic characterization and dynamic impact experiments, complemented by noncontact optical measurement and finite element simulation, the mechanical enhancement mechanisms imparted by the lattice architecture are systematically uncovered. The resulting composites exhibit exceptional load&#8208;bearing capacity under quasistatic conditions and superior energy dissipation under dynamic impacts, making them ideal for advanced protective systems. Building on this, smart sports shoes featuring a deep&#8208;learning&#8208;based smart sensing module that integrates structural customizability, buffering capacity, and gait recognition, are developed. This work provides a transformative structure design approach to shear&#8208;stiffening materials systems, paving the way for next&#8208;generation intelligent wearable protection applications.

         <title>Enabling High Reversibility of Both Cationic and Anionic Redox in Layered Oxide Cathodes via NiMn6 Superlattice Topology for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The layered oxide cathode material (NNLMO) with the LiMn6 and NiMn6 dual&#8208;topology superlattice is constructed for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, realizing the reversible cationic and anionic redox. The Ni2+ electronic configuration serves as a redox buffer to tune the redox activity, while the NiMn6 topology provides topological protection to reinforce the superstructure stability.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage oxygen anionic redox provides a transformative opportunity to achieve high energy density of batteries. However, it is challenging to guarantee the reversibility of both cationic and anionic redox for layered transition metal (TM) oxide cathode materials due to the high oxygen&#8208;redox reactivity and the complex structural rearrangements. Herein, a honeycomb&#8208;layered Na0.78Ni0.12Li0.18Mn0.7O2 (NNLMO) cathode material with the NiMn6 and LiMn6 dual&#8208;topology superlattice is proposed for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the Ni2+ electronic configuration serves as a redox buffer to tune the cationic and anionic redox activity by enlarging the energy gap between O 2p and Mn 3d orbitals, while the NiMn6 topology renders the LiMn6 topology delocalized in the TM layers to reinforce the superstructure stability through suppressing the intralayer Mn migration and O2 formation. As a result, NNLMO delivers a highly reversible capacity of 224 mAh g&#8722;1 with the mitigated voltage hysteresis and exhibits remarkable capacity retention of 92.2% over 50 cycles within the wide voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5&#160;V. The findings suggest a new insight into the topological superstructure design of high&#8208;energy oxide cathode materials for sustainable batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Integrated Micro&#8208;Vortex Air Filter Enabled With Honeycomb&#8208;Like Structured Nanofibrous Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cellular cell micro&#8208;vortex air filter constructed by 3D honeycomb&#8208;like structured nano&#8208;networks is created by a unique electro&#8208;netting&#8208;assembly technique. Due to the micro&#8208;vortex cascade filtration mode of cellular cells, 3D porous cell walls (average pore size &#8776;410 nm) consisting of nano&#8208;scaled fibers (diameter 45 nm), enhanced air slip effect, our filters achieve high&#8208;efficiency and low&#8208;resistance PM0.3 removal, desirable dust holding capacity and remarkable biodegradibility.








Abstract
Particulate matter (PM) pollution has posed a serious threat to public health, especially with the outbreak of respiratory infections. However, most existing fiber filters face an inevitable trade&#8208;off between removal efficiency and air resistance, due to their thick fibers and uncontrolled flat stacking structure. Herein, a unique high&#8208;performance integrated micro&#8208;vortex filter is created using honeycomb&#8208;like structured cellular nanofibrous networks via the innovative electro&#8208;netting&#8208;assembly nanotechnique for air filtration. Manipulation of the ejection, deformation, and self&#8208;assembly of the charged droplets from the Taylor cone enables the one&#8208;step construction of 3D cellular cells with 2D nano architectured networks consisted of 1D nanowires with a diameter of &#8776;45&#160;nm on a large&#8208;scale. The resultant micro&#8208;vortex air filter, functioned as an integrated filter system, achieved a remarkable air slip effect and striking micro&#8208;vortex cascade filtration mode, showing &gt;99.97% PM0.3 removal, &#8776;0.12% atmosphere pressure of air resistance, 27&#160;g m&#8722;2 dust holding, along with robust mechanical stability.

     alt="High-Performance Integrated Micro-Vortex Air Filter Enabled With Honeycomb-Like Structured Nanofibrous Networks"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cellular cell micro-vortex air filter constructed by 3D honeycomb-like structured nano-networks is created by a unique electro-netting-assembly technique. Due to the micro-vortex cascade filtration mode of cellular cells, 3D porous cell walls (average pore size &#8776;410 nm) consisting of nano-scaled fibers (diameter 45 nm), enhanced air slip effect, our filters achieve high-efficiency and low-resistance PM&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt; removal, desirable dust holding capacity and remarkable biodegradibility.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particulate matter (PM) pollution has posed a serious threat to public health, especially with the outbreak of respiratory infections. However, most existing fiber filters face an inevitable trade-off between removal efficiency and air resistance, due to their thick fibers and uncontrolled flat stacking structure. Herein, a unique high-performance integrated micro-vortex filter is created using honeycomb-like structured cellular nanofibrous networks via the innovative electro-netting-assembly nanotechnique for air filtration. Manipulation of the ejection, deformation, and self-assembly of the charged droplets from the Taylor cone enables the one-step construction of 3D cellular cells with 2D nano architectured networks consisted of 1D nanowires with a diameter of &#8776;45&#160;nm on a large-scale. The resultant micro-vortex air filter, functioned as an integrated filter system, achieved a remarkable air slip effect and striking micro-vortex cascade filtration mode, showing &amp;gt;99.97% PM&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt; removal, &#8776;0.12% atmosphere pressure of air resistance, 27&#160;g m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; dust holding, along with robust mechanical stability. This work may provide a promising avenue for the design and development of novel separation and purification materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Relaxor Antiferroelectric Dynamics for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel 2D relaxor antiferroelectric (AFE) material CuBiP2Se6 (CBPS)&#160;showcases unique AFE and optoelectronic properties. These properties enable CBPS devices to mimic synaptic plasticity through reversible polarization switching under electrical stimuli. Moreover, they can replicate key characteristics of biological synapses in response to optical stimuli, paving the way for in&#8208;sensor computing applications such as image restoration.








Abstract
Relaxor antiferroelectric (AFE) materials display a gradual polarization response and high energy storage density with polarization slowly reverting after removing an external field. This distinctive polarization&#8208;switching behavior closely resembles synaptic plasticity in biological nervous systems, presenting substantial potential for neuromorphic computing applications. Especially, its 2D scenario exhibits unique physical properties and maintains stability at atomic thickness due to their antipolar alignment, which effectively eliminates the depolarization field effect. Such stable 2D relaxor AFE materials offer significant advantages for integrating these materials into modern electronic devices for neuromorphic computing. In this study, the potential of a novel quaternary layered AFE material, CuBiP&#8322;Se&#8326; (CBPS), is explored for neuromorphic device applications. CBPS exhibits a broad range of light absorption and stable relaxor AFE behavior, rendering it an outstanding candidate for optoelectronic synaptic devices. High&#8208;quality CBPS is synthesized and its AFE properties through various characterization techniques are verified. CBPS&#8208;based synaptic devices demonstrate dual&#8208;mode tunable resistance plasticity stimulated by both electrical and optical inputs, demonstrating the capacity to perform in&#8208;sensor computing for image restoration tasks. These findings suggest that relaxor AFE materials like CBPS could provide a robust platform for various brain&#8208;inspired applications, particularly in neuromorphic computing, and artificial visual systems.

         <title>Neuromorphic Transistors Integrating Photo&#8208;Sensor, Optical Memory and Visual Synapses for Artificial Vision Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a neuromorphic transistor integrating sensing, memory, and computing in one device to address the challenges of commercial artificial vision system. By varying top gate voltages, it can operate as an ultrasensitive photo&#8208;sensor (&#8776;6.515 kA W&#8722;1), a non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;level optical memory (&gt;4 bits), and a neuromorphic visual synapse with 95.26% image recognition accuracy by combing artificial neural network model.








Abstract
In commercial artificial vision system (AVS), the sensing, storage, and computing units are usually physically separated due to their architecture and performance gaps, which thus increases the volume, complexity, and energy loss. This work develops a neuromorphic transistor integrating these different modules within one single device. Leveraging the gate&#8208;tunable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electric field, the device achieves the multi&#8208;mode integration of photo&#8208;sensor, optical memory, and visual synapse. When operating at negative top gate voltage (VTG), a strong photo&#8208;gating effect enables highly sensitive photo&#8208;response with responsivity of &#8776;6.515 kA W&#8722;1 and detectivity up to &#8776;3.92 &#215; 1014 Jones. Due to the charge storage effect, it can also act as a non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;level (&gt;4 bits) optical memory with a long endurance of over 10&#160;000 s and a high writing/erasing ratio of up to 106. At zero or positive VTG, the transistor switches to visual synapse mode with neuromorphic computing capability, providing a pathway for complex biological learning and flexible synaptic plasticity. By further combining the synaptic plasticity with an artificial neural network (ANN), it achieves precise image recognition and classification with an accuracy of up to 95.26%. This work develops a multi&#8208;mode transistor that integrates key components of an AVS, addressing the existing challenges of all&#8208;in&#8208;one integration and manufacturing complexity.

         <title>A Core&#8208;Shell Perovskite Composite Air Electrode With Thermal&#8208;Expansion Offset and Mechanical Support Functions for Highly Durable Reversible Protonic Ceramic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;shell perovskite composite with a highly durable electrochemical activity for oxygen catalysis is developed as an air electrode for reversible protonic ceramic cells (RPCCs) via a unique solid&#8208;state reaction. This work also demonstrates a new pathway to developing highly durable air electrode materials for RPCCs technology, accelerating RPCCs&#8217; commercialization.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic cells (RPCCs) offer a promising pathway to efficient and reversible energy conversion, accelerating the global shift to renewables. However, the RPCCs&#8217; commercialization faces limitations in air electrode materials. Traditional cobalt&#8208;based perovskite air electrodes, while effective, suffer from high cost and environmental concerns. Alternative materials, such as SrFeO3&#8208;&#948; (SF)&#8208;based perovskites, offer potential, yet durability issues, including thermal&#8208;expansion mismatch and mechanical instability, hinder their practical application. Here, a unique solid&#8208;state reaction between SF and negative&#8208;thermal&#8208;expansion (NTE) material is demonstrated to yield a core&#8208;shell perovskite composite as a highly durable RPCCs air electrode. Specifically, by calcining a mixture of SF and an NTE material, ZrW2O8 (ZWO), the in situ incorporation of ZWO into the SF lattice is achieved, resulting in a non&#8208;closed core&#8208;shell composite, comprising single perovskite SraFebZrcWdO3&#8208;&#948; (SP&#8208;SFZW) core and B&#8208;site cation ordered double perovskite SrxFeyZrmWnO6&#8208;&#948; (DP&#8208;SFZW) shell. Both SP&#8208;SFZW and DP&#8208;SFZW serve as oxygen catalysts, while DP&#8208;SFZW shell additionally acts as a thermal expansion suppressor and mechanical support structure, effectively mitigating electrode cracking and delamination from other cell components during RPCC operation. Consequently, the composite electrode demonstrates comparable catalytic activity to SF, coupled with significantly enhanced durability. This work illustrates a novel approach for developing robust RPCCs air electrode.

         <title>Toward Switching and Fusing Neuromorphic Computing: Vertical Bulk Heterojunction Transistors with Multi&#8208;Neuromorphic Functions for Efficient Deep Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zou et al propose a novel vertical bulk heterojunction neuromorphic transistor, integrating three functions of the synapse, artificial spiking neuron, and artificial self&#8208;activation neuron for the first time. By simply changing the program, it can switch between spiking neurons and self&#8208;activating neurons, which effectively facilitates seamless switching and fusion computation of artificial neural networks and spiking neural networks.








Abstract
The combination of artificial neural networks (ANN) and spiking neural networks (SNN) holds great promise for advancing artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, the reported ANN and SNN computational architectures are independent and require a large number of auxiliary circuits and external algorithms for fusion training. Here, a novel vertical bulk heterojunction neuromorphic transistor (VHNT) capable of emulating both ANN and SNN computational functions is presented. TaOx&#8208;based electrochemical reactions and PDVT&#8208;10/N2200&#8208;based bulk heterojunctions are used to realize spike coding and voltage coding, respectively. Notably, the device exhibits remarkable efficiency, consuming a mere 0.84 nJ of energy consumption for a single multiply accumulate (MAC) operation with excellent linearity. Moreover, the device can be switched to spiking neuron and self&#8208;activation neuron by simply changing the programming without auxiliary circuits. Finally, the VHNT&#8208;based artificial spiking neural network (ASNN) fusion simulation architecture is demonstrated, achieving 95% accuracy for Canadian&#8208;Institute&#8208;For&#8208;Advanced&#8208;ResearchResearch&#8208;10 (CIFARResearch&#8208;10) dataset while significantly enhancing training speed and efficiency. This work proposes a novel device strategy for developing high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;power, and environmentally adaptive AGI.

     alt="Toward Switching and Fusing Neuromorphic Computing: Vertical Bulk Heterojunction Transistors with Multi-Neuromorphic Functions for Efficient Deep Learning"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zou et al propose a novel vertical bulk heterojunction neuromorphic transistor, integrating three functions of the synapse, artificial spiking neuron, and artificial self-activation neuron for the first time. By simply changing the program, it can switch between spiking neurons and self-activating neurons, which effectively facilitates seamless switching and fusion computation of artificial neural networks and spiking neural networks.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of artificial neural networks (ANN) and spiking neural networks (SNN) holds great promise for advancing artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, the reported ANN and SNN computational architectures are independent and require a large number of auxiliary circuits and external algorithms for fusion training. Here, a novel vertical bulk heterojunction neuromorphic transistor (VHNT) capable of emulating both ANN and SNN computational functions is presented. TaO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-based electrochemical reactions and PDVT-10/N2200-based bulk heterojunctions are used to realize spike coding and voltage coding, respectively. Notably, the device exhibits remarkable efficiency, consuming a mere 0.84 nJ of energy consumption for a single multiply accumulate (MAC) operation with excellent linearity. Moreover, the device can be switched to spiking neuron and self-activation neuron by simply changing the programming without auxiliary circuits. Finally, the VHNT-based artificial spiking neural network (ASNN) fusion simulation architecture is demonstrated, achieving 95% accuracy for Canadian-Institute-For-Advanced-ResearchResearch-10 (CIFARResearch-10) dataset while significantly enhancing training speed and efficiency. This work proposes a novel device strategy for developing high-performance, low-power, and environmentally adaptive AGI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Lead&#8208;Free Ceramics With Simultaneously High Piezoelectricity and High Mechanical Quality Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric materials with high piezoelectric coefficient (d33) and high mechanical quality factor (Qm) are critical for advanced high&#8208;power applications. However, achieving this combination is challenging due to the inherent trade&#8208;off between d33 and Qm. This work reports a novel strategy involving the introduction of defect dipoles into quadruple point compositions to break the conventional trade&#8208;off and simultaneously enhance d33 to 710 pC/N and Qm to 929 in designed lead&#8208;free piezoelectric materials.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials with a high piezoelectric coefficient (d33) and high mechanical quality factor (Qm) are vital for advanced high&#8208;power applications. However, achieving this combination is challenging, particularly for lead&#8208;free piezoelectrics, because a high d33 value relies on mobile domain walls, which increase dissipative losses and reduce Qm. In this study, this longstanding trade&#8208;off is overcome by introducing defect dipoles (via Mn doping) into the quadruple point (QP) composition of the lead&#8208;free Ba(Sn, Ti)O3 system. The resultant 0.5%Mn&#8208;doped Ba(Sn0.11Ti0.89)O3 (BST&#8208;0.5%Mn) ceramic exhibits a high d33 value of 710 pC/N and high Qm value of 929, while the BST&#8208;1%Mn ceramic achieves a d33 value of 614 pC/N and Qm value of 1138. These values represent a 10&#8208;fold increase in Qm and 1.6&#8208;fold increase in d33 for BST&#8208;0.5%Mn, compared to those for undoped BST. High&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and phase&#8208;field simulations reveal that the enhanced d33 and Qm are attributable to the coexistence of multiple phases of QPs with symmetry&#8208;conforming defect dipoles, challenging the long&#8208;held notion of physical incompatibility between high d33 and high Qm. These findings offer a pathway for designing eco&#8208;friendly piezoelectric materials with unprecedented performance, paving the way for sustainable and efficient high&#8208;power applications.

         <title>Structured Light Projection Using Image Guide Fibers for In Situ Photo&#8208;biofabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;based biofabrication is typically performed with single wavelength light sources and within benchtop devices. This work demonstrates FaSt&#8208;Light (Fiber&#8208;assisted Structured Light) as a new approach to achieve multiwavelength image projection using flexible image guide fibers, which enables a variety of applications for in situ biofabrication.








Abstract
Light&#8208;based biofabrication techniques have revolutionized the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Specifically, the projection of structured light, where the spatial distribution of light is controlled at both macro and microscale, has enabled precise fabrication of complex three dimensional&#160;structures with high resolution and speed. However, despite tremendous progress, biofabrication processes are mostly limited to benchtop devices which limit the flexibility in terms of where the fabrication can occur. Here, a Fiber&#8208;assisted Structured Light (FaSt&#8208;Light) projection apparatus for rapid in situ crosslinking of photoresins is demonstrated. This approach uses image&#8208;guide fiber bundles which can project bespoke images at multiple wavelengths, enabling flexibility and spatial control of different photoinitiation systems and crosslinking chemistries and also the location of fabrication. Coupling of different sizes of fibers and different lenses attached to the fibers to project small (several mm) or large (several cm) images for material crosslinking is demonstrated. FaSt&#8208;Light allows control over the cross&#8208;section of the crosslinked resins and enables the introduction of microfilaments which can further guide cellular infiltration, differentiation, and anisotropic matrix production. The proposed approach can lead to a new range of in situ biofabrication techniques which improve the translational potential of photofabricated tissues and grafts.

         <title>Deep Learning Empowered Parallelized Metasurface Computed Tomography Snapshot Spectral Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Snapshot spectral imaging faces challenges in miniaturization due to cascading optics. Here, an ultracompact parallelized metasurface tomography spectral imaging system synergized with generative deep learning is presented. Parallel sub&#8208;metasurfaces capture multi&#8208;angle spectral projections, while a trained adversarial network reconstructs spectral images with high resolution in milliseconds. This sub&#8208;mm3&#8208;scale innovation enables endoscopic/microscopic integration, promising to transform real&#8208;time biomedical diagnostics.









Abstract
Snapshot spectral imaging is an emerging technology for fast data acquisition in dynamic environments, capturing high&#8208;volume spatial&#8208;spectral information in a single snapshot. However, it suffers from bulky cascading optics and cannot be directly used in space&#8208;restricted scenarios such as endoscope&#8208;assisted brain microsurgery and real&#8208;time cellular tissue imaging. In this work, an ultracompact strategy of parallelized metasurface computed tomography empowered by generative deep learning is proposed, which can effectively reduce the optics volume in snapshot spectral imaging from cm3 scale to sub&#8208;mm3 scale while retaining high resolution and speed of imaging so that the above&#8208;mentioned pain point problem is well addressed. The system comprises seven multifunctional sub&#8208;metasurfaces simultaneously acquiring multi&#8208;angle spectral projection and integration information of the target, uses the system&#8208;calibrated point spread functions as wavelength and spatial position distributions, and incorporates a generative adversarial deep neural network for fast reconstruction of spatial&#8208;spectral multiplexed images. Experimental results show that single snapshot imaging can be achieved in 38&#160;ms with a spectral resolution of 10&#160;nm in the spectral range of 450&#8211;650&#160;nm. This technique paves the way for snapshot spectral imaging integration into various highly miniaturized microscopy and endoscopic imaging systems in applications such as advanced medical diagnosis.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Voltage Thermal Charging Cells Enabled by Ca&#8211;Li Dual&#8208;Cationic Ionic Liquid Electrolytes and Anionophilic Separators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Practical high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;voltage thermal charging cells, incorporating heat&#8208;resistant Ca&#8211;Li salt, C4mimAOT&#8208;AmimCl co&#8208;solvent, and PEN@ZrBDC&#8208;F&#8208;4% separators, are successfully developed. These advancements are attributed to enhanced energy storage of dual carriers, improved diffusion kinetics facilitated by the AmimCl solvent and optimized carrier mobility enabled by the anionophilic properties of ZrBDC. The research holds significant promise for high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;performance waste heat harvesting.








Abstract
Thermoelectric technologies (TEs) offer immense potential for waste heat recovery and energy storage. However, the practical application of current TEs has been severely hampered by potential performance degradation in extreme environments, particularly at high temperatures, due to electrolyte flammability or poor carrier mobility. The development of high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;performance TEs is crucial for broadening their operational range and enabling diverse applications. Here, practical high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;voltage thermal charging cells (HHTCCs) are reported, facilitated by a heat&#8208;resistant trifluoromethanesulfonate&#8208;based Ca&#8211;Li dual&#8208;cationic ionic liquid electrolyte containing functionalized AmimCl solvent, together with a thermotolerant composite membrane, PEN(polyphenylene&#8208;ether&#8208;nitrile)@ZrBDC&#8208;F&#8208;4%.

&lt;p&gt;Practical high-temperature high-voltage thermal charging cells, incorporating heat-resistant Ca&#8211;Li salt, C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;mimAOT-AmimCl co-solvent, and PEN@ZrBDC-F-4% separators, are successfully developed. These advancements are attributed to enhanced energy storage of dual carriers, improved diffusion kinetics facilitated by the AmimCl solvent and optimized carrier mobility enabled by the anionophilic properties of ZrBDC. The research holds significant promise for high-temperature, high-performance waste heat harvesting.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thermoelectric technologies (TEs) offer immense potential for waste heat recovery and energy storage. However, the practical application of current TEs has been severely hampered by potential performance degradation in extreme environments, particularly at high temperatures, due to electrolyte flammability or poor carrier mobility. The development of high-temperature, high-performance TEs is crucial for broadening their operational range and enabling diverse applications. Here, practical high-temperature high-voltage thermal charging cells (HHTCCs) are reported, facilitated by a heat-resistant trifluoromethanesulfonate-based Ca&#8211;Li dual-cationic ionic liquid electrolyte containing functionalized AmimCl solvent, together with a thermotolerant composite membrane, PEN(polyphenylene-ether-nitrile)@ZrBDC-F-4%. The dual-cation mechanism enables high thermal voltage through cooperative energy storage, while the functionalized AmimCl accelerates the mobility of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions by weakening the surrounding shielding effect. Additionally, the anionophilic ZrBDC-F-4% nanoparticles in the composite membrane enhance carrier migration. As a result, the HHTCCs exhibit an impressive thermal voltage of 1.138 V, a remarkable thermopower of 15.3 mV K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and an outstanding Carnot-relative efficiency of 9.56% over an unprecedented temperature range from 328.15 to 393.15 K, demonstrating the excellent safety and feasibility of HHTCCs. This work expands the service-temperature range of i-TEs, holding significant promise for high-temperature, high-performance waste heat harvesting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strut&#8208;Buckling Transformation Enabling Anomalous Density&#8208;Scaling Toughening Law in Ultralight Lattice Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uncovers an anomalous density&#8208;scaling toughening law in discrete lattices, where ultrahigh&#160;specific fracture toughness can be achieved at ultralow relative density, thereby filling gaps in material property space. This anomalous toughening law stems from crack&#8208;tip blunting triggered by delocalized strut&#8208;buckling transformation at ultralow densities, which is universal across various lattice metamaterials with varying sizes, topologies, and component properties.








Abstract
Lightweight lattice metamaterials attract considerable attention due to their exceptional and tunable mechanical properties. However, their practical application is ultimately limited by their tolerance to inevitable&#160;manufacturing defects. Traditional fracture mechanics of lattice metamaterials are confined to localized tensile failure of a crack&#8208;tip strut, overlooking the toughening effect of buckling instability in discrete struts around the crack front. Here, via a combination of additive manufacturing, numerical simulation, and theoretical analysis, this work identifies an anomalous power scaling law of specific fracture energy with relative density, where the scaling exponent shifts to negative values below a critical relative density. This anomalous toughening law stems from crack&#8208;tip blunting triggered by delocalized strut&#8208;buckling transformation at ultralow densities, which is universal across various lattice metamaterials with varying length scales, crack orientations, node connectivity, and component properties. By strategically harnessing strut buckling mechanisms, exceptionally high specific fracture toughness can be achieved at extremely low relative density, thereby addressing gaps in the material property design space. These findings not only provide physical insights into discrete lattice fracture but also offer design motifs for ultralight, ultra&#8208;tough lattice metamaterials.

         <title>Narrow&#8208;Linewidth Emission and Weak Exciton&#8208;Phonon Coupling in 2D Layered Germanium Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural and photophysical properties of the 2D layered metal halides (4F&#8208;PMA)2GeI4 and (4F&#8208;PMA)2PbI4 are reported. For the Ge composition, reduced exciton&#8208;phonon coupling is found and the absence of bound&#8208;exciton emission, present for the Pb composition. The narrowest reported emission linewidth from a Ge&#8208;based 2D metal halide is measured, to date, suggesting that Ge&#8208;based materials offer a promising, less&#8208;toxic alternative for light&#8208;emitting applications.








Abstract
The photophysical properties of low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide semiconductors and their tunability make them promising candidates for light&#8208;absorbing and emitting applications. Yet, the germanium&#8208;based halide perovskites to date lack desirable light&#8208;emitting properties, with so far only very broad, weak, and unstructured photoluminescence (PL) reported due to significant octahedral distortion. Here, the photophysical properties of the 2D layered Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper semiconductors (4F&#8208;PMA)2GeI4 and (4F&#8208;PMA)2PbI4 (4F&#8208;PMA: 4&#8208;F&#8208;phenylmethylammonium) are characterized and compared. Using a combination of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, variable temperature time&#8208;resolved PL, and density functional theory, structure&#8208;property relations are correlated. Specifically, the results indicate that (4F&#8208;PMA)2PbI4 features stronger coupling to longitudinal optical (LO) phonons, assisting emission from a broad bound&#8208;exciton state due to a soft, deformable lattice. In contrast, (4F&#8208;PMA)2GeI4, benefitting from intermolecular bonding to scaffold a rigid octahedral structure, shows weaker LO&#8208;phonon coupling, resulting in the longest PL lifetime and most narrow linewidth (&#8776;120 meV linewidth at 2 K) reported for a Ge&#8208;halide perovskite yet, without the occurrence of any additional bound&#8208;state emission at low temperatures. These results highlight the potential of germanium halide perovskite materials for optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Inhalable Ce Nanozyme&#8208;Backpacked Phage Aims at Ischemic Cerebral Injury by M1&#8208;Microglia Hitchhiking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study developed a bio&#8208;active, inhalable nanozyme&#8208;backpacked M13 phage (CZM) which specifically delivers to the ischemic core via the olfactory bulb pathway. Leveraging M1&#8208;microglia hitchhiking, CZM accumulates specifically at the lesion site, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) to mitigate neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, providing a safe and effective strategy for the precise treatment of neuroinflammatory disorders.








Abstract
There is a desperate need for precise nanomedications to treat ischemic cerebral injury. Yet, the drawbacks of poor delivery efficiency and off&#8208;target toxicity in pathologic parenchyma for traditional antioxidants against ischemic stroke result in inadequate brain accumulation. M13 bacteriophages are highly phagocytosed by M1&#8208;polarized microglia and can be carried toward the neuroinflammatory sites. Here, a bio&#8208;active, inhalable, Ce0.9Zr0.1O2&#8208;backpacked&#8208;M13 phage (abbreviated as CZM) is developed and demonstrates how M13 bacteriophages are taken up by different phenotypes&#8217; microglia. With the M1 microglia's proliferating and migrating, CZM can be extensively and specifically delivered to the site of the ischemic core and penumbra, where the surviving nerve cells need to be shielded from secondary oxidative stress and inflammatory cascade initiated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). With non&#8208;invasive administration, CZM effectively alleviates oxidative damage and apoptosis of neurons by eliminating ROS generated by hyperactive M1&#8208;polarized microglia. Here, a secure and effective strategy for the targeted therapy of neuroinflammatory maladies is offered by this research.

         <title>Cell Surface&#8208;Tethered Nucleic Acid Therapeutics Program Robust and Tumor&#8208;Responsive Enhancement of Adoptive Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) against solid tumors is limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This study develops cell&#8208;surface&#8208;anchored tumor&#8208;responsive nucleic acid therapeutics (NATs) to arm ACT cells by synergistic blockade of inhibitory pathways. NAT backpacks substantially improve the efficacy of ACT and are broadly applicable to various ACTs involving TCR&#8208;T and CAR&#8208;T cells.








Abstract
The efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) against solid tumors is significantly limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Systemic administration of immunostimulants provides inadequate support to ACT cells and often elicits systemic toxicities. Here we present cell&#8208;surface&#8208;anchored nucleic acid therapeutics (NATs) to robustly enhance ACT through synergistic blockade of immunosuppressive adenosine and PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 pathways in tumors. Two distinct NATs&#8208;DNA aptamers targeting PD&#8208;L1 (aptPD&#8208;L1) and ATP (aptATP)&#8208;are engineered to form partially&#8208;hybridized duplexes (aptDual) that can efficiently anchor to cell surface before transfer. Backpacked aptDual spatial&#8208;temporally co&#8208;localize with ACT cells in vivo and jointly infiltrate the ATP&#8208;rich TME. Upon binding with ATP, aptDual dissociates to responsively release aptPD&#8208;L1. Concurrently, aptATP scavenges extracellular ATP and its metabolite adenosine to disrupt the inhibitory adenosinergic axis, thereby sensitizing ACT cells to immune checkpoint blockade by aptPD&#8208;L1. This dual inhibition elicited a remarkable 40&#8208;fold increase in functional tumor&#8208;infiltrating ACT cells, substantially boosting the efficacy of TCR&#8208;T and CAR&#8208;T cells in multiple solid tumor models, even in immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors.

&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) against solid tumors is limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This study develops cell-surface-anchored tumor-responsive nucleic acid therapeutics (NATs) to arm ACT cells by synergistic blockade of inhibitory pathways. NAT backpacks substantially improve the efficacy of ACT and are broadly applicable to various ACTs involving TCR-T and CAR-T cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) against solid tumors is significantly limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Systemic administration of immunostimulants provides inadequate support to ACT cells and often elicits systemic toxicities. Here we present cell-surface-anchored nucleic acid therapeutics (NATs) to robustly enhance ACT through synergistic blockade of immunosuppressive adenosine and PD-1/PD-L1 pathways in tumors. Two distinct NATs-DNA aptamers targeting PD-L1 (aptPD-L1) and ATP (aptATP)-are engineered to form partially-hybridized duplexes (aptDual) that can efficiently anchor to cell surface before transfer. Backpacked aptDual spatial-temporally co-localize with ACT cells in vivo and jointly infiltrate the ATP-rich TME. Upon binding with ATP, aptDual dissociates to responsively release aptPD-L1. Concurrently, aptATP scavenges extracellular ATP and its metabolite adenosine to disrupt the inhibitory adenosinergic axis, thereby sensitizing ACT cells to immune checkpoint blockade by aptPD-L1. This dual inhibition elicited a remarkable 40-fold increase in functional tumor-infiltrating ACT cells, substantially boosting the efficacy of TCR-T and CAR-T cells in multiple solid tumor models, even in immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors. NAT backpacks provide a facile, versatile, and safe strategy to augment various ACTs against solid tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Optimized Aerogel&#8208;Based Apheresis Device for Targeted Lipid Clearance in Elderly Hyperlipidemia Patients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research introduces an aerogel apheresis device specifically designed for hyperlipidemia management in elderly patients. Leveraging the unique properties of aerogels, LipClean achieves selective lipid adsorption from plasma while maintaining efficiency and biocompatibility. The optimized hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic network ensures effective water permeability and reduces the unintended removal of essential plasma components.








Abstract
Elderly patients with hyperlipidemia often exhibit resistance to conventional hypolipidemic treatments, underscoring the need for more effective strategies to address lipid imbalances in this high&#8208;risk group. This study introduces LipClean, an aerogel&#8208;based apheresis device specifically designed to remove harmful plasma lipids. LipClean is constructed using hydrophilic cellulose fibers, which serve as a supramolecular platform for synthesizing hydrophobic conjugated polymers through a Sonogashira&#8208;Hagihara reaction. These conjugated polymers are then cross&#8208;linked with the cellulose fibers via phosphorylation, generating an aerogel monolith with an interpenetrating network of hydrophilic fibers and hydrophobic polymers. Unlike bilayer aerogels that separate hydrophilic and hydrophobic layers, LipClean's interpenetrating structure is precisely engineered through polymer design and gradient cross&#8208;linking. This optimization enhances both bodily fluid flow and lipid adsorption while minimizing the removal of essential plasma components and ensuring unobstructed cell passage. In preclinical testing, LipClean significantly reduced triglyceride and cholesterol levels in an elderly rat model of hyperlipidemia and normalized lipid levels in blood samples from hypertensive patients. Importantly, purified blood maintained normal levels of blood cells and physiological and biochemical indicators after apheresis, highlighting LipClean's potential for managing hyperlipidemia&#8208;related disorders. This study, therefore, underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in driving medical device innovation.

         <title>Inverse Opal Photonic Crystal Structured Bifacial&#8208;Iridescent Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bifacial&#8208;iridescent solar cell is developed using an inverse opal perovskite photonic crystal. It exhibited unique iridescent structural colors on both sides and achieved an impressive bifacial equivalent efficiency of 18.00% for small cells and 12.77% for mini&#8208;modules.








Abstract
Colorful perovskite solar cells exhibit excellent potential for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs), which increase the utilization of clean power. However, their efficiencies are lower than those of uncolored devices. Moreover, traditional mono&#8208;facial colored devices cannot satisfy diverse BIPV scenarios. Here a bifacial iridescent solar cell (BFI&#8208;SC) is developed,&#160;constructed by inverse opal (IO) perovskite photonic crystals and transparent front and rear electrodes. The developed BFI&#8208;SC exhibited bright vivid colors on both sides, which originate from the reflection at the photonic stop band of the IO perovskite photonic crystal. Moreover, this unique IO photonic crystal decreased the interfacial Fresnel reflection and generated a slow&#8208;photon effect, which increases the material light absorption and utilization to obtain high efficiency. Furthermore, the BFI&#8208;SC can harvest light from both sides, considerably enhancing the device efficiency. Thus, the BFI&#8208;SC achieved an impressive bifacial equivalent efficiency (&#951;eq) of 18.00%, which is the highest value achieved for the reported multicolored (or iridescent) solar cell. A larger&#8208;scale BFI&#8208;SC module is successfully assembled, achieving a champion &#951;eq of 12.77%. In addition, another perovskite material with an IO structure and wide&#8208;bandgap components exhibited vivid colors on both sides, indicating the universality of this coloring strategy and its independence of the perovskite components.

         <title>Electroadhesion Suction Cups</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroadhesion (EA) Suction Cups are electrically operated soft grippers that can pick up a wide range of objects from the top. A soft membrane, driven by electrostatic forces, conforms to surfaces, creating a passive vacuum when lifted. EA suction cups eliminate bulky vacuum systems, offering a compact, efficient, and portable alternative for industrial and service robotics.








Abstract
Suction cups are the light bulbs of robotics and automation. They are simple, reliable, yet energy&#8208;hungry, and require a bulky and noisy vacuum infrastructure. This work reports Electroadhesion (EA) Suction Cups: soft, silent, monolithic, electrically&#8208;driven grippers, with a power consumption of only 1.5&#160;W, that can grasp flat and curved objects, with smooth or rough surfaces, holding payloads up to 1.5&#160;kg. This performance is enabled by a deeper understanding of the contact mechanics of electroadhesion systems. A thin and soft membrane containing interdigitated electrodes zips onto the object driven by electrostatic forces, conforming to the object's shape and thus establishing large&#8208;area contact. The lifting force is transmitted to a robot arm through a small pillar connected at the center of the membrane. This design maximizes the peeling force and enables the formation of passive vacuum inside the conical chamber formed when the membrane stretches during lifting. Object release is obtained by turning off the voltage and optionally by opening a valve to quickly break the vacuum. EA suction cups address many shortcomings of widely used vacuum&#8208;driven grippers, offering a compact, fully electric, and energy&#8208;efficient solution that meets the needs for efficiency and portability in both industrial and service robotics.

         <title>Octopus Tentacle&#8208;Inspired In&#8208;Sensor Adaptive Integral for Edge&#8208;Intelligent Touch Intention Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the octopus cerebellum on its tentacles, a reconfigurable and adaptive intelligent touch sensor is proposed. It epitomizes touch strategic innovation by integrating a geometric progression structure that not only enhances deformability but also embeds an integral in&#8208;sensing mechanism. The work provides ground&#8208;breaking insight into the in&#8208;sensor computing and adaptive structure design strategies for advancing deformable multitouch electronics.








Abstract
Electronics continue to drive technological innovation and diversified applications. To ensure efficiency and effectiveness across various interactive contexts, the ability to adjust operating functions or parameters according to environmental shifts or user requirements is highly desirable. However, due to the inherent limitations of nonadaptive device structures and materials, the current development of touch electronics faces challenges, e.g., limited hardware resources, poor adaptability, weak deformation stability, and bottlenecks in sensing data processing. Here, a reconfigurable and adaptive intelligent (RAI) touch sensor is proposed, inspired by octopus's tentacle cognitive behavior. It realizes remarkable deformability and highly efficient multitouch interactions. The geometric progression structure of the sensing element equips the RAI touch sensor with a unique integrated&#8208;in&#8208;sensing mechanism and programmable logic. This greatly compresses sensing data dimensionality at the edge, yielding concise and undistorted interactive signals. By leveraging the advantages of hard&#8208;soft bonding and interface modulation of functional materials, the adaptability is achieved with a 200% strain range a 180&#176; twist tolerance, and exceptional deformation stability of &gt;10&#160;000 cycles. The diverse application&#8208;specific configurations of the RAI touch sensor, enable a dynamic intention recognition accuracy of over 99%, advancing next&#8208;generation Internet of Things and edge computing research and innovation.

         <title>Modulation of Magnetic Domain and the Occurrence of Antisymmetric Magnetoresistance in the Folded van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new methodology is demonstrated that leverages the flexible nature of van der Waals ferromagnet, specifically employing an origami technique to modulate magnetic domains. A previously rarely observed antisymmetric magnetoresistance effect is detected in folded vdW Fe3GaTe2 devices. The results highlight the potential for fabricating novel spintronic devices based on this origami&#8208;like domain structure engineering method.








Abstract
Emergent magnetism in 2D materials has attracted significant attention due to their intrinsic magnetic order, which persists down to the monolayer limit, and their potential applications in spintronic devices. In particular, domain structure modulation plays a crucial role in 2D magnet&#8208;based nano&#8208;spintronic devices. However, the fabrication and modulation of the desired domain structure, along with the establishment of reliable electrical write/read operations, remain significant challenges. Herein, a unique structure&#8208;shaping way to modulate domain structure is demonstrated via folding a continuous flat Fe3GaTe2 nanosheet. Accompanied by magnetic domain structure transformation, the symmetric butterfly&#8208;shaped magnetoresistance (MR) curve changes to an antisymmetric field&#8208;dependent magnetoresistance. Notably, the MR exhibits either the same or opposite sign at geometrically equivalent positions, depending on the relative angle of the current flow and domain wall direction. The MR behavior with respect to sweeping field and electrodes position is due to the circulating current in the vicinity of the domain wall. More importantly, this new concept of manipulating domain structure and its associated magneto&#8208;transport behavior can inspire novel spintronic devices fabrication and application.

         <title>A Simple Optical Convolution Strategy Based on Versatile Adjustable Optical Convolution Kernel for All&#8208;Optical Convolution Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel optical convolution strategy leveraging continuously adjustable photoluminescent device (CA&#8208;PLD) as convolution kernel is proposed for all&#8208;optical computing. Under ultraviolet illumination, the CA&#8208;PLD array successfully demonstrates parallel and highly efficient multiply&#8208;accumulate operations. The system achieves convolution computing in a non&#8208;von Neumann architecture, exhibiting structural simplicity, high computational efficiency, and powerful image processing and segmentation capabilities.








Abstract
Convolutional neural network (CNN) is currently one of the most important artificial neural networks. However, traditional CNN hardware architectures suffer from significant increases in energy consumption and processing time as the demand for artificial intelligence tasks grows. Here, a novel optical convolution computing strategy is proposed that leverages a continuously adjustable photoluminescent device (CA&#8208;PLD) as the optical convolution kernel, enabling parallel, all&#8208;optical convolution computing and greatly simplifying the traditional convolution process. Under ultraviolet illumination, the CA&#8208;PLD exhibits visible long&#8208;afterglow emission characteristics due to the charge trapping and retention effects. This allows for continuously adjustable light weights, facilitating arbitrary convolution operations. Building on this, parallel and efficient multiply&#8208;accumulate operations have been successfully demonstrated using CA&#8208;PLD arrays with different weight combinations. Moreover, space&#8208;transformable CA&#8208;PLD units enable applications in dilated convolution. In a semantic segmentation task with 20 categories, the CA&#8208;PLD units achieve higher Intersection over Union (IoU) values and accuracy. Therefore, the weight&#8208;adjustable and spatial transformable CA&#8208;PLD proposed in this work holds promise for future applications in intelligent optical computing systems and optical implementations of non&#8208;von Neumann architectures.

         <title>Uniaxiality&#8208;Induced Reduced&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Ultrahard Paracrystalline Diamond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paracrystalline diamond, a new&#8208;type sp3&#8208;bonded non&#8208;crystalline carbon, is synthesized at 16 GPa (vs. 30 GPa in previous reports) via uniaxial stress&#8208;induced collapse of C60 at lower pressures. By integrating experimental and computational insights, this work opens avenues for designing novel materials through controlled stress environments under pressure and offers a strategy for low&#8208;cost high&#8208;pressure material production.








Abstract
Synthesizing fully sp3&#8208;bonded non&#8208;crystalline carbon remains a long&#8208;standing challenge due to the intrinsic instability of the sp3 bond at ambient pressure. Recently, paracrystalline diamond, a new&#8208;form sp3&#8208;bonded non&#8208;crystalline carbon consisting of sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;sized paracrystallites, has been synthesized from face&#8208;centered cubic C60 at 30&#160;GPa, which has attracted attention due to its unique structural features and excellent physical properties. However, the ultrahigh synthesis pressure of paracrystalline diamond poses an obstacle to its large&#8208;scale production and applications. In this study, paracrystalline diamond is synthesized at an exceptionally low pressure (16 GPa) via inducing uniaxiality at high&#8208;pressure and high&#8208;temperature conditions, thereby breaking through the temperature&#8208;pressure phase diagram of C60. By combining structural characteristics and advanced molecular dynamics simulation, the remarkable reduction of synthesis pressure is attributed to the fact that the symmetry of the C60 cage is broken due to the uniaxiality, which further allows the C60 cage to collapse at much lower pressures. This work reveals the critical role of uniaxiality in the reduced&#8208;pressure synthesis of paracrystalline diamond, which may provide a potent methodological strategy for the development of novel low&#8208;cost high&#8208;pressure materials.

         <title>Pressure Induced Molecular&#8208;Arrangement and Charge&#8208;Density Perturbance in Doped Polymer for Intelligent Motion and Vocal Recognitions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sidechain doped polymer is investigated to have great potential for pressure detection due to the advantages including molecular rearrangement and charge&#8208;density perturbance induced by micro&#8208;mechanical deformation. This sensor displayed low&#8208;pressure detection limit of 0.7&#160;Pa as well as a rapid response time of 18.8&#160;ms, enabling multi&#8208;mode motion analysis and intelligent vocal recognitions.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) show great potential for pressure detection due to the amorphous polymer packing, but a lack of clarity regarding sensing mechanisms hampers the development of further applications. Herein, a sacrificial template&#8208;full solution method with both rough surface and high conductivity is described that can be applied to sandwich&#8208;structured resistive pressure sensors. Transient absorption measurements demonstrate the significant increase of carrier lifetime (from 1.44 to 2.54&#160;ns) induced by pressure, which directly evidenced the superior sensing mechanism of sidechain doped conjugated polymer. This sensor displayed low&#8208;pressure detection limit of 0.7&#160;Pa as well as a rapid response time of 18.8&#160;ms, enabling multi&#8208;mode motion analysis including wrist pulse, swallowing, finger bending, grabbing, and typing. Additionally, an intelligent vocal recognition system with convolutional neural networks is used which can achieve &gt;96% classification accuracy across diverse vocal profiles. This general approach is anticipated and enables a new direction for the development of pressure sensors.

         <title>Stable and Ultrasensitive X&#8208;Ray Detectors Based on Oriented Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskite Rods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large high&#8208;quality perovskite FAPbI3 SC single crystal rods (SCRs) with unique orientation are grown using a biomass&#8208;derived green solvent. The oriented FAPbI3 SCR shows high carrier mobility and large bulk resistivity. Therefore, the SC detectors realize record high X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity (2.16 &#215; 105 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging at a low dose rate of 12 nGy s&#8722;1.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;halide perovskite single crystals (SCs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detectors. X&#8208;ray detectors fabricated using perovskite FAPbI3 SCs exhibit high detection sensitivity. However, two pressing issues still need to be addressed for practical applications: the orientation&#8208;controlled growth and environmentally friendly acquisition of high&#8208;quality FAPbI3 SCs. In this study, large high&#8208;quality perovskite FAPbI3 SC rods (SCRs) with unique orientation are grown using a biomass&#8208;derived green solvent. Owing to the high carrier mobility and large bulk resistivity of the oriented FAPbI3 SCRs, the SC detectors realize a record high X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity (2.16 &#215; 105 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and high sensitivity to dark current density ratio (1.93 &#215; 109&#160;Gy&#8722;1 s). Furthermore, the detectors exhibit both ultralow dark and X&#8208;ray current drifts, as well as a detection limit of 2 nGy s&#8722;1. These characteristics enable the detectors to achieve high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging, even at dose rates as low as 12 nGy s&#8722;1. This study not only contributes a new technical solution for low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray detection, but also establishes a new approach for the low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly production of core materials for X&#8208;ray detectors.

The oriented FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; SCR shows high carrier mobility and large bulk resistivity.

&lt;p&gt;Metal-halide perovskite single crystals (SCs) are promising candidates for next-generation X-ray detectors. X-ray detectors fabricated using perovskite FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; SCs exhibit high detection sensitivity.

         <title>Signal Converter&#8208;Based Therapy Platform Promoting Aging Bone Healing by Improving Permeability of the Mitochondrial Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
GelMA microspheres integrated with polydopamine&#8208;coated gold nanorods (GMPG) respond to ultrasound stimulation, converting it into biochemical signals that stimulate senescent bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to highly express HSP70, thereby improving mitochondrial membrane permeability by inhibiting BAX activation, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, and ultimately promoting aging bone regeneration.








Abstract
The aging microenvironment promotes persistent inflammation and loss of intrinsic regenerative capacity. These are major obstacles to effective bone tissue repair in older adults. This study aims to explore how physical thermal stimulation can effectively delay the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) aging process. Based on this, an implantable physical signal&#8208;converter platform is designed as a therapeutic system that enables stable heat signals at the bone injury site under ultrasound stimulation (US). It is found that the therapeutic platform controllably reduces the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization of aging BMSCs, bidirectionally inhibiting mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) leakage. The leakage ratio of mtDNA decreases by 22.7%. This effectively mitigates the activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and its downstream NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling induced by oxidative stress in aging BMSCs, thereby attenuating the pathological advancement of chronic inflammation. Thus, it effectively restores the metabolism and osteogenic differentiation of aging BMSCs in vitro, which is further confirmed in a rat model. In the GMPG/US group, the bone mineral density increases 2&#8211;3 times at 4 weeks in the rats femoral defect model. Therefore, this ultrasound&#8208;based signal&#8208;conversion platform provides a promising strategy for aging bone defect repair.

         <title>A Sprayable Hydrogel Based on Biomimetic Polypeptide&#8208;Modified Lipid Nanoparticles for Treating Non&#8208;Compressible Hemorrhaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a sprayable hydrogel based on polypeptide&#8208;modified lipid nanoparticles (PLNs) mimicking natural hemostasis. PLNs integrate platelet adhesion peptide (GFOGER) and platelet crosslinking peptide (GGQQLK), DSPS, and Ca2&#8314; to activate coagulation. Combined with Ca2&#8314;&#8208;sodium alginate hydrogels, they synergistically enhance rapid clot formation via platelet aggregation, prothrombin activation, and fibrin crosslinking, offering an efficient biomimetic strategy for hemorrhage.








Abstract
Non&#8208;compressible hemorrhaging is the main cause of death in modern warfare. A biomimetic peptide&#8208;modified lipid nanoparticle&#8208;based sprayable hydrogel is developed to mimic and amplify the blood coagulation process for effective hemostasis. A platelet adhesion peptide (PAP, sequence: GFOGER) and platelet crosslinking peptide (PCP, sequence: GGQQLK) are customized and conjugated to 1,2&#8208;distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoethanolamine&#8208;N[methoxy (polyethylene glycol) 2000] acid (DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;COOH) via amido bonds to form DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;PAP and DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;PCP, respectively. These compounds are mixed with distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine, cholesterol, and distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phospho&#8208;L&#8208;serine (DSPS) to construct the peptide&#8208;modified lipid nanoparticles via thin film rehydration. The nanoparticles are incorporated into a CaCl2&#8208;sodium alginate sprayable hydrogel crosslinked via ionic bonds. The application of the hydrogel solution quickly gels and seals the wound. The PAP activates and adheres platelets, the DSPS and Ca2+ amplify prothrombin activation, and PCP strengthens the fibrin network. The hydrogel achieves rapid hemostasis within 30 s in a liver hemorrhage model. This sprayable hydrogel has significant potential for managing non&#8208;compressible hemorrhaging.

         <title>In Situ Secondary Self&#8208;Assembly of Near&#8208;Infrared II J&#8208;Aggregates: A Novel Phototheranostic Strategy for Inducing Tumor Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel near&#8208;infrared II J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;based nanomedicine has been observed to target tumor tissue and achieve effective penetration and prolonged retention in tumor tissue using an in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly strategy. These nanomedicines induce tumor pyroptosis by generating type I reactive oxygen species (superoxide anions), facilitating robust NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and activating tumor photoimmunotherapy.








Abstract
Pyroptosis, a programmed cell death mechanism that bypasses apoptosis resistance and triggers tumor&#8208;specific immune responses, has gained much attention as a promising approach to cancer therapy. Despite enhancing tumor accumulation and extending the circulation of small&#8208;molecule drugs, nanomedicines still face significant challenges, including poor tissue penetration, tumor resistance, and hypoxic microenvironments. To overcome these challenges, a novel near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;based nanomedicine is designed, leveraging an in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly strategy to fabricate highly targeted nanoparticles (MSDP NPs). These nanomedicines trigger pyroptosis by generating type I reactive oxygen species, especially superoxide anions, while simultaneously activating photoimmunotherapy. In vivo studies demonstrate that MSDP NPs achieve efficient tumor penetration and prolong tumor&#160;retention, which is facilitated by the J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;driven formation of microscale spindle&#8208;shaped fibrillar bundles through in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly at the tumor site. This unique structural transformation enhances nanomedicine accumulation in tumor tissues, enabling robust NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and improving therapeutic efficacy even in hypoxic tumor microenvironments. This study provides an innovative phototheranostic strategy that utilizes the in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly of NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates to induce tumor pyroptosis, offering a potential solution to the limitations of current nanomedicines in cancer therapy.

         <title>Pushing the Limits: Maximizing Energy Density in Silicon Sulfide Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;energy silicon solid&#8208;state battery exceeding 400&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; is demonstrated using a 99.9&#160;wt% micro&#8208;Si anode, a thin sulfide electrolyte, and high&#8208;loading NMC811 cathode. Optimized dry/wet processing and interface engineering enable excellent cell cycling stability. Key degradation mechanisms are identified, providing strategies to enhance long&#8208;term performance of solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
For the first time, we demonstrate a silicon solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) architecture that achieves &gt;400 Wh kg&#8722;1, approaching the theoretical limit for silicon&#8208;based SSBs.

&lt;p&gt;A high-energy silicon solid-state battery exceeding 400&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; is demonstrated using a 99.9&#160;wt% micro-Si anode, a thin sulfide electrolyte, and high-loading NMC811 cathode.

         <title>Ultrahigh Conductive MXene Films for Broadband Electromagnetic Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of nitrogen&#8208;substituted MXene films, spanning the full composition range, achieves record&#8208;high conductivity (35&#8201;000 S cm&#8315;&#185;) and outstanding electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding across X, Ka, and W bands, even in ultrathin layers. These solution&#8208;processable, lightweight films outperform metals and open new possibilities for high&#8208;frequency electronics and wireless communication systems of the future.








Abstract
Broadband and ultrathin electromagnetic interference (EMI)&#8208;shielding materials are crucial for efficient high&#8208;frequency data transmission in emerging technologies. MXenes are renowned for their outstanding electrical conductivity and EMI&#8208;shielding capability. While substituting nitrogen (N) for carbon (C) atoms in the conventional MXene structure is theoretically expected to enhance these properties, synthesis challenges have hindered progress. Here, it is demonstrated that TixCyNx&#8208;y&#8208;1Tz MXene films with optimized N content achieve a record&#8208;high electrical conductivity of 35&#8201;000 S cm&#8722;1 and exceptional broadband EMI shielding across the X (8&#8211;12.4&#160;GHz), Ka (26.5&#8211;40&#160;GHz), and W (75&#8211;110&#160;GHz) bands&#8212;outperforming all previously reported materials even at reduced thicknesses. By synthesizing a full series of high&#8208;stoichiometric TixAlCyNx&#8208;y&#8208;1 MAX phases without intermediate phases, the impact of N substitution on the physical and electrical properties of TixCyNx&#8208;y&#8208;1Tz MXene flakes is systematically explored, achieving complete composition tunability in both dispersion and film forms. These findings position TixCyNx&#8208;y&#8208;1Tz MXenes as promising candidates for applications spanning from conventional lower&#8208;frequency domains to next&#8208;generation sub&#8208;THz electronics.

         <title>Reconstruction of the Buried Interface of Triple&#8208;Halide Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite for All&#8208;Perovskite Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By modifying the buried interface of the triple&#8208;halide wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite (WBG) with potassium trifluoromethanesulfonate (TfOK), a graded heterojunction is formed between the buried thin layer and the bulk, thereby improving the quality of the WBG perovskite film. Ultimately, an all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell with a PCE of 28.30% is achieved.








Abstract
All&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs) paired by wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites with narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskites holds the potential to overcome the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limitation. However, the severe phase segregation and non&#8208;radiative recombination of WBG perovskite put on a shadow for their power conversion efficiency and stability. Here, an interfacial engineering strategy is introduced into the triple&#8208;halide WBG perovskite. Potassium trifluoromethanesulfonate (TfOK) is utilized to reconstruct the buried interface of the triple&#8208;halide WBG perovskite. The distribution of (chlorine) Cl&#8722; changes from perovskite bulk toward the buried interface due to the TfOK addition. Therefore, a wider bandgap perovskite thin layer is formed at buried layer, which can form a graded heterojunction with bulk WBG perovskite to improve carrier separation and transfer. Meanwhile, the (potassium) K+ of TfOK diffuses into WBG perovskite bulk to suppress halide phase segregation. Consequently, the 1.78&#160;eV WBG PSCs deliver an impressive power conversion efficiency of 20.47% and an extremely high fill factor over 85%. Furthermore, the resultant two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite TSCs achieves a champion efficiency of 28.30%. This strategy provides a unique avenue to improve performance and photostability of WBG PSCs, a new function of Cl&#8722; in triple&#8208;halide is illustrated.

         <title>Spectrally Engineered Coatings for Steering the Solar Photons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectrum&#8208;splitting energy synergy: a spectrally engineered radiative cooling (RC) coating with photoluminescence is integrated with bifacial photovoltaic (biPV) panels to construct a hybrid biPV&#8208;RC system. By controlling solar photon conversion pathways and guiding light transport, the system enables synergistic power generation and daytime radiative cooling, offering a scalable solution for carbon&#8208;neutral buildings.








Abstract
The spectral properties of radiative cooling (RC) and photovoltaic (PV) govern their capacity to utilize solar photons at distinct energy levels. However, spectral mismatches with the solar spectrum result in significant inefficiencies: non&#8208;photovoltaic heat losses in PV panels and wasted energy from reflected solar radiation in RC systems. To address this, a photoluminescent RC coating with spectrally selective reflectivity is developed to be&#160;integrated it with bifacial photovoltaic (biPV) panels. The high reflectivity of the RC coating directs photons to the rear side of the PV panels, while its spectral selectivity optimizes the energy distribution of photons reaching the rear side, resulting in a 32% increase in the overall power output of the bifacial PV system. Additionally, the incorporation of photoluminescent materials enables the conversion of absorbed photons into luminescence rather than heat by suppressing non&#8208;radiative transitions. This reduces effective solar absorption by 14% and enhances radiative cooling performance. Simulated urban rooftop deployment demonstrates that this dual&#8208;harvesting system meet &#8776;18.1% of Hong Kong's annual electricity demand, offering a scalable pathway toward carbon&#8208;neutral cities.

         <title>Aggregation Engineering of Toluene&#8208;Processed Acceptor Layer Enables Over 19% Efficiency of Air&#8208;Blade&#8208;Coated Organic Solar Cells</title>

To elucidate the mechanism of morphology regulation in the blade&#8208;coated active layer to obtain high efficiency, three analogous acceptors (Y6, L8&#8208;BO, and L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl) are systematically compared. Benefiting from the unique molecular packing of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl and its weak molecule&#8208;interaction with toluene, the air&#8208;blade&#8208;coated D18/L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl&#8208;based device yields an outstanding power&#8208;conversion efficiency of 19.31%.








Abstract
Understanding the unique features of photovoltaic materials in high&#8208;performance blade&#8208;coated organic solar cells (OSCs) is critical to narrow the device performance difference between spin&#8208;coating and blade&#8208;coating methods. In this work, it is clarified that the molecular packing of acceptor and molecule&#8208;solvent interaction plays an essential role in determining the photovoltaic performance of blade&#8208;coated layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer OSCs. It is demonstrated that the unique dimer packing feature of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl can lead to lower excited energy (&#8710;ES1) and dominant J&#8208;aggregates in the blade&#8208;coated film compared to the analogs of Y6 and L8&#8208;BO. Meanwhile, the weaker molecule&#8208;solvent interaction between L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl and toluene is in favor of forming prominent J&#8208;aggregation in blade&#8208;coated film, contributing to a&#160;more compact &#960;&#8208;stacking than Y6 and L8&#8208;BO. Additionally, the blade&#8208;coated D18/L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl film shows more defined interpenetrating networks with clearer donor&#8208;acceptor interfaces than D18/Y6 and D18/L8&#8208;BO, facilitating improved charge extraction and suppressed charge recombination. As a result, the air&#8208;blade&#8208;coated layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer device based on D18/L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl yields a remarkable power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.31% without any additive and post&#8208;treatment, while much lower PCEs of 7.01% and 16.47% are obtained in the device based on D18/Y6 and D18/L8&#8208;BO, respectively. This work offers an effective approach to developing highly efficient air&#8208;blade&#8208;coated layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer OSCs.

         <title>Selective Lower&#8208;Occupied Through&#8208;Bond Interactions for Efficient Organic Phosphorescence Enabling High&#8208;Resolution Long&#8208;Wavelength Afterglow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>

Selective low&#8208;occupancy carbon&#8208;sulfur through&#8208;bond interactions enhance the organic red room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) to 46% yield with an emission lifetime of 0.43 s from materials without containing elements from the 4th period or higher. This significant improvement in organic red RTP yield enables high&#8208;resolution afterglow emission detection from individual nanoparticles even in the long wavelength region without relying on ambient autofluorescence. 








Abstract
Persistent organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) enables high&#8208;resolution afterglow bioimaging, independent of autofluorescence. However, the yield of organic RTP in the long&#8208;wavelength region is generally low, which limits the high&#8208;resolution information that can be obtained from the long&#8208;wavelength region. Moreover, this makes it impossible to obtain multicolor and high&#8208;resolution afterglow images. This report describes a molecule containing no atoms from the fourth or higher period that exhibits efficient red RTP in high yield. A molecule with red phosphorescent chromophores substituted with multiple phenylthio groups reached an RTP yield of 46.3% and an RTP lifetime of 0.43 s in an appropriate crystalline host medium. The selective lower&#8208;occupied through&#8208;bond or through&#8208;space interactions among molecules significantly enhance the phosphorescence in the long&#8208;wavelength region. The highly efficient and bright red persistent RTP induces a red afterglow from individual nanoparticles. Tuning the selective lower&#8208;occupied through&#8208;bond or through&#8208;space interactions allows for the design of high&#8208;performance RTP dyes and offers a novel approach to explore high&#8208;resolution full&#8208;color afterglow imaging.

         <title>Creation of Independently Controllable and Long Lifetime Polar Skyrmion Textures in Ferroelectric&#8208;Metallic Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that PTO/CCMO/SRO heterostructure can hold a broad family of skyrmion&#8208;like polar textures. One can write regular skyrmion bubble patterns with a high density &#8776;300 Gbit per inch2 by local tip field. The multiple &#960;&#8208;twist target skyrmions and skyrmion bags show significant topology&#8208;enhanced stability, verifying a topology strategy to encode robust information in ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Topological textures like vortices, labyrinths, and skyrmions formed in ferroic materials have attracted extensive interest during the past decade for their fundamental physics, intriguing topology, and technological prospects. So far, polar skyrmions remain scarce in ferroelectrics as they require a delicate balance between various dipolar interactions. Here, it is reported that PbTiO3 thin films in a metallic contact undergo a topological phase transition and hold a broad family of skyrmion&#8208;like textures including Q = &#177;1 skyrmions, multiple &#960;&#8208;twist target skyrmions, and skyrmion bags, with independent controllability, analogous to those reported in magnetic systems. Weakly&#8208;interacted skyrmion arrays with a density over 300 Gbit/inch2 are successfully written, erased, and read out by local electrical and mechanical stimuli of a scanning probe. Interestingly, in contrast to the relatively short lifetime (&lt;20 hours) of the normal skyrmions, the multiple &#960;&#8208;twist target skyrmions and skyrmion bags show topology&#8208;enhanced stability with a lifetime of over two weeks. Experimental and theoretical analysis implies the heterostructures carry electric Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction mediated by oxygen octahedral tiltings. The results demonstrate ferroelectric&#8208;metallic heterostructures as fertile playgrounds for topological states and emergent phenomena.

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective Symmetric PbSe&#8208;Based Device for Thermoelectric Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;effective symmetric PbSe&#8208;based device constructed from seven pairs of Pb0.988Cu0.002Se (p&#8208;type) and Pb1.02Cu0.002Se (n&#8208;type), which demonstrates impressive cooling temperature difference (&#916;TC) of 32.8, 36.9, and 41.0 K with the hot side maintained at 303, 323, and 343 K, respectively.








Abstract
Thermoelectric cooling technology has broad applications but is limited by the high cost of tellurium (Te) in commercially available Bi2Te3&#8208;based thermoelectric materials. Herein, a cost&#8208;effective symmetric PbSe&#8208;based device constructed from 7 pairs of Pb0.988Cu0.002Se (p&#8208;type) and Pb1.02Cu0.002Se (n&#8208;type) is presented, which demonstrates impressive cooling temperature difference (&#916;TC) of 32.8 and 41.0 K with the hot side maintained at 303 and 343 K, respectively. This low&#8208;cost symmetric PbSe&#8208;based device exhibits superior cost&#8208;effectiveness (&#916;T/cost) for near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature thermoelectric cooling compared to other Bi2Te3&#8208;based devices. Its high cooling performance primarily stems from an advanced carrier and phonon transport properties in p&#8208;type Pb0.988Cu0.002Se. Specifically, Pb vacancy and Cu substitution in Pb0.988Cu0.002Se act as strong p&#8208;type dopants that effectively optimize carrier density, resulting in a maximum power factor of 28.69 &#181;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 at room temperature. Moreover, the mobile Cu atoms within the lattice significantly impede phonon propagation, leading to a low room&#8208;temperature lattice thermal conductivity of 1.10&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. Finally, the room&#8208;temperature figure of merit (ZT) and average ZT value in p&#8208;type Pb0.988Cu0.002Se can reach 0.6 and 0.68 at 300&#8211;573 K, surpassing previous p&#8208;type PbSe&#8208;based polycrystals. This work emphasizes the significant potential of a cost&#8208;effective PbSe compound for near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature cooling applications.

Finally, the room-temperature figure of merit (&lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt;) and average &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; value in p-type Pb&lt;sub&gt;0.988&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.002&lt;/sub&gt;Se can reach 0.6 and 0.68 at 300&#8211;573 K, surpassing previous p-type PbSe-based polycrystals. This work emphasizes the significant potential of a cost-effective PbSe compound for near-room-temperature cooling applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrahigh Piezoelectric Coefficients Achieved by Tailoring the Sequence and Nano&#8208;Domain Structure of P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)</title>

Here, the study reports morphotropic phase boundary like behavior in a relaxor ferroelectric polymer with a unique head&#8208;to&#8208;head/tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail chain structure by the complete hydrogenation of poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene), achieving an outstanding piezoelectric coefficient of &#8722;107 pC/N, over five times higher than commercial polyvinylidene difluoride. This breakthrough enables next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance flexible devices.








Abstract
During past decades, the construction of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) behavior in ceramic&#8208;based relaxor ferroelectrics has successfully led to a significant enhancement in the piezoelectric coefficient for actuators, transducers, and sensors application. However, MPB&#8208;like behavior is achieved only in the ferroelectric state in flexible ferroelectric polymers such as poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) with the highest piezoelectric coefficients of &#8776;&#8722;63.5 pC/N, due to the lack of a rational design in polymer chain structure and composition. Here, the study reports the first MPB&#8208;like behavior observed in a relaxor ferroelectric polymer synthesized by fully hydrogenating poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene), which are primarily linked in a head&#8208;to&#8208;head/tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner, and trifluoroethylene units are randomly dispersed along the molecular chain. The unique polymer chain structure is found to be responsible for the formation of conformations disorder, thus strong relaxor behavior, and phase transition from an all&#8208;trans conformation to 3/1 helix, thus inducing phase boundary behavior. As a result, an outstanding longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient of &#8722;107 pC/N, more than five times higher than that of commercial poly(vinylidene fluoride) (&#8722;20 pC/N), is observed. This work opens up a new gate for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance flexible devices.

         <title>Modulating Crystal Growth with Sacrificial Coordination for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells via Intense Pulsed Light Annealing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DodecylMSO, a sacrificial Lewis base additive, modulates perovskite crystallization during intense pulsed light annealing by strongly binding PbI&#8322; and volatilizing at high temperatures. This results in larger grains, lower defect density, and minimum trace residues, achieving the highest efficiency in its class.








Abstract
Intense pulsed light (IPL) annealing has emerged as a transformative technology for the high&#8208;throughput, low&#8208;cost fabrication of perovskite films, enabling the rapid conversion of precursor wet films into perovskite films within milliseconds. Despite their potential, the efficiencies of IPL&#8208;processed devices have yet to match those achieved through conventional thermal annealing (TA), primarily due to the challenges of uncontrolled crystallization and defect formation during the IPL process. In this study, a solid Lewis base additive, dodecyl methyl sulfoxide (DodecylMSO) is introduced, to modulate perovskite crystal growth and improve film morphology and uniformity under IPL conditions. DodecylMSO acts as a sacrificial additive, with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirming the majority of it is removed in the final films. Compared to the control films, DodecylMSO&#8208;modified films exhibited significantly reduced defect densities and enhanced carrier extraction and transport properties. Leveraging this approach, p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is demonstrated with a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.5% fabricated via IPL. This sacrificial coordination strategy not only addresses key challenges in IPL processing but also opens new avenues for advancing the manufacturability and scalability of high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Bifunctional Compound Induced Dual Back Surface Fields for Efficient Hole Transport Layer&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;based hole&#8208;transport&#8208;layer&#8208;free perovskite solar cells present a cost&#8208;effective and stable photovoltaic alternative but suffer from low efficiency due to the absence of back surface field (BSF). In this work,&#160;trityl tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate&#160;is utilized to engineer&#160;dual BSFs, significantly enhancing open&#8208;circuit voltage and leading to a&#160;champion efficiency of 20.79%&#8212;marking a substantial improvement in device performance.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based hole transport layer&#8208;free (C&#8208;HTL&#8208;free) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising for low&#8208;cost and stable photovoltaics, but the HTL absence deteriorates their power conversion efficiency (PCE) due to the lack of back surface field (BSF). In this work, the benefits of forming dual BSFs in improving the PCE of C&#8208;HTL&#8208;free PSCs are first investigated by simulation. Then, trityl tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (Tr+TPFB&#8722;) is introduced into the C&#8208;HTL&#8208;free PSCs by post&#8208;treatment for the first time, which enables the formation of dual BSFs. TPFB&#8722; passivates n&#8208;doping defects in perovskite and leads to the formation of perovskite n&#8208;p homojunction, while Tr+ extracts electrons from carbon and lowers its work function, which succeeds realizing dual BSFs. This improves the separation and extraction of photocarriers within the device, which is evidenced by the photoluminescence lifetime imaging of the device cross&#8208;section for the first time. As a result, the average open&#8208;circuit voltage increases significantly by about 70&#160;mV, which largely contributes to the improvement of PCE with a champion value of 20.79% obtained.

         <title>Functional Group Engineering Stabilizing Precursor Solution and Passivating Defects for Operationally Stable and Highly Reproducible Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degradation of perovskite precursors is suppressed by modulating the position and type of functional groups in stabilizers. 4&#8208;hydrazinobenzenesulfonic acid (4&#8208;HBSA), with the lowest pKa, effectively improved stability, passivated grain boundary defects, and increased carrier lifetime, leading to a maximum PCE of 26.79% in inverted PSCs fabricated by vacuum flash technology under ambient conditions.








Abstract
The instability of perovskite precursor solution induced by deprotonation of organic cations and oxidation of iodide ions substantially deteriorates the reproducibility and reliability of the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The above decomposition reactions can be conquered via the synergistic engineering of organic functional groups. However, how spatial conformation and type of weak acid functional groups impact the stability of perovskite precursor solution remains to be investigated. Herein, it is uncovered that the position of functional groups on the benzene and the type of weak acid functional groups remarkably influence the acid dissociation constant (pKa) and thus the stability of perovskite inks. The pKa plays a decisive role in suppressing the deprotonation of organic cations and following the amine&#8208;cation addition&#8208;elimination reaction. The 4&#8208;hydrazinobenzenesulfonic acid (4&#8208;HBSA) with the lowest pKa is optimal in stabilizing perovskite inks and mitigating nonradiative recombination through defect passivation. This breakthrough enables the inverted PSCs to deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.79% (certified 26.36%, the highest PCE value for PSCs prepared in ambient conditions) using vacuum flash evaporation technology. The modulated PSC could maintain 92% of its initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of continuous maximum power point tracking.

         <title>Superior Energy Storage Performance in a Self&#8208;Organized Trirelaxor&#8208;Antiferroelectric Nanocomposite Over a Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;organized nanocomposite addresses the challenge of energy storage materials degrading at high temperatures. The nanocomposite maintains exceptional performance from room temperature to 200&#160;&#176;C, with enhanced energy density and efficiency. Through the trirelaxor matrix and nanointerface with antiferroelectric nanoparticles, it offers a promising strategy for high&#8208;temperature dielectric energy storage, overcoming polarization and breakdown degradation at elevated temperatures.








Abstract
A fundamental paradox in energy storage dielectrics lies in the challenge of achieving superior performance consistently across both room and elevated temperatures. This is addressed by designing a self&#8208;organized nanocomposite (1&#8722;x)(Ba,Sr)(Ti,Sn)O3&#8208;xBi1.5ZnNb1.5O7 composed of nano&#8208;sized antiferroelectric(AFE) particles embedded into a trirelaxor(TRE) matrix through nanoscale phase separation process. The optimal composition at x = 0.11 exhibits outstanding energy storage performance from room temperature (energy density = 8.5 J&#160;cm&#8722;3, efficiency = 94.8%, and figure of merit of 167 J&#160;cm&#8722;3) up to 200&#160;&#176;C (energy density = 4.85 J&#160;cm&#8722;3, efficiency &gt;90% and figure of merit of 49 J&#160;cm&#8722;3), outperforming existing Pb&#8208;free dielectrics. High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron x&#8208;ray diffractometry reveal that the coexisting nanometric antiferroelectric particles and the trirelaxor nanodomains sustain over a wide temperature range. Piezoresponse force microscopy and phase&#8208;field simulation show that hysteresis&#8208;free switching of trirelaxor nanodomains enables enhanced polarization and low hysteretic loss. Resistivity shows a 2&#8211;3 order of magnitude increases accompanying significant increase in breakdown strength up to high temperatures, attributable to deep charge trapping effect at high&#8208;density TRE/AFE interfaces as evidenced by thermally stimulated depolarization current. These favorable effects in the nano&#8208;composite are responsible for its high energy storage performance up to high temperatures.

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Pixel with Only a Single Perovskite Photodiode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full&#8208;color pixel with only a single perovskite photodiode is presented. By integrating multiple photoresponse mechanisms into one device, spectral information is encoded directly into its impedance characteristics. Machine learning&#8208;based reconstruction enables accurate color retrieval without the need for additional optical components or modulation. The RGB reconstruction error is kept below 2%.








Abstract
Photodetectors typically provide only 1D information about light intensity. Even the most basic color sensing requires external optical components, such as integrated filters. This limitation of information richness has only been overcome in recent years at the cost of spatial inefficiencies in multidetector integration designs or challenges in precisely controlling in situ modulation in single&#8208;detector designs. Acquiring high&#8208;dimensional color information with a single photodetector without external components, integration, or modulation remains a significant challenge that is aimed to resolve in this work. Due to the differences in carrier excitation by photons of varying energies, the simultaneous introduction of both electronic and ionic photoconductivity mechanisms enables the spectral characteristics of the unknown exciting light to be embedded within the impedance features of the device. By extracting impedance spectra and using machine learning&#8208;based reconstruction, a full&#8208;color pixel is achieved for the first time with just a single photodetector.

         <title>Assembling Octahedral Pt2Ag4 Clusters for High&#8208;Efficiency Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two enantiomeric pairs of alloy clusters composed of two Pt2Ag4 monomer are synthesized. Chiral structural transformations occurred in response to solvent stimuli, concomitant with high&#8208;contrast chiroptical switching. By manipulation of such chiral clusters, a chiral cubic lattice with high&#8208;efficiency circularly polarized luminescence is achieved. Further, the application in the information encryptions is explored.








Abstract
Establishing atom&#8208;precise and controllable self&#8208;assembly of metal clusters to achieve high&#8208;efficiency circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is especially fascinating, yet it creates considerable challenges. Here, two enantiomeric pairs of dimer clusters R/S&#8208;Pt4Ag8&#8208;green and R/S&#8208;Pt4Ag8&#8208;orange composed of two octahedral Pt2Ag4 monomers through Pt&#8211;Pt bonds are constructed, which show a 28&#8208;fold increase in photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) compared with the reported monomer in solution. The solid&#8208;state chiral dimer R/S&#8208;Pt4Ag8&#8208;orange shows a PLQY of 87% without an aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect. The intercluster distances and arrangements of the chiral cluster can be modulated through the ligand configuration and solvent stimuli, giving rise to the reversible transformations between chiral single crystals, concomitant with high&#8208;contrast optical/chiroptical switching. Additionally, by further assembling chiral Pt&#8208;Ag clusters with Ag+, a chiral 3D cubic lattice with high&#8208;efficiency red&#8208;emitting CPL is achieved. Furthermore, high&#8208;efficiency luminescence, intrinsic chirality, and the adjustable assembly behaviors of these chiral cluster assemblies bestow them with excellent smart CPL switching properties. This work opens a new avenue for high&#8208;efficiency CPL&#8208;active metal clusters by regulating metal&#8208;metal interactions.

         <title>Tunable Bipolar Photothermoelectric Response from Mott Activation for In&#8208;Sensor Image Preprocessing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a gate&#8208;tunable bipolar photothermoelectric detector using a vanadium dioxide film transistor. The device offers broadband photoresponse, linear light&#8208;intensity dependence, adjustable responsivities, low energy use (8 pJ&#160;per spike), and high stability (over 5000 cycles). An integrated convolutional network excels in broadband image classification, medical image denoising, and retinal vessel segmentation, highlighting its potential for future smart edge sensors.








Abstract
In&#8208;sensor image preprocessing, a subset of edge computing, offers a solution to mitigate frequent analog&#8208;digital conversions and the von Neumann bottleneck in conventional digital hardware. However, an efficient in&#8208;sensor device array with large&#8208;scale integration capability for high&#8208;density and low&#8208;power sensory processing is still lacking and highly desirable. This work introduces an adjustable broadband photothermoelectric detector based on a phase&#8208;change vanadium dioxide thin&#8208;film transistor. This transistor employs a vanadium dioxide/gallium nitride three&#8208;terminal structure with a gate&#8208;tunable phase transition at the gate&#8208;source junctions. This design allows for modulable photothermoelectric responsivities and alteration of the short&#8208;circuit photocurrent's polarities. The devices exhibit linear gate dependence for the broadband photoresponse and linear light&#8208;intensity dependence for both positive and negative photoresponsivities. The device's energy consumption is as low as 8 pJ per spike, which is one order of magnitude lower than that of previous Mott materials&#8208;based in&#8208;sensor preprocessing devices. A wafer&#8208;scale bipolar phototransistor array has also been fabricated by standard micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;fabrication techniques, exhibiting excellent stability and endurance (over 5000 cycles). More importantly, an integrated in&#8208;sensor convolutional network is successfully designed for simultaneous broadband image classification, medical image denoising, and retinal vessel segmentation, delivering exceptional performance and paving the way for future smart edge sensors.

The combination of metal single atoms and heterojunctions creates a ladder&#8208;like built&#8208;in electric field, providing a novel and innovative photocatalyst structure for improving photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Semiconductor heterojunctions can significantly enhance the separation of photogenerated charge carriers, among which Z&#8208;type heterojunctions are more conducive to photocatalysis due to their special transfer paths and strong oxidizing and reducing properties. However, introducing efficient active sites has always been a significant challenge in the improvement of heterogeneous photocatalysts. Herein, through in&#8208;depth analysis of the reaction mechanism and structural characteristics, single atom catalysts and heterojunctions are ingeniously integrated using built&#8208;in electric fields. For the first time, the suitable metal single atom active sites are successfully designed under the special electronic structure at the N&#8208;terminal, utilizing low electronegativity non&#8208;metallic element doping to counteract local electron migration from heterojunctions. Ladder&#8208;like built&#8208;in electric field composed of the divergent and parallel built&#8208;in electric fields from single atom catalysts and heterojunctions respectively, which introduces a new carrier separation path. AgPCN/BCN heterojunction reaches a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) yield 559.5&#160;&#181;M&#8729;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of 17.8% through 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction. Photoelectrochemical tests indicate the importance of 4e&#8722; water oxidation reaction as an auxiliary reaction. This novel and innovative photocatalyst structure brings new approaches for photocatalysts improvement, and new insights into the role of built&#8208;in electric fields in photocatalytic reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Cellular Glycocalyx Affects Nanoparticle Access to Cell Membranes and Uptake</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cellular glycocalyx is a dense and negatively charged layer of carbohydrates that ubiquitously coats cells. Nanoparticles must permeate through the glycocalyx to access receptors on the cell surface. The glycocalyx layer regulates cellular access to nanoparticles via charge&#8208;charge interactions. By varying nanoparticle surface charges, researchers can control nanoparticle uptake to enhance the specificity of targeted drug delivery systems.









Abstract
Understanding nanoparticle interactions with cells is fundamental to designing them for medical applications. Nanoparticles must interface with the cell surface to be bound and taken up. The glycocalyx is a carbohydrate layer coating the cell surface, rendering it negatively charged. Many researchers have noted that the glycocalyx affects nanoparticle uptake, but the mechanism remains unknown,&#160;Here, we investigate the interaction between the glycocalyx and nanoparticles at the cell surface in different cell types. The glycocalyx reduced the interactions between the nanoparticles and cells, thereby reducing cellular access, binding, and uptake. The magnitude of the effect is dependent on the nanoparticle charge. Fine&#8208;tuning the charge of nanoparticles can enhance the specificity of nanoparticle targeting. Understanding the role of the glycocalyx in nano&#8208;bio interactions will allow researchers to control the interactions of nanoparticles with the cell surface.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Rare Earth Oxides Anchoring Tunable Cu&#948;+ Nanochimneys for Self&#8208;Tandem C&#8208;C Coupling Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic protocol for 2D high&#8208;entropy rare earth oxides (HE&#8208;REOs) featuring lattice distortions and oxygen vacancies is developed, representing an emerging platform for anchoring Cu&#948;+ nano&#8208;domains with tunable oxidation states. The HE&#8208;REOs&#8208;Cu&#948;+ self&#8208;tandem catalysts exhibit largely exposed synergistic sites that facilitate *CO spillover, while stabilized optimal Cu&#948;+ chimneys promote C&#9472;C couplings and interfacial channels that delocalize electrons, thereby lowering the energy barrier.








Abstract
Copper (Cu)&#8208;based materials are promising for carbon&#8208;carbon bond (C&#9472;C) coupling catalysis, but they are limited to poor structural stability, high activation energy, and low selectivity toward C2+ products. Here a customized synthetic protocol is defined for the fabrication of 2D ultrathin high&#8208;entropy rare earth (RE) oxides (HE&#8208;REOs) with rich lattice distortions and oxygen vacancies, which act as robust supports for anchoring Cu&#948;+ serial domains with tunable oxidation states. The rationally integrated HE&#8208;REOs&#8208;Cu&#948;+ heterostructures feature largely exposed synergistic multi&#8208;site driving rapid *CO spillover, and multiple stabilized Cu&#948;+ chimneys promoting cascade *CO coupling, together with intrinsic electron activation channels enabling RE 4f electron delocalization to lower the energy barrier. The optimal CeZrZnAgPbO&#8208;Cu0.44+ self&#8208;tandem catalysts achieve a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 51.7% for C2+ gaseous products at a low potential of &#8208;0.9&#160;V versus (vs) reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in H&#8208;type cell. The study proposes an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; design principle for advanced RE&#8208;based catalysts through integrating advantageous individuals in a predictable manner.

         <title>Modular Design of T Cell Nanoengagers for Tumor Immunotherapy via Genetically Engineered Lipid&#8208;Tagged Antibody Fragments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;display&#8221; strategy for constructing T cell nanoengagers by directly embedding genetically engineered lipid&#8208;tagged antibodies into lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles. This versatile approach enables the design of both bi&#8208; and tri&#8208;specific nanoengagers, which effectively recruit T cells to tumor cells, enhance T cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity, and mitigate T cell exhaustion.









Abstract
T cell engagers, which bind tumor&#8208;associated antigens and T cell specific molecules, represent a promising class of immunotherapies for enhancing targeted immune responses. Here, a &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;display&#8221; platform is introduced for engineering T cell nanoengagers by anchoring antibody fragments into lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles. This approach utilizes a genetically engineered lipoprotein fused with single&#8208;chain variable fragments (scFv) and nanobodies, which spontaneously integrate into lipid bilayer of the nanoparticles, achieving a high surface density of at least 0.102&#160;scFv&#160;nm&#8722;2 (&#8776;3200&#160;scFv per particle). Modular bi&#8208;specific (Lipo&#8208;BiTE) and tri&#8208;specific (Lipo&#8208;TriTE) immunoliposomes are designed to enhance anti&#8208;tumor T cell immune responses. The Lipo&#8208;BiTE, integrating anti&#8208;CD3 and anti&#8208;HER2 scFv at an optimized surface density of 1.28&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;scFv&#160;nm&#8722;2, exhibits enhanced CD8+ T cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity in HER2&#8208;positive tumor models by simultaneously engaging tumor cells and T cells. Incorporating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 nanobodies to create Lipo&#8208;TriTE further addresses T cell exhaustion. This modular platform provides a robust foundation for designing immune cell engagers, with broad applications in targeted immunotherapy.

         <title>Fluorine Engineering Induces Phase Transformation in NiCo2O4 for Enhanced Active Motifs Formation in Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely manipulating the reconstruction process to generate specific active motifs remains challenging during the alkaline OER. NiCo2O4&#8208;Fn, structured with NiCo2O4 cores and (NH4)NixCo1&#8722;xF3 shells, facilitate the dual&#8208;metal NiCoOOH active phase with Ov forming at a lower voltage than the single&#8208;metal NiOOH in NiCo2O4, which is demonstrated by in situ Raman and XAFS. The NiCoOOH generation is attributed to the transformation of (NH4)NixCo1&#8722;xF3 into NixCo1&#8722;x(OH)2 hydroxide in electrolyte without bias. Consequently, NiCo2O4&#8208;Fn exhibits enhanced OER intrinsic activities compared to NiCo2O4.









Abstract
Dynamic reconstruction of catalysts is key to active site formation in alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but precise control over this process remains challenging. Herein, F&#8208;doped NiCo2O4 (NiCo2O4&#8208;Fn), consisting of a NiCo2O4 core and a (NH4)NixCo1&#8722;xF3 shell is reported, which promotes the formation of a dual&#8208;metal NiCoOOH active phase. In situ Raman and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analyses reveal that the NiCoOOH, rich in oxygen vacancies (Ov), forms at 1.2&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for NiCo2O4&#8208;F1, in contrast to the NiOOH phase formation at 1.4&#160;V versus RHE for undoped NiCo2O4. This is facilitated by the transformation of (NH4)NixCo1&#8722;xF3 into amorphous NixCo1&#8722;x(OH)2 in the KOH electrolyte without bias. Electrochemical tests show that NiCo2O4&#8208;F1 exhibits a 14&#8208;fold increase in intrinsic activity compared to NiCo2O4. Theoretical calculations suggest that Ov&#8208;induced unsaturated Co and Ni sites enhance electroactivity by promoting *OH intermediates adsorption and conversion, lowering the OER energy barrier. The oriented control of NiCoOOH active motifs in NiCo2O4 spinel, achieved through fluorine engineering, paves a new avenue for designing efficient OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>High&#8208;Oriented SnO2 Nanocrystals for Air&#8208;Processed Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with an Efficiency of 23.87%</title>

         <dc:description>
DAC&#8208;AA into SnO2 colloids favors the crystalline phase and preferential orientation along high&#8208;oriented (101) and (200) crystal planes by reducing surface absorption energy and modulating crystal thermodynamics, promoting heating transfer rate in the flexible PEN substrate and favoring perovskite/SnO2 lattice matching. The f&#8208;PSCs fabricated in full&#8208;air conditions produce an efficiency of 23.87% and exceptional mechanical stability.








Abstract
Tin (IV) oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer (ETL) emerges as the most promising n&#8208;type semiconductor material for flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs). The (110) facet&#8208;dominated SnO2 colloids are readily created, whereas other best&#8208;performing (101) and (200) facets&#8208;dominated ones with superior potential in interface modulation and lattice matching remain insufficiently explored. Here water&#8208;soluble acryloyloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride&#8208;acrylamine (DAC&#8208;AA) doping into SnO2 colloids produces more (101)&#8208; and (200)&#8208;oriented crystal domains through lowering surface absorption energy and offering additional thermodynamic driving force. Theoretical and experimental analyses corroborate that the grain preference orientation induced by DAC&#8208;AA modification strengthens heating transfer rate on the flexible substrate and favors lattice matching of perovskite (100) plane on SnO2 (101) and (200) facets. Accordingly, the champion f&#8208;PSCs on high&#8208;oriented SnO2&#8208;DAC&#8208;AA ETLs fabricated fully in ambient air conditions achieve the efficiencies of 23.87% and 22.41% with aperture areas of 0.092 and 1 cm2. In parallel, the propitious interfacial lattice arrangement attenuates the formation of micro&#8208;strain inside perovskite films, maintaining 92.5% of their initial performance after 10&#160;000 bending cycles with a curvature radius of 6&#160;mm.

         <title>Scalable Lithium Niobate Nanoimprinting for Nonlinear Metalenses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A broadband polycrystalline lithium niobate platform is developed for highly versatile and scalable fabrication of nonlinear metasurfaces. This work demonstrates simultaneous second harmonic generation and wavefront&#8208;shaping via a metalens on this platform. The high effective optical nonlinearity enables broadband frequency doubled light focusing for power density enhancement from near&#8208;ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared spectral range.








Abstract
Miniaturizing nonlinear optical components is essential for integrating advanced light manipulation into compact photonic devices, enabling scalable and cost&#8208;effective applications. While monocrystalline lithium niobate thin films advance nonlinear nanophotonics, their high inertness limits the design of top&#8208;down fabricated nanostructures. A versatile bottom&#8208;up fabrication method based on nanoimprint lithography is presented for achieving polycrystalline lithium niobate nanostructures and demonstrate its significant potential for nonlinear metasurfaces. The fabrication enables nearly vertical features and aspect ratios of up to 6 combined, which we combine with a novel solution&#8208;derived material with high effective second&#8208;order nonlinearity deff of 5&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1. On this platform, second&#8208;harmonic focusing is demonstrated over a broad spectral range from near&#8208;ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared, increasing the nonlinear signal intensity by up to 34 times. This method enables the first lithium niobate metalens and expands the field of nonlinear metasurfaces by providing a low&#8208;cost, highly scalable fabrication method for engineered nonlinear&#160;nanostructures.

         <title>Screening Natural Cholesterol Analogs to Assemble Self&#8208;Adjuvant Lipid Nanoparticles for Antigens Tagging Guided Therapeutic Tumor Vaccine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cholesterol analogs ginsenosides&#8208;Rg3 are screened to assemble lipid nanoparticles, which can deliver nucleic acid antigens to tumors and lymph nodes for antigens tagging tumor cells and dendritic cells activation, thus guiding CTL to accurately recognize and kill tumor cells. Besides, ginsenosides&#8208;Rg3 can reshape tumor microenvironment by inhibiting STAT3. Collectively, this work has great clinical value for immune&#8208;escaping tumors.








Abstract
The clinical progress of tumor nucleotide vaccines is limited due to insufficient recognition and killing of tumor cells with low antigen expression by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Here, natural cholesterol analogs are screened to assemble self&#8208;adjuvant lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for antigens tagging tumor cells and dendritic cells (DC) activation. First, a library of ginsenosides are collected, and then screened according to their anti&#8208;tumor immunity. Then, ginsenoside&#8208;Rg3 based&#8208;LNPs loaded with antigens (Rg3&#8208;LNPs) are identified as the optimal formulation by investigating the physicochemical and biological properties. Finally, Rg3&#8208;LNPs and granulocyte&#8208;macrophage colony&#8208;stimulating factor (GM&#8208;CSF) are co&#8208;loaded into a macroporous hydrogel for long&#8208;term immune response. Rg3&#8208;LNPs could accumulate into both tumors and LNs. Rg3&#8208;LNPs targeted tumor cells with high glucose transporter&#8208;1 expression via the targeting ligand Rg3, and anchored antigens on the tumor cell surface, thus promoting the recognition of CTL to tumor cells; Rg3&#8208;LNPs can accumulate into the LNs to promote DC activation and antigen presentation, thus stimulating CTL activation. Besides, Rg3, as an adjuvant, cooperated with GM&#8208;CSF to remodel the tumor microenvironment, thus promoting the killing of CTL to tumor cells. Collectively, this work highlights the importance of tagging antigens to tumor cells in tumor vaccine and has great clinical value for immune&#8208;escaping tumors.

Electron Release via Internal Polarization Fields
The internal polarization field at the W&#8211;graphene heterointerface induces sulfur vacancy formation under ion bombardment, modulating the electronic structure via excess electron transfer. This enhances valence state filling of W and S atoms. This study highlights the relationship between the WS2 basal plane's electronic structure and electrocatalytic activity, focusing on optimizing S&#8211;H bonding. More details can be found in article number 2411211 by Hyeong&#8208;U Kim, Pil J. Yoo, Taesung Kim, and co&#8208;workers.

All&#8208;Iron Redox Flow Batteries
Aqueous redox flow batteries are limited by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at their negative electrodes. In article number 2414596 by Emre B. Boz, Ameya Bondre, Ronald de Bruijne, and Antoni Forner&#8208;Cuenca, conductive polymers are conformally coated on porous carbonaceous electrodes to improve the reaction selectivity of hybrid all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries. Poly(pyrrole)/PSS coating inhibits HER in acidic media and increases the battery lifetime, while PEDOT/PSS electrode improves the roundtrip efficiency.

Spontaneous Twist of Ferroelectric Smectic Blocks
The ferroelectric nematic (NF) phase in achiral rod&#8208;shape mesogens is known to exhibit chiral ground state (CGS) due to the polarization escape. In this study, Hiroya Nishikawa, Fumito Araoka, and co&#8208;workers found such CGS as twisting of bulky smectic blocks in a ferroelectric smectic phase transited directly from the NF phase. More details can be found in article number 2501946.

Flame Treatment
A rapid and scalable high&#8208;temperature flame technique is developed to enable surface reconstruction of sulfide semiconductor photoelectrode for enhanced photoelectrochemical(PEC) performances. In article number 2403164, Sung Sik Shin, Xiaolin Zheng, Sun Cho, and their team demonstrate rapid surface reconstruction of Indium sulfide (In2S3) photoanode using the flame process. The flame process transforms the In2S3 surface into a 5 nm&#8208;thin In2O3 layer and generates bulk sulfur vacancies simultaneously, leading to a remarkable PEC water oxidation photocurrent density of 8.5 mA cm&#8722;2 and iodide oxidation photocurrent density of 7.3 mA cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Polyphenol&#8208;Derived Carbonaceous Frameworks with Multiscale Porosity for High&#8208;Power Electrochemical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the fluid dynamic behavior within carbonaceous porous structures, linking structural characteristics to electrolyte transport and electrochemical performance. Specifically, it quantitatively assesses the effect of polyphenol derivatives&#8208;harnessed multiscale pore structures on active surface utilization and electrochemical activity for advancements in high&#8208;power electrochemical applications.








Abstract
With the escalating global demand for electric vehicles and sustainable energy solutions, increasing focus is placed on developing electrochemical systems that offer fast charging and high&#8208;power output, primarily governed by mass transport. Accordingly, porous carbons have emerged as highly promising electrochemically active or supporting materials due to expansive surface areas, tunable pore structures, and superior electrical conductivity, accelerating surface reaction. Yet, while substantial research has been devoted to crafting various porous carbons to increase specific surface areas, the optimal utilization of the surfaces remains underexplored. This review emphasizes the critical role of the fluid dynamics within multiscale porous carbonaceous electrodes, leading to substantially enhanced pore utilization in electrochemical systems. It elaborates on strategies of using sacrificial templates for incorporating meso/macropores into microporous carbon matrix, while exploiting the unique properties of polyphenol moieties such as sustainable carbons derived from biomass, inherent adhesive/cohesive interactions with template materials, and facile complexation capabilities with diverse materials, thereby enabling adaptive structural modulations. Furthermore, it explores how multiscale pore configurations influence pore&#8208;utilization efficiency, demonstrating advantages of incorporating multiscale pores. Finally, synergistic impact on the high&#8208;power electrochemical systems is examined, attributed to improved fluid&#8208;dynamic behavior within the carbonaceous frameworks, providing insights for advancing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;power electrochemical applications.

         <title>Natural and Nature&#8208;Inspired Biomaterial Additives for Metal Halide Perovskite Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review surveys natural biomaterials and nature&#8208;inspired artificial materials as additives for metal halide perovskite films in optoelectronics, including solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, photodetectors, and X&#8208;ray detectors. It discusses how these biomaterials differ from conventional materials in terms of their impact on device performance from both mechanistic and functional viewpoints. Although solar cell applications dominate, reports on other applications are rapidly increasing.








Abstract
This comprehensive review meticulously categorizes and discusses the applications of diverse biomaterials, specifically natural and nature&#8208;inspired synthetic materials in metal halide perovskite optoelectronics. Applications range from solar cells to light&#8208;emitting diodes, photodetectors, and X&#8208;ray detectors. Emphasis is placed on the intricate interactions between bio&#8208;additives and perovskite crystals, highlighting their influence on the grain size, crystal orientation, grain boundaries, and surface passivation. This review also explores the advantages and disadvantages of each natural or nature&#8208;inspired material and their unique properties compared with conventional additives. Special attention is given to the mechanistic and functional viewpoints, showing how these biomaterials enhance device performance. Through additive engineering with ecofriendly biomaterials, defects in metal halide perovskite thin films can be effectively passivated, thus extending the photostability or in some cases mechanical flexibility of devices. This review provides valuable insights for selecting and designing next&#8208;generation biomaterial additives, offering new prospects for achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite layers and advancing the field of peorvskite&#8208; based optoelectronics.

         <title>Aerosol CVD Carbon Nanotube Thin Films: From Synthesis to Advanced Applications: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aerosol chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a cutting&#8208;edge method for producing carbon nanotube (CNT) thin films through gas&#8208;phase synthesis and filtration collection. The films exhibit exceptional electrical, optical, and mechanical properties. This review provides comprehensive guidelines from synthesis to applications, emphasizing how precise control of aerosol CVD parameters enables scalability and enhances commercial viability across diverse technological applications.








Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) produced by the floating&#8208;catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD) method are among the most promising nanomaterials of today, attracting interest from both academic and industrial sectors. These CNTs exhibit exceptional electrical conductivity, optical properties, and mechanical resilience due to their binder&#8208;free and low&#8208;defect structure, while the FCCVD method enables their continuous and scalable synthesis. Among the methodological FCCVD variations, aerosol CVD&#8217; is distinguished by its production of freestanding thin films comprising macroscale CNT networks, which exhibit superior performance and practical applicability. This review elucidates the complex interrelations between aerosol CVD reactor synthesis conditions and the resulting properties of the CNTs. A unified approach connecting all stages of the synthesis process is proposed as a comprehensive guide. This review examines the correlations between CNT structural parameters (length and diameter) and resultant film properties (conductivity, optical, and mechanical characteristics) to establish a comprehensive framework for optimizing CNT thin film synthesis. The analysis encompasses characterization methodologies specific to aerosol CVD&#8208;synthesized CNTs and evaluates how their properties influence applications across diverse domains, from energy devices to optoelectronics. The review concludes by addressing current challenges and prospects in this field.

         <title>Material Selection and Device Design of Scalable Flexible Brain&#8208;Computer Interfaces: A Balance Between Electrical and Mechanical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the balance between electrical and mechanical performance of flexible BCIs through the careful selection of electronic materials and probe design to achieve long&#8208;term stable neural recordings with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios.








Abstract
Brain&#8208;computer interfaces (BCIs) hold the potential to revolutionize brain function restoration, enhance human capability, and advance our understanding of cognitive mechanisms by directly linking neural signals with hardware. However, the mechanical mismatch between conventional rigid BCIs and soft brain tissue limits long&#8208;term interface stability. Next&#8208;generation BCIs must achieve long&#8208;term biocompatibility while maintaining high performance, enabling the integration of millions of sensors within tissue&#8208;level flexible and soft, stable neural interfaces. Lithographic fabrication techniques provide scalable thin&#8208;film flexible electronics, but traditional electronic materials often fail to meet the unique requirements of BCIs. This review examines the selection of materials and device design for flexible BCIs, starting with an analysis of intrinsic material properties&#8212;Young's modulus, electrical conductivity and dielectric constant. It then explores the integration of material selection with electrode design to optimize electrical circuits and assess key mechanical factors. Next, the correlation between electrical and mechanical performance is analyzed to guide material selection and device design. Finally, recent advances in neural probes are reviewed, highlighting improvements in signal quality, recording stability, and scalability. This review focuses on scalable, lithography&#8208;based BCIs, aiming to identify optimal materials and designs for long&#8208;term, reliable neural recordings.

         <title>One&#8208;Shot Remote Integration of Macromolecular Synaptic Elements on a Chip for Ultrathin Flexible Neural Network System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel one&#8208;shot integration electropolymerization (OSIEP) method is developed as a breakthrough on the intricate photolithographic steps, enabling to compress all processes from synthesis to channel integration in one&#8208;shot manufacturing. The specially designed dual bipolar electrodes provide the targeted depositions of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) on 6 &#215; 5 channel array. A multi&#8208;gate synaptic circuit mimicking operant conditioning constructed by OSIEP is successfully evaluated.








Abstract
The field of biomimetic electronics that mimic&#160;synaptic&#160;functions&#160;has expanded significantly to overcome the limitations&#160;of&#160;the&#160;von Neumann bottleneck. However, the scaling down of the technology has led to an increasingly intricate manufacturing process. To address the issue, this work presents a one&#8208;shot integrable electropolymerization (OSIEP) method with remote controllability for the deposition of synaptic elements on a chip by exploiting bipolar electrochemistry. Condensing synthesis, deposition, and patterning into a single fabrication step is achieved by combining alternating&#8208;current voltage superimposed on direct&#8208;current voltage&#8208;bipolar electropolymerization and a specially designed dual source/drain bipolar electrodes. As a result, uniform 6 &#215; 5 arrays of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) channels are successfully&#160;fabricated&#160;on flexible ultrathin parylene substrates in one&#8208;shot process. The channels exhibited highly uniform characteristics and are directly used as electrochemical synaptic transistor with synaptic plasticity over 100 s. The synaptic transistors have demonstrated promising performance in an artificial neural network (NN) simulation, achieving a high recognition accuracy of 95.20%. Additionally, the array of synaptic transistor is easily reconfigured to a multi&#8208;gate synaptic circuit to implement the principles of operant conditioning. These results provide a compelling fabrication strategy for realizing cost&#8208;effective and disposable NN systems with high integration density.

The channels exhibited highly uniform characteristics and are directly used as electrochemical synaptic transistor with synaptic plasticity over 100 s. The synaptic transistors have demonstrated promising performance in an artificial neural network (NN) simulation, achieving a high recognition accuracy of 95.20%. Additionally, the array of synaptic transistor is easily reconfigured to a multi-gate synaptic circuit to implement the principles of operant conditioning. These results provide a compelling fabrication strategy for realizing cost-effective and disposable NN systems with high integration density.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Charged Black&#8208;Hole&#8208;Like Electronic Structure Driven by Geometric Potential of 2D Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that curvature in 2D semiconductors triggers the modified geometric potential with curvature&#8208;induced bandgap change, resembling the effective potential of black holes. The atomic&#8208;scale observation of bound states in the modified geometric potential shows an analog of the stable orbits near black holes. The modified geometric potential is related to curvature&#8208;induced variations in both band gap and spin&#8208;orbit interaction.








Abstract
One of the exotic expectations in the 2D curved spacetime is the geometric potential from the curvature of the 2D space, still possessing unsolved fundamental questions through Dirac quantization. The atomically thin 2D materials are promising for the realization of the geometric potential, but the geometric potential in 2D materials is not identified experimentally. Here, the curvature&#8208;induced ring&#8208;patterned bound states are observed in structurally deformed 2D semiconductors and formulated the modified geometric potential for the curvature effect, which demonstrates the ring&#8208;shape bound states with angular momentum. The formulated modified geometric potential is analogous to the effective potential of a rotating charged black hole. Density functional theory and tight&#8208;binding calculations are performed, which quantitatively agree well with the results of the modified geometric potential. The modified geometric potential is described by modified Gaussian and mean curvatures, corresponding to the curvature&#8208;induced changes in spin&#8208;orbit interaction and band gap, respectively. Even for complex structural deformation, the geometric potential solves the complexity, which aligns well with experimental results. The understanding of the modified geometric potential provides us with an intuitive clue for quantum transport and a key factor for new quantum applications such as valleytronics, spintronics, and straintronics in 2D semiconductors.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Engineering of Thermodynamically Enhanced SaCas9 for Improved Gene Suppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermostable Cas9 (CRISPR&#8208;associated protein 9) variant is developed using a structure&#8208;guided protein engineering approach. By thermodynamic analysis, deletable domains are identified to enhance stability while preserving function. Also, a 3D&#160;structure with novel conformation of nontarget&#8208;stranded DNA is confirmed through cryo&#8208;electron microscopy. Fusion with functional elements for CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) interference applications enables gene suppression efficiency, demonstrating the potential of tailored CRISPR systems.








Abstract
Proteins with multiple domains play pivotal roles in various biological processes, necessitating a thorough understanding of their structural stability and functional interplay. Here, a structure&#8208;guided protein engineering approach is proposed to develop thermostable Cas9 (CRISPR&#8208;associated protein 9)&#160;variant for CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)&#160;interference applications. By employing thermodynamic analysis, combining distance mapping and molecular dynamics simulations, deletable domains are identified to enhance stability while preserving the DNA recognition function of Cas9. The resulting engineered Cas9, termed small and dead form Cas9, exhibits improved thermostability and maintains target DNA recognition function. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy analysis reveals structural integrity with reduced atomic density in the deleted domain. Fusion with functional elements enables intracellular delivery and nuclear localization, demonstrating efficient gene suppression in diverse cell types. Direct delivery in the mouse brain shows enhanced knockdown efficiency, highlighting the potential of structure&#8208;guided engineering to develop functional CRISPR systems tailored for specific applications. This study underscores the significance of integrating computational and experimental approaches for protein engineering, offering insights into designing tailored molecular tools for precise biological interventions.

         <title>Responsive Ordered Assembly of Magnetic Nanoparticles for ROS Activatable Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive ordered assembly of magnetic nanoparticles (RMNAs) achieve a ROS&#8208;dependent off/on MPI signal regulation through the ordered assembly/disassembly&#8208;mediated MPI tuning strategy. Remarkably, the activatable MPI probe, RMNA, demonstrates a 3.98&#8208;fold recovery of MPI signals in response to ROS conditions, enabling ultra&#8208;sensitive monitoring of acute liver injury at a low dosage of 0.05 mg&#160;kg&#8722;1, with a 27&#8208;fold increase in MPI signals compared to the non&#8208;responsive group.








Abstract
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) has emerged as a versatile biomedical imaging modality, yet a significant challenge persists in the absence of activatable MPI probes for targeted imaging of disease biomarkers. In this study, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive ordered assembly of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is reported, engineered through the meticulous design of magnetic nanoparticle building blocks and ROS&#8208;responsive polymeric ligands, enabling precise control over the assembly structure. This ordered configuration amplifies magnetic dipole&#8208;dipole interactions, raising the energy barrier during nonequilibrium dynamic magnetization and effectively quenching the MPI signal. By modulating the assembly and disassembly of these ordered structures in response to ROS, this nanoprobe achieves ROS&#8208;dependent off/on MPI signal regulation. Consequently, the probe enables the monitoring of early pathological ROS change in a mice model of early acute liver injury, facilitating highly sensitive monitoring of the ROS level&#8208;dependent severity of the disease. This work represents the inaugural application of microenvironment&#8208;responsive MPI probes for the early diagnosis of ROS&#8208;associated diseases. The introduction of ordered assembly structures for MPI signal tuning offers a promising translational approach in the development of next&#8208;generation activatable MPI probes.

         <title>Near Infrared Light&#8208;Based Non&#8208;Contact Sensing System for Robotics Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;contact intelligent sensing system that can accurately recognize patterns formed by NIR light is reported. Black phosphate (BP)&#8208;based organogel with anti&#8208;freezing and water retention properties as non&#8208;contact sensor can be used in extremely cold or hot environments. The designed non&#8208;contact sensing system shows good robustness by maintaining high sensitivity over a wide temperature range, long working distances, different current intensities, and dark conditions.








Abstract
With the development of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, non&#8208;contact sensors are expected to realize complex human&#8208;computer interaction. However, current non&#8208;contact sensors are mainly limited by accuracy and stability. Herein, an intelligent infrared photothermal non&#8208;contact sensing system is developed that provides long&#8208;distance and high&#8208;accuracy non&#8208;contact sensing. A black phosphorus (BP)&#8208;based composite organogel is designed, which exhibits excellent photothermal properties and environmental stability, as the active material. This material can detect patterns created by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light through various patterned masks monitored by an infrared thermal imager. The constructed non&#8208;contact sensing system is capable of accurately recognizing 26 letters with an impressive accuracy rate of 99.4%. Furthermore, even small size non&#8208;contact sensors can maintain high sensitivity and stability across a wide temperature range, at long working distances, and under different current intensities and dark conditions, demonstrating exceptional robustness. Combined with machine learning method, it is demonstrated that the non&#8208;contact sensing system excels in pattern recognition and human&#8208;computer interaction. These features highlight its potential applications in intelligent robotics and remote control systems.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous redox flow batteries are limited by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at their negative electrodes. In this work, conductive polymers are conformally coated on porous carbonaceous electrodes to improve the reaction selectivity of hybrid all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries. Poly(pyrrole)/PSS coating inhibits HER in acidic media and increases the battery lifetime, while PEDOT/PSS electrode improves the roundtrip efficiency.








Abstract
Aqueous all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries are an attractive and economic technology for grid&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their use of abundant and environmentally benign iron as the redox active material and water as solvent. However, the battery operation is challenged by the plating/stripping reactions of iron and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction at the negative electrode, which hinder performance and durability. Here, the reaction selectivity of the negative electrode is tailored by introducing conductive polymer coatings onto porous carbonaceous electrodes. Two conductive polymers, poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and poly(pyrrole) (PPy) are conformally coated with the dopant poly(4&#8208;styrenesulfonate) (PSS) and the resulting electrochemistry is studied on model electroanalytical platforms and redox flow batteries. Both polymers decrease the hydrogen evolution current on rotating disc electrodes, with PPy/PSS strongly inhibiting the reaction at high overpotentials. In full all&#8208;iron redox flow cells, PPy/PSS coating extends cyclability and significantly reduces hydrogen evolution, while PEDOT/PSS coating improves the round&#8208;trip efficiency, possibly acting as a redox shuttle for the iron stripping reaction. These findings motivate broader investigation and implementation of conductive polymers to engineer reaction selectivity for flow batteries and other electrochemical technologies.

         <title>When Graphitic Nitrogen Meets Pentagons: Selective Construction and Spectroscopic Evidence for Improved Four&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exclusive construction of graphitic nitrogen coordinated with pentagon defects is achieved by pyrolysis of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 under unusually high temperatures. The graphitic nitrogen model electrocatalyst enables highly efficient four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction in both alkaline and acidic conditions, as evidenced by in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon materials have emerged as promising metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. However, the structural inhomogeneity, particularly the coexistence of four nitrogen doping structures&#8211;pyridinic, graphitic, pyrrolic, and oxidized nitrogen&#8211;makes assessing their respective contributions challenging and controversial. The current understanding of the four nitrogen doping structures may be also oversimplified and even problematic. The development of a distinctive graphitic&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon electrocatalyst is presented in which graphitic nitrogen coordinated with pentagon defects is selectively constructed. Contrary to the previously held belief that graphitic nitrogen has little effect on ORR electrocatalysis, the unique graphitic N configuration exhibited significantly enhanced four&#8208;electron ORR activity in both alkaline and acidic media. In situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations further revealed that graphitic nitrogen, when coordinated with pentagon defects, optimized the density of states near the Fermi level, leading to optimized binding energies with oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. The results rationalize the long&#8208;standing controversy over the role of different nitrogen dopants in ORR electrocatalysis and suggest that there is considerable potential to precisely construct new nitrogen doping configurations to achieve superior electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Boosted Hydrogen Evolution via Photoinduced Hole Transfer in Molecular&#8208;Level Organic Heterojunction under NIR Photon Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brand&#8208;new A&#8208;D1&#8208;D2&#8208;D1&#8208;A type electron acceptor BTPT&#8208;IC4F is designed, synthesized and integrated with donor polymer PBDB&#8208;T to achieve full&#8208;spectrum light harvesting. PBDB&#8208;T:BTPT&#8208;IC4F nanoparticles exhibit a promising external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 6.3% at 730&#160;nm, which is attributed to efficient hole extraction from BTPT&#8208;IC4F* (excited BTPT&#8208;IC4F) to PBDB&#8208;T phase in the molecular&#8208;level heterojunction under pure near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photon excitation.









Abstract
The energy of sunlight is predominantly concentrated in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, posing a paramount limitation for practical application of conventional photocatalysts. Organic semiconductors can offer NIR absorption and tunable energy levels simultaneously through molecular engineering, which presents great potential in solar&#8208;driven catalysis. However, an individual organic semiconductor typically generates Frenkel excitons with large binding energy, hindering efficient electron&#8208;hole separation. Herein, we develop molecular&#8208;level heterojunction to suppress electron&#8208;hole recombination, thereby achieving a boosted hydrogen (H2) evolution reaction rate of 25.54&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 (12.77&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1) under visible&#8211;near&#8208;infrared (Vis&#8211;NIR) light. Surprisingly, heterojunction nanoparticles (NPs) comprising donor polymer PBDB&#8208;T matched with an A&#8208;D1&#8208;D2&#8208;D1&#8208;A type acceptor BTPT&#8208;IC4F exhibit a promising external quantum efficiency of 6.3% at 730&#160;nm. Transient absorption spectroscopy monitors effective extraction of photogenerated holes from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of BTPT&#8208;IC4F to the HOMO of PBDB&#8208;T, while first&#8208;principle calculations confirm the prolonged lifetime of excited BTPT&#8208;IC4F due to efficient hole capture by the PBDB&#8208;T phase. The outstanding performance of heterojunction NPs under NIR light is ascribed to strong hole transfer within the nanoparticle. This study provides valuable insights for designing molecular&#8208;level organic heterojunction photocatalysts toward NIR light&#8208;driven H2 evolution and other potential reactions.

         <title>PSMA&#8208;Targeted Nanoparticles with PI3K/mTOR Dual Inhibitor Downregulate P&#8208;Glycoprotein and Inactivate Myeloid&#8208;Derived Suppressor Cells for Enhanced Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy in Prostate Cancer</title>

This study presents glutathione&#8208;responsive nanoparticles (PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ) targeting prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen to deliver a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor. The system simultaneously suppresses P&#8208;glycoprotein&#8208;mediated drug resistance, enhances chemotherapy sensitivity, and reprograms immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments by inactivating myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells, offering a dual chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic strategy against advanced prostate cancer.








Abstract
Acquired drug resistance and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment significantly limit the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in advanced prostate cancer. Blocking the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway has been recently proved as a new strategy to improve sensitivity to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Herein, glutathione (GSH)&#8208;sensitive nanoparticles (PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ) are developed that can target prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA), loaded with PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor prodrug BEZ235. BEZ235 can be released from PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ in response to elevated GSH levels in prostate cancer tissues, inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and impairing downstream cellular functions such as cell proliferation, DNA repair, and protein synthesis. When combined with paclitaxel, PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ could reduce drug efflux by downregulating P&#8208;glycoprotein expression in cancer cells, thus enhancing the sensitivity to chemotherapy. Furthermore, PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ could impair the immunosuppressive functions of myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells and reshape the &#8220;cold&#8221; immune microenvironment in prostate cancer, enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy and including long&#8208;term immune memory against tumor recurrence. PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ serves a safe and promising strategy to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in advanced prostate cancer.

         <title>Supramolecular Conductive Hydrogels With Homogeneous Ionic and Electronic Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) based conductive hydrogels have received great attention in bioelectronics on account of their tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties. However, inhomogeneous morphologies of the conducting PEDOT phase limits their electrical and mechanical properties. Here, supramolecular hydrogels with self&#8208;doped PEDOT (S&#8208;PEDOT) homogeneously distributed are reported, which simultaneously exhibit high toughness (620 kJ m&#8722;3), softness (10.5 kPa) and conductivity (5.8 S cm&#8722;1).








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) based conductive hydrogels have received great attention in bioelectronics on account of their tissue-like mechanical properties. However, inhomogeneous morphologies of the conducting PEDOT phase limits their electrical and mechanical properties. Here, supramolecular hydrogels with self-doped PEDOT (S-PEDOT) homogeneously distributed are reported, which simultaneously exhibit high toughness (620 kJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;), softness (10.5 kPa) and conductivity (5.8 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Single&#8208;Layer Spin&#8208;Orbit&#8208;Torque Magnetization Switching Due to Spin Berry Curvature Generated by Minute Spontaneous Atomic Displacement in a Weyl Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;layer magnetization switching with a small critical current density of &#8776;106&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 is demonstrated. The strong intrinsic spin Hall effect, causing the switching, is induced by the synergy of the inherent spin&#8208;orbit coupling and the spontaneous oxygen octahedral rotation in SrRuO3.The findings highlight the immense potential for realizing efficient material systems for spin&#8208;orbitronics applications by precise atom positioning.








Abstract
Spin Berry curvature characterizes the band topology as the spin counterpart of Berry curvature and is crucial in generating novel spintronics functionalities. By breaking the crystalline inversion symmetry, the spin Berry curvature is expected to be significantly enhanced; this enhancement will increase the intrinsic spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic materials and, thus, the spin&#8211;orbit torques (SOTs). However, this intriguing approach is not applied to devices; generally, the spin Hall effect in ferromagnet/heavy&#8208;metal bilayer is used for SOT magnetization switching. Here, SOT&#8208;induced partial magnetization switching is demonstrated in a single layer of a single&#8208;crystalline Weyl oxide SrRuO3 (SRO) with a small current density of &#8776;3.1&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. Detailed analysis of the crystal structure in the seemingly perfect periodic lattice of the SRO film reveals barely discernible oxygen octahedral rotations with angles of &#8776;5&#176; near the interface with a substrate. Tight&#8208;binding calculations indicate that a large spin Hall conductivity is induced around small gaps generated at band crossings by the synergy of inherent spin&#8210;orbit coupling and band inversion due to the rotations, causing magnetization reversal. The results indicate that a minute atomic displacement in single&#8208;crystal films can induce strong intrinsic SOTs that are useful for spin&#8208;orbitronics devices.

         <title>Cardiac Organoid Model Inspired Micro&#8208;Robot Smart Patch to Treat Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heart organoid model exhibits the acidic microenvironment characteristic of myocardial infarction, which emerges as a pivotal force propelling the movement of micro&#8208;robots. These micro&#8208;robots, administered through microneedles, can penetrate deep into the tissue, effectively delivering therapeutic payloads to facilitate heart repair.








Abstract
Post&#8208;myocardial infarction (MI), the rapid decrease in pH triggers myocardial cell acidosis, which compromises the therapeutic efficacy of exosomes in MI. The groundbreaking research in the human cardiac organoid MI model suggests that exosomes, when paired with pH adjustment, dramatically reduce cardiomyocyte mortality while maintaining their proliferative potential, underscoring the importance of pH regulation in myocardial preservation. Micro&#8208;robot mounted micro&#8208;needle (MN) patch is thus proposed, targeting MI&#8208;acidic microenvironmet, to deliver exosomes into deep injured tissue. Upon injection, the patch base releases VEGF&#8208;laden nanoparticles adhering to the infarcted myocardium. The smart patch is found not only 3D reconstructs the vascular network in MI regions but also effectively saves cardiomyocytes in rats. Furthermore, the minimally invasive delivery of MN patches are also verified to hearts of rabbits and pigs via thoracoscopic surgery underscores. These findings suggest that precise regulation of the microenvironment is a key to improving treatment outcomes.

         <title>Designing Supported Nanoparticles via Synergistic Ex&#8208;Solution and Phosphorization for Tailored Active Site Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot process synchronizing nanoparticle ex&#8208;solution and phosphorization is developed for simultaneous phosphide nanoparticle synthesis and host oxide functionalization. The resulting IrRuP/WO2.9 catalyst achieves exceptional mass activity and low onset potential for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C and offering a promising alternative for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysis.









Abstract
Supported nanoparticles incorporating catalytically attractive nonmetal elements have gained significant attention as a promising strategy for enhancing catalytic activity in various industrial applications. This study presents an innovative one&#8208;pot synthesis method for fabricating hybrid catalysts, which simultaneously modifies surface properties through the precipitation of nanoparticles with the concurrent incorporation of nonmetal elements. The underlying concept is to synchronize the temperature required for particle formation with that of nonmetal incorporation by adjusting the oxygen chemical potential of the host oxide. As a case study, Ir&#8208; and Ru&#8208;doped WO3 are selected as the starting material, with phosphorus (P) as the representative nonmetal for surface functionalization. Notably, the hybrid catalyst, composed of amorphous (Ir,Ru)Px particles dispersed on P&#8208;rich WO2.9 sheets, is synthesized through a single heat treatment at 500&#160;&#176;C, avoiding undesirable sintering of the host material. When used as a hydrogen evolution catalyst, this material exhibits outstanding mass activity, durability, compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C catalysts. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the superior performance of the hybrid catalysts attributes to improved water dissociation and favorable adsorption and desorption of key reaction intermediates. This novel synthesis strategy offers considerable potential for advancing diverse areas of heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Molecular Domino Toppling for Directed Self&#8208;Erasing Information Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An azobenzene&#8208;based material with unprecedented light&#8208;pumped directional charge&#8208;transfer reminiscent of toppling dominoes is presented. After light&#8208;induced trans&#8594;cis forward isomerization, electron hopping occurs in a sequential and propagating manner between the cis isomers along with an electrocatalytic cis&#8594;trans backward isomerization. This repeatable, self&#8208;erasing domino information transfer is a groundbreaking new mechanism, suitable to process information on the molecular level.








Abstract
In the pursuit of more secure information transfer, advanced nanoelectronic technologies and nanomaterials must be developed. Here, a material is presented able to undergo an unprecedented light&#8208;pumped directional charge&#8208;transfer process reminiscent of toppling dominoes. The material is based on ortho&#8208;fluorinated azobenzene molecules which are organized in molecular rows by the regular array of a metal&#8211;organic framework. The azobenzene molecules undergo light&#8208;induced trans&#8594;cis forward as well as electrocatalytic cis&#8594;trans backward isomerization. The findings reveal that electron hopping occurs in a sequential and propagating manner between the light&#8208;generated cis isomers along with an isomerization of the sample to the trans&#8208;state. Thus, light can be used to locally write information, which subsequently can be read out by the transferred charge with simultaneous deletion of the information. This freely repeatable, self&#8208;erasing domino information transfer is a groundbreaking new mechanism to process information on the molecular level that may find application in encryption.

This repeatable, self-erasing domino information transfer is a groundbreaking new mechanism, suitable to process information on the molecular level.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pursuit of more secure information transfer, advanced nanoelectronic technologies and nanomaterials must be developed. Here, a material is presented able to undergo an unprecedented light-pumped directional charge-transfer process reminiscent of toppling dominoes. The material is based on &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-fluorinated azobenzene molecules which are organized in molecular rows by the regular array of a metal&#8211;organic framework. The azobenzene molecules undergo light-induced &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8594;&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; forward as well as electrocatalytic &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;&#8594;&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; backward isomerization. The findings reveal that electron hopping occurs in a sequential and propagating manner between the light-generated &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; isomers along with an isomerization of the sample to the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-state. Thus, light can be used to locally write information, which subsequently can be read out by the transferred charge with simultaneous deletion of the information. This freely repeatable, self-erasing domino information transfer is a groundbreaking new mechanism to process information on the molecular level that may find application in encryption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetically Switchable Adhesive Millirobots for Universal Manipulation in both Air and Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a series of millirobots with magnetically switchable adhesion, enabled by soft, double&#8208;reentrant micropillar arrays with side liquid&#8208;repellency. These millirobots can universally manipulate a wide range of targets in both air and water. Beyond transportation, they are capable of performing various complex tasks, such as circuit repair, precision assembly, and high&#8208;speed actuation in amphibious environments.








Abstract
Magnetic soft robots with multimodal locomotion have demonstrated significant potential for target manipulation tasks in hard&#8208;to&#8208;reach spaces in recent years. Achieving universal manipulation between robots and their targets requires a nondestructive and easily switchable interaction with broad applicability across diverse targets. However, establishing versatile and dynamic interactions between diverse targets and robotic systems remains a significant challenge. Herein, a series of magnetic millirobots capable of universal target manipulation with magnetically switchable adhesion is reported. Through two&#8208;photon lithography&#8208;assisted molding, magnetic soft double&#8208;reentrant micropillar arrays with liquid repellency are fabricated on the robots. These micropillar arrays can serve as switchable adhesion units for the millirobots to effectively manipulate targets of various geometries (0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D) in both air and water. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstrations, these adhesive robots can perform various complex tasks, including circuit repair, mini&#8208;turbine assembly, and high&#8208;speed underwater rotation of the turbine machine. This work may offer a versatile approach to magnetic manipulation of non&#8208;magnetic objects through amphibious adhesion, emerging as a new paradigm in robotic manipulation.

         <title>Electric&#8208;Field Regulation of Adhesion/De&#8208;Adhesion/Release Capacity of Transparent and Electrochromic Adhesive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conductive hydrogel with surface adhesion and electric field&#8208;triggered de&#8208;adhesion and release is fabricated from thioctic acid and L&#8208;arginine. The non&#8208;covalent intermolecular attractions not only endow the hydrogel with useful bulk&#8208;state properties and strong adhesion but also generate electric responsiveness for on&#8208;demand de&#8208;adhesion and release.








Abstract
Removing adhesive nondestructively and intact from the adhered surface is a difficult challenge for advanced adhesive materials. Compared with the commonly used thermal or chemical release, the controlled adhesive release via electric&#8208;field offers practical application advantages. However, a noninvasive release mode such as this has not been available for the de&#8208;bonding of supramolecular adhesives that originate from small organic molecules. Herein, a conductive hydrogel with surface adhesion and electric field&#8208;triggered de&#8208;adhesion and release is fabricated from thioctic acid (TA) and L&#8208;arginine (LA). The non&#8208;covalent intermolecular attractions of poly[TA&#8208;LA], especially its electrostatic interactions, not only endow it with useful bulk&#8208;state properties and strong adhesion (up to 363.3&#160;kPa) but also generate electric responsiveness for on&#8208;demand de&#8208;adhesion and release. The poly[TA&#8208;LA] adhesive layer can be easily released within a short time (&lt;60 s) under a mild voltage (5&#8776;10&#160;V). After a combined experimental and theoretical investigation, It is concluded that the adhesive&#8208;layer morphological and mechanical changes, activated by a weak current (1.1&#8776;3.2&#160;mA), are responsible for the adhesion failure, which takes place primarily at the anode. Importantly, rapid electric release of poly[TA&#8208;LA] is applicable at low temperatures (5 V, 60 s, &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C) or underwater (5 V, 60 s, 25&#160;&#176;C).

         <title>In Situ Impurity Phase Repair Strategy Enables Highly&#8208;Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells with Periodic Photovoltaic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite, ideal for high&#8208;efficiency solar cells, suffers from impurity phases causing defects and instability. Using FAI/MASCN vapors repairs impurities into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, enhancing charge transport and morphology. This achieves 26.05% efficiency, with large&#8208;area devices (24.52% for 1 cm2, 22.35% for 17.1 cm2). Cyclic repair retains 94.3% efficiency after two cycles, significantly boosting device durability.








Abstract
The photoactive &#945;&#8208;phase of formamidinium lead iodide perovskite (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) is regarded as one of the ideal materials for high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to its superior optoelectronic properties. However, during the deposition of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films, the presence of impurity phases, such as PbI2 and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3, can cause the formation of inherent defects, which leads to suboptimal charge transport and extraction properties, as well as inadequate long&#8208;term stability in the film's morphology and structure. To address these issues, an impurity phase repair strategy is employed using FAI/MASCN mixed vapors to convert the impurity phases into light&#8208;absorbing &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Meanwhile, this recrystallization process also facilitates the recovery of its characteristic morphology, thereby improving efficiency and enhancing the durability of PSCs. This approach promotes the PSCs to obtain an efficiency of 26.05% (with a certified efficiency of 25.67%, and steady&#8208;state PCE of 25.41%). Additionally, this approach is suitable for the fabrication of large&#8208;area devices, obtaining a 1 cm2 device with a PCE of 24.52% and a mini&#8208;module (with an area of 17.1 cm2) with a PCE of 22.35%. Furthermore, it is found that this strategy enables cyclic repair of aged perovskite films, with the perovskite solar cells retaining &#8776; 94.3% of their initial efficiency after two cycles of repair, significantly enhancing the lifetime of the perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Engineered Polar Topological Domains in Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative interfacial engineering strategy has been proposed to construct and modulate polar topological domains within ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals. These ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, featuring diverse and adjustable polar topological structures including vortex, centrifugal vortex, and center&#8208;divergent domains, hold significant potential for applications in the field of topological photonics.








Abstract
Polar topological domains, distinguished by their inherent topological protection and diverse optoelectronic functionalities, have recently attracted significant interest across scientific disciplines. However, the realization of these structures in inorganic materials is often impeded by crystal symmetry constraints. In this context, ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, characterized by spontaneous polarization and flexible polarization orientation, provide an exceptional platform for the development of polar topological domains. Despite their potential, a considerable challenge lies in identifying a straightforward yet versatile approach for engineering polar topological domains within liquid crystals. Here, this study presents an interfacial engineering strategy that effectively stabilizes a range of polar topological domains in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, including vortex, centrifugal vortex, and center&#8208;divergent configurations, by synergistically modulating the surface tension and interfacial tension. Utilizing a combination of experimental characterization and simulation, the role of anchoring energy is systematically investigated in the molecular alignment of liquid crystals and facilitates transitions between diverse topological structures. This research not only extends the horizons for constructing and manipulating polar topological domains but also enhances their prospective applications in topological photonics.

This research not only extends the horizons for constructing and manipulating polar topological domains but also enhances their prospective applications in topological photonics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Cancer metastasis begins with intravasation, a complex process involving cancer&#8208;endothelial interactions. INVADE (Intravasation&#8208;on&#8208;&#181;Device), a biomimetic microfluidic platform enables high&#8208;throughput analysis of intravasation under controlled conditions. This system reveals distinct invasion modes, an epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) &#8208; mesenchymal&#8208;epithelial transition (MET) switch, and endothelial suppression of mesenchymal traits. It also uncovers bilateral signaling, highlighting dynamic cancer&#8208;endothelial crosstalk with implications for metastasis research.

Abstract
Cancer metastasis begins with intravasation, where cancer cells enter blood vessels through complex interactions with the endothelial barrier. Understanding this process remains challenging due to the lack of physiologically relevant models. Here, INVADE (Intravasation&#8208;on&#8208;&#181;Device), a biomimetic microfluidic platform, is presented, enabling high&#8208;throughput analysis of cancer cell intravasation under controlled conditions. This engineered platform integrates 23 parallel niche chambers with an endothelialized channel, providing both precise microenvironmental control and optical accessibility for real&#8208;time visualization. Using this platform, distinct intravasation mechanisms are uncovered: MCF&#8208;7 cells exhibit collective invasion, while MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells demonstrate an interactive mode with three functionally distinct subpopulations. A previously unknown epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal&#8208;epithelial transition (MET) switch is We discovered during intravasation, where MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells initially increase Vimentin expression before undergoing a 2.3 fold decrease over 96 h alongside a 1.5 fold increase in epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). Remarkably, endothelial cells directly suppress cancer cell mesenchymal properties, as evidenced by a 4.6 fold reduction in Vimentin expression compared to mono&#8208;cultures. Additionally, bilateral cancer&#8208;endothelial interactions are revealed, aggressive cancer cells induce significant intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;1 (ICAM&#8208;1) upregulation in endothelium. The INVADE platform represents an engineering advancement for studying complex cell&#8211;cell interactions with implications for understanding metastatic mechanisms.

         <title>Mitigating Surface Energy and Core&#8208;Shell Interface Strain of Yb3+&#8208;Doped ZnSe&#8208;Based Quantum Dots for Pure&#8208;Blue Emission QLED Devices</title>

Breaking Quantum Confinement in Yb3&#8314;&#8208;Doped ZnSe QDs: Surface&#8208;energy engineering enables scalable growth beyond the exciton Bohr radius with high&#8208;purity blue emission (453 nm), narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 46 nm, and exceptional photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 67.5%. 








Abstract
Large ZnSe quantum dots (QDs) with an emission peak &#8776;450&#160;nm hold significant promise for display technologies. However, achieving efficient pure&#8208;blue emission through the enlargement of ZnSe nanocrystals remains a significant challenge. In this study, a breakthrough is reported in growing large&#8208;size ZnSe QDs well beyond the exciton Bohr radius through Yb3+ doping strategy. Yb3+ doping reduces the surface energy of the ZnSe (220) crystal plane and alleviates interface strain in the ZnSe/ZnS structure, enabling the QDs to grow larger while maintaining enhanced crystal stability. The resulting Yb: ZnSe/ZnS QDs exhibit pure&#8208;blue emission at 453&#160;nm, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 46&#160;nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 67.5%. When integrated into quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), the devices display electroluminescence (EL) at 455&#160;nm, with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.35%, and a maximum luminance of 1337.08&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>Gambogic Acid Based Coordination Polymer Reinforces High&#8208;Intensity Focused Ultrasound Treatment of Gynecologic Malignancies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>

The study developed GAZn&#8208;PEG nanoparticles&#160;(GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs) that synergize with HIFU to enhance anti&#8208;tumor immunity. GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs reduce HSP&#8208;90 expression, promote dendritic cell maturation, and activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, amplifying immune stimulation. Combined with HIFU, GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs eradicated local tumors and induced durable systemic immunity, effectively suppressing metastasis and recurrence.









Abstract
High&#8208;intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is emerging as a promising non&#8208;invasive treatment for solid tumors. Nevertheless, HIFU may also induce the upregulation of Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP&#8208;90), potentially resulting in resistance to HIFU. Besides, although it is effective against in situ tumors, challenges remain with tumor metastasis and recurrence. Herein, the innovative design of gambogic acid (GA) based coordination polymer&#8212;GAZn&#8208;PEG nanoparticles (GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs) are synthesized through the coordination of GA with zinc ions (Zn2+), and subsequently functionalized with lipid bilayer incorporating polyethylene glycol (PEG), sensitizing HIFU for the treatment of cervical and ovarian cancers. Briefly, under HIFU exposure, GA markedly suppresses the expression of HSP&#8208;90, thereby increasing the tumor's sensitivity to HIFU therapy. Furthermore, Zn2+ not only overcome the issue of GA's poor water solubility but also synergistically stimulate immune responses in conjunction with GA. More intriguingly, it has been discovered that GAZn&#8208;PEG can effectively activate the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of the interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway, thereby enhancing the immune responses provoked by HIFU. Specifically, GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs show a remarkable increase in dendritic cell activation and the effective stimulation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, crucial for long&#8208;term protection against tumor recurrence and metastasis.

         <title>On&#8208;Chip Active Non&#8208;Reciprocal Topological Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;compact and efficient on&#8208;chip isolator is experimentally demonstrated by integrating magneto&#8208;optical InSb onto a terahertz silicon topological chip. The simultaneous breaking of spatial and temporal reversal symmetries forms a valley&#8208;conserved non&#8208;reciprocal waveguide mode, enabling a compact cavity size of 6.4 &#215; 2.5&#955;2 and a low insertion loss of 2.6 dB, with actively tunable isolation ratios up to 64.3 dB.








Abstract
Chip&#8208;scale non&#8208;reciprocity is essential for advancing integrated photonics, particularly in realizing photonic circulators and isolators for data communication, signal modulation, and quantum computing. However, achieving a non&#8208;reciprocal silicon chip with a small footprint, high isolation ratio, low loss, and active control remains a challenge. Here, a non&#8208;reciprocal topological silicon chip based on magneto&#8208;optical Indium Antimonide (InSb) integrated valley Hall system is reported. The valley&#8208;conserved non&#8208;reciprocal modes, realized by breaking both time&#8208;reversal and spatial&#8208;inversion symmetries, enable ultra&#8208;compact and efficient non&#8208;reciprocal photonic devices that outperform conventional chips. A maximum isolation ratio of 64.3&#160;dB and a low chip loss of 2.6&#160;dB is experimentally achieved by fine&#8208;tuning the non&#8208;reciprocal critical coupling points of a topological cavity with a small footprint of 6.4 &#215; 2.5&#955;2. An all&#8208;optical method is also applied to actively modulate the isolation ratio from 0 to 48&#160;dB. The development of a non&#8208;reciprocal topological silicon chip marks a pivotal advancement in communication systems, LiDAR, terahertz technologies, quantum computing, and cryptography.

         <title>Spontaneous Twist of Ferroelectric Smectic Blocks in Polar Fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral ground state of ferroelectric smectric is discovered which emerges in an achiral rod mesogen. This is not due to the torque&#8208;driven effect on the surface. The research confirms that the polar smectric blocks are twisted despite its high elasticity. Such a structure is predominantly generated in molecules with larger dipole moments, smaller dipole angles, and smaller aspect ratios.








Abstract
In soft matter, the polar orientational order of molecules can facilitate the coexistence of structural chirality and ferroelectricity. The ferroelectric nematic (NF) state, exhibited by achiral calamitic molecules with large dipole moments, serves as an ideal model for the emergence of spontaneous structural chirality. This chiral ground state arises from a left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed twist of polarization due to depolarization effects. In contrast, the ferroelectric smectic state, characterized by a polar lamellar structure with lower symmetry, experiences significantly higher energy associated with layer&#8208;twisting deformations and the formation of domain walls, thus avoiding a continuously twisted layered structure. In this study, two types of achiral molecules (BOE&#8208;NO2 and DIOLT) are reported that possess different molecular structures but exhibit a NF&#8211;ferroelectric smectic phase sequence. It is demonstrated that the chiral ground state of NF is inherited in the ferroelectric smectic phases of BOE&#8208;NO2, which features larger dipole moments and a steric hindrance moiety, thereby triggering the formation of the twisted polar smectic blocks.

         <title>Suppression of Stacking Faults for Stable Formamidinium&#8208;Rich Perovskite Absorbers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors show that the (011)C perovskite planes are prone to stacking faults formation in all leading formamidinium&#8208;rich perovskite compositions. Using ethylene thiourea as a precursor additive, Othman et&#160;al. suppress those vulnerable facets, significantly enhancing the absorber's intrinsic stability under various operational conditions.









Abstract
The poor intrinsic perovskite absorber stability is arguably a central limitation challenging the prospect of commercialization for photovoltaic (PV) applications. Understanding the nanoscopic structural features that trigger instabilities in perovskite materials is essential to mitigate device degradation. Using nanostructure characterization techniques, we observe the local degradation to be initiated by material loss at stacking faults, forming inherently in the (011)&#8208;faceted perovskite domains in different formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite compositions. We introduce Ethylene Thiourea (ETU) as an additive into the perovskite precursor, which manipulates the perovskite crystal growth and results in dominantly in&#8208;and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (001) oriented perovskite domains. Combining in&#8208;depth experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations, we find that ETU lowered the perovskite formation energy, readily enabling crystallization of the perovskite phase at room temperature without the need for an antisolvent quenching step. This facilitated the fabrication of high&#8208;quality large area 5 cm by 5 cm blade&#8208;coated perovskite films and devices. Encapsulated and unmasked ETU&#8208;treated devices, with an active area of 0.2 cm2, retained &gt; 93 % of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) for &gt; 2100 hours at room temperature, and additionally, 1 cm2 ETU&#8208;treated devices maintained T80 (the duration for the PCE to decay to 80 % of the initial value) for &gt; 600 hours at 65 &#176;C, under continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination at the maximum power point in ambient conditions. Our demonstration of scalable and stable perovskite solar cells represents a promising step towards achieving a reliable perovskite PV technology.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance 721 nm&#8208;Excitable Photon Upconversion Porous Aromatic Frameworks for Broad&#8208;Range Oxygen Sensing and Efficient Heterogeneous Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance 721 nm&#8208;excitable solid upconversion porous aromatic frameworks (UC PAFs) was constructed and applied to a broad&#8208;range oxygen sensing and efficient heterogeneous photoredox catalysis. Moreover, homogeneous triple exciton energy is recognized to facilitate exciton diffusion, resulting in a high upconversion quantum yield (1.5% with an upper limit of 50%).








Abstract
The development of long&#8208;wavelength excitable solid upconversion materials and the regulation of exciton behavior is important for solar energy harvesting, photocatalysis, and other emerging applications. However, the approaches for regulating exciton diffusion are very limited, resulting in extremely poor photonic upconversion performance in solid&#8208;state. Here, the annihilation unit is integrated into porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) and loaded with photosensitizer to construct efficient 721 nm&#8208;excitable solid upconversion material (upconversion quantum yield up to 1.5%, upper limit 50%). Most importantly, we found that the steric hindrance of annihilator units breaks the &#960;&#8208;conjugation between the annihilation unit and the PAFs framework to form the homogeneous triplet exciton energy, which is conducive to the exciton diffusion. After increasing the exciton diffusion constant from 2.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6 to 1.34&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 cm2 s&#8722;1, the upconversion quantum yield is increased &#8776; 50&#8208;fold. Further, this solid upconversion material is utilized to demonstrate, for the first time, a broad&#8208;range oxygen sensing and 721 nm&#8208;driven heterogeneous and recyclable photoredox catalysis. These findings provide an important approach for regulating the behavior of triplet exciton in disorder solid materials to gain better upconversion performance, which will advance practical applications of organic photon upconversion in energy, chemistry, and photonics.

         <title>Revealing Trapped Carrier Dynamics at Buried Interfaces in Perovskite Solar Cells via Infrared&#8208;Modulated Action Spectroscopy with Surface Photovoltage Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new spectroscopy technique (i.e., pump&#8208;push&#8208;surface photovoltage) is introduced that monitors trapped carrier dynamics at the buried interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) via combining optical trap activation by infrared light with surface photovoltage detection. The proposed new approach separates interfacial carrier&#8208;loss contributions from the top and buried surfaces, providing design insights for achieving high&#8208;performance PeSCs through interface optimization. 








Abstract
Interfacial engineering is a proven strategy to enhance the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) by controlling surface electronic defects and carrier trapping. The trap states at the &#8220;top&#8221; interface between the perovskite and upper charge extraction layers are experimentally accessible and have been extensively studied. However, the understanding of the unexposed &#8220;bottom&#8221; surface of the perovskite layer remains elusive, due to the lack of selective and non&#8208;destructive tools to access buried interface. Here, a new spectroscopy technique is introduced that monitors nanosecond to millisecond dynamics of trapped carriers at the buried interfaces by combining optical trap activation by infrared light with surface photovoltage detection. Applied to various PeSC architectures, this method reveals that most interfacial traps reside between the perovskite and hole transport layer, suggesting a predominance of hole traps (e.g., cation and lead vacancies) over electron traps (e.g., halide vacancies) in the studied PeSC systems. The proposed new approach separates interfacial carrier&#8208;loss contributions from the top and buried surfaces, providing design insights for achieving high&#8208;performance PeSCs through interface optimization.

         <title>Thermally Activated Swelling and Wetting Transition of Frozen Polymer Brushes:a New Concept for Surface Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach is introduced that&#160;leverages polymer phase transitions to modulate brush behavior. The oleophilic bottle brush system exhibits two distinct melting transitions&#8212;bulk and surface&#8212;enabling a two&#8208;stage swelling and wetting transition. These transitions can be controlled globally, or locally with a focused laser beam, offering a new strategy for designing adaptive surfaces based on intrinsic polymer properties.









Abstract
Functional polymer brush coatings have great potential for various industrial applications thanks to their ability to adapt to environmental stimuli, providing tunable surface properties. While existing approaches rely on polymer&#8208;solvent interactions and their response to external stimuli, changes in the intrinsic physical properties of the polymer also play a critical role in modulating brush behavior. In this context, the melting transition of a semicrystalline oleophilic poly&#8208;octadecylmethacrylate (P18MA) brush coating is shown to drive a swelling and wetting transition upon exposure to various liquid alkanes. The top surface of this polymer displays a somewhat higher melting temperature than the bulk, enabling separate control of the bulk&#8208;driven swelling and surface&#8208;driven wetting transitions. Laser&#8208;induced heating enables reversible on&#8208;demand activation of both transitions with micrometer lateral resolution. These findings suggest a new concept of polymer brush&#8208;based functional surfaces that allow for controlled fluid transport via separately switchable surface barriers and bulk transport layers based on a suitable choice of polymer&#8208;polymer and polymer&#8208;solvent interactions.

         <title>Evidence of Cation Symmetry Reduction Induced Bulk Photovoltaic Effect in Metal&#8208;Free Perovskite for Efficient Self&#8208;Powered X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between the bulk photovoltaic effect and cation symmetry is systematically investigated, leading to the first realization of a self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detector in metal&#8208;free perovskites. Reduced cation symmetry enhances both the dipole moment and crystal polarity, facilitating carrier migration while simultaneously passivating defects. Leveraging the nonlinear photocurrent response mechanism, the X&#8208;ray detector achieves ultra&#8208;high equivalent sensitivity at zero bias.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free perovskite (MFP) X&#8208;ray detectors have attracted attention due to biocompatibility and synthesizability. However, the necessity of high voltages for MFP X&#8208;ray detectors affects stability and safety. Although, the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) with spontaneous electric field is a potential alternative for X&#8208;ray detection without high voltage, the constitutive relationship of BPVE in MFP remains unclear. Herein, the relationship between BPVE and cation symmetry is explored, and a self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detector is realized by BPVE in MFP for the first time. Theoretical studies show that cation symmetry reduction can distort the halide octahedron in one direction, which increases the dipole moment and crystal polarity to induce BPVE. The electric field from crystal polarity can drive the defect passivation by the equilibrium carrier and enhance the nonequilibrium carrier performance for BPVE. Then, polar MFP (mPAZE&#8208;NH4Br3 H2O) with excellent BPVE is designed. Due to the nonlinear response, the detector obtains a numerically recorded equivalent sensitivity (&#8776;103 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) at 0&#160;V. Moreover, the imaging performance is demonstrated and two image convolution kernels for it are constructed. Finally, it features continuous operation (20000 s) and temperature stability (&#8208;55&#8211;250 &#176;C). It is believed that the method will further drive the application of MFP for X&#8208;ray detectors.

         <title>Electron Extraction Optimization for Carbon&#8208;Based Hole&#8208;Conductor&#8208;Free Perovskite Photovoltaics With Record 1.41&#160;V VOC</title>

A gradient electron energy level strategy is constructed to reduce voltage losses in planar HTL&#8208;free CsPbI2Br C&#8208;PSCs. This electron extraction optimization enables rapid photogenerated electron extraction and carrier separation, thereby suppressing recombination at the back contact. The resulting PSCs deliver a record VOC of 1.41 V, a high PCE of 17.42% and a high stability, simultaneously.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells (PSCs) free of a hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL) have emerged as promising photovoltaics due to their low processing cost and superior stability. However, the voltage deficit resulting from inefficient carrier extraction causes insufficient power conversion efficiency (PCE), severely hindering their progress. Here, a gradient electron energy level modulation strategy proves effective in reducing voltage losses through the rapid extraction of photogenerated electrons. This process enhances carrier separation/collection and reduces recombination at the back contact, thereby achieving high&#8208;performance photovoltaics. It is demonstrated that the front electron extraction, equally critical as the prevailing back perovskite/carbon contact, accounts for the significant contributing factor of voltage deficit in carbon&#8208;based HTL&#8208;free PSCs. The resulting PSCs deliver a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.41&#160;V and a PCE of 17.42% and retain more than 92% of their initial efficiency after 1, 000&#160;h. These results highlight the significant potential of carbon&#8208;based HTL&#8208;free perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Time&#8208;Division Multiplexing Physical Unclonable Functions Based on Multicolor Phosphorescent Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A time&#8208;division multiplexing physical unclonable function (TDM&#8208;PUF) label based on multicolor phosphorescent carbon dots (CDs) is proposed, which leverages the variations in wavelengths and lifetimes of the phosphorescent CDs to construct time&#8208;resolved multidimensional cryptographic protocols. This study provides a competitive anti&#8208;counterfeiting label and inspires the development of novel anti&#8208;counterfeiting strategies.








Abstract
Phosphorescent materials offer a promising approach to information encryption due to their long luminescence lifetimes and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios. However, fixed phosphorescent patterns are vulnerable to imitation over time, limiting their effectiveness in advanced encryption. Here, a time&#8208;division multiplexing physical unclonable function (TDM&#8208;PUF) label utilizing multicolor phosphorescent carbon dots (CDs) is proposed that leverages variations in wavelength and lifetime to construct time&#8208;resolved, multidimensional cryptographic protocols. Efficient multi&#8208;color phosphorescence in CDs is achieved by enhancing intersystem crossing, suppressing non&#8208;radiative transitions through confinement effects, and regulating emission spectra via energy transfer. The random spatial distribution and unpredictable emissions of phosphorescent CDs significantly enhance the complexity of the PUF system, thereby fortifying its defenses against mimicry attacks. Furthermore, this PUF system exhibits multiple optical responses over time, allowing correct information recognition only at specified time nodes, achieving time&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Finally, by segmenting PUF labels based on emission color and time channels, non&#8208;overlapping multicolor and multi&#8208;time segments are achieved, enabling highly secure time&#8208;division multiplexed encryption.

     alt="Time-Division Multiplexing Physical Unclonable Functions Based on Multicolor Phosphorescent Carbon Dots"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A time-division multiplexing physical unclonable function (TDM-PUF) label based on multicolor phosphorescent carbon dots (CDs) is proposed, which leverages the variations in wavelengths and lifetimes of the phosphorescent CDs to construct time-resolved multidimensional cryptographic protocols. This study provides a competitive anti-counterfeiting label and inspires the development of novel anti-counterfeiting strategies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphorescent materials offer a promising approach to information encryption due to their long luminescence lifetimes and high signal-to-noise ratios. However, fixed phosphorescent patterns are vulnerable to imitation over time, limiting their effectiveness in advanced encryption. Here, a time-division multiplexing physical unclonable function (TDM-PUF) label utilizing multicolor phosphorescent carbon dots (CDs) is proposed that leverages variations in wavelength and lifetime to construct time-resolved, multidimensional cryptographic protocols. Efficient multi-color phosphorescence in CDs is achieved by enhancing intersystem crossing, suppressing non-radiative transitions through confinement effects, and regulating emission spectra via energy transfer. The random spatial distribution and unpredictable emissions of phosphorescent CDs significantly enhance the complexity of the PUF system, thereby fortifying its defenses against mimicry attacks. Furthermore, this PUF system exhibits multiple optical responses over time, allowing correct information recognition only at specified time nodes, achieving time-resolved anti-counterfeiting. Finally, by segmenting PUF labels based on emission color and time channels, non-overlapping multicolor and multi-time segments are achieved, enabling highly secure time-division multiplexed encryption. The study provides a competitive anti-counterfeiting label and inspires the development of novel anti-counterfeiting strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Porous Single&#8208;Crystalline Molybdenum Nitride Monoliths at the Centimeter Scale Surpass Platinum for all pH Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;sized porous single&#8208;crystalline MoN monoliths with unsaturated Mo&#8211;N coordination structures are fabricated through solid&#8208;state phase transformation. The porous single&#8208;crystalline MoN integrates the structural features, suitable hydrogen adsorption energy, high electronic conductivity and intrinsic catalytic activity, demonstrating low Tafel slopes, minimal charge transfer resistances and long&#8208;term stability across all&#8208;pH conditions, significantly surpassing traditional Pt/C electrodes.








Abstract
Platinum is widely used in the important components in most electrochemical energy conversion systems while as a noble metal it faces the inevitable challenge of limited reserves. Herein, porous single&#8211;crystalline (PSC) molybdenum nitride (MoN) monoliths are reported at the centimeter scale that surpass platinum for all&#8211;pH hydrogen evolution. Free&#8211;standing PSC MoN electrode with the pore size of &#8776;6&#160;nm and porosity of &#8776;72% present both noble&#8211;metal&#8211;like electronic structure and unsaturated Mo&#9472;N coordination structures at surface, contributing to remarkably high intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. The unprecedented overpotentials of as low as 13 and 11&#160;mV are presented at the geometrical current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution in H2SO4 (pH 0) and KOH (pH 14) media, respectively, which is dramatically superior to commercial Pt electrodes. As a result of the structural stability, the outstanding long&#8211;term durability for all pH hydrogen evolution is demonstrated without visible degradation in a continuous operation for 300&#160;h.

         <title>Energy Transfer Loop Enables Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with &gt;20% EQE and Near&#8208;Zero Roll&#8208;Offs at 104 Nits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence diodes with the record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.8% and the record&#8208;low EQE roll&#8208;off of only 2.6% at 104 nits is first realized through an &#8220;energy transfer loop&#8221; strategy, in which a TADF sensitizer 24DDMACPPPO with vibration&#8208;free reverse intersystem crossing is used to displace TADF emitter in triplet&#8208;singlet up&#8208;conversion for phonon decoupling, leading to markedly enhanced radiation and suppressed quenching.








Abstract
The bottleneck in efficiency stability at high luminance limits the development of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) diodes, due to the insufficient management of quenching factors, especially exciton&#8208;phonon coupling during reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) assistant with vibrational coupling. Herein, this challenge is overcome by a TADF sensitizer based &#8220;energy transfer loop&#8221; strategy. A dimethylacridine&#8208;phosphole oxide hybrid sensitizer named 24DDMACPPPO is constructed with vibration&#8208;free RISC and excited&#8208;state energy levels equal to a TADF emitter 4CzTPNBu. The former displaces the latter in RISC for phonon decoupling through reverse triplet and positive singlet energy transfer between them. As a result, co&#8208;doping 0&#160;.1%wt. 24DDMACPPPO doubles the RISC rate constant and triples the singlet radiation rate of 4CzTPNBu, and simultaneously nearly halves non&#8208;radiation rate constants, giving rise to 70% and 90% increased photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;luminescence quantum efficiencies of 4CzTPNBu. More importantly, the energy transfer loop between 24DDMACPPPO and 4CzTPNBu combines their advantages in RISC, quenching suppression, and singlet radiation, giving rise to the record values of external quantum efficiency (&#8776;23%wt.) and roll&#8208;off (2.6%) at 104&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Large&#8208;Area Perovskite Solar Cells via a Multifunctional Crystallization Regulating Passivation Additive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chlorine&#8208;substituted aromatic polycyclic compound is introduced into perovskite solar cells to regulate perovskite crystallization, passivate various defects, and enhance hole transport at the HTL/perovskite interface. This approach achieved high efficiencies of 25.04% for 1 cm2 cells and 22.81% for 12 cm2 modules, with excellent stability (maintaining 80% of initial efficiency after 2500 h of MPP tracking under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 standards).








Abstract
Film morphology and surface/interface defect density play a critical role in determining the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a chlorine&#8208;substituted aromatic polycyclic derivative (BNCl) is reported, which shows strong interaction with both lead iodide and dimethyl sulfoxide, to regulate the crystallization of perovskite, along with effective passivation of grain boundaries and surface. In addition, the extruded BNCl molecule at the hole transport layer (HTL)/perovskite interface can facilitate the hole transport, leading to better charge transfer. As a result, certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.04% and 22.81% are achieved for PSCs and minimodules with aperture areas of 1 cm2 and 12 cm2 respectively. In addition, the device maintained 80% of its initial efficiency after 2500 h of maximum power point (MPP) tracking under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 standard.

         <title>Synergistic Interface Engineering via o&#8208;Difluorobenzene&#8208;Mediated HPWO Crystallization and ITO Fluorination for 20.57% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;action optimization strategy is developed combining the fluorination of ITO electrodes with precisely controlled crystallization of phosphotungstic acid, which establishes favorable energy level alignment and reduces interface trap density to obtain 20.57% efficiency of organic solar cells.








Abstract
Interfacial energy loss is a critical challenge in achieving high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs), primarily due to mismatched energy levels and inefficient charge collection. Herein, a bifunctional interface engineering strategy is proposed, employing an ethanol/o&#8208;difluorobenzene (EtOH/o&#8208;DFB) dual&#8208;solvent system for phosphotungstic acid (HPWO) processing. During film formation, o&#8208;DFB regulates HPWO crystallization by suppressing excessive aggregation, while enabling in situ ITO fluorination through the adsorbed o&#8208;DFB. This synergistic approach simultaneously mitigates the trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination at the hole transport layer while enhancing the electrode work function, resulting in better ohmic contact, minimized trap&#8208;state densities, and improved energy level alignment at the electrode/active layer interface. The effectiveness of this strategy is demonstrated across multiple active layer systems. Remarkable power conversion efficiencies of 19.55%, 20.07%, and 20.57% are achieved for PM6/L8&#8208;BO, D18/L8&#8208;BO, and D18/BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based OSCs, respectively. Notably, the 20.57% PCE represents one of the highest efficiencies reported to date for OSCs, highlighting the potential of this bifunctional interface engineering strategy in advancing high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaics.

         <title>O, S, and N Bridged Atoms Screening on 2D Conjugated Central Units of High&#8208;Performance Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
O, S, and N atoms are adopted to bridge the 2D conjugated central cores, yielding three acceptors of CH&#9472;O, CH&#9472;S, and CH&#9472;N. CH&#9472;N&#8208;based device affords the highest fill factor of 83.13% in organic photovoltaics and the first&#8208;class binary device efficiency of 20.23%.








Abstract
Almost all of central cores in high&#8208;performance acceptors are limited to the electron&#8208;withdrawing diimide structure currently, which constrains further acceptor structural innovation greatly. Herein, oxygen (O), sulfur (S), and nitrogen (N) atoms are adopted to bridge the 2D conjugated central cores, yielding three acceptor platforms of CH&#9472;O, CH&#9472;S, and CH&#9472;N that differ in structure by only two atoms. Because of the characteristic atomic outer electron configuration and hybrid orbital orientation, O&#8208;, S&#8208;, and N&#8208;bridged central cores display quite different conformations and electronic properties, namely, dibenzodioxin (planar, non&#8208;aromatic), thianthrene (puckered, non&#8208;aromatic) and phenazine (planar, aromatic), respectively. A systematic investigation discloses how the central core, especially its p&#8208;&#960; orbital overlap between lone pair on O/S/N and coterminous benzene planes, affect the intrinsic photoelectronic properties of acceptors for the first time. Finally, CH&#9472;N&#8208;based binary device affords the highest fill factor of 83.13% in organic photovoltaics along with a first&#8208;class efficiency of 20.23%. By evaluating the strictly controlled O&#8208;, S&#8208;, and N&#8208;bridged molecular platforms comprehensively, the work reveals the potential uniqueness of diimide in determining the excellent photovoltaic outcomes of acceptors.

         <title>Microbial Photosynthetic Oxygenation and Radiotherapeutic Sensitization Enables Pyroptosis Induction for Combinatorial Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the preparation of lanthanum oxide nanoparticles (La2O3 NPs) via a solid&#8208;phase synthesis method, combined with cyanobacteria (Cyan) to effectively alleviate hypoxia. These components are confined within the tumor microenvironment using a thermosensitive hydrogel, enhancing the sensitivity of radiotherapy for colorectal and lung cancers. By alleviating hypoxia through cyanobacteria&#8208;mediated photosynthetic oxygenation, La2O3 NPs not only promote reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, triggering pyroptosis via GSDMD activation, but also amplify radiotherapy&#8208;induced pyroptosis mediated by GSDME. This dual mechanism provides a powerful strategy to overcome hypoxia&#8208;induced radiotherapy resistance in colorectal and lung cancers.








Abstract
Rectal cancer surgery is challenging due to the complex anatomy, making it difficult to achieve clear surgical margins. Radiotherapy (RT) plays a crucial role, especially in treating locally recurrent rectal cancer and preserving anal function. However, its effectiveness is often limited by tumor hypoxia, particularly prevalent in hypoxic regions near the bowel wall in colorectal cancer. Hypoxia contributes to both radiation resistance and apoptosis resistance, compromising RT outcomes. To overcome hypoxia&#8208;driven radiotherapy resistance, this work designs and engineers a radiotherapy&#8208;sensitizing bioplatform for efficient cancer RT. It combines lanthanum oxide nanoparticles (La2O3 NPs) with cyanobacteria, which produces oxygen through photosynthesis. This bioplatform uniquely reduces tumor hypoxia, enhances radiation deposition, and improves RT efficacy. La2O3 NPs further enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) production induced by radiation, triggering pyroptosis via the ROS&#8208;NLRP3&#8208;GSDMD pathway, while RT amplifies pyroptosis through GSDME, circumventing tumor apoptosis resistance. The further integrated thermosensitive hydrogels ensure precise localization of the bioplatform, reducing systemic toxicity and improving therapeutic specificity. Compared to conventional therapies, this dual&#8208;action system addresses hypoxia, RT resistance, and apoptosis resistance more effectively. In vivo and in vitro hypoxia models validate its potent anti&#8208;tumor efficacy, offering valuable insights for refining clinical treatment paradigms.

         <title>AI&#8208;Generated Ammonium Ligands for High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable 2D/3D Heterojunction Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning procedure combined with an artificial intelligence (AI) model are used to accelerate the generation of ammonium ligands (ALs) in 2D perovskites. The relationship between the carrier transport barrier and the structure of ALs is explored. Utilizing the AI&#8208;designed ALs significantly enhances the carrier transport of the 2D perovskites, leading to high&#8208;efficiency and stable 2D/3D perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The 2D/3D heterojunction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit remarkable stability, but the quantum well in the 2D perovskite capping layer hinders the carrier transport, thereby lowering the power conversion efficiency (PCE). The relationship between the transport barrier and the complex structure of ammonium ligands (ALs) is currently poorly understood, thus leading to the one&#8208;sided approach and inefficient process in the development of 2D perovskite. Here, a machine learning procedure is established to comprehensively explore the relationship and combined it with an artificial intelligence (AI) model based on reinforcement learning algorithm to accelerate the generation of ALs. Finally, the AI&#8208;designed ALs improved the carrier transport performance of the 2D perovskite capping layer, and we achieved a certified PCE of 26.12% in inverted PSCs. The devices retained 96.79% of the initial PCE after 2000 h operation in maximum power point tracking under 1&#8208;sun illumination at 85&#176;C.

         <title>Highly Defective Ultrafine Carbon Nanoreactors Enriched with Edge&#8208;Type Zn&#8208;N3P1 Moiety Boosting Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous&#8208;dominant carbon nanoreactor is designed with dimensions in the range of 15&#8211;43 nm with edge&#8208;rich defective atomic Zn sites. The crystal size and pore diameter of this carbon nanoreactors can be precisely adjusted to enable tunable mass diffusion pathways and porosities. The hydrophobic nature of 25 nm nanoreactors maximizes the nonkinetic advantages of active site exposure and rapid O2 mass transfer at the triple&#8208;phase interface.








Abstract
High&#8208;active nonplatinum group metal oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts have great potential to improve fuel cell and metal&#8211;air battery performance due to their efficiency and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, a fundamental understanding of their size&#8208;dependent structure&#8211;performance relationships remain elusive. Here a mesoporous&#8208;dominant carbon nanoreactor with dimensions in the range of 15&#8211;43 nm with edge&#8208;rich defective atomic Zn sites is designed. The crystal size and pore diameter of this carbon nanoreactors can be precisely adjusted to enable tunable mass diffusion pathways and porosities. Importantly, the hydrophobic nature of 25 nm nanoreactors maximizes the nonkinetic advantages of active site exposure and rapid O2 mass transfer at the triple&#8208;phase interface. The developed Zn&#8208;N&#8208;P/NPC catalysts delivers outstanding alkaline and acidic ORR performance with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.92 and 0.80 V, respectively, as well as excellent zinc&#8211;air battery performance with charge/discharge over 400 h under 20 mA cm&#8722;2. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations indicate that the enhanced ORR catalytic activity of Zn&#8208;N&#8208;P/NPC stems from the introduction of P atoms and edge carbon defects effectively exciting the localized electronic asymmetric distribution of Zn species. The findings provide new perspectives on the size effect of porous carbon supports for the development of efficient cathodes catalysts with multifunctionality.

         <title>Customized Multifunctional Additive Regulates 1.67 eV&#8208;Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Crystallization for Four&#8208;Terminal Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>

A doping strategy of incorporating Bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene (BTFIB) additive in 1.67 eV WBG perovskite precursor has been proposed to passivate uncoordinated lead ions and iodide vacancies and retard the crystallization of perovskite. Finally, BTFIB&#8208;based perovskite solar cells yielded a champion efficiency of 23.05% (certified 22.21%) and enabled a four&#8208;terminal perovskite/Si tandem cell with a PCE of 31.20% and excellent long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs, Eg &gt;&#160;1.6&#160;eV), serving as the top cell in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (PSTSCs), play an indispensable role in absorbing high energy photons and increasing overall efficiency. However, WBG PSCs often suffer from severe light&#8208;induced phase segregation and significant non&#8208;radiative recombination losses due to uncontrolled rapid crystallization. Here, polyfluoride molecular additives are designed and incorporated via (diacetoxyiodo)benzene into WBG perovskite, to regulate crystallization process of perovskite films and thereby reduce defects. (Bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene (BTFIB) can passivate uncoordinated lead ions and iodide vacancies, thereby inhibiting phase separation caused by iodide migration and reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination loss during charge transport. Moreover, the introduction of BTFIB can effectively moderate the film formation process and confer excellent hydrophobic properties to the films. Consequently, BTFIB&#8208;based 1.67 eV&#8208;WBG perovskite devices yield a champion efficiency of 23.05% (certified efficiency of 22.21%), enabling a 31.20% efficiency in four&#8208;terminal PSTSCs, along with excellent open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.246&#160;V and fill factor of 85.34%. After 2500&#160;h of aging in a glovebox, the device retained 80% of its initial efficiency.

         <title>Atomic Insights Into Self&#8208;Assembly of Zingibroside R1 and its Therapeutic Action Against Fungal Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cryo&#8208;EM reveals Zingibroside R1 (ZR1) undergoes self&#8208;assemble helical nanofibrils. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding interface between ZR1 nanofibrils and glucan compromises membrane integrity, inhibiting C. albicans proliferation in vitro and in vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) model mice in vivo. ZR1 gel could also deliver probiotic Lactobacillus to restore the vaginal microenvironment, synergistically inhibiting VVC.








Abstract
Natural products are a crucial resource for drug discovery, but poor understanding of the molecular&#8208;scale mechanisms of their self&#8208;assembly into soluble, bioavailable hydrogels limits their applications and therapeutic potential. It is demonstrated that Zingibroside R1 (ZR1), derived from Panax notoginseng, undergoes spontaneous self&#8208;assemble into a hydrogel comprising helical nanofibrils with potent antifungal activity lacking in its monomeric state. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) revealed an intricate hydrogen&#8208;bonding network that facilitates ZR1 nanofibril formation, characterized by a hydrophobic core and hydrophilic exterior architecture, which underpin its binding activity with cell wall in the vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) pathogen, C. albicans. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding interface between ZR1 gel and glucan compromises membrane integrity, inhibiting C. albicans proliferation in vitro and in VVC model mice in vivo. ZR1 gel could also deliver probiotic Lactobacillus, synergistically inhibiting VVC and restoring the vaginal microenvironment. This study advances the mechanistic understanding of ZR1's structure&#8208;function relationships, offering valuable insights into the rational design and therapeutic optimization of natural product&#8208;based hydrogels.

         <title>Optimization of Core&#8211;Shell Ternary Electrodes for High&#8208;Performance Ionic Actuator in Soft Gripper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8211;shell ternary electrode (Opt&#8208;SWCNTs/PEDOT:PSS/IL) is developed via a simple two&#8208;step dispersion and vacuum filtration process, with component ratios optimized to achieve excellent mechanical toughness and electrical conductivity based on simulation results. The resulting actuators demonstrate high strain and blocking force, enabling precise gripping and complex deformation, showing great potential for soft robotics and next&#8208;generation electrochemical actuators.








Abstract
Ionic actuators based on composite electrodes consisting of nanomaterials and conducting polymer typically offer the advantages of low&#8208;voltage operation and high stability, however, electrode preparation using conventional mixing suffers from issues of ineffective dispersion of nanomaterials, greatly diminishing their synergistic effects. Here, the ternary electrode system based on SWCNTs/PEDOT: PSS/ionic liquid using the two&#8208;step dispersion process is optimized, achieving a uniformly coated core&#8211;shell structure with high conductivity (&#8776;392.4 S cm&#8722;1). The ions migration process is analyzed according to the core&#8211;shell model, further optimization of the ternary electrode and device structure enables the actuator to realize the peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak strain per volt reaching 1.3% V&#8722;1 and normalized blocking force of 0.15&#160;MPa V&#8722;1 (&#8776;89.2 times its own weight), with stable performance maintained over 1 million cycles. Therefore, the actuator can be utilized for the assembly of multi&#8208;clawed grippers to grasp precision components or larger objects. Multiple connected actuators fulfill a complex deformation, indicating promising applications in smart grippers, bioinspired robotics, and human&#8211;machine interaction.

         <title>Interstitial&#8208;Substitutional&#8208;Mixed Solid Solution of RuO2 Nurturing a New Pathway Beyond the Activity&#8208;Stability Linear Constraint in Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An AEM&#8208;derived proton acceptor&#8208;electron donor mechanism is proposed in RuO2 by constructing an interstitial&#8208;substitutional mixed solid solution structure (C,Ta&#8208;RuO2), in which the interstitial C as the proton acceptor decreases the deprotonation energy barrier, while the substitutional Ta as the electron donor weakens the Ru&#9472;O bond covalency, thereby breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off of RuO2 in acidic OER.








Abstract
The acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane electrolyzer (PEMWE) often face a trade&#8208;off between activity and stability due to inherent linear relationship and overoxidation of metal atoms in highly oxidative environments, while following the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Herein, a favorable AEM&#8208;derived proton acceptor&#8208;electron donor mechanism (PAEDM) is proposed in RuO2 by constructing interstitial&#8208;substitutional mixed solid solution structure (denoted as C,Ta&#8208;RuO2), which can effectively break the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off of RuO2 in acidic OER. In situ spectroscopy experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the interstitial C as the proton acceptor reduces the deprotonation energy barrier, enhancing catalytic activity, while the substitutional Ta as the electron donor donates electrons to the Ru sites via bridging oxygen, weakening the Ru&#9472;O bond covalency and preventing over&#8208;oxidation of surface Ru, thereby ensuring long&#8208;term stability. Under the guidance of this mechanism, the optimized C,Ta&#8208;RuO2 simultaneously achieves far low overpotential (&#951;10 = 171&#160;mV) and ultra&#8208;long stability (over 1300&#160;h) for the acidic OER. More remarkably, a homemade PEMWE using C,Ta&#8208;RuO2 as the anode also shows high water splitting performance (1.63&#160;V@1 A cm&#8722;2). This work supplies a novel strategy to guide future developments on efficient OER electrocatalysts toward water oxidation.

         <title>Direct Recycling of Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes Through Photocatalytic Correction of Anti&#8208;Site Defects</title>

We employ photocatalysis to decrease the iron migration barrier, enabling the repositioning of disordered iron atoms into their designated octahedral sites while simultaneously facilitating Li+ diffusion into the LFP lattice, thereby realizing the direct recovery of S&#8208;LFP. This method has substantial environmental and economic benefits, making it a promising solution for sustainable lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling.








Abstract
Fe&#8208;Li (FeLi) anti&#8208;site defects, commonly observed in degraded LiFePO4 cathodes, impede Li+ mobility and disrupt the electronic pathways, leading to significant performance degradation in LFP. However, addressing FeLi anti&#8208;site defects to achieve direct recycling of LFP remains challenging due to Fe high migration energy barriers and the lattice distortions they induce. Here, a feasible strategy is proposed for LFP regeneration by utilizing photocatalysis to reduce the Fe migration barrier. This approach facilitates repositioning disordered Fe atoms to their designated octahedral sites while simultaneously enabling Li+ diffusion into the LFP lattice, thus restoring capacity and ensuring cycling stability. The mechanism of the photocatalysis regeneration strategy is comprehensively analyzed through a combination of theoretical calculations, in&#8208;depth atomic characterization techniques, and electrochemical evaluations. Notably, this strategy is adaptable to varying levels of FeLi anti&#8208;site defects in spent LFP. Furthermore, life cycle analysis highlights the substantial environmental and economic benefits of this advanced strategy, making it a promising solution for sustainable lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Fluorinated Ni Single Atom Catalyst for Efficient Artificial Photosynthetic Diluted CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, synergistic spatial and electronic structure regulation of conjugated Ni single&#8208;atom catalysts are achieved through a dual&#8208;fluorination strategy. Under diluted CO2 (10%) atmosphere, TPB&#8208;SA2F&#8208;Ni obtains the highest reported CO yield (30344.4 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) among heterogeneous catalytic systems with 98% CO selectivity.








Abstract
The development of efficient photocatalysts to convert dilute CO2 from flue gas into high value&#8208;added products is a promising approach to achieving carbon neutrality. In this work, a dual&#8208;fluorinated Ni single atom photocatalyst is reported for the photoreduction of diluted CO2 to CO. Under a dilute CO2 (10%) atmosphere, TPB&#8208;SA2F&#8208;Ni achieves the highest reported CO yield (30344.4&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) among heterogeneous catalytic systems with a CO selectivity of 98%. Kevin probe force microscopy and photoelectrochemical characterizations indicate that dual&#8208;fluorination strategy enhances photoexcited electron transfer between the photosensitizer and photocatalyst by optimizing the conjugated electronic structure. Pore size distribution and CO2 adsorption experiments show that the uniform microporous structure induced by the dual&#8208;F site further enhanced the ability of the Ni&#8208;N2O2 active site to capture CO2 molecules. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the high CO yield of TPB&#8208;SA2F&#8208;Ni stems from a lowered energy barrier for *COOH intermediate formation.

         <title>Direct Experimental Evidence of Low Carrier Scattering Potential in High Performance Thermoelectric AgSbSe2 Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of high&#8208;quality AgSb0.973Cd0.017Se2 crystals with short&#8208;range order embeds within a long&#8208;range periodic structure, achieving the synergistic optimization of both electrical and phonon transport properties. Time&#8208;resolved reflectance spectroscopy provides clear evidence of a pronounced reduction in carrier scattering barriers, leads to a threefold enhancement in the average power factor (PFavg), ultimately achieving superior thermoelectric performance.








Abstract
Thermoelectric materials, like other electronic materials, require high carrier mobility, which is governed by carrier scattering potential. In addition to intrinsic acoustic phonon scattering, the extrinsic factors such as microstructure and atomic arrangement also have great influence on carrier transport in solids, e.g., the emerging thermoelectric material AgSbSe2 with strong cation disorder. However, the experimental evaluation of total carrier scattering potential and distinguishing the contributions from intrinsic and extrinsic scatterings is challenging at present. Here, the time&#8208;resolved ultrafast spectroscopy analysis utilizing a pump&#8208;probe scheme is performed to characterize the charge carrier dynamics of AgSbSe2 with femtosecond time resolution quantitatively. A significantly lowered total carrier scattering potential energy in Cd&#8208;doped AgSbSe2 crystal is determined, resulting from the elimination of grain boundaries and the presence of short&#8208;range order that leads to a negative extrinsic scattering potential. The reduction in carrier scattering potential leads to a threefold increase in the average power factor from 323 to 723 K. A maximum thermoelectric figure of merit of 1.7 is achieved in high&#8208;quality AgSb0.973Cd0.017Se2 crystal at 723 K, with the output efficiency of the single&#8208;leg thermoelectric device reaching a competitive value of 8%. This work reveals how to effectively characterize and modulate carrier scattering potential in thermoelectric compounds.

         <title>Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Deposition of Antigen Peptides on Bifidobacterium for Subintestinal Lymphatic System&#8208;Guided Personalized Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vaccine (Bif&#8208;OVA&#8208;Ocur) is designed to target gut&#8208;associated lymphoid tissues, promoting the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the expansion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)&#160;at mucosal sites. This targeted approach strengthens both mucosal and systemic immunes responses. These immune responses enable the immune system to specifically recognize and destroy tumor cells, thereby inhibiting tumor growth and progression.








Abstract
Gut&#8208;associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) possesses a highly specialized immune system and is rational as a foothold for oral tumor vaccines. Here, a noninvasive oral vaccine (Bif&#8208;OVA&#8208;Ocur) is designed to engage GALT, inducing both intestinal mucosal and systemic immunity for tumor therapeutics. The vaccine uses Bifidobacterium (Bif) as a delivery vehicle for tumor antigen peptides, which are coated with antigen peptides (OVA) and oxidized curdlan (Ocur) in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) manner. Upon oral administration, Bif&#8208;OVA&#8208;Ocur is efficiently directed to Peyer's patches (PPs) in the intestines and further presented to antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs), which then migrate to the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) to evoke specific T cell responses. In mouse models, Bif&#8208;OVA&#8208;Ocur effectively boosts the production of secretory immunoglobin A (SIgA) and promotes a strong mucosal and systemic immune response, leading to significant tumor suppression and resistance to tumor challenges. Importantly, the vaccine shows no systemic toxicity. This approach to harnessing the intestinal mucosal immune system offers valuable insights for the development of other non&#8208;invasive oral vaccines and therapeutic agents.

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Electric&#8208;Mechanical Coupling Selects Barrier Layer for Advanced Bismuth Telluride Thermoelectric Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermo&#8208;electric&#8208;mechanical coupling strategy proposed here predicts the feasibility of Ni2SbTe2 and NiTe2 as ideal TEbMs for (Bi,Sb)2Te3 and Bi2(Te,Se)3, based on three&#8208;phase thermodynamic equilibrium, electrical resistivity, and CTE compatibility. The fabricated TE generators demonstrate a third&#8208;party&#8208;verified conversion efficiency of 7.1% and a power density of 0.49 W cm&#8722;2 when the hot&#8208;side temperature is 523 K, with negligible degradation over 200 h.








Abstract
The long&#8208;term stability of thermoelectric generators, including those based on Bi2Te3, is hindered by the lack of ideal thermoelectric barrier materials (TEbMs). Conventional selection methods for TEbMs mainly rely on trial&#8208;and&#8208;error, which is time&#8208;consuming and does not reveal the underlying mechanisms. In this study, a new design principle for selecting TEbMs based on thermo&#8211;electric&#8211;mechanical coupling is proposed. By combining the phase diagram predictions with the thermal expansion coefficients and electrical resistivities of the potential reactants, the Ni2SbTe2 and NiTe2 compounds are identified as ideal TEbMs for (Bi,Sb)2Te3 and Bi2(Te,Se)3, respectively, leading to interfaces with high thermal stability, low contact resistivity, and high strength. The fabricated thermoelectric generator achieves a competitive conversion efficiency of 7.1% and a power density of 0.49 W cm&#8722;2 at hot&#8208;side and cold&#8208;side temperatures of 523 and 296 K, respectively. Moreover, performance degradation is negligible after 200&#160;h of cycling. This work demonstrates progress toward stable high&#8208;performance service, provides the foundation for applications in low&#8208;grade heat recovery, and offers new insights for more thermoelectric generators.

&lt;p&gt;The thermo-electric-mechanical coupling strategy proposed here predicts the feasibility of Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NiTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as ideal TEbMs for (Bi,Sb)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Te,Se)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, based on three-phase thermodynamic equilibrium, electrical resistivity, and CTE compatibility. The fabricated TE generators demonstrate a third-party-verified conversion efficiency of 7.1% and a power density of 0.49 W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; when the hot-side temperature is 523 K, with negligible degradation over 200 h.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-term stability of thermoelectric generators, including those based on Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is hindered by the lack of ideal thermoelectric barrier materials (TEbMs). Conventional selection methods for TEbMs mainly rely on trial-and-error, which is time-consuming and does not reveal the underlying mechanisms. In this study, a new design principle for selecting TEbMs based on thermo&#8211;electric&#8211;mechanical coupling is proposed. By combining the phase diagram predictions with the thermal expansion coefficients and electrical resistivities of the potential reactants, the Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NiTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compounds are identified as ideal TEbMs for (Bi,Sb)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Te,Se)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, leading to interfaces with high thermal stability, low contact resistivity, and high strength. The fabricated thermoelectric generator achieves a competitive conversion efficiency of 7.1% and a power density of 0.49 W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at hot-side and cold-side temperatures of 523 and 296 K, respectively. Moreover, performance degradation is negligible after 200&#160;h of cycling. This work demonstrates progress toward stable high-performance service, provides the foundation for applications in low-grade heat recovery, and offers new insights for more thermoelectric generators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decoupling Lithium Reutilization Behavior under Different Discharge Rates for Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uncovers the Li0 reutilization behavior of AFLMBs at different discharge rates, which exhibits a &#8220;volcano&#8208;type&#8221; variation. The opposite effects of the distribution relationship between fresh Li and residue Li0 and concentration polarization at specific discharge rate dominate Li0 reutilization. This cognition provides guidance toward high&#8208;power density AFLMBs under practical conditions.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal battery (AFLMB) has become an excellent candidate for long endurance electric vehicles and electric low altitude aircraft, profiting from its high energy density as well as outstanding manufacturing safety. However, the limitation at high discharge rates of AFLMBs is shrouded in mystery, yet to achieve more attention. Herein, the limitation of fast discharge for AFLMBs is dissected exhaustively, and a symptomatic strategy to break the limit is put forward, in order to eliminate the inevitable mismatch that lies in the inferior performance of AFLMBs. A &#8220;volcano&#8208;type&#8221; curve of capacity retention of AFLMBs is discovered with the discharge rate increased. Systematic investigation revealed that the overlapped spatial relationship between fresh deposited Li and residue Li0 facilitated the utilization of &#8220;recoverable Li0&#8221; (Li0) at the prophase of discharge rate increase. However, further enhanced discharge rate induced large concentration polarization (&#951;conc), reflecting limited Li+ diffusion. Enabling the electrolyte to rapidly transport Li+ by lowering &#951;conc increased the optimal discharge rate as well as the cycling stability of AFLMBs. This work reveals the rate&#8208;determining step for high&#8208;rate discharge and expands the employment boundary of AFLMBs under harsh conditions, providing a significant complement of present knowledge with respect to the power performance of AFLMBs.

Investigation of charge carrier dynamics in graphene/ MoS2 heterostructures under photoexcitation, revealing associated intraband THz responses. The study highlights charge transfer mechanisms and carrier lifetimes, advancing the understanding of light&#8208;matter interactions in 2D materials for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The engineering of terahertz phonons is challenging due to difficulties in achieving sub&#8208;nanometer material precision and in facilitating efficient phonon coupling at terahertz frequencies region. The effective generation, detection, and manipulation of terahertz phonons via the integration of atomically thin layers in van der Waals heterostructures can enable new designs for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic quantum devices, offering new avenues for thermal engineering in the terahertz regime. Here, optical pump terahertz probe and terahertz time&#8208;domain experiments are used to reveal the behavior of charge carrier transfer in real time at heterostructure interfaces of single&#8208;layer graphene and monolayer MoS2 upon photoexcitation and plausible mechanism has been put forward. Moreover, a temperature&#8208;dependent terahertz response of GM heterostructure along with experimental observation is explored in detail with considered appropriate theoretical models. These insights can prove valuable for designing the next generation of optoelectronic applications with stacked 2D heterostructures within the terahertz bandwidth.

         <title>Photogenetic&#8208;Like Liposomes Disrupt Neuroligin&#8208;3 Dependency to Enhance Glioma Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a light&#8208;responsive liposome Lip&#8208;CuRA that synergizes photothermal therapy (CuS/980&#160;nm) with dual NLGN3 regulation: RuBi&#8208;GABA/UCNPs suppress NLGN3 synthesis via Cl&#8315; channels, while GI254023X inhibits ADAM10&#8208;mediated release. In glioma models, this strategy blocks PI3K/Wnt pathways, reduces stemness, and prolongs survival through combined neuromodulation&#8208;photothermal effects.








Abstract
Neuronal activity is shown to potentiate glioma initiation, progression, and/or metastasis. A key mechanism in neural regulation of brain cancer involves the activity&#8208;dependent cleavage and release of the synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin&#8208;3 (NLGN3). Here, this report describes the preparation of optogenetics&#8208;like liposome Lip&#8208;CuRA, which is used to regulate the content of NLGN3 in neurons and mediate phototherapy in cancer cells. Lip&#8208;CuRA contains upconversion nanoparticles encapsulating CuS (CuS@PUCNPs), a visible light&#8208;activated neurotransmitter prodrug RuBi&#8208;GABA, and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM10) inhibitors GI254023X. Upon 980&#160;nm laser irradiation, the photothermal conversion of CuS not only induces tumor cell apoptosis, but also destroys liposome structure, releasing Rubi&#8208;GABA and GI254023X. The UCNPs convert the 980&#160;nm laser into 540&#160;nm, activating RuBi&#8208;GABA into GABA. GABA selectively opens Cl&#8315; channels in nerve cells, reducing the expression of NLGN3 and the degree of axonal connections. GI254023X inhibits the activity of the ADAM10 enzyme on the nerve surface, reducing the release of NLGN3, thereby blocking the transmission of proliferation and stemness signals. In the GL261&#8208;luc orthotopic glioma model, C6&#8208;luc orthotopic glioma model, and glioma patient&#8208;derived xenograft (PDX) model, Lip&#8208;CuRA effectively inhibits tumor recurrence, reduces glioma stemness, and extends survival through a synergistic photothermal and NLGN3&#8208;regulating therapy.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative plasmon&#8208;mediated electron emission (PMEE) nanocathode is developed through gold nanoparticle&#8208;decorated vertically aligned few&#8208;layer graphene, enabling synchronized generation of picosecond electron pulses and GHz electromagnetic radiation. This room&#8208;temperature system achieves exceptional performance of 8.81 &#215; 109 A&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;sr&#8722;1&#183;V&#8722;1 brightness and 0.97 eV energy spread, while operating at moderate excitation, offering a promising platform for compact and high&#8208;efficiency vacuum electronic devices.









Abstract
Vacuum electronic devices offer superior electron mobility and spatiotemporal electron manipulating precision, with recent challenges focusing on ultrafast electron pulses for high&#8208;frequency, high&#8208;energy, and high&#8208;resolution applications. Plasmon&#8208;mediated electron emission (PMEE) nanocathodes provide a promising solution by producing high&#8208;quality ultrafast electron pulses while simplifying the electron beam manipulation.

&lt;p&gt;An innovative plasmon-mediated electron emission (PMEE) nanocathode is developed through gold nanoparticle-decorated vertically aligned few-layer graphene, enabling synchronized generation of picosecond electron pulses and GHz electromagnetic radiation.

&lt;p&gt;Vacuum electronic devices offer superior electron mobility and spatiotemporal electron manipulating precision, with recent challenges focusing on ultrafast electron pulses for high-frequency, high-energy, and high-resolution applications. Plasmon-mediated electron emission (PMEE) nanocathodes provide a promising solution by producing high-quality ultrafast electron pulses while simplifying the electron beam manipulation. In this study, we developed a PMEE Au-on-Gr nanocathode using vertically aligned few-layer graphene decorated with gold nanoparticles, enabling synchronized generation of picosecond pulsed electron beam and electromagnetic radiation.

         <title>Constructing Controlled Vertical Gradient Morphology in Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Photovoltaics via Self&#8208;Assembled Interface Orthogonal Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled interface orthogonal strategy is first applied to construct pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction organic photovoltaics with controllable vertical gradient distribution morphology. Introducing low surface&#8208;energy N2200 to self&#8208;assemble molecular layer on PM6 surface overcomes erosion effect and modulates phase morphology, thus achieving the highest efficiency of 19.86% via air&#8208;printing process.








Abstract
Precisely regulating vertically distributed morphology by blade&#8208;coating process is crucial to realize high&#8208;performance large&#8208;scale pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction organic photovoltaics (OPVs). However, the thermodynamic motion and random diffusion of donor/acceptor (D/A) generated from the differences in surface energy and concentration during sequentially blade&#8208;coating process will cause great challenges for obtaining ideal active layer morphology. Herein, this study have proposed a self&#8208;assembled interface orthogonal strategy by introducing low surface energy guest (N2200) to form protective layer on PM6 surface, which counteracts erosion from orthogonal solution of acceptor to enhance continuity of D/A phases, thus promoting directional carrier migration and effectively suppressing energetic disorder. Finally, N2200&#8208;modified device achieves the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.86%, and large&#8208;area module (16.94 cm2) exhibits exceptional PCE (16.43%). This investigation presents innovative insights into morphology issue triggered by molecular motion and provides an effective method for air&#8208;printing large&#8208;scale OPVs with precisely controlled morphology based on non&#8208;halogenated solvent.

         <dc:description>
A machine learning framework is harnessed to scrutinize the thermodynamically induced crystal phase transition behavior of medium&#8208;entropy Prussian blue analogs (ME&#8208;PBA). This study provides a unified framework for understanding the crystal phase transformation in ME&#8208;PBA and is poised to lay the groundwork for the development of other polymetallic coordination polymer derivatives.









Abstract
Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are exemplary precursors for the synthesis of a diverse array of derivatives.Yet, the intricate mechanisms underlying phase transitions in these multifaceted frameworks remain a formidable challenge. In this study, a machine learning&#8208;guided analysis of phase transitions in a medium&#8208;entropy PBA system is delineated, utilizing an array of descriptors that encompass crystallographic phases, structural subtleties, and fluctuations in multimetal valence states. By integrating multimodal simulations with experimental validation, a thermodynamics&#8208;driven phase transformation model for medium&#8208;entropy PBA is established and accurately predicted the critical synthesis parameters. A constellation of advanced techniques&#8212;including atomic force microscopy coupled with Kelvin probe force microscopy for individual nanoparticles, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, operando ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy, in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, theoretical calculations, and multiphysics simulations&#8212;substantiated that the iron oxide@NiCoZnFe&#8208;PBA exhibits both exceptional stability and remarkable electrochemical activity. This investigation provides profound insights into the phase transition dynamics of polymetallic complexes and propels the rational design of other thermally&#8208;induced derivatives.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Halogen Pockets Steering *CO Adsorption Configurations for Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and synthesis of copper nanoparticles encaged in polymer&#8208;halogen pockets for selective CO2 reduction are presented. As a direct outcome, the strategy achieves selective conversion of ethylene and ethanol, &#8776;48.3 &#177; 1.3% selectivity for ethanol, and 60.3 &#177; 2.1% for ethylene.








Abstract
The selective CO2 electroreduction (CO2R) toward specific C2 products represents a critical challenge for practical applicability, requiring precise control over *CO intermediates. Herein, a &#8220;polymer&#8208;halogen&#8221; pocketed Cu catalyst is proposed, wherein the adjustable concentration of Iodide ion (I&#8722;) within the pocket enables continuous modulation of *CO adsorption configurations on the Cu, thereby enabling tailored CO2R toward ethylene or ethanol production. A perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA)&#8208;modified CuI catalyst is constructed, where I&#8722; is in situ leaching from CuI and subsequently confined by PFSA as an anion shielding layer to form polymer&#8208;halogen pockets. By tuning the thickness of PFSA shell, the amount of I&#8722; in the pocket can be controlled. The surface&#8208;enhanced in situ Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that the coverage of *CO intermediates on Cu surface increases and tends to adsorb at low coordination Cu sites in catalyst granule for dimerization reaction as the I&#8722; concentration in the pocket increases. Furthermore, the coordination environment exhibits distinct product selectivity. *CO at medium&#8208;coordinated sites favor ethanol production, while those at low&#8208;coordinated sites are conducive to ethylene formation. This strategy enables wide modulation of ethylene&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol ratios from 0.65 to 3.96, achieving peak Faradaic efficiencies (FE) of 60.3 &#177;&#160;2.1% for ethylene and 48.3 &#177;&#160;1.3% for ethanol.

         <title>Growth Control of InP/ZnSe Heterostructured Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The morphology of ZnSe epilayers on InP NCs is controlled, ranging from tetrapod to spherical InP/ZnSe heterostructured NCs, under the guidance of DFT calculations. The expanded morphology envelope permits InP/ZnSe heterostructured NCs to customize their photophysical characteristics from stable and pure emission to environment&#8208;sensitive ones, which will prompt their practical use in a range of photonic applications.








Abstract
The morphology of heterostructured semiconductor nanocrystals (h&#8208;NCs) dictates the spatial distribution of charge carriers and their recombination dynamics and/or transport, which are the main performance indicators of photonic applications utilizing h&#8208;NCs. The inability to control the morphology of heterovalent III&#8208;V/II&#8208;VI h&#8208;NCs composed of heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free elements hinders their practical use. As a case study of III&#8208;V/II&#8208;VI h&#8208;NCs, the growth control of ZnSe epilayers on InP NCs is demonstrated here. The anisotropic morphology in InP/ZnSe h&#8208;NCs is attributed to the facet&#8208;dependent energy costs for the growth of ZnSe epilayers on different facets of InP NCs, and effective chemical means for controlling the growth rates of ZnSe on different surface planes are demonstrated. Ultimately, this article capitalizes on the controlled morphology of InP/ZnSe h&#8208;NCs to expand their photophysical characteristics from stable and pure emission to environment&#8208;sensitive one, which will facilitate their use in a variety of photonic applications.

&lt;p&gt;The morphology of ZnSe epilayers on InP NCs is controlled, ranging from tetrapod to spherical InP/ZnSe heterostructured NCs, under the guidance of DFT calculations. The expanded morphology envelope permits InP/ZnSe heterostructured NCs to customize their photophysical characteristics from stable and pure emission to environment-sensitive ones, which will prompt their practical use in a range of photonic applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morphology of heterostructured semiconductor nanocrystals (&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-NCs) dictates the spatial distribution of charge carriers and their recombination dynamics and/or transport, which are the main performance indicators of photonic applications utilizing &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-NCs. The inability to control the morphology of heterovalent III-V/II-VI &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-NCs composed of heavy-metal-free elements hinders their practical use. As a case study of III-V/II-VI &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-NCs, the growth control of ZnSe epilayers on InP NCs is demonstrated here. The anisotropic morphology in InP/ZnSe &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-NCs is attributed to the facet-dependent energy costs for the growth of ZnSe epilayers on different facets of InP NCs, and effective chemical means for controlling the growth rates of ZnSe on different surface planes are demonstrated. Ultimately, this article capitalizes on the controlled morphology of InP/ZnSe &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-NCs to expand their photophysical characteristics from stable and pure emission to environment-sensitive one, which will facilitate their use in a variety of photonic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Information Density Enhancement Using Lossy Compression in DNA Data Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Explored deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) lossy compression models to increase the information density in DNA storage. This study compared these models with others, showing potential competitive advantages, in terms of information density and image quality. This study also examined model applications using convolutional neural networks for image quality assessment, highlighting the potential of DNA storage technology for handling complex data.








Abstract
This study develops two deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#160;lossy compression models, Models A and B, to encode grayscale images into DNA sequences, enhance information density, and enable high&#8208;fidelity image recovery. These models, distinguished by their handling of pixel domains and interpolation methods, offer a novel approach to data storage for DNA. Model A processes pixels in overlapped domains using linear interpolation (LI), whereas Model B uses non&#8208;overlapped domains with nearest&#8208;neighbor interpolation (NNI). Through a comparative analysis with Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG)&#160;compression, the DNA lossy compression models demonstrate competitive advantages in terms of information density and image quality restoration. The application of these models to the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset reveals their efficiency and the recognizability of decompressed images, which is validated by convolutional neural network (CNN) performance. In particular, Model B2, a version of Model B, emerges as an effective method for balancing high information density (surpassing over 20 times the typical densities of two bits per nucleotide) with reasonably good image quality. These findings highlight the potential of DNA&#8208;based data storage systems for high&#8208;density and efficient compression, indicating a promising future for biological data storage solutions.

         <title>Rapid Surface Reconstruction of In2S3 Photoanode via Flame Treatment for Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid surface reconstruction strategy is proposed to enhance the charge collection efficiency and stability of indium sulfide (In2S3) photoanode via a high&#8208;temperature flame treatment. This method selectively transforms the In2S3 surface into a diffusionless In2O3 and generates bulk sulfur vacancies, resulting in surface&#8208;reconstructed In2S3 (sr&#8208;In2S3). The sr&#8208;In2S3 exhibits an impressive photocurrent density of 8.5 mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming previously reported sulfide&#8208;based photoanodes.








Abstract
Surface reconstruction, reorganizing the surface atoms or structure, is a promising strategy to manipulate materials' electrical, electrochemical, and surface catalytic properties. Herein, a rapid surface reconstruction of indium sulfide (In2S3) is demonstrated via a high&#8208;temperature flame treatment to improve its charge collection properties. The flame process selectively transforms the In2S3 surface into a diffusionless In2O3 layer with high crystallinity. Additionally, it controllably generates bulk sulfur vacancies within a few seconds, leading to surface&#8208;reconstructed In2S3 (sr&#8208;In2S3). When using those sr&#8208;In2S3 as photoanode for photoelectrochemical water splitting devices, these dual functions of surface In2O3/bulk In2S3 reduce the charge recombination in the surface and bulk region, thus improving photocurrent density and stability. With optimized surface reconstruction, the sr&#8208;In2S3 photoanode demonstrates a significant photocurrent density of 8.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), marking a 2.5&#8208;fold increase compared to pristine In2S3 (3.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). More importantly, the sr&#8208;In2S3 photoanode exhibits an impressive photocurrent density of 7.3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.6&#160;V versus RHE for iodide oxidation reaction. A practical and scalable surface reconstruction is also showcased via flame treatment. This work provides new insights for surface reconstruction engineering in sulfide&#8208;based semiconductors, making a breakthrough in developing efficient solar&#8208;fuel energy devices.

         <title>Ferroelectric Stochasticity in 2D CuInP2S6 and Its Application for True Random Number Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a true random number generator (TRNG) based on stochastic ferroelectric polarization switching in 2D CuInP2S6 materials, is reported. The TRNG exhibits exceptional stochastic variability, surpassing conventional entropy metrics, and passes the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) randomness tests. Moreover, TRNG's unclonability is demonstrated through device&#8208;to&#8208;device variation, providing resilience against machine learning (ML) attacks.








Abstract
True random number generators (TRNGs), which create cryptographically secure random bitstreams, hold great promise in addressing security concerns regarding hardware, communication, and authentication in the Internet of Things (IoT) realm. Recently, TRNGs based on nanoscale materials have gained considerable attention for avoiding conventional and predictable hardware circuitry designs that can be vulnerable to machine learning (ML) attacks. In this article, a low&#8208;power and low&#8208;cost TRNG developed by exploiting stochastic ferroelectric polarization switching in 2D ferroelectric CuInP2S6 (CIPS)&#8208;based capacitive structures, is reported. The stochasticity arises from the probabilistic switching of independent electrical dipoles. The TRNG exhibits enhanced stochastic variability with near&#8208;ideal entropy, uniformity, uniqueness, Hamming distance, and independence from autocorrelation variations. Its unclonability is systematically examined using device&#8208;to&#8208;device variations. The generated cryptographic bitstreams pass the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) randomness tests. This nanoscale CIPS&#8208;based TRNG is circuit&#8208;integrable and exhibits potential for hardware security in edge devices with advanced data encryption.

         <title>Spiking Neural Network Integrated with Impact Ionization Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Neuron and a Ferroelectric Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Synapse</title>

2D spiking neural network consisting of 2D ferroelectric FET synapses and 2D impact ionization FET spiking neurons are demonstrated. This study marks a major leap in developing fast&#8208;switching, energy&#8208;efficient ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power devices vital for future artificial neural networks, addressing key challenges in energy management for spiking neuron devices.








Abstract
The integration of artificial spiking neurons based on steep&#8208;switching logic devices and artificial synapses with neuromorphic functions enables an energy&#8208;efficient computer architecture that mimics the human brain well, known as a spiking neural network (SNN). 2D materials with impact ionization or ferroelectric characteristics have the potential for use in such devices. However, research on 2D spiking neurons remains limited and investigations of 2D artificial synapses far more common. An innovative 2D spiking neuron is implemented using a WSe2 impact ionization transistor (I2FET), while a spiking neural network is formed by combining it with a 2D ferroelectric synaptic device (FeFET). The suggested 2D spiking neuron demonstrates precise spiking behavior that closely resembles that of actual neurons. In addition, it achieves a low energy consumption of 2&#160;pJ/spike. The better impact ionization properties of WSe2 are responsible for this efficiency. Furthermore, an all&#8208;2D SNN consisting of 2D I2FET neurons and 2D FeFET synapses is constructed, which achieves high accuracy of 87.5% in a face classification task by unsupervised learning. The integration of a 2D SNN with 2D steep&#8208;switching spiking neuronal devices and 2D synaptic devices shows great potential for the development of neuromorphic systems with improved energy efficiency and computational capabilities.

&lt;p&gt;The integration of artificial spiking neurons based on steep-switching logic devices and artificial synapses with neuromorphic functions enables an energy-efficient computer architecture that mimics the human brain well, known as a spiking neural network (SNN). 2D materials with impact ionization or ferroelectric characteristics have the potential for use in such devices. However, research on 2D spiking neurons remains limited and investigations of 2D artificial synapses far more common. An innovative 2D spiking neuron is implemented using a WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; impact ionization transistor (I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FET), while a spiking neural network is formed by combining it with a 2D ferroelectric synaptic device (FeFET). The suggested 2D spiking neuron demonstrates precise spiking behavior that closely resembles that of actual neurons. In addition, it achieves a low energy consumption of 2&#160;pJ/spike. The better impact ionization properties of WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are responsible for this efficiency. Furthermore, an all-2D SNN consisting of 2D I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FET neurons and 2D FeFET synapses is constructed, which achieves high accuracy of 87.5% in a face classification task by unsupervised learning. The integration of a 2D SNN with 2D steep-switching spiking neuronal devices and 2D synaptic devices shows great potential for the development of neuromorphic systems with improved energy efficiency and computational capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Percolative Metal Microweb&#8208;Based Flexible Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery with Fast Charging and High Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel percolative metal microweb&#8208;based flexible electrode using electrohydrodynamic processes is developed. This lightweight and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) electrode enhances the electrochemical and mechanical performances of the resultant lithium&#8208;ion batteries with improved energy density, lithium&#8208;ion diffusion, and electron transfer. As a result, the lithium&#8208;ion battery developed here exhibits exceptional energy and power densities of 110 and 1048&#160;W&#160;kg&#8315;&#185;, respectively.








Abstract
Flexible and high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) encounter challenges due to the inherent trade&#8208;offs in conventional electrode designs, particularly concerning mechanical flexibility and high energy density. Here, a novel percolative metal microweb&#8208;based electrode, fabricated via electrohydrodynamic processes, yielding a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network structure with exceptional electrical properties and mechanical durability is introduced. This lightweight electrode design addresses the need for improved energy density by reducing the weight of the current collector, which typically accounts for more than 10% of the battery's weight. The 3D architecture of the electrode enhances the contact area with the electrolyte, thereby minimizing polarization voltage and improving lithium&#8208;ion diffusion. Furthermore, the low coating thickness&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio promotes electron transfer and mitigates capacity fade at high current densities. The microweb&#8208;based full cell exhibits energy and power densities of 110 and 1,048&#160;W&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; at 10 C, respectively, which are the highest reported values among LIBs utilizing similar materials. The design of the electrode proposed in this study is expected to significantly contribute to the development of wearable and flexible electronics.

The proposed &#181;LED pixel circuit utilizes IGZO/Te CFETs, which exhibits symmetrical ambipolar behavior. The IGZO/Te heterostructure is confirmed to consist of an amorphous IGZO layer and a hexagonal Te layer using HR&#8208;TEM and GIXRD. The circuit, based on PWM, achieved 8&#8208;bit gray level control and stable &#181;LED luminance, confirming its suitability for high&#8208;quality &#181;LED displays.








Abstract
This study investigates a micro light&#8208;emitting diode (&#181;LED) pixel circuit using the heterogeneous integration of complementary field&#8208;effect transistors (CFETs). The CFETs are fabricated using a semiconductor layer composed of tellurium (Te) and indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc oxide (IGZO) layers. Te and IGZO layers in the heterostructure IGZO/Te film exhibit hexagonal and amorphous phases, respectively, indicating that each layer maintains independent material characteristics. The fabricated IGZO/Te CFETs exhibit ambipolar behavior with a turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.0&#160;V and field&#8208;effect mobility of 0.74 and 1.42 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type channels, respectively. Inverters comprising IGZO/Te CFET and IGZO TFT exhibit inverting behavior. A &#181;LED pixel circuit is designed using IGZO/Te CFETs based on pulse width modulation (PWM). The proposed circuit uses an inverter structure with IGZO/Te and IGZO to control the emission time, suppressing the wavelength shift of &#181;LEDs depending on the &#181;LED current levels. The operation of the proposed pixel circuit is investigated through simulation and measurement of the fabricated circuit. The fabricated &#181;LED pixel circuit successfully exhibits PWM operation, controlling the emission time and luminance. Consequently, IGZO/Te CFETs show promise as devices for high&#8208;quality &#181;LED displays.

         <title>Electron Release via Internal Polarization Fields for Optimal S&#8208;H Bonding States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study offers insights into material design rules for activating the basal planes of TMDs and suggests ultimate strategies using positively charged built&#8208;in polarized fields that electrostatically repel H2S+ ions. The de&#8208;localizing charge density derived from the released electrons originally bound to S atoms at the Sv incorporated heterointerface, results in unidirectional charge transport to the basal plane.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have received considerable attention as promising electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet their potential is often constrained by the inertness of the basal planes arising from their poor hydrogen adsorption ability. Here, the relationship between the electronic structure of the WS2 basal plane and HER activity is systemically analyzed to establish a clear insight. The valance state of the sulfur atoms on the basal plane has been tuned to enhance hydrogen adsorption through sequential engineering processes, including direct phase transition and heterostructure that induces work function&#8208;difference&#8208;induced unidirectional electron transfer. Additionally, an innovative synthetic approach, harnessing the built&#8208;in internal polarization field at the W&#8208;graphene heterointerface, triggers the in&#8208;situ formation of sulfur vacancies in the bottom WSx (x &lt; 2) layers. The resultant modulation of the valance state of the sulfur atom stabilizes the W&#8208;S bond, while destabilizing the S&#8208;H bond. The electronic structural changes are further amplified by the release and transfer of surplus electrons via sulfur vacancies, filling the valance state of W and S atoms. Consequently, this work provides a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between the electronic structure of the WS2 basal plane and the HER activity, focusing on optimizing S&#8208;H bonding state.

         <title>High Thermal Conductive Crystalline Organohalide for Endurable Resistive Switching Non&#8208;Volatile Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Typical organic materials&#8208;based resistive memory devices suffer from poor operational reliability and stability. The crystalline organohalide&#8208;based thin film with high thermal conductivity and low electrical conductivity introduced in this study enabled a reliable resistive memory device with significantly enhanced endurance, high on/off ratio, and millivolt scale operating voltages.








Abstract
The organic&#8208;based memristive devices are widely studied as a next&#8208;generation electronics for eco&#8208;friendly wearable applications, thanks to materials` flexibility and biocompatibility. However, poor operational reliability and stability of the devices remain a critical challenge. Here, the study demonstrates a crystalline organohalide, Dabconium ammonium triiodide (DABCO&#8208;NH4&#8208;I3, DABCO is 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2] octonium)&#8208;based memristive device with exceptionally high reliability and endurance. Owing to the low dielectric constant and anisotropic hexagonal crystal structure consisting of hydrogen bonds with a high bandgap, the DABCO&#8208;NH4&#8208;I3&#8208;based conductive bridging random access memory device demonstrates millivolt&#8208;scale operating voltages with a remarkably high on/off ratio of &#8776;109, capable of multi&#8208;level storage. The relatively higher thermal conductivity of the crystalline organohalide (1.06&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1K&#8722;1), compared to most of organic materials (0.1&#8211;0.5&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1K&#8722;1), is found to be beneficial to suppress intense heat accumulation generated by Joule heating effect during device operation. With the facilitated dissipation of the generated heat, the simple planar heterojunction structured device shows remarkably endurable resistive switching over 103 cycles of program&#8208;erase at both room temperature and 85 &#176;C with high switching reliability. This study introduced a new class of materials that can overcome the limitations of existing organic materials for high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation organic electronic devices.

The relatively higher thermal conductivity of the crystalline organohalide (1.06&#160;W&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), compared to most of organic materials (0.1&#8211;0.5&#160;W&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), is found to be beneficial to suppress intense heat accumulation generated by Joule heating effect during device operation. With the facilitated dissipation of the generated heat, the simple planar heterojunction structured device shows remarkably endurable resistive switching over 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; cycles of program-erase at both room temperature and 85 &#176;C with high switching reliability. This study introduced a new class of materials that can overcome the limitations of existing organic materials for high-performance next-generation organic electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spectroscopic Signatures of Ultra&#8208;Thin Amorphous Carbon with the Tuned Disorder Directly Grown on a Dielectric Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a method for directly growing ultra&#8208;thin amorphous carbon with controlled levels of disorder on dielectric substrates, eliminating issues related to material transfer. Using XPS, EELS, and Raman spectroscopy for material characterization, the films exhibit distinct signatures, with Raman spectroscopy especially effective in identifying disorder levels. Additionally, electrical and dielectric measurements indicate promising potential for nanometer&#8208;scale semiconductor applications.








Abstract
The reduced structural complexity of atomically thin amorphous carbons makes it suitable for semiconductor technology. Inherent challenges arise from transfer processes subsequent to growth on metallic substrates, posing significant challenges to the accurate characterization of amorphous materials, thereby compromising the reliability of spectroscopic analysis. Here this work presents a novel approach: direct growth of ultra&#8208;thin amorphous carbon with tuned disorder on a dielectric substrate (SiO2/Si) using photochemical reaction and thermal annealing process with a solid precursor. This work characterizes the amorphous carbon films' disorder using spectroscopic techniques, such as X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Electron energy loss spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy, which offer greater convenience compared to microscopy&#8208;based studies. This method, rooted in comprehensive spectroscopic characterization, elucidates characteristic signatures inherent to the amorphous carbon films. These findings reveal that Raman spectroscopy is particularly effective in identifying the amorphous phase of atomically&#8208;thin carbon. Additionally, I&#8208;V characterization and high&#8208;frequency dielectric measurements showcase the potential application of directly grown amorphous carbon films in the semiconductor industry, where nanometer&#8208;level thin conductors and dielectrics are commonly utilized. This transfer&#8208;free characterization method provides a useful tool to find the correlation between atomic structure and electrical/optical properties, giving valuable insights into comprehensive crystallographic fundamental research.

         <title>Titanium&#8210;Nickel Dual Active Sites Enabled Reversible Hydrogen Storage of Magnesium at 180&#160;&#176;C with Exceptional Cycle Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the Mg2Ni@Ti&#9472;MgO catalyst, featuring Mg2Ni and stable Ti&#9472;MgO with stable Ti valence state, is applied to Mg/MgH2. It simultaneously facilitates the hydrogen adsorption, dissociation, diffusion, and nucleation processes, enabling moderate&#8208;temperature hydrogen storage reactions with long&#8208;term cycle stability. These findings suggest the importance of combining early&#8208; and late&#8208;transition metals in a gas&#8208;solid phase reaction.








Abstract
Enhancing hydrogenation and dehydrogenation (de/hydrogenation) kinetics without compromising cycle stability is a major challenge for Mg&#8208;based hydrogen storage materials (Mg/MgH2). The de/hydrogenation reactions of Mg/MgH2 are one of the gas&#8211;solid reactions involving hydrogen adsorption, dissociation, diffusion, and nucleation, which often results in the catalysts being unable to simultaneously accelerate these distinct kinetic processes. Here, the Mg2Ni@Ti&#9472;MgO catalyst with dual active sites is reported to be designed to address this issue. The stabilization of Ti2+ and Ti3+ valence states in the MgO lattice simultaneously accelerates hydrogen adsorption and dissociation. Additionally, Mg2Ni serves as a hydrogen diffusion and nucleation center, synergistically enhancing de/hydrogenation reactions. Consequently, it enables MgH2 to release 5.28&#160;wt.% H2 in 2&#160;min at 280&#160;&#176;C, and achieves 1.96&#160;wt.% H2 of hydrogen release in 60&#160;min at 180&#160;&#176;C. The Mg2Ni@Ti&#9472;MgO catalyst exhibits remarkable chemical stability at the interfacial structure, minimizing structural and chemical degradation impact, and realizing excellent de/hydrogenation performance over 1000 cycles. These results provide a new methodology for optimizing multiple kinetic steps, attaining highly efficient and stable de/hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Decoding the Role of Molecular Orientation in Conjugated Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for High&#8208;Performance Binary Organic Photovoltaics Approaching 20% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study elucidates how the molecular orientation of conjugated self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) governs work function (WF) modulation via alignment of the conjugated core with the surface normal. Edge&#8208;on&#8208;oriented BCZ&#8208;1 molecule maximizes vertical dipole moments and achieves dense in&#8208;plane coverage, enabling ultrafast hole extraction and minimized recombination. The resultant binary organic photovoltaics achieve a record efficiency of 19.93%, highlighting orientation engineering as a pivotal strategy for high&#8208;performance devices.








Abstract
Molecular orientation stands as the quintessential hallmark of conjugated self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs), which have recently catalyzed noteworthy advancements in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Nevertheless, an unambiguous understanding of these directional arrangements and their impact on optoelectronic properties remains elusive. To address this issue, herein three SAMs with representative orientations, i.e., edge&#8208;on (BCZ&#8208;1), tilt&#8208;on (4PACz) and face&#8208;on (BCZ&#8208;2) are meticulously designed. These orientations have been rigorously validated by sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy and first&#8208;principles calculations. Remarkably, an unequivocal correlation between the molecular orientation and the device performance is discerned. Particularly, the edge&#8208;on oriented BCZ&#8208;1 exhibits the largest dipole moment normal to the electrode, accompanied by a dense and uniform coverage. These features collectively contribute to its strongest work function increment for ultra&#8208;fast hole extraction and minimum interfacial carrier recombination. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency of 19.93% is achieved in devices based on BCZ&#8208;1 with D18:L8&#8208;BO as the active layer, representing one of the highest values reported for binary bulk heterojunction OPVs. Besides, BCZ&#8208;1 shows great potential for practical applications due to its superior up&#8208;scalability and enhanced device shelf&#8208;stability. Overall, this work offers in&#8208;depth insights into the orientation behaviors of SAMs, opening new avenues to unlock the efficiency potential of OPVs.

         <title>Imaging the 4D Chemical Heterogeneity of Single V2O5 Particles During Charging/Discharging Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spectrally&#8208;resolved dual&#8208;mode spinning&#8208;disk confocal microscopy is developed to monitor the 4D chemical heterogeneity of single V2O5 particles during cycling. A unique and irreversible transformation of V5+ to V3+ on a particle's bottom electric contact points has been unveiled for the first time. The coordination strategy between ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid and V3+ is proposed to inhibit V3+ precipitation effectively.








Abstract
Microparticle cathode materials are widely used in secondary batteries. However, obtaining dynamic chemical heterogeneities of these microparticles is challenging, hindering in&#8208;depth mechanistic investigation of the underlying processes. For example, although vanadium pentoxide shows promise as an electrode material for zinc ion batteries, its poor performance's root cause is elusive. Herein, a fluorescence/scattering dual&#8208;mode spinning disk confocal microscopy&#8208;based approach is developed to visualize the 4D chemical heterogeneity of single V2O5 particles during cycling. Dual&#8208;mode in situ imaging identifies valence state changes of vanadium ions with high spatiotemporal resolution. A unique difference is observed between the scattering intensities of a particle's bottom electric contact points and the rest parts during the discharging process. In contrast, fluorescence intensity variation suggests high consistency across the particles. Correlative Raman, UV&#8211;Vis spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses suggest the precipitation of V3+ species at the bottom interface of the V2O5 electrode, leading to increased electron transfer resistance and compromised overall performance. A coordination strategy between ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid and V3+ is proposed for inhibiting V3+ precipitation, and its effectiveness is further verified by imaging and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses. Insights from the imaging approach presented herein will enable the rational design of high&#8208;performance batteries.

Herein, a fluorescence/scattering dual-mode spinning disk confocal microscopy-based approach is developed to visualize the 4D chemical heterogeneity of single V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; particles during cycling. Dual-mode in situ imaging identifies valence state changes of vanadium ions with high spatiotemporal resolution. A unique difference is observed between the scattering intensities of a particle's bottom electric contact points and the rest parts during the discharging process. In contrast, fluorescence intensity variation suggests high consistency across the particles. Correlative Raman, UV&#8211;Vis spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses suggest the precipitation of V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; species at the bottom interface of the V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; electrode, leading to increased electron transfer resistance and compromised overall performance. A coordination strategy between ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid and V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is proposed for inhibiting V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; precipitation, and its effectiveness is further verified by imaging and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses. Insights from the imaging approach presented herein will enable the rational design of high-performance batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proposing Altermagnetic&#8208;Ferroelectric Type&#8208;III Multiferroics with Robust Magnetoelectric Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiferroics are highly sought after for advanced technological applications. Here, a novel class of type&#8208;III multiferroics is proposed, where ferroelectricity and altermagnetism are inherently interlocked by crystal symmetry, setting them apart from conventional multiferroics. The ferroelectric switching is shown to fully invert the spin polarization of altermagnets, equivalent to a 180&#176; reversal of magnetic spin.








Abstract
Multiferroic materials, characterized by the coexisting of ferroelectric polarization (breaking space&#8208; inversion symmetry, &#119979;) and magnetism (breaking time&#8208;reversal symmetry, &#119983;), with strong magnetoelectric coupling, are highly sought after for advanced technological applications. Novel altermagnets, distinct from conventional magnets, have recently been revealed to exhibit unique spin polarization protected by crystal symmetry, which naturally overcomes the isolation of magnetism from ferroelectrics associated with spatial symmetry. In this study, a novel class of type&#8208;III multiferroics is proposed, which leverages the unique symmetry of altermagnets to enforce spin&#8208;ferroelectric locking, setting them apart from conventional multiferroics. Through first&#8208;principles calculations, ferroelectric switching is shown to fully invert the spin polarization of altermagnets, equivalent to a 180&#176; reversal of magnetic spin. This altermagnetic phase controlled by ferroelectrics can be effectively probed using the magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect, revealing a new class of multiferroics with intrinsic and deterministic magnetoelectric coupling. This theoretical advancement redefines the design principles of magnetoelectric materials and lays the foundation for the design of next&#8208;generation spintronic devices leveraging altermagnetism.

         <title>Interfacial Energetics Reversal Strategy for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy&#8208; &#8220;interfacial energetics reversal&#8221; to reconstruct perovskite energetics that matches well with the upper hole transport layer has been successfully developed, enabling efficient n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite solar cells with nonradiative recombination induced qVoc loss of only 57 meV from the radiative limit.








Abstract
Reducing heterointerface nonradiative recombination is a key challenge for realizing highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Motivated by this, a facile strategy is developed via interfacial energetics reversal to functionalize perovskite heterointerface. A surfactant molecule, trichloro[3&#8208;(pentafluorophenyl)propyl]silane (TPFS) reverses perovskite surface energetics from intrinsic n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type, evidently demonstrated by ultraviolet and inverse photoelectron spectroscopies. The reconstructed perovskite surface energetics match well with the upper deposited hole transport layer, realizing an exquisite energy level alignment for accelerating hole extraction across the heterointerface. Meanwhile, TPFS further diminishes surface defect density. As a result, this cooperative strategy leads to greatly minimized nonradiative recombination. PSCs achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.9% with excellent reproducibility, and a nonradiative recombination&#8208;induced qVoc loss of only 57 meV, which is the smallest reported to date in n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured PSCs.

         <title>Key Role of Bridge Adsorbed Hydrogen Intermediate on Pt&#8211;Ru Pair for Efficient Acidic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed Pt atomic chain modified fcc&#8208;type Ru nanocrystal with co&#8208;crystalline structure possesses an efficient bridge adsorbed hydrogen configuration (*Hbridge) at the Pt&#8211;Ru(fcc) interface. The *Hbridge dominates HER and exhibits superior intrinsic activity, &#8776;10.6 times higher than that of Pt. The designed Pt&#8211;Ru(fcc) with *Hbridge demonstrates excellent catalytic activity and stability for both laboratory and industrial levels.








Abstract
Atop and multiple adsorbed hydrogen are considered as key intermediates on Pt&#8208;group metal for acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet the role of bridge hydrogen intermediate (*Hbridge) is consistently overlooked experimentally. Herein, a Pt atomic chain modified fcc&#8208;Ru nanocrystal (Pt&#8211;Ru(fcc)) is developed with a co&#8208;crystalline structure, featuring *Hbridge intermediate bonded on the Pt&#8211;Ru pair site. Electrons leap from the pair site to *Hbridge facilitate hydrogen desorption, thus accelerating the Tafel kinetics and ensuring outstanding electrocatalytic performance, with a low overpotential (4.0&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#8201;&#160;cm&#8722;2) and high turnover frequency (56.4&#8201;H2&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;mV). Notably, the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer PEMWE with ultra&#8208;low loading of 10 ugPt&#8201;cm&#8722;2 shows excellent activity (1.61&#160;V at 1.0&#8201;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and low average degradation rate (4.0 &#181;V h&#8722;1 over 1000&#160;h), significantly outperforming the benchmark Pt/C. Furthermore, the PEMWE&#8208;based 80&#160;&#181;m Gore membrane under identical operating conditions requires only 1.54 and 1.58&#160;V to achieve 1.0 and 1.5 A cm&#8722;2. This finding highlights the key role of *Hbridge at the Pt&#8211;Ru interface in obtaining high HER intrinsic activity and underscores the transformative potential in designing next&#8208;generation bimetallic catalysts for clean hydrogen energy.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Mediated Redox Strategy for Sustainable Lithium Extraction From Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iodine&#8208;mediated electrochemical strategy recycles spent LiFePO4 cathodes, extracting lithium as carbonate and producing metallic zinc. Delithiated LiFePO4 is transformed into an efficient oxygen evolution catalyst. This scalable, sustainable approach reduces energy use and emissions while offering economic benefits for clean energy applications.








Abstract
With the widespread application of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, the recycling of spent batteries, especially those involving LiFePO4 (LFP) cathodes for their low&#8208;cost and high safety, has become an urgent environmental and resource challenge. Traditional recycling methods (hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy) struggle to achieve green and efficient recycling. Herein, this study proposes an iodine&#8208;mediated electrochemical strategy to utilize a recyclable I3&#8722;/I&#8722; redox system and efficiently extract Li+ from spent LFP through liquid&#8208;phase reactions on one side (achieving a 93% leaching rate and recovery as lithium carbonate), while simultaneously producing metallic zinc through electrodeposition, which can be directly used in Zn&#8208;air batteries or hydrogen production. Furthermore, the delithiated LFP is upcycled into an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, achieving an overpotential of only 250&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, superior to commercial RuO2 catalysts. Eventually, this system reduces energy consumption by 32% (9.2&#160;MJ kg&#8722;1) compared to traditional hydrometallurgical processes, decreases greenhouse gas emissions by 35% compared to traditional pyrometallurgical processes, while achieving a net profit of &#8776;$0.44 per kg. This work establishes a novel, scalable recycling system, providing a robust sustainable solution for spent LFP cathodes recycling and clean energy storage.

Furthermore, the delithiated LFP is upcycled into an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, achieving an overpotential of only 250&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, superior to commercial RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts. Eventually, this system reduces energy consumption by 32% (9.2&#160;MJ kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to traditional hydrometallurgical processes, decreases greenhouse gas emissions by 35% compared to traditional pyrometallurgical processes, while achieving a net profit of &#8776;$0.44 per kg. This work establishes a novel, scalable recycling system, providing a robust sustainable solution for spent LFP cathodes recycling and clean energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Flexible QZPCs formulated by the MES@CNT/CC air cathode and IL&#8208;PANa hydrogel electrolyte demonstrate a high cell&#8208;level energy density of 105 Wh kgcell&#8722;1, and an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 4000 cycles at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 even at low temperature of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C. The electronic synergy within the bifunctional MES@CNT/CC air cathode, initiates an intriguing adaptive active&#8208;site&#8208;switching catalytic mechanism during the reciprocating ORR and OER processes, thereby sustaining the high performance of the QZPCs.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air pouch cells (QZPCs) promise a high energy&#8208;to&#8208;cost ratio while ensuring inherent safety. However, addressing the challenges associated with exploring superior energy&#8208;wise cathode catalysts along with their activity origin, and the super&#8208;ionic electrolytes remains a fundamental task. Herein, the realistic high&#8208;performance QZPCs are contrived, underpinned by a robust NiVFeCo medium&#8208;entropy metal sulfides (MESs) bifunctional air cathode with a record&#8208;low potential polarization of 0.523&#160;V, paired with a sodium polyacrylate&#8208;ionic liquid hydrogel exhibiting exceptional conductivity (234 mS cm&#8722;1) and water retention (93.8% at 7 days) at room temperature as the super&#8208;ionic conductor electrolyte. Through combined studies of in situ Raman, ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis, and theoretic calculations, an intriguing adaptive active&#8208;sites&#8208;switching mechanism of the MESs cathode during discharging/charging processes is unveiled, revealing a dynamic role transition of Co and Ni active sites in the reversible oxygen electrocatalysis. Consequently, the persistent low cathode polarization and super ion&#8208;conductive electrolyte endorse QZPCs an excellent rate performance from 1 to 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at room temperature. Moreover, an impressively high cell&#8208;level energy density of 105&#160;Wh kgcell&#8722;1 with an ultra&#8208;long cycle lifespan of 4000 cycles at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a low temperature of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C is achieved.

         <title>Emergent Locomotion in Self&#8208;Sustained, Mechanically Connected Soft Matter Rings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally fueled, self&#8208;moving twisted rings made from liquid crystal elastomers are investigated. By studying single rings and linked knots, it is shown how autonomous locomotion emerges through coupling between the rings. The movement is programmable via handedness control at connection points, offering insights into collective behavior and programmable motion in soft materials.








Abstract
In nature, the interplay between individual organisms often leads to the emergence of complex belabours, of which sophistication has been refined through millions of years of evolution. Synthetic materials research has focused on mimicking the natural complexity, e.g., by harnessing non&#8208;equilibrium states to drive self&#8208;assembly processes. However, it is highly challenging to understand the interaction dynamics between non&#8208;equilibrium entities and to obtain collective behavior that can arise autonomously through interaction. In this study, thermally fueled, twisted rings exhibiting self&#8208;sustained movements are used as fundamental units and their interactive behaviors and emergent functions are investigated. The rings are fabricated from connected thermoresponsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) strips that undergo zero&#8208;elastic&#8208;energy&#8208;mode, autonomous motions upon a heat gradient. Single&#8208;ring structures with various twisting numbers and nontrivial links, and connected knots where several LCE rings (N = 2,3,4,5) are studied and linked. The observations uncover that controlled locomotion of the structures can emerge when N &#8805; 3. The locomotion can be programmed by controlling the handedness at the connection points between the individual rings. These findings illustrate how group activity emerges from individual responsive material components through mechanical coupling, offering a model for programming autonomous locomotion in soft matter constructs.
