         <title>Cluster&#8208;Scale Multisite Interface Reinforces Ruthenium&#8208;Based Anode Catalysts for Alkaline Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strongly coupled multisite anode electrocatalyst with cluster&#8208;scale ruthenium&#8208;tungsten oxide (Ru&#8208;WOx) interface is developed for alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), which could simultaneously achieve high coverage of hydroxyl (OHad) and hydrogen (Had) at Ru and WOx domains, respectively. The AEMFC delivers a high peak power density of 1.36 W cm&#8722;2 with a low anode catalyst loading of 0.05 mgRu cm&#8722;2 and outstanding durability.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is a more cost&#8208;effective alternative to platinum anode catalysts for alkaline anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), but suffers from severe competitive adsorption of hydrogen (Had) and hydroxyl (OHad). To address this concern, a strongly coupled multisite electrocatalyst with highly active cluster&#8208;scale ruthenium&#8208;tungsten oxide (Ru&#8208;WOx) interface, which could eliminate the competitive adsorption phenomenon and achieve high coverage of OHad and Had at Ru and WOx domains, respectively, is designed. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that WOx domain functions as a proton sponge to perpetually accommodate the activated hydrogen species that spillover from the adjacent Ru domain, and the resulting WO&#8208;Had species are readily coupled with Ru&#8208;OHad at the heterointerface to finish the hydrogen oxidation reaction with faster kinetics via the thermodynamically favorable Tafel&#8208;Volmer mechanism. The AEMFC delivers a high peak power density of 1.36 W cm&#8722;2 with a low anode catalyst loading of 0.05 mgRu cm&#8722;2 and outstanding durability (negligible voltage decay over 80&#8208;h operation at 500&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). This work offers completely new insights into understanding the alkaline HOR mechanism and designing advanced anode catalysts for AEMFCs.

         <title>Cardiac Organoid Model Inspired Micro&#8208;Robot Smart Patch to Treat Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heart organoid model exhibits the acidic microenvironment characteristic of myocardial infarction, which emerges as a pivotal force propelling the movement of micro&#8208;robots. These micro&#8208;robots, administered through microneedles, can penetrate deep into the tissue, effectively delivering therapeutic payloads to facilitate heart repair.








Abstract
Post&#8208;myocardial infarction (MI), the rapid decrease in pH triggers myocardial cell acidosis, which compromises the therapeutic efficacy of exosomes in MI. The groundbreaking research in the human cardiac organoid MI model suggests that exosomes, when paired with pH adjustment, dramatically reduce cardiomyocyte mortality while maintaining their proliferative potential, underscoring the importance of pH regulation in myocardial preservation. Micro&#8208;robot mounted micro&#8208;needle (MN) patch is thus proposed, targeting MI&#8208;acidic microenvironmet, to deliver exosomes into deep injured tissue. Upon injection, the patch base releases VEGF&#8208;laden nanoparticles adhering to the infarcted myocardium. The smart patch is found not only 3D reconstructs the vascular network in MI regions but also effectively saves cardiomyocytes in rats. Furthermore, the minimally invasive delivery of MN patches are also verified to hearts of rabbits and pigs via thoracoscopic surgery underscores. These findings suggest that precise regulation of the microenvironment is a key to improving treatment outcomes.

         <title>Tribenzyl Organic Cations Carried Multidentate X&#8208;Type Lewis Soft Base for High&#8208;Performance Foldable Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes tribenzyl organic cation carried multidentate X&#8208;type Lewis soft base to enhance adhesion and passivate defects simultaneously, aiming to achieve foldable and efficient perovskite nanocrystal&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes.&#160;The resulting pure red F&#8208;PeLEDs exhibit a recorded high EQE of 16.2% and robust mechanical properties to endure 5000 folding cycles with small radius of 1 mm.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) exhibit significant potential for advancing foldable perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (F&#8208;PLEDs) due to their discrete crystalline morphology, bright emission across an extensive color gamut, and remarkable color purity; however, their progression remains in the early stages with the concerns of inadequate performance and mechanical instability. This study proposes a ligand strategy employing tribenzyl organic cation (tribenzylamine, TBA) carried multidentate X&#8208;type Lewis soft base (sodium acid pyrophosphate, SAPP) to address the challenges above simultaneously. Specifically, the use of multibranched aromatic ligands considerably improved the adhesion force between PNCs and adjacent layers, enhancing mechanical stability during folding, while the control sample shows deleterious cracks. Additionally, TBA&#8208;SAPP ligands effectively eliminate the defects in PNC film, yielding exceptional photoluminescence properties with a near&#8208;unity quantum yield. Consequently, the multifunctional ligands improved F&#8208;PLEDs to achieve a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 16.2% compared to the previously reported pure&#8208;red flexible PLEDs and display substantially improved spectral and operational stability. Equally important, these devices demonstrate robust mechanical properties, enduring a small folding radius of 1 mm for 5000 cycles. This ligand strategy is anticipated to inspire relevant research in PNCs and promote the realization of highly efficient and mechanically stable F&#8208;PLEDs.

         <title>Unveiling the Origin of Oxygen Framework Stability in Ultra&#8208;High Nickel Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of oxygen framework stability is studied by integrating high covalent element Mo into the bulk and surface of ultra&#8208;high nickel cathode materials through a one&#8208;step method. Mo with strong covalency can suppress Li/Ni antisite defects and reduce Li&#8208;O&#8208;Li configurations, thus suppressing irreversible phase transition and stabilizing the oxygen framework structure at high voltage.








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;high nickel layered oxides are recognized as promising cathode candidates for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their enhanced overall capacity and elevated operating voltage. However, the interlayer sliding of transition metal&#8208;oxygen octahedra (TMO6) and the instability of lattice oxygen at high voltages for ultra&#8208;high nickel oxide cathodes pose significant challenges to their development. Herein, the origin of oxygen framework stability is investigated by incorporating high&#8208;covalent element Mo in both bulk and surface using a one&#8208;step integrated method for ultra&#8208;high nickel cathode material LiNi0.92Co0.08O2. It is revealed that apart from the isolation and protection effect of the Mo&#8208;enriched surface layer, the suppression of Li/Ni antisite defects by Mo6+ with strong covalency in the bulk plays a critical role in reducing the configurations of the activated anionic redox reaction and stabilizing the lattice oxygen and oxygen framework structure. Benefiting from this, the reversibility of anionic redox reaction and the stability of oxygen framework is significantly enhanced, enabling more oxidized oxygen to exist in the form of oxygen dimer ions O2n&#8722;$O_2^{n - }$ rather than being lost as gaseous O2. Consequently, the modified ultra&#8208;high nickel material demonstrates improved diffusion kinetics and optimized electrochemical performance at high voltage.

Acid etching assisted direct upcycling strategy that selectively removals rock&#8208;salt phases on the surface of highly degraded LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 and dissociating polycrystalline structure to single crystals simultaneously, facilitating direct repair of its composition and structure via simple solid&#8208;state sintering. The regenerated LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 exhibits comparable capacity and more excellent electrochemical stability to commercialized ones.








Abstract
Direct recycling of cathode materials has attracted phenomenal attention due to its economic and eco&#8208;friendly advantages. However, existing direct recycling technologies are difficult to apply to highly degraded layered materials as the accumulation of thick rock&#8208;salt phases on their surfaces not only blocks lithiation channels but also is thermodynamically difficult to transform into layered phases. Here, a surface engineering&#8208;assisted direct upcycling strategy that reactivates the lithium diffusion channels at the highly degraded cathode surfaces using acid etching explored. Acid can selectively remove the electrochemically inert rock&#8208;salt phases on the surface while simultaneously dissociating the degraded polycrystalline structure to single crystals, thereby reducing the thermodynamic barrier of the relithiation process and enhancing the stability of the regenerated cathode. This strategy can restore the capacity of highly degraded LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 from 59.7 to 165.4 mAh g&#8722;1, comparable to that of commercialized ones. The regenerated cathode also exhibits excellent electrochemical stability with a capacity retention of 80.1% at 1 C after 500 cycles within 3.0&#8211;4.2 V (vs graphite) in pouch&#8208;type full cells. In addition, the generality of this strategy has also been validated on Ni&#8208;rich layered materials and LiCoO2. This work presents a promising approach for direct recycling of highly degraded cathode materials.

         <title>3D Printed Materials with Nanovoxelated Elastic Moduli</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D printing method enables the fabrication of materials with precisely controlled mechanical properties at nanoscale resolution. A volume&#8208;conserving photoresist combined with the free and open&#8208;source software, OpenScribe, achieves mechanical transitions over 770 nanometers &#8208; representing a 130&#8208;fold improvement over existing approaches. This advancement enables the creation of complex materials with unprecedented control over local elasticity.








Abstract
Fabrication methods that synthesize materials with higher precision and complexity at ever smaller scales are rapidly developing. Despite such advances, generating&#160;complex 3D materials with controlled mechanical properties at the nanoscale remains challenging. Exerting precise control over mechanical properties at the nanoscale would enable material strengths near theoretical maxima, and the replication of natural structures with hitherto unattainable strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratios. Here, a method for fabricating materials with nanovoxelated elastic moduli by employing a volume&#8208;conserving photoresist composed of a copolymer hydrogel, along with OpenScribe, an open&#8208;source software that enables the precise programming of material mechanics, is presented. Combining these, a material composed of periodic unit cells featuring heteromechanically tessellated soft&#8208;stiff structures, achieving a mechanical transition over an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude change in elastic modulus within 770&#160;nm, a 130&#8208;fold improvement on previous reports, is demonstrated. This work critically advances material design and opens new avenues for fabricating materials with specifically tailored properties and functionalities through unparalleled control over nanoscale mechanics.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Switchable Photomultiplication and Photovoltaic Dual&#8208;Mode Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodetector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, BFDO&#8208;4F, is integrated into organic photodetectors (OPDs) to enable electron trapping. The resulting devices exhibit dual&#8208;mode functionality, with bias&#8208;switchable operation between photovoltaic (PV) and photomultiplication (PM) modes. An on&#8208;chip module is demonstrated, where the PV section supplies bias for the PM section achieving self&#8208;powered amplifier&#8208;free system, highlighting the potential for multifunctional OPDs in advanced optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodetectors (PM&#8208;OPDs) provide for signal amplification, ideal for detecting faint light, and simplifying detection systems. However, current designs often suffer from slow response speed and elevated dark current. Conversely, photovoltaic&#8208;type organic photodetectors (PV&#8208;OPDs) provide fast response and high specific detectivity (D*) but have limited photoresponse. This study presents the synthesis and incorporation of a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, BFDO&#8208;4F, into the active layer to introduce trap states for capturing photogenerated electrons. The resulting device exhibits dual&#8208;mode characteristic and is bias&#8208;switchable between PV and PM&#8208;modes. In PV&#8208;mode, the OPDs achieve high D* of 1.92 &#215; 10&#185;2 Jones and a response time of 2.83/4.43 &#181;s. In PM&#8208;mode, the OPDs exhibit exceptional external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 3484% and a D* of up to 1.13 &#215; 10&#185;2 Jones. An on&#8208;chip self&#8208;powered module with PV&#8208;mode pixels driving a PM&#8208;mode pixel is demonstrated, yielding a photocurrent approximately five times higher than the reference device. This approach paves the way for developing multifunctional bias&#8208;switchable dual&#8208;mode on&#8208;chip OPDs, suitable for various applications.

         <title>Machine Learning Relationships Between Nanoporous Structures and Electrochemical Performance in MOF Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study constructs a unified supercapacitor database comprising hundreds of MOF electrodes based on constant&#8208;potential molecular simulation. The relationships between porous structures and electrochemical performance are thoroughly examined through interpretable machine learning techniques, with molecular insights by analyzing in&#8208;pore electrode&#8208;ion coordination and ion diffusion. These findings pave the way for the design and optimization of advanced electrode materials.









Abstract
The development of supercapacitors is impeded by the unclear relationships between nanoporous electrode structures and electrochemical performance, primarily due to challenges in decoupling the complex interdependencies of various structural descriptors. While machine learning (ML) techniques offer a promising solution, their application is hindered by the lack of large, unified databases. Herein, constant&#8208;potential molecular simulation is used to construct a unified supercapacitor database with hundreds of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) electrodes. Leveraging this database, well&#8208;trained decision&#8208;tree&#8208;based ML models achieve fast, accurate, and interpretable predictions of capacitance and charging rate, experimentally validated by a representative case. SHAP analyses reveal that specific surface area (SSA) governs gravimetric capacitance while pore size effects are minimal, attributed to the strong dependence of electrode&#8208;ion coordination on SSA rather than pore size. SSA and porosity, respectively, dominate volumetric capacitance in 1D&#8208;pore and 3D&#8208;pore MOFs, pinnacling the indispensable effects of pore dimensionality. Meanwhile, porosity is found to be the most decisive factor in the charging rate for both 1D&#8208;pore and 3D&#8208;pore MOFs. Especially for 3D&#8208;pore MOFs, an exponential increase in porosity is observed in both ionic conductance and in&#8208;pore ion diffusion coefficient, ascribed to loosened ion packing. These findings provide profound insights for the design of high&#8208;performance supercapacitor electrodes.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the synthesis of printable photonic materials and devices for both wearable and implantable sensing applications. The challenges of mechanical stability, biocompatibility, and large&#8208;scale manufacturing are discussed with proposed strategies. Innovations in high&#8208;performance printable photonic sensing devices can inspire their practical applications in personalized medicine and intelligent healthcare.








Abstract
Photonic materials possess tunable optical properties and have been widely utilized for healthcare applications. These materials enable the detection of physical and physiological bio&#8208;signals via modulated optical output characteristics, such as wavelength shifts, fluorescence emission, and light scattering. When further synthesized into functional photonic inks, multimodal devices for epidermal, minimally invasive, and implantable bio&#8208;sensing can be constructed in facile and printable manners. This review first introduces functional photonic materials in different geometries and their unique properties. To enable feasible fabrication of multi&#8208;functional photonic devices for biosensing in versatile platforms, the synthesis of printable inks and the as&#8208;printed devices are then illustrated. Subsequently, the advances and breakthroughs to construct printable photonic devices and integrated systems for wearable and implantable applications are displayed, especially for multimodal sensing to facilitate personalized and remote healthcare. Finally, the challenges in achieving mechanical stability, eliminated degradation, enhanced biocompatibility in dynamic biological environments, and scalable production are discussed, along with the prospects toward reliable and intelligent healthcare.

         <title>Locally Resonant Metagrating by Elastic Impedance Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a breakthrough in wave manipulation physics and technology, enabling perfect absorption and precise wavefront control. The proposed concept of metagrating surpasses the size and efficiency limitations of conventional ones. Its compact, lightweight design tackles the key challenge inherent to all elastic wave&#8208;manipulation metastructures, which consists in the unavoidable vibration modes in finite structures hindering their implementation in real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
Optical and acoustic metagratings have addressed the challenges of low&#8208;efficiency wave manipulation and high&#8208;complexity fabrication associated with metamaterials and metasurfaces. In this research, the concept of locally resonant elastic metagrating (LREM) is both theoretically and experimentally demonstrated, which is underpinned by the unique elastic impedance modulation and the hybridization of intrinsic evanescent waves. Remarkably, the LREM overcomes the size limitations of conventional metagratings and offers a distinctive design paradigm for highly efficient, compact, and lightweight structures for wave manipulation in elastic wave systems. Importantly, the LREM tackles a key challenge inherent to all elastic wave&#8208;manipulation metastructures, which consists in the unavoidable vibration modes in finite structures hindering their real&#8208;world&#160;applications.

         <title>Localized Electrolyte Grain Engineering to Suppress Li Intrusion in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a highly scalable chemical approach based on the anion exchange reaction is developed to engineer an amorphous metal compound layer on the surface of argyrodite&#8208;type electrolyte grains. Further, a novel localized grain engineering concept is introduced, which combines engineered and pure electrolyte grains to enable aggregates with favorable macroscopic properties for suppressing Li intrusion.








Abstract
Li intrusion is the primary factor contributing to the undesirable cycling durability and rate capability of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. However, conventional engineering methodologies for solid electrolytes (SEs) that focus on crystalline scales, such as doping, have limited efficacy in addressing this issue, as they not only involve cumbersome trial&#8208;and&#8208;error processes but also struggle to simultaneously optimize the multiple macroscopic properties necessary for effectively suppressing Li intrusion. Herein, rather than following the conventional practice of SE engineering, it is concentrated on optimizing SEs at the grain&#8208;aggregate level. A highly scalable chemical approach based on a thermodynamic&#8208;favored anion exchange reaction is first developed to engineer an amorphous metal compound layer on the surface of argyrodite&#8208;type electrolyte grains. Further, a novel localized grain engineering concept is introduced, which combines engineered and pure electrolyte grains to enable aggregates with favorable macroscopic properties for suppressing Li intrusion. The localized grain&#8208;engineered electrolyte aggregates greatly enhance Li reversibility and are able to suppress Li intrusion under practical working conditions. Notably, the 20 &#181;m&#8208;Li||LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cell using localized grain&#8208;engineered electrolyte aggregates can stably cycle for over 2000 cycles at a high current density of 1.6 mA cm&#8722;2.

         <title>LiF&#8208;Rich Cathode Electrolyte Interphases Homogenizing Li+ Fluxes toward Stable Interface in Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel vapor phase method is first proposed to reconstruct a robust LiF coating layer on the Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes. The designed LiF layer effectively modulates the electric field distribution on the electrode surface, thereby promoting the formation of a uniform LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase&#160;(CEI). The optimized CEI facilitates homogeneous Li+ fluxes on the electrode surface, contributing to a stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface.








Abstract
Constructing a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) is crucial to enhance the battery performance of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based oxide (LMO) cathodes. To achieve an ideal CEI, a gas&#8208;phase fluorination technique is proposed to pre&#8208;structure a robust LiF layer (&#8776;1&#160;nm) on the LMO surface. The designed LiF layer effectively modulates the electric field distribution on the electrode surface and mitigates undesirable side reactions between the electrode and electrolyte, thereby promoting the formation of a uniform LiF&#8208;rich CEI layer on the LMO&#8208;F&#8208;1. The optimized CEI facilitates homogeneous Li+ fluxes across the electrode surface and enhances Li+ diffusion in the electrode during (de)intercalation, contributing to a stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, the robust LiF&#8208;rich CEI layer effectively suppresses the decomposition of lithium salts in the electrolyte and reduces autocatalytic side reactions triggered by the by&#8208;products. In addition, it improves the structural stability of LMO by increasing the formation energies of oxygen and manganese vacancies. As a result, the modified LMO with the LiF&#8208;rich CEI retains 95% of its initial capacity after 100 cycles, demonstrating remarkable electrochemical stability. The proposed gas&#8208;phase Li+ flux homogenization strategy offers a promising avenue for enhancing the interface stability of high&#8208;voltage cathode materials with lithium storage.

         <title>Gasotransmitter&#8208;Nanodonor for Spatial Regulation of Anxiety&#8208;Like Behavior and Bone Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gasotransmitter&#8208;nanodonor FSG@AB co&#8208;releases hydrogen sulfide (H&#8322;S) and glucose oxidase (GOx) at bone metastases, disrupting mitochondrial function and inhibiting glycolysis to deplete tumor energy sources, exerting robust anti&#8208;tumor effects. The released H&#8322;S travels to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), upregulating glutamate transporter 1 (GLT&#8208;1) expression, reducing extracellular glutamate levels, and mitigating glutamatergic hyperactivity, ultimately alleviating anxiety&#8208;like behaviors.








Abstract
Anxiety is highly prevalent among cancer patients, significantly impacting their prognosis. Current cancer therapies typically lack anxiolytic properties and may even exacerbate anxiety. Here, a gasotransmitter&#8208;nanodonors (GND) system is presented that exerts dual anxiolytic and anti&#8208;tumor effects via a &#8220;tumor&#8208;brain axis&#8221; strategy. The GND, synthesized by co&#8208;embedding Fe2&#8314; and S2&#8315; ions along with glucose oxidase (GOx) within bovine serum albumin (BSA) nanoparticles (FSG@AB), enables the controlled release of the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H&#8322;S) in the acidic tumor microenvironment. H&#8322;S and GOx synergistically deplete tumor energy sources, resulting in robust anti&#8208;tumor effects. Meanwhile, H&#8322;S generated at the tumor site is transported through the bloodstream to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the brain, where it modulates neuronal activity. Specifically, in the ACC, H&#8322;S upregulates glutamate transporter 1 (GLT&#8208;1), which reduces extracellular glutamate levels and attenuates the hyperactivity of glutamatergic neurons, thereby alleviating anxiety&#8208;like behavior. This study proposes a GND system that targets both oncological and psychiatric dimensions of cancer through the &#8220;tumor&#8208;brain axis&#8221; strategy, resulting in improved therapeutic outcomes.

Abstract
Harnessing engineered living materials for energy application represents a promising avenue to sustainable energy conversion and storage, with bio&#8208;batteries emerging as a pivotal direction for sustainable power supply. Whereas, the realization of miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery orchestrating off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf devices remains a significant challenge. Here, this work reports the development of a miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery using living hydrogels containing conductive biofilms encapsulated in an alginate matrix for nerve stimulation. These hydrogels, which can be 3&#8208;D printed into customized geometries, retained biologically active characteristics, including electroactivity that facilitates electron generation and the reduction of graphene oxide. By fabricating the living hydrogel into a standard 2032 battery shell with a diameter of 20&#160;mm, this work successfully creates a miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery with self&#8208;charging performance. The device demonstrates remarkable electrochemical performance with a coulombic efficiency of 99.5% and maintains high cell viability exceeding 90% after operation. Notably, the electricity generated by the bio&#8208;battery can be harnessed for nerve stimulation to enable precise control over bioelectrical stimulation and physiological blood pressure signals. This study paves the way for the development of novel, compact, and portable bio&#8208;energy devices with immense potential for future advancements in sustainable energy technologies.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harnessing engineered living materials for energy application represents a promising avenue to sustainable energy conversion and storage, with bio-batteries emerging as a pivotal direction for sustainable power supply. Whereas, the realization of miniaturized and portable bio-battery orchestrating off-the-shelf devices remains a significant challenge. Here, this work reports the development of a miniaturized and portable bio-battery using living hydrogels containing conductive biofilms encapsulated in an alginate matrix for nerve stimulation. These hydrogels, which can be 3-D printed into customized geometries, retained biologically active characteristics, including electroactivity that facilitates electron generation and the reduction of graphene oxide. By fabricating the living hydrogel into a standard 2032 battery shell with a diameter of 20&#160;mm, this work successfully creates a miniaturized and portable bio-battery with self-charging performance. The device demonstrates remarkable electrochemical performance with a coulombic efficiency of 99.5% and maintains high cell viability exceeding 90% after operation. Notably, the electricity generated by the bio-battery can be harnessed for nerve stimulation to enable precise control over bioelectrical stimulation and physiological blood pressure signals. This study paves the way for the development of novel, compact, and portable bio-energy devices with immense potential for future advancements in sustainable energy technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Spin&#8208;Orbit&#8208;Locking Holography
In article number 2415142, Xiaocong Yuan, Puxiang Lai, Qinghua Song, and co&#8208;workers present a multi&#8208;channel vectorial holography technique encoded by both the spin and orbital angular momentum using a minimalist, non&#8208;interleaved, geometry&#8208;phase metasurface. It not only substantially enhances the selectivity of input light, exhibiting intriguing spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;locking behavior, but also expands the multiplexing channels of the output optical field, holding great potential for advanced light manipulation.

Mechanical Metamaterial
In article number 2410865, Fei Pan, Yuli Chen, and co&#8208;workers propose an automatically on&#8208;demand reprogrammable mechanical metamaterial. Driven by the pre&#8208;established structure&#8208;performance relations, the metamaterial can automatically tune its building blocks' states using built&#8208;in actuators to match different target stress&#8208;strain curves in real time. This offers a new solution for the physical properties reprogramming of artificial systems.

Sapphire Machining Integrated with Superconducting Qubits
In article number 2411780, Connor D. Shelly and co&#8208;workers from OQC and the University of Southampton present the integration of machining of sapphire substrates with superconducting qubits and quantum processors. It is shown that this sapphire machining process is compatible with the production of high&#8208;coherence qubits whilst maintaining tight Josephson junction parameter spread. This work provides a route to further scaling of quantum processors on sapphire.

Abstract
Film capacitors are widely used in advanced electrical and electronic systems. The temperature stability of polymer dielectrics plays a critical role in supporting their performance operation at elevated temperatures. For the last decade, the investigations for new polymer dielectrics with high energy storage performance at higher temperatures (&gt;200 &#176;C) have attracted much attention and numerous strategies have been employed. However, there is currently still a large gap between lab research and large&#8208;scale production. In this review, the main effects of high temperature on the dielectric properties are analyzed and core modification strategies are summarized. The scientific and technological reasons for the performance difference between lab research and practical application are also discussed. Further, several processes for large&#8208;scale film preparation and typical device structure design are reviewed. The current research and product launches pertaining of high&#8208;temperature film capacitors are also summarized. Conclusive insights and future perspectives are delineated to offer strategic direction for the ongoing and prospective innovation in polymer dielectric materials.

Abstract
Biological structures exhibit autonomous and intelligent behaviors, such as movement, perception, and responses to environmental changes, through dynamic interactions with their surroundings. Inspired by natural organisms, future soft robots are also advancing toward autonomy, sustainability, and interactivity. This review summarizes the latest achievements in untethered soft robots based on 1D and 2D nanomaterials. First, the performance of soft actuators designed with different structures is compared. Then, the development of basic locomotion forms, including crawling, jumping, swimming, rolling, gripping, and multimodal, mimicking biological motion mechanisms under dynamic stimuli, is discussed. Subsequently, various self&#8208;sustained movements based on imbalance mechanisms under static stimuli are introduced, including light tracking, self&#8208;oscillating, self&#8208;crawling, self&#8208;rolling, and flying. Following that, the progress in soft actuators integrated with additional functionalities such as sensing, energy harvesting, and storage is summarized. Finally, the challenges faced in this field and the prospects for future development are discussed.

It then delves into the mechanisms behind crystal nucleation and growth, explaining how these processes impact perovskite quality and performance. Additionally, it discusses common strategies to improve crystallization quality, including additive engineering, solvent engineering, evaporation control, and post&#8208;treatment techniques. Lastly, the review offers potential recommendations to further enhance perovskite crystallization, encouraging ongoing innovation to overcome current challenges and drive the advancement of p&#8208;MPSCs.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based printable mesoscopic solar cells (p&#8208;MPSCs) offer significant advantages for industrialization due to their simple fabrication process, low cost, and scalability. Recently, the certified power conversion efficiency of p&#8208;MPSCs has exceeded 22%, drawing considerable attention from the community. However, the key challenge in improving device performance is achieving uniform and high&#8208;quality perovskite crystallization within the mesoporous structure. This review highlights recent advancements in perovskite crystallization for p&#8208;MPSCs, with an emphasis on controlling crystallization kinetics and regulating perovskite morphology within confined mesopores. It first introduces the p&#8208;MPSCs, offering a solid foundation for understanding their behavior. Additionally, the review summarizes the mechanisms of crystal nucleation and growth, explaining how these processes influence the quality and performance of perovskites. Furthermore, commonly applied strategies for enhancing crystallization quality, such as additive engineering, solvent engineering, evaporation controlling, and post&#8208;treatment techniques, are also explored. Finally, the review proposes several potential suggestions aimed at further refining perovskite crystallization, inspiring continued innovation to address current limitations and advance the development of p&#8208;MPSCs.

         <title>Flexible Neuromorphic Electronics for Wearable Near&#8208;Sensor and In&#8208;Sensor Computing Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Research on the flexible bio&#8208;inspired cognitive systems, classified into near&#8208; and in&#8208;sensor computing, is addressed. Fundamental aspects, including biological processes, required components, and the device types for each component, as well as applications for wearable systems, are discussed. Additionally, perspectives on future research directions for flexible neuromorphic electronics are provided.








Abstract
Flexible neuromorphic architectures that emulate biological cognitive systems hold great promise for smart wearable electronics. To realize neuro&#8208;inspired sensing and computing electronics, artificial sensory neurons that detect and process external stimuli must be integrated with central nervous systems capable of parallel computation. In near&#8208;sensor computing, synaptic devices, and sensors are used to emulate sensory neurons and receptors, respectively. In contrast, in in&#8208;sensor computing, a single multifunctional device serves as both the receptor and neuron. Bio&#8208;inspired cognitive systems efficiently detect and process stimuli through data structuring techniques, significantly reducing data volume and enabling the extension of neuromorphic applications to smart wearable systems. To construct wearable near&#8208; and in&#8208;sensor computing, it is crucial to develop artificial sensory neurons and central nervous synapses that replicate the biological functionalities. Additionally, the integrated systems must exhibit high mechanical flexibility and integration density. This review addresses research on flexible bio&#8208;inspired cognitive systems, classified into near&#8208; and in&#8208;sensor computing. It covers fundamental aspects, including biological cognitive processes, the required components, and the structures for each component, as well as applications for wearable smart systems. Finally, it offers perspectives on future research directions for flexible neuromorphic electronics in smart wearable systems connected to the next&#8208;generation Internet of Things.

         <title>Destabilization of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts: Characterization, Mechanisms, and Regeneration Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of deactivation mechanisms and regeneration strategies for single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), identifying five deactivation pathways across seven destabilization scenarios and detailing three key regeneration strategies. It introduces advanced in situ and ex situ characterization techniques relevant to these processes. These insights provide valuable guidance for designing stable and efficient SACs for energy applications.








Abstract
Numerous in situ characterization studies have focused on revealing the catalytic mechanisms of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), providing a theoretical basis for their rational design. Although research is relatively limited, the stability of SACs under long&#8208;term operating conditions is equally important and a prerequisite for their real&#8208;world energy applications, such as fuel cells and water electrolyzers. Recently, there has been a rise in in situ characterization studies on the destabilization and regeneration of SACs; however, timely and comprehensive summaries that provide the catalysis community with valuable insights and research directions are still lacking. This review summarizes recent advances in the destabilization mechanisms and regeneration strategies of SACs, specifically highlighting various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization techniques employed in the studies. The factors that induce destabilization in SACs are identified by discussing the failure of active sites, coordination environments, supports, and reaction conditions under long&#8208;term operating scenarios. Next, the primary regeneration strategies for SACs are introduced, including redispersion, surface poison desorption, and exposure of subsurface active sites. Additionally, the advantages and limitations of both in situ and ex situ characterization techniques are discussed. Finally, future research directions are proposed, aimed at constructing structure&#8211;stability relationships and guiding the design of more stable SACs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Metal Complexes in Biomedical Research</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal complexes are widely used in biomedical research due to their excellent properties. To further overcome the pharmacological limitations of metal complexes, the multifunctional nanomaterials are developed. This review introduces the self&#8208;assembly of metal complexes into nanoparticles of various shapes, the mechanism of self&#8208;assembly, and their applications in biomedical fields such as detection, imaging, and antitumor therapy.








Abstract
Cisplatin is widely used in clinical cancer treatment; however, its application is often hindered by severe side effects, particularly inherent or acquired resistance of target cells. To address these challenges, an effective strategy is to modify the metal core of the complex and introduce alternative coordination modes or valence states, leading to the development of a series of metal complexes, such as platinum (IV) prodrugs and cyclometalated complexes. Recent advances in nanotechnology have facilitated the development of multifunctional nanomaterials that can selectively deliver drugs to tumor cells, thereby overcoming the pharmacological limitations of metal&#8208;based drugs. This review first explores the self&#8208;assembly of metal complexes into spherical, linear, and irregular nanoparticles in the context of biomedical applications. The mechanisms underlying the self&#8208;assembly of metal complexes into nanoparticles are subsequently analyzed, followed by a discussion of their applications in biomedical fields, including detection, imaging, and antitumor research.

         <title>Advances in Oxygen Evolution Reaction Electrocatalysts via Direct Oxygen&#8211;Oxygen Radical Coupling Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts via the oxide path mechanism (OPM) is systematically reviewed. It sheds light on the rational design of OPM&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts to break the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;offs involved in conventional OER mechanisms, leading to more efficient energy conversion and storage processes, such as water electrolysis, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a cornerstone of various electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems, including water splitting, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and rechargeable metal&#8208;air batteries. OER typically proceeds through three primary mechanisms: adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), and oxide path mechanism (OPM). Unlike AEM and LOM, the OPM proceeds via direct oxygen&#8211;oxygen radical coupling that can bypass linear scaling relationships of reaction intermediates in AEM and avoid catalyst structural collapse in LOM, thereby enabling enhanced catalytic activity and stability. Despite its unique advantage, electrocatalysts that can drive OER via OPM remain nascent and are increasingly recognized as critical. This review discusses recent advances in OPM&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts. It starts by analyzing three reaction mechanisms that guide the design of electrocatalysts. Then, several types of novel materials, including atomic ensembles, metal oxides, perovskite oxides, and molecular complexes, are highlighted. Afterward, operando characterization techniques used to monitor the dynamic evolution of active sites and reaction intermediates are examined. The review concludes by discussing several research directions to advance OPM&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts toward practical applications.

         <title>Army Ant Nest Inspired Adaptive Textile for Smart Thermal Regulation and Healthcare Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the thermal adaptability of army ant nest, an innovative textile, Army ant Nest Textile (ANT), is developed for intelligent thermal regulation and healthcare monitoring. The ANT swiftly reacts to perspiration, enhancing heat dissipation through improved radiation transmission and air exchange. Additionally, it integrates colorimetric sensors for temperature, sweat pH, and UV intensity, providing vital risk signals for users.








Abstract
A textile material that can dynamically adapt to different environments while serving as an immediate alert system for early detection of life&#8208;threatening factors in the surroundings, not only enhances the individual's health management but also contributes to a reduction in energy consumption for space cooling and/or heating. In nature, different species have their own adaptation system to ambient temperature. Inspired by the army ant nest, herein a thermal adaptive textile known as Army ant Nest Textile (ANT) for thermal management and health monitoring is reported. This textile can promptly respond to perspiration, rapidly absorb sweat, and then transform its architecture to facilitate heat dissipation. Simultaneously, the colorimetric sensing function of ANT allows it to emulate the &#8220;site migration&#8221; behavior of the army ant nest, which empowers individuals to expeditiously identify multiple health&#8208;related signals such as body temperature, UV radiation, and sweat pH values, and warn them to move to a secure environment, thereby effectively reducing the likelihood of physical harm. Together with its excellent scalability and biocompatibility, the ANT offers a promising direction for the development of next&#8208;generation smart e&#8208;textiles for personal thermal and healthcare management, while satisfying the growing demand for energy saving.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the thermal adaptability of army ant nest, an innovative textile, Army ant Nest Textile (ANT), is developed for intelligent thermal regulation and healthcare monitoring. The ANT swiftly reacts to perspiration, enhancing heat dissipation through improved radiation transmission and air exchange. Additionally, it integrates colorimetric sensors for temperature, sweat pH, and UV intensity, providing vital risk signals for users.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A textile material that can dynamically adapt to different environments while serving as an immediate alert system for early detection of life-threatening factors in the surroundings, not only enhances the individual's health management but also contributes to a reduction in energy consumption for space cooling and/or heating. In nature, different species have their own adaptation system to ambient temperature. Inspired by the army ant nest, herein a thermal adaptive textile known as Army ant Nest Textile (ANT) for thermal management and health monitoring is reported. This textile can promptly respond to perspiration, rapidly absorb sweat, and then transform its architecture to facilitate heat dissipation. Simultaneously, the colorimetric sensing function of ANT allows it to emulate the &#8220;site migration&#8221; behavior of the army ant nest, which empowers individuals to expeditiously identify multiple health-related signals such as body temperature, UV radiation, and sweat pH values, and warn them to move to a secure environment, thereby effectively reducing the likelihood of physical harm. Together with its excellent scalability and biocompatibility, the ANT offers a promising direction for the development of next-generation smart e-textiles for personal thermal and healthcare management, while satisfying the growing demand for energy saving.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A controllable &#8220;oxygen vehicle&#8221; as a versatile nano&#8208;carrier. For co&#8208;delivery with lactate oxidase (LOX) significantly elevated lactate detection rates, triggering a significantly increase in IFN&#8208;&#947; and T cell infiltration. Co&#8208;delivering unmethylated cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligonucleotide &#65288;CpGODN&#65289; demonstrate a remarkable increase in polarization of macrophages from M2&#8208;like to M1&#8208;like phenotypes, DCs maturation, and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells.








Abstract
Hypoxia severely limits the antitumor immunotherapy for breast cancer. Although efforts to alleviate tumor hypoxia and drug delivery using diverse nanostructures achieve promising results, the creation of a versatile controllable oxygen&#8208;releasing nano&#8208;platform for co&#8208;delivery with immunostimulatory molecules remains a persistent challenge. To address this problem, a versatile oxygen controllable releasing vehicle PFOB@F127@PDA (PFPNPs) is developed, which effectively co&#8208;delivered either protein drug lactate oxidase (LOX) or nucleic acids drug unmethylated cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligonucleotide (CpG ODNs). Upon photothermal heating, this platform triggered oxygen release, thereby augmenting LOX&#8208;mediated lactate detection rates, and improving T cells infiltrating and cytokine expression. Moreover, under an oxygenated tumor microenvironment (TME), PFPNPs co&#8208;delivered with CpG ODNs effectively reprogrammed the immunosuppressive TME by repolarizing macrophages to an M1&#8208;like phenotype, promoting dendritic cells maturation, and increasing tumor&#8208;infiltrating T cells while decreasing the ratio of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Our study demonstrated that this controlled oxygen&#8208;releasing platform possessed adaptive drug&#8208;loading capabilities to meet varied immunotherapeutic demands in clinical settings.

         <title>Microenvironment Mechanical Torque from ZnFe2O4 (ZFO) Micromotors Inhibiting Tumor Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles self&#8208;assemble in situ effectively and introduce mechanical force simulating primary biomechanical into the tiny target spot of TME through wireless magnetic control, which effectively inhibits tumor migration.








Abstract
Mechanical force attracts booming attention with the potential to tune the tumor cell behavior, especially in cell migration. However, the current approach for introducing mechanical input is difficult to apply in vivo. How the mechanical force affects cell behavior in situ also remains unclear. In this work, an intelligent miniaturized platform is constructed with magnetic ZnFe2O4 (ZFO) micromotors. The wireless ZFO can self&#8208;assemble in situ and rotate to generate mechanical torque of biologically relevant piconewton&#8208;scale at the target tumor site. It is observed unexpectedly that enhanced in situ mechanical rotating torque from ZFO micromotors and the active fluid inhibit the migration of highly invasive A549 tumor cells. The down&#8208;regulation of the Piezo1 channel and the suppressed signaling of ROCK1 in mechano&#8208;adaptive tumor cells is found to be related to the inhibition effect. With effectiveness confirmed with the zebrafish xenograft model, this platform provides a valuable toolkit for mechanobiology and force&#8208;associated non&#8208;invasive tumor therapy.

         <title>On&#8208;demand Reprogrammable Mechanical Metamaterial Driven by Structure Performance Relations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapidly and on&#8208;demand reprogrammable mechanical metamaterial with an embedded digital interface to its structure&#8208;performance relationships is proposed. For a given stress&#8211;strain curve, the optimal state can first be calculated based on pre&#8208;established structure&#8208;performance relationships. Subsequently, the state of the metamaterial can be changed using integrated soft actuators, enabling accurate and fast performance reprogramming.








Abstract
The physical reprogrammability of metamaterials provides unprecedented opportunities for tailoring changeable mechanical behaviors. It is envisioned that metamaterials can actively, precisely, and rapidly reprogram their performances through digital interfaces toward varying demands. However, on&#8208;demand reprogramming by integration of physical and digital merits still remains less explored. Here, a real&#8208;time reprogrammable mechanical metamaterial is reported that is guided by its own structure&#8208;performance relations. The metamaterial consists of periodically tessellated bistable building blocks with built&#8208;in soft actuators for state switching, exhibiting rich spatial heterogeneity. Guided by the pre&#8208;established relations between state sequences and stress&#8211;strain curves, the metamaterial can accurately match a target curve by digitally tuning its state within 4 s. The metamaterial can be elastically tensioned and compressed under a strain of 4%, and its modulus tuning ratio reaches &gt;30. Moreover, it also shows highly tunable shearing and bending performances. This work provides a new thought for the physical performance reprogrammability of artificial intelligent systems.

         <title>Integration of Through&#8208;Sapphire Substrate Machining with Superconducting Quantum Processors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through&#8208;sapphire machining is integrated with superconducting quantum processors (QPUs) and qubits. High coherence of the qubits is demonstrated as well as low parameter spread. This machining integration provides a route to further scaling of QPUs on new materials such as tantalum that are typically deposited on sapphire substrates. In addition, the machining provides a route to through&#8208;sapphire&#8208;vias in superconducting circuits.








Abstract
A sapphire machining process integrated with intermediate&#8208;scale quantum processors is demonstrated. The process allows through&#8208;substrate electrical connections, necessary for low&#8208;frequency mode&#8208;mitigation, as well as signal&#8208;routing, which are vital as quantum computers scale in qubit number, and thus dimension. High&#8208;coherence qubits are required to build fault&#8208;tolerant quantum computers and so material choices are an important consideration when developing a qubit technology platform. Sapphire, as a low&#8208;loss dielectric substrate, has shown to support high&#8208;coherence qubits. In addition, recent advances in material choices such as tantalum and titanium&#8208;nitride, both deposited on a sapphire substrate, have demonstrated qubit lifetimes exceeding 0.3 ms. However, the lack of any process equivalent of deep&#8208;silicon etching to create through&#8208;substrate&#8208;vias in sapphire, or to inductively shunt large dies, has limited sapphire to small&#8208;scale processors, or necessitates the use of chiplet architecture. Here, a sapphire machining process that is compatible with high&#8208;coherence qubits is presented. This technique immediately provides a means to scale quantum processing units (QPUs) with integrated mode&#8208;mitigation, and provides a route toward the development of through&#8208;sapphire&#8208;vias, both of which allow the advantages of sapphire to be leveraged as well as facilitating the use of sapphire&#8208;compatible materials for large&#8208;scale&#160;QPUs.

         <title>Quantum Dot Luminescence Microspheres Enable Ultra&#8208;Efficient and Bright Micro&#8208;LEDs</title>

Green and red quantum dot (QD) luminescence microspheres with simultaneous excellent color conversion performance and high photoluminescence stability are synthesized by a facile wet chemical process. They further serve as color conversion materials for the fabrication of green and red micro&#8208;LEDs, which exhibit world&#8208;record external quantum efficiencies of 40.8% and 22.1% and high brightnesses of 1.7&#160;&#215;&#160;108 and 7.6&#160;&#215;&#160;107 cd&#160;m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Quantum dot (QD)&#8208;converted micrometer&#8208;scale light&#8208;emitting diodes (micro&#8208;LEDs) are regarded as an effective solution for achieving high&#8208;performance full&#8208;color micro&#8208;LED displays because of their narrow&#8208;band emission, simplified mass transfer, facile drive circuits, and low cost. However, these micro&#8208;LEDs suffer from significant blue light leakage and unsatisfactory electroluminescence properties due to the poor light conversion efficiency and stability of the QDs. Herein, the construction of green and red QD luminescence microspheres with the simultaneously high conversion efficiency of blue light and strong photoluminescence stability are proposed. These luminescence microspheres exhibit high external photoluminescence quantum yields exceeding 46% under 450&#160;nm excitation, along with excellent reliability against blue light, heat, and water&#8208;oxygen degradation, owing to the waveguide and spatial confinement effects of the microspheres. The microsphere&#8208;based green and red micro&#8208;LEDs achieve world&#8208;record external quantum efficiencies of 40.8% and 22.1%, respectively, and high brightness values of 1.7&#160;&#215;&#160;108 and 7.6&#160;&#215;&#160;107&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, respectively. Finally, 0.6&#160;inch red, green, and blue monochrome micro&#8208;LED displays are demonstrated by integrating microsphere&#8208;converted micro&#8208;LED arrays with thin&#8208;film transistor backplanes, which show a pixel resolution as high as 1700 PPI and brightness exceeding 10&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Stress Relaxation for Lead Iodide Nucleation in Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By inducing LiOTf in SnO2/ PbI2, the defects in bulk SnO2 and at the interface are passivated and stress in PbI2 is released, thus reducing the critical Gibbs free energy for mesoporous PbI2 films which leads to highly crystalline perovskite films. Ultimately, efficient and stable perovskite solar cells with a champion PCE of 25.33% are fabricated.








Abstract
Porous lead iodide (PbI2) film is crucial for the complete reaction between PbI2 and ammonium salts in sequential&#8208;deposition technology so as to achieve high crystallinity perovskite film. Herein, it is found that the tensile stress in tin (IV) oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer (ETL) is a key factor influencing the morphology and crystallization of PbI2 films. Focusing on this, lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiOTf) is used as an interfacial modifier in the SnO2/PbI2 interface to decrease the tensile stress to reduce the necessary critical Gibbs free energy for PbI2 nuclei formation. The relaxed tensile stress facilitates the more porous PbI2 generation with larger particles and higher roughness, resulting in superior&#8208;quality perovskite films. Besides, this strategy effectively passivates the inherent electron traps of SnO2 and smooths the interfacial energy levels, boosting the charge extraction and transfer. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.33% (25.10% stabilized for 600 s) is achieved. Furthermore, the device demonstrates exceptional stability, retaining 90% of its initial PCE at its maximum power point tracking measurement (under 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 white light illumination at &#8776;55&#160;&#176;C temperature, in N2 atmosphere) after 600 h.

         <title>A Universal Therapeutic Vaccine Leveraging Autologous Pre&#8208;Existing Immunity to Eliminate in Situ Uniformly Engineered Heterogeneous Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The therapeutic vaccine overcomes immune evasion and resistance in diverse tumor cells by utilizing the highly immunogenic SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RBD antigen, enhancing antigen presentation via SUSD6 shRNA, and silencing the immune checkpoint gene PD&#8208;L1 through shRNA. It further amplifies RBD&#8208;specific pre&#8208;existing immunity with adjuvant&#8208;supported secretion of RBD&#8208;enveloped virus&#8208;like particles, achieving precise and effective eradication of engineered tumor cells.








Abstract
Tumor vaccines that activate the autologous immune system to eliminate tumor cells represent a promising approach in cancer immunotherapy. However, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity, limited antigen selection, insufficient antigen presentation, and the slow onset of de novo immune responses have resulted in poor universality and suboptimal response rates. In contrast, pathogen&#8208;specific pre&#8208;existing immunity acquired through infection or vaccination, can rapidly generate a more potent and enduring immune response upon re&#8208;encounter with the same antigen. Here, an adeno&#8208;associated virus (AAV)&#8208;based therapeutic vaccine capable of genetically modifying diverse tumor cells to uniformly overexpress and efficiently present the highly immunogenic transmembrane SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 receptor binding domain (RBD), and to release RBD&#8208;enveloped virus&#8208;like particles, which awaken and enhance the RBD&#8208;specific pre&#8208;existing immunity, leading to significant tumor remission, is engineered. Mechanistically, this therapeutic vaccine leverages the robust RBD&#8208;specific pre&#8208;existing immunity and heightened antibody&#8208;mediated phagocytosis to eliminate engineered tumor cells while inducing antigen spreading, thereby provoking a more diverse tumor&#8208;specific cellular immune responses. Notably, widespread administration of vaccines against various pathogens has provided a versatile pool of pre&#8208;existing immunity that can be redirected to eradicate tumors. These findings offer a novel perspective on overcoming the limitations posed by tumor heterogeneity and personalized medicine.

         <title>Supercooled Liquids in a Core&#8211;Shell Coordination Structure for Practical Long&#8208;Term Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a unique metal&#8208;organic core&#8211;shell coordination structure, new supercooled liquid materials successfully achieve mutually phase&#8208;stability and controllable phase&#8208;transition in inherent contradictory, for practical long&#8208;term thermal energy storage.








Abstract
Mutual acquisition of phase&#8208;stability and controllable phase&#8208;transition becomes a predominant criterion of phase&#8208;change materials for the practical long&#8208;term energy storage but seems contradictory always. Here a strategy combining coordination and hydrogen bonds hierarchically to create a supercooled liquid in a core&#8211;shell coordination structure is reported, addressing that demand successfully. This new material is composed of a Mn&#8208;methylurea complex (MM) core and the hierarchically bonded erythritols shell. MM glass core with a viscosity of 108 Pa&#183;s determines its thermal phase&#8208;stability. As discovered, the ingenious ligand&#8208;exchange between erythritol and Cl&#8722; ion coordinated with MM core accounts for this effectively reversible phase&#8208;transition. This can be triggered by a small shear&#8208;stress of 10&#160;Pa within tens of seconds, exhibiting good practicability. Thermodynamics and kinetics of phase&#8208;transition are explored.

         <title>Buffer&#8208;Less Gallium Nitride High Electron Mobility Heterostructures on Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a systematic method for the direct growth of GaN on six&#8208;inch silicon substrates without buffers, significantly reducing GaN&#8208;to&#8208;substrate thermal resistance while maintaining structural quality comparable to buffered approaches. As&#8208;grown AlGaN/AlN/GaN heterojunctions on this buffer&#8208;less platform demonstrate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D electron gas mobilities, paving the way for efficient III&#8208;nitride transistors and advancing fundamental research on electron dynamics.








Abstract
Thick metamorphic buffers are considered indispensable for III&#8208;V semiconductor heteroepitaxy on large lattice and thermal&#8208;expansion mismatched silicon substrates. However, III&#8208;nitride buffers in conventional GaN&#8208;on&#8208;Si high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) impose a substantial thermal resistance, deteriorating device efficiency and lifetime by throttling heat extraction. To circumvent this, a systematic methodology for the direct growth of GaN after the AlN nucleation layer on six&#8208;inch silicon substrates is demonstrated using metal&#8208;organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). Crucial growth&#8208;stress modulation to prevent epilayer cracking is achieved even without buffers, and threading dislocation densities comparable to those in buffered structures are realized. The buffer&#8208;less design yields a GaN&#8208;to&#8208;substrate thermal resistance of (11 &#177; 4) m2&#160;K&#160;GW&#8722;1, an order of magnitude reduction over conventional GaN&#8208;on&#8208;Si and one of the lowest on any non&#8208;native substrate. As&#8208;grown AlGaN/AlN/GaN heterojunctions on this template show a high&#8208;quality 2D electron gas (2DEG) whose room&#8208;temperature Hall&#8208;effect mobility exceeds 2000 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, rivaling the best&#8208;reported values. As further validation, the low&#8208;temperature magnetoresistance of this 2DEG shows clear Shubnikov&#8208;de&#8208;Haas oscillations, a quantum lifetime &gt; 0.180 ps, and tell&#8208;tale signatures of spin&#8208;splitting. These results could establish a new platform for III&#8208;nitrides, potentially enhancing the energy efficiency of power transistors and enabling fundamental investigations into electron dynamics in quasi&#8208;2D wide&#8208;bandgap systems.

         <title>In Situ, Treatment with Guanidinium Chloride Ligand Enables Efficient Blue Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with 23.5% External Quantum Efficiency</title>

         <dc:description>
Insufficient hole injection, excessive electron injection, and abundant defects on the surface of QDs are limiting the performance of blue QLEDs. An in situ patching strategy with GACl is proposed to simultaneously passivate surface defects and enhance hole injection, with the EQE increasing from 16.3% to 23.5%. The model is proposed to understand the physical mechanism of hole injection and transport.








Abstract
The poor efficiency and stability of blue Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting diodes (QLED) hinders the practical applications of QLEDs full&#8208;color displays. Excessive electron injection, insufficient hole injection, and abundant defects on the surface of quantum dots (QD) are the main issues limiting the performance of blue devices. Herein, an in situ treatment with bipolar small molecule polydentate ligand&#8211;guanidine chloride (GACl) is proposed to simultaneously suppress excessive electron injection, patch surface defects of QDs and enhance hole injection. GACl&#8208;treated blue QLEDs exhibited a remarkable increase in maximal external quantum Efficiency (EQE) from 16.3% to a record 23.5%, accompanied by maximal luminance (36810&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2), excellent maximal current efficiency (17.5&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1), and enhanced device stability. Combining C&#8211;V and J&#8211;V characteristics, a concise physical model of hole injection is also established: Below 3&#160;V, hole injection is controlled by the interfacial barrier, primarily through tunneling and thermionic injection; Above 3&#160;V, the interfacial barrier is eliminated, and hole injection efficiency is governed by transport within the QD layer. This study showed a clear physical model for understanding the hole injection mechanism in QLEDs, offering valuable design strategies for improving the performance of blue&#8208;QLEDs.

         <title>Fabricating Lattice&#8208;Confined Pt Single Atoms With High Electron&#8208;Deficient State for Alkali Hydrogen Evolution Under Industrial&#8208;Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice&#8208;confined Pt1/Ni(OH)2 SACs with excellent activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are constructed by a co&#8208;reduction strategy. Mechanism studies disclose the Pt 3d orbital strongly hybridizes with O 2p and Ni 3d orbitals in Ni(OH)2, thus largely reducing the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step during HER. Finally, this facile synthesis approach is extended to fabricate other 9 lattice&#8208;confined SACs.








Abstract
The confining effect is essential to regulate the activity and stability of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), but the universal fabrication of confined SACs is still a great challenge. Here, various lattice&#8208;confined Pt SACs supported by different carriers are constructed by a universal co&#8208;reduction approach. Notably, Pt single atoms confined in the lattice of Ni(OH)2 (Pt1/Ni(OH)2) with a high electron&#8208;deficient state exhibit excellent activity for basic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Specifically, Pt1/Ni(OH)2 just requires 15&#160;mV to get 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and the mass activity of Pt1/Ni(OH)2 is 15 times of commercial Pt/C. Moreover, Pt1/Ni(OH)2 assembled in an alkaline water electrolyzer shows 1030&#160;h durability under the industrial current density of 800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy techniques reveal Pt&#9472;H and &#8220;free&#8221; OH radical can be directly observed for Pt1/Ni(OH)2, confirming the lattice&#8208;confined Pt single atoms play a key role during HER. Further density functional theory uncovers the Pt 3d orbital strongly hybridizes with O 2p and Ni 3d orbitals in Ni(OH)2, which quickly optimizes the electronic state of the Pt site, thus largely reducing the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step to 0.16&#160;eV for HER. Finally, this synthesis method is extended to construct other 9 lattice&#8208;confined SACs.

         <title>Crystallographic Spin Torque Conductivity Tensor of Epitaxial IrO2 Thin Films for Oxide Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, all the independent elements of the spin torque conductivity tensor allowed by bulk crystal symmetries are determined for the tetragonal conductor IrO2 epitaxial thin films, via measurements of conventional anti&#8208;damping torques in the high&#8208;symmetry (001) and (100) orientations. Rotational transformations of this tensor can predict both the conventional and unconventional torques for IrO2 in the lower&#8208;symmetry orientations, with good agreement.








Abstract
Unconventional spin&#8208;orbit torques arising from electric&#8208;field&#8208;generated spin currents in anisotropic materials have promising potential for spintronic applications, including for perpendicular magnetic switching in high&#8208;density memory applications. Here, all the independent elements of the spin torque conductivity tensor allowed by bulk crystal symmetries for the tetragonal conductor IrO2 are determined via measurements of conventional (in&#8208;plane) anti&#8208;damping torques for IrO2 thin films in the high&#8208;symmetry (001) and (100) orientations. It is then tested whether rotational transformations of this same tensor can predict both the conventional and unconventional anti&#8208;damping torques for IrO2 thin films in the lower&#8208;symmetry (101), (110), and (111) orientations, finding good agreement. The results confirm that spin&#8208;orbit torques from all these orientations are consistent with the bulk symmetries of IrO2, and show how simple measurements of conventional torques from high&#8208;symmetry orientations of anisotropic thin films can provide an accurate prediction of the unconventional torques from lower&#8208;symmetry orientations.

         <title>Bioinspired Heterogeneous Surface for Radiative Cooling Enhanced Power&#8208;Free Moisture Harvesting in Unsaturated Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the Namib Pachydactylus Rangei, a Power&#8208;Free Cooling moisture harvester with Luneburg Lens Array is fabricated using Self&#8208;Developed &#956;&#8208;ECM process. The synergy between the surface and interface functions endows the PFCMH with Exceptional Passive sub&#8208;Dewpoint Cooling and Efficient Harvesting Performance. Installing every 1 m2 of PFCMH can Yield &#8776;294.5&#8211;490.6&#160;kg per year of water and Save &#8776;198.7&#8211;331.0&#160;kWh per year of electricity.








Abstract
The development of zero&#8208;power moisture&#8208;harvesting technology in an unsaturated atmosphere is of great significance for coping with global freshwater scarcity. Here, inspired by Pachydactylus rangei's&#160;(Namib sand gecko) ability to evade thermal radiation and harvest moisture, a power&#8208;free cooling moisture harvester (PFCMH) is fabricated using the continuous, industrialized micro&#8208;extrusion compression molding. A Luneburg lens is introduced in the PFCMH for the first time, endowing it with a high reflectivity of &#8776;92.9% in 0.3 to the 2.5&#160;&#181;m waveband and emissivity of &#8776;98.1% in 8&#8211;13&#160;&#181;m waveband, which are &#8776;19.2% and &#8776;15.4% higher than those of the unstructured radiative cooler, respectively. Consequently, a temperature reduction of &#8776;6.9 &#176;C is achieved. In addition, the wettability of PFCMH is well regulated, at a contact angle of &#8776;153&#176; and a rolling angle of &#8776;42&#176;, enabling its surface to efficiently nucleate and transport water droplets. The synergy between the surface and interface functions endows the PFCMH with exceptional passive sub&#8208;dewpoint cooling and efficient harvesting performance. Importantly, every 1 m2 of PFCMH can yield &#8776;294.5&#8211;490.6&#160;kg year&#8722;1 of water and save &#8776;198.7&#8211;331.0&#160;kWh year&#8722;1 of electricity. The PFCMH offers an environmentally, power&#8208;free, and promising solution to freshwater scarcity.

         <title>Directional Freeze&#8208;Casting Cryogel Loaded with Quaternized Chitosan Modified Gallium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Capture and Eradicate the Resistant Bacteria for Guided Regeneration in Infected Bone Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antimicrobial resistance and impaired bone regeneration are the great challenges in treating infected bone defects. This work reported a quaternized chitosan (QCS) coated gallium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (GaMOF), to capture the Methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a &#8220;captor&#8221; and rejuvenate Methicillin (Me). Then, a radially oriented porous cryogel (Me/QCSGa&#8208;MOF@Cryogel) is fabricated for combating resistant bacteria and guiding bone regeneration in infected bone defects.








Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance and impaired bone regeneration are the great challenges in treating infected bone defects. Its recurrent and resistant nature, high incidence rate, long&#8208;term hospitalization, and high medical costs have driven the efforts of the scientific community to develop new therapies to improve the situation. Considering the complex microenvironment and persistent mechanisms mediated by resistant bacteria, it is crucial to develop an implant with enhanced osseointegration and sustained and effective infection clearance effects. Here, a positively charged quaternized chitosan (QCS) coated gallium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (GaMOF) is designed, to capture the antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria (Methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA) as a &#8220;captor&#8221;, and rejuvenate Methicillin (Me) via disturbing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Then, a radially oriented porous cryogel loaded with the Me and QCSGaMOF is fabricated by the directional freeze&#8208;casting method. The oriented porous structure has an enhanced osseointegration effect by guiding the ingrowth of osteogenic cells. In vitro and in vivo experiments prove the advantages of as&#8208;prepared Me/QCSGa&#8208;MOF@Cryogel in combating resistant bacteria and guiding bone regeneration in infected bone defects.

         <title>The First Molecular Ferroelectric Mott Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article presents the design and characterization of first molecular ferroelectric Mott insulator, (C7H14N)3V12O30. Accompanied by the ferroelectric phase transition, (C7H14N)3V12O30 shows a sharp change in conductivity, implying the metal&#8211;insulator transition&#8208;like behavior. This finding opened up new possibilities for the development of strongly correlated electron systems.








Abstract
With the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance materials and high&#8208;temperature superconductors, Mott insulators can potentially undergo a transition from insulating state to metallic state. Here, in molecular ferroelectrics system, a Mott insulator of (C7H14N)3V12O30 has been first synthesized, which is a 2D organic&#8211;inorganic ferroelectric with composition of layered vanadium oxide and quinuclidine ring. Interestingly, accompanied by the ferroelectric phase transition, (C7H14N)3V12O30 changes sharply in conductivity. The occurrence of a Mott transition has been proven by electric transport measurements and theoretical calculations. This research has significantly expanded the applicative horizons of ferroelectric materials, and offering an ideal platform for the investigation of strongly correlated electron systems.

         <title>The Photoinduced Response of Antimony from Femtoseconds to Minutes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optical properties of antimony make it a promising candidate for photonic memory applications due to the large contrast between crystalline and amorphous solid states. This study resolves the entire switching cycle from crystal to glass and back. It elucidates the structural origin of the optical properties of the final and intermediate transient states, which are relevant for high bandwidth photonic applications.








Abstract
As a phase change material (PCM), antimony exhibits a set of desirable properties that make it an interesting candidate for photonic memory applications. These include a large optical contrast between crystalline and amorphous solid states over a wide wavelength range. Switching between the states is possible on nanosecond timescales by applying short heating pulses. The glass state is reached through melting and rapid quenching through a supercooled liquid regime. While initial and final states are easily characterized, little is known about the optical properties on the path to forming a glass. Here we resolve the entire switching cycle of antimony with femtosecond resolution in stroboscopic optical pump&#8208;probe measurements and combine the experimental results with ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations. The glass formation process of antimony is revealed to be a complex multi&#8208;step process, where the intermediate transient states exhibit distinct optical properties with even larger contrasts than those observed between crystal and glass. The provided quantitative understanding forms the basis for exploitation in high bandwidth photonic&#160;applications.

         <title>Synergistic Adhesion and Shape Deformation in Nanowire&#8208;Structured Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomer films with dense nanowire arrays exhibit synergistic adhesion and shape&#8208;changing properties. They curl toward the nanowire side under heat or chemical vapors but away from it with liquid droplets. Chemical modifications make them superoleophobic underwater, enabling precise droplet manipulation. This biomimetic design integrates enhanced adhesion with stimuli&#8208;responsive deformation, with promising applications in soft robotics and adaptive surfaces.








Abstract
Nature provides many examples of the benefits of nanoscopic surface structures in areas of adhesion and antifouling. Herein, the design, fabrication, and characterization of liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) films are presented with nanowire surface structures that exhibit tunable stimuli&#8208;responsive deformations and enhanced adhesion properties. The LCE films are shown to curl toward the side with the nanowires when stimulated by heat or organic solvent vapors. In contrast, when a droplet of the same solvent is placed on the film, it curls away from the nanowire side due to nanowire&#8208;induced capillary forces that cause unequal swelling. This characteristic curling deformation is shown to be reversible and can be optimized to match curved substrates, maximizing adhesive shear forces. By using chemical modification, the LCE nanowire films can be given underwater superoleophobicity, enabling oil repellency under a range of harsh conditions. This is combined with the nanowire&#8208;induced frictional asymmetry and the reversible shape deformation to create an underwater droplet mixing robot, capable of performing chemical reactions in aqueous environments. These findings demonstrate the potential of nanowire&#8208;augmented LCE films for advanced applications in soft robotics, adaptive adhesion, and easy chemical modification, with implications for designing responsive materials that integrate mechanical flexibility with surface functionality.

         <title>Creating Single Atomic Coordination for Hypoxia&#8208;Resistant Pyroptosis Nano&#8208;Inducer to Boost Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniform carbon nanodots (HNCDs) that inherit the single atomic Fe&#8211;N4 center of hemin while creating sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon surroundings were created by a simple solvothermal treatment of hemin. HNCDs synergistically modulated the energy level and electron transfer for converting the type II photodynamic process to type I, thus can significantly induce tumor pyroptosis and evoke strong antitumor immune response even under hypoxic environment.









Abstract
General synthesis and mechanical understanding of type I nano&#8208;photosensitizers are of great importance for hypoxia&#8208;resistant pyroptosis inducers. Herein, a simple solvothermal treatment is developed to convert non&#8208;photosensitive small molecules (hemin) into uniform carbon nanodots (HNCDs) with strong type I photodynamic activity and red fluorescence emission. These HNCDs inherit the single atomic Fe&#8211;N4 center of hemin while creating sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon surroundings, which synergistically modulated the energy level and electron transfer for converting the type II photodynamic process to type I. After encapsulating HNCDs with bovine serum albumin (BSA)&#160;to facilitate in vivo applications, the resulting BSA nanoparticles (HB) can image tumors and significantly induce the pyroptosis of tumor cells even under an extremely hypoxic environment (2% O2). This evokes a strong antitumor immune response, effectively restraining tumor growth and lung metastasis in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer mice, with good biocompatibility. This work introduces an applicable pyroptosis nano&#8208;inducer to combat hypoxic tumors and highlights the regulation of Fe&#8211;N4 centers to develop hypoxia&#8208;resistant type I nano&#8208;photosensitizers for cancer treatment.

         <title>Electric Field&#8208;Induced Nonreciprocal Directional Dichroism in a Time&#8208;Reversal&#8208;Odd Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electric field&#8208;induced nonreciprocal directional dichroism (E&#8208;induced NDD) ascribed to the diagonal electrotoroidic effect is discovered in a time&#8208;reversal&#8208;odd antiferromagnet Co&#8322;SiO&#8324; possessing a time&#8208;reversal&#8208;odd scalar quantity, magnetic toroidal monopole. Spatial distribution measurements of E&#8208;induced NDD reveal domain structures. Magnetic field&#8208;induced domain inversion mediated by the piezomagnetic effect highlights the rich physics of time&#8208;reversal&#8208;odd antiferromagnets.








Abstract
Antiferromagnets with broken time&#8208;reversal (T$\mathcal{T}$) symmetry (T$\mathcal{T}$&#8208;odd antiferromagnets) have gained extensive attention, mainly due to their ferromagnet&#8208;like behavior despite the absence of net magnetization. However, certain types of T$\mathcal{T}$&#8208;odd antiferromagnets remain inaccessible by the typical ferromagnet&#8208;like phenomena (e.g., anomalous Hall effect). One such system is characterized by a T$\mathcal{T}$&#8208;odd scalar quantity, the magnetic toroidal monopole. To access the broken T$\mathcal{T}$ symmetry in such a system, a unique nonreciprocal optical phenomenon, electric field&#8208;induced nonreciprocal directional dichroism (E&#8208;induced NDD), is employed. Signals of E&#8208;induced NDD are successfully detected in a T$\mathcal{T}$&#8208;odd antiferromagnet, Co&#8322;SiO&#8324;, whose magnetic structure is characterized by the magnetic toroidal monopole. Furthermore, by spatially resolving the E&#8208;induced NDD, spatial distributions of a pair of domain states related to one another by the T$\mathcal{T}$ operation are visualized. The domain imaging revealed the inversion of the domain pattern by applying a magnetic field, which is explained by trilinear coupling attributed to the piezomagnetic effect. The observation of E&#8208;induced NDD highlights unique functionalities of T$\mathcal{T}$&#8208;odd antiferromagnets.

         <title>High&#8208;Modulus Homochiral Torsional Oxide Ceramic Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;modulus homochiral Al2O3 yarn artificial muscles with a different actuation mechanism containing volume expansion and topological structure transformation are fabricated. Under an electric drive, the torsional muscle provides a high actuation stress of 483.5 MPa, a large energy density of 9.8 J&#160;g&#8722;1, and a high output power of 10.3 W&#160;g&#8722;1, while maintaining a large stroke of 13.5%.








Abstract
Fiber&#8208;based artificial muscles are soft actuators used to mimic the movement of human muscles. However, using high modulus oxide ceramics to fabricate artificial muscles with high energy and power is a challenge as they are prone to brittle fracture during torsion. Here, a ceramic metallization strategy is reported that solves the problem of low torsion and low ductility of alumina (Al2O3) ceramics by chemical plating a thin copper layer on alumina filaments. These filaments with a high modulus of &#8776;180&#160;GPa can be twisted into chiral coiled artificial muscles, exhibiting a unique electric thermal actuation mechanism. This tough and robust alumina artificial muscle can carry objects equivalent to 0.28 million times its weight and provide high actuation stress of up to 483.5&#160;MPa. In addition, it exhibits 18 times higher contraction power and 240 times higher energy density than human muscles, as well as a high energy conversion efficiency of up to 7.59%, which far exceeds most reported actuated carbon and polymer artificial muscles. This work has achieved large&#8208;scale manufacturing of high&#8208;modulus oxide ceramic muscles for the first time.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustained Biophotocatalytic Nano&#8208;Organelle Reactors with Programmable DNA Switches for Combating Tumor Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the challenges of limited light penetration and insufficient oxygen supply in PDT for metastatic tumor treatment, a self&#8208;contained organelle&#8208;mimicking nanoreactor is engineered with DNA switches using cell&#8208;inspired compartmentalization technology. It utilizes endogenous glucose as a biofuel, luminol as a light source, and hemoglobin as an oxygen supplier to achieve self&#8208;illuminating chemiexcited PDT via chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer.








Abstract
Metastasis, the leading cause of mortality in cancer patients, presents challenges for conventional photodynamic therapy (PDT) due to its reliance on localized light and oxygen application to tumors. To overcome these limitations, a self&#8208;sustained organelle&#8208;mimicking nanoreactor is developed here with programmable DNA switches that enables bio&#8208;chem&#8208;photocatalytic cascade&#8208;driven starvation&#8208;photodynamic synergistic therapy against tumor metastasis.

&lt;p&gt;To overcome the challenges of limited light penetration and insufficient oxygen supply in PDT for metastatic tumor treatment, a self-contained organelle-mimicking nanoreactor is engineered with DNA switches using cell-inspired compartmentalization technology. It utilizes endogenous glucose as a biofuel, luminol as a light source, and hemoglobin as an oxygen supplier to achieve self-illuminating chemiexcited PDT via chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metastasis, the leading cause of mortality in cancer patients, presents challenges for conventional photodynamic therapy (PDT) due to its reliance on localized light and oxygen application to tumors. To overcome these limitations, a self-sustained organelle-mimicking nanoreactor is developed here with programmable DNA switches that enables bio-chem-photocatalytic cascade-driven starvation-photodynamic synergistic therapy against tumor metastasis. Emulating the compartmentalization and positional assembly strategies found in living cells, this nano-organelle reactor allows quantitative co-compartmentalization of multiple functional modules for the designed self-illuminating chemiexcited PDT system. Within the space-confined nanoreactor, biofuel glucose is converted to hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) which enhances luminol-based chemiluminescence (CL), consequently driving the generation of photochemical singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) via chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer. Meanwhile, hemoglobin functions as a synchronized oxygen supplier for both glucose oxidation and PDT, while also exhibiting peroxidase-like activity to produce hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH). Crucially, the nanoreactor keeps switching off in normal tissues, with on-demand activation in tumors through toehold-mediated strand displacement. These findings demonstrate that this nanoreactor, which is self-sufficient in light and oxygen and precise in striking tumors, presents a promising paradigm for managing highly metastatic cancers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flat&#8208;Band Electronic Bipolarity in a Janus and Kagome van der Waals Semiconductor Nb3TeI7</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Janus and Kagome van der Waals material Nb3TeI7 exhibits strong electronic bipolar states and robust semiconducting properties with the face&#8208;dependent n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type field&#8208;effect transistor behaviors. Strong built&#8208;in out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization is attributed to ferroelectric&#8208;like stacking, amplified by strong electron correlation in the Nb flat bands at the breathing&#8208;Kagome lattice, endowing Nb3TeI7 with a promising material platform for Janus&#8208;material&#8208;based applications.








Abstract
Janus materials, a novel class of materials with two faces of different chemical compositions and electronic polarities, offer significant potential for various applications with catalytic reactions, chemical sensing, and optical or electronic responses. A key aspect for such functionalities is face&#8208;dependent electronic bipolarity, which is usually limited by the chemical distinction of terminated surfaces and has not been exploited in the semiconducting regime. Here, it is showed that a Janus and Kagome van der Waals (vdW) material Nb3TeI7 has ferroelectric&#8208;like coherent stacking of the Janus layers and hosts strong electronic bipolar states in the semiconducting regime. A large potential difference of &#8764; 0.7&#160;eV between the I4 and TeI3 terminated surfaces is observed, despite only one fourth of the I atoms being replaced by Te atoms on one side of the layers. Additionally, robust semiconducting properties with the face&#8208;dependent n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type field&#8208;effect transistor behaviors are demonstrated. These unique properties are attributed to Nb 4d orbital flat bands of the breathing&#8208;Kagome lattice, of which significantly large electron mass makes the semiconducting properties immune to impurity doping, and inherent strong electron correlation enhances asymmetric electron distribution, thereby amplifying a built&#8208;in electric field. These findings highlight that naturally&#8208;grown Janus and Kagome vdW semiconductors provide a promising material platform for utilizing strong electronic bipolarity in 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based&#160;applications.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Orbit&#8208;Locking Vectorial Metasurface Holography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a general multi&#8208;channel vectorial holography technique encoded by both the spin and orbital angular momentum using a minimalist, non&#8208;interleaved, geometry&#8208;phase metasurface. The approach not only substantially enhances the selectivity of the input light, exhibiting spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;locking behavior, but also expands the multiplexing capacity of the output optical field, opening new avenues for advanced light manipulation.








Abstract
Vectorial metasurface holography, allowing for independent control over the amplitude, phase, and polarization distribution of holographic images enabled by metasurfaces, plays a crucial role in the realm of optical display, optical, and quantum communications. However, previous research on vectorial metasurface holography has typically been restricted to single degree of freedom input and single channel output, thereby demonstrating a very limited modulation capacity. This work presents a novel method to achieve multi&#8208;channel vectorial metasurface holography by harnessing spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;locking vortex beams. In each channel, the optical vectorial field is encoded with a pair of total angular momentums (TAMs) featuring two orthogonal spin angular momentums (SAMs) independently locked with arbitrary orbital angular momentums (OAMs). The methodology relies on a modified Gerchberg&#8208;Saxton algorithm, enabling the encoding of various TAM channels within a single phase profile. Consequently, a pure geometry&#8208;phase metasurface with a non&#8208;interleaved approach can be used to support such multi&#8208;channel vectorial holography, achieving high selectivity of both SAM and OAM, and offering precise routing and manipulation of complex light channels. The work presents a paradigm shift in the field of holography, offering promising avenues for high&#8208;density optical information processing and future photonic device design.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Surface Ligands Enables Versatile Optical Patterning and Form Factor Flexibility in Quantum Dot Assemblies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Partially ligand&#8208;exchanged InP QDs with lipoic acid can undergo direct optical patterning when exposed to UV light, which induces disulfide ring opening, leading to polymerization and the assembly of the QDs. This approach also allows for the creation of stretchable QD films that can be recycled through reversible polymerization. This study provides a solution for future advanced displays and optoelectronics.








Abstract
The evolution of display technologies is rapidly transitioning from traditional screens to advanced augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR) and wearable devices, where quantum dots (QDs) serve as crucial pure&#8208;color emitters. While solution processing efficiently forms QD solids, challenges emerge in subsequent stages, such as layer deposition, etching, and solvent immersion. These issues become especially pronounced when developing diverse form factors, necessitating innovative patterning methods that are both reversible and sustainable. Herein, a novel approach utilizing lipoic acid (LA) as a ligand is presented, featuring a carboxylic acid group for QD surface attachment and a reversible disulfide ring structure. Upon i&#8208;line UV exposure, the LA ligand initiates ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP), crosslinking the QDs and enhances their solvent resistance. This method enables precise full&#8208;color QD patterns with feature sizes as small as 3&#160;&#181;m and pixel densities exceeding 3788 ppi. Additionally, it supports the fabrication of stretchable QD composites using LA&#8208;derived monomers. The reversible ROP process allows for flexibility, self&#8208;healing, and QD recovery, promoting sustainability and expanding QD applications for ultra&#8208;fine patterning and on&#8208;silicon displays.

         <title>Mesoporous Boron&#8208;Doped Carbon with Curved B4C Active Sites for Highly Efficient H2O2 Electrosynthesis in Neutral Media and Air&#8208;Supplied Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous B&#8208;doped carbon (meso&#8208;BPC) with highly efficient curved B4C active sites for 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction&#160;catalyst under a neutral electrolyte is reported. Combining experiments with dentity functional theory&#160;calculations, it is revealed that the mesoporous structure and B4C active site on the curved carbon surface significantly improve the oxygen supply and catalytic activity at high current densities and air&#8208;supplied environments.









Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis via the 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is considered as a cost&#8208;effective and safe alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process. However, in more practical environments, namely, the use of neutral media and air&#8208;fed cathode environments, slow ORR kinetics and insufficient oxygen supply pose significant challenges to efficient H2O2 production at high current densities. In this work, mesoporous B&#8208;doped carbons with novel curved B4C active sites, synthesized via a carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction using a pore&#8208;former agent, to simultaneously achieve excellent 2e&#8722; ORR activity and improved mass transfer properties are introduced. Through a combination of experimental analysis and theoretical calculations, it is confirmed that the curved B4C configuration, formed by mesopores in the carbon, demonstrates superior selectivity and activity for 2e&#8722; ORR due to its weaker interaction with *OOH intermediates compared to planar B4C in neutral media. Moreover, the mesopores facilitate oxygen supply and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 86.2% at 150&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under air&#8208;supplied conditions, along with an impressive O2 utilization efficiency of 93.6%. This approach will provide a route to catalyst design for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis in a practical environment.

     alt="Mesoporous Boron-Doped Carbon with Curved B4C Active Sites for Highly Efficient H2O2 Electrosynthesis in Neutral Media and Air-Supplied Environments"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mesoporous B-doped carbon (meso-BPC) with highly efficient curved B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C active sites for 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction reaction&#160;catalyst under a neutral electrolyte is reported. Combining experiments with dentity functional theory&#160;calculations, it is revealed that the mesoporous structure and B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C active site on the curved carbon surface significantly improve the oxygen supply and catalytic activity at high current densities and air-supplied environments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) electrosynthesis via the 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is considered as a cost-effective and safe alternative to the energy-intensive anthraquinone process. However, in more practical environments, namely, the use of neutral media and air-fed cathode environments, slow ORR kinetics and insufficient oxygen supply pose significant challenges to efficient H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production at high current densities. In this work, mesoporous B-doped carbons with novel curved B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C active sites, synthesized via a carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) reduction using a pore-former agent, to simultaneously achieve excellent 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR activity and improved mass transfer properties are introduced. Through a combination of experimental analysis and theoretical calculations, it is confirmed that the curved B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C configuration, formed by mesopores in the carbon, demonstrates superior selectivity and activity for 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR due to its weaker interaction with *OOH intermediates compared to planar B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C in neutral media. Moreover, the mesopores facilitate oxygen supply and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 86.2% at 150&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under air-supplied conditions, along with an impressive O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization efficiency of 93.6%. This approach will provide a route to catalyst design for efficient H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis in a practical environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>1.6&#8208;Inch Transparent Micro&#8208;Display with Pixel Circuit Integrated microLED Chip Array by Misalignment&#8208;Free Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, this work demonstrates a radical technology that will transforms the current display industry beyond the backplane limits. The pixel circuit integrated micro&#8208;LED (PIMLED) does not need an active&#8208;matrix backplane but has an active&#8208;pixel circuit into it. The proposed PIMLED is compatible with intrinsic randomness of fluidic&#8208;based transfer technology and free from angular misalignment during vertical integration.








Abstract
Recent advances in mass transfer technology are expected to bring next&#8208;generation micro light&#8208;emitting diodes (&#181;LED) displays into reality, although reliable integration of the active&#8208;matrix backplane with the transferred &#181;LEDs remains as a challenge. Here, the &#181;LED display technology is innovated by demonstrating pixel circuit&#8208;integrated micro&#8208;LEDs (PIMLEDs) and integrating them onto a transparent glass substrate. The PIMLED comprises of low&#8208;temperature poly&#8208;silicon transistors and GaN &#181;LED. The square&#8208;shaped PIMLED is designed to secure a larger process margin but to reduce misalignment in the subsequent bonding process. Its unique four&#8208;fold rotational symmetric design together with concentric circular pixel electrodes of the substrate makes their massive transfer compatible with intrinsic randomness of fluidic&#8208;based transfer and free from angular misalignment during wafer bonding. The vertically integrated pixels show similar optical and electrical properties regardless of four possible arrangements. It is demonstrated that a 96 &#215; 96 PIMLED display on a transparent glass substrate, which is expected to open a door to novel form&#8208;factor free and transparent &#181;LED displays.

         <title>Minute&#8208;Level Room&#8208;Temperature Switching and Long Cycle Stability of Thermochromic Inorganic Perovskite Smart Windows</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible switching between colored and bleached phases of three colors of inorganic perovskite smart windows is induced using dimethyl sulfoxide vapor at room temperature. Compared with normal houses in field tests, the model houses with three colors of smart windows reached a maximum indoor temperature drop of 2.6, 3.6, and 4.2&#160;&#176;C at noon, respectively, showing excellent energy&#8208;saving potential.








Abstract
Perovskite smart windows (PSWs) are widely investigated owing to excellent thermochromic properties, while restricted by poor transition performance and cycle stability. Herein, dimethyl sulfoxide vapor is utilized as an induction reagent for rapid reversible switching at room temperature between the colored and bleached phases. To obtain PSWs with different optical properties and transition performance, red CsPbIBr2, yellow Rb0.5Cs0.5PbIBr2 and brown CsSn0.1Pb0.9IBr2 are prepared through alloying. The perovskites can exhibit reversible switching at 27.4&#8211;34.3&#160;&#176;C within 1.9&#8211;5.1&#160;min. Even after 100 cycles, they exhibit remarkable stability of luminous transmittance (retention &#8805;97.4%) and transition time (retention &#8805;97.6%). Experimental characterization proves that the reversible switching occurs between colored three&#8208;dimension perovskite phase and bleached zero&#8208;dimension perovskite phase. In the field test (air temperature&#160;=&#160;21.6&#8211;26.5&#160;&#176;C), model houses with PSWs exhibit a maximum indoor temperature drop of 4.2&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, they exhibit considerable temperature modulation ability up to 7.9&#160;&#176;C under a solar simulator (temperature of the control model house&#160;=&#160;60&#160;&#176;C). The decrease in the luminous transmittance of the PSWs after 20 days is 2.9%, indicating excellent long&#8208;term stability. This study offers PSWs with prominent transition performance and long cycle stability.

         <title>Distinct Transmission of Left&#8208; and Right&#8208;Handed Magnon Modes in Compensated Ferrimagnet/Antiferromagnet Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed magnons, thermally generated in a compensated ferrimagnet Gd3Fe5O12, propagate efficiently through the antiferromagnetic NiO layer. Within NiO, these magnons undergo distinct decay processes, unveiling a chiral selection rule for magnon transmission induced by interfacial spin&#8208;flop coupling. These findings provide new insights for advancing chirality&#8208;based magnonics.








Abstract
The chirality of magnons, exhibiting left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed polarizations analogous to the counterparts of spin&#8208;up and spin&#8208;down, has emerged as a promising paradigm for information processing. However, the potential of this paradigm is constrained by the controllable excitation and transmission of chiral magnons. Here, the magnon transmission is explored in the Gd3Fe5O12/NiO/Pt structures. It is demonstrated that both left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed magnon modes, thermally generated in the compensated ferrimagnet Gd3Fe5O12, can efficiently propagate through the antiferromagnetic NiO layer. Remarkably, these modes undergo distinct decay processes in NiO, manifested by different evolutions of the spin diffusion length with temperature. This behavior can be explained by an exchange model rooted in the spin&#8208;flop magnetic configuration between Gd3Fe5O12 and NiO, which establishes a chiral selection rule for magnon transmission. These findings offer significant fundamental insight into controlling chiral magnons, opening avenues for chirality&#8208;based magnonics.

         <title>Bifunctional Group Modulation Strategy Enables MR&#8208;TADF Electroluminescence Toward BT.2020 Green Light Standard</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;bifunctional group modulation strategy&#8221; enables precise emission wavelength control while maintaining exceptionally narrow FWHM values. Non&#8208;sensitized pure green OLEDs based on DBNDS&#8208;TPh exhibited peak EQE of 34.5% and 36.0%, with CIE coordinates of (0.17, 0.76) and (0.19, 0.75) at the doping concentration of 1 and 3 wt.%. This is the first instance of a green OLED in a bottom&#8208;emitting device structure achieving a CIEy value of 0.76.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;bifunctional group modulation strategy&#8221; enables precise emission wavelength control while maintaining exceptionally narrow FWHM values. Non-sensitized pure green OLEDs based on DBNDS-TPh exhibited peak EQE of 34.5% and 36.0%, with CIE coordinates of (0.17, 0.76) and (0.19, 0.75) at the doping concentration of 1 and 3 wt.%. This is the first instance of a green OLED in a bottom-emitting device structure achieving a CIE&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; value of 0.76.

The crystallization mechanism of the biomimetic calcification method triggers a secondary conformational transition of proteins from &#945;&#8208;helix to &#946;&#8208;sheet in solvents. The adoption of the &#946;&#8208;sheet conformation enhances the affinity for metal ions, thereby intensifying the competitive interaction with organic ligands and expediting crystal formation and encapsulation.








Abstract
Biomimetic calcification is a micro&#8208;crystallization process that mimics the natural biomineralization process, where biomacromolecules regulate the formation of inorganic minerals. In this study, it is presented that a protein&#8208;assisted biomimetic calcification method for the in situ synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) materials. A series of unique core&#8208;shell structures are created by utilizing proteins as templates and guiding agents in the nucleation step, creating ideal conditions for shell growth. To further understand the influence of the protein and organic ligand on the morphology of the MOF shell, the competing mechanism toward metal ions is supposed. Through systematic experiments and analyses, a strategy to construct unique precursor structures by controlling calcification nucleation is proposed. After carbonization, protein&#8208;containing precursors exhibit exceptional porous characteristics, stability, and high nitrogen content. These attributes make them promising materials as sulfur hosts in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSB). Electrochemical tests confirm that biomimetic calcification&#8208;assisted 3D carbonaceous structure can effectively immobilize dissolved polysulfides, demonstrating strong adsorption and catalytic capabilities. This discovery not only opens up new avenues for employing biomimetic calcification as a sustainable method for batteries but also enlightens the fields of materials science, catalytic chemistry, and energy storage.

         <title>Multiple Electron Transfers Enable High&#8208;Capacity Cathode Through Stable Anionic Redox</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
K2FeSiO4 is synthesized and utilized as a cathode material for potassium&#8208;ion batteries. This compound offers advantages including high elemental abundance, low cost, and structural stability. Ultrahigh capacity can be achieved through charge compensation involving Fe cations and O anions during cycling. Additionally, the strong Si&#9472;O bond can effectively immobilize O anions to prevent excessive lattice oxygen loss.








Abstract
Single&#8208;electron transfer, low alkali metal contents, and large&#8208;molecular masses limit the capacity of cathodes. This study uses a cost&#8208;effective and light&#8208;molecular&#8208;mass orthosilicate material, K2FeSiO4, with a high initial potassium content, as a cathode for potassium&#8208;ion batteries to enable the transfer of more than one electron. Despite the limited valence change of Fe ions during cycling, K2FeSiO4 can undergo multiple electron transfers via successive oxygen anionic redox reactions to generate a high reversible capacity. Although the formation of O&#8210;O dimers in K2FeSiO4 occur upon removing large amounts of potassium, the strong binding effect of Si on O mitigates irreversible oxygen release and voltage degradation during cycling. K2FeSiO4 achieves 236 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1, with an energy density of 520&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, which can be comparable with commercial LiFePO4 materials. Moreover, it also exhibits 1400 stable cycles under high&#8208;current conditions. These findings enhance the potential commercialization prospects for potassium&#8208;ion batteries.

Using food&#8208;safe sargassum nanocellulose as the binder framework, combined with food&#8208;grade additives, a highly biocompatible fully ingestible supercapacitor is successfully employed. This design introduces high mechanical strength and fast ion transport behavior of the nanofiber, achieving a disposable power supply and electrical stimulation antibacterial in vivo, which provides a promising alternative power source for novel medical electronic devices.








Abstract
Small high&#8208;performance energy modules have significant practical value in the biomedical field, such as painless diagnosis, alleviation of gastrointestinal discomfort, and electrical stimulation therapy. However, due to performance limitations and safety concerns, it is a formidable challenge to design a small, emerging ingestible power supply. Here, a fully ingestible supercapacitor (FISC) constructed of sargassum cellulose nanofiber is presented. FISCs exhibit an electrode areal capacitance of 2.29 F cm&#8722;2 and a high energy density of 307 &#181;Wh cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, over 90% of the antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli is achieved during the self&#8208;discharge process. Therefore, following insertion into an enteric capsule, this device can enable a disposable power supply and electrostimulation for bacteriostasis in the intestine after being swallowed by a human, which offers new possibilities for scientific and simple therapy.

         <title>Efficient and Scalable Direct Regeneration of Spent Layered Cathode Materials via Advanced Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel advanced oxidation strategy leverages the inherent catalytic activity of spent layered cathode materials, facilitating the decomposition of H2O2 to generate &#8226;OH and &#8226;O2&#8722; free radicals, which promote oxidation reactions with the surface of the spent cathode. It effectively elevates the Ni valence state, modifies the surface microstructure, and eliminates fluorine&#8208;containing interface impurities, thereby promoting the solid&#8208;state regeneration process.








Abstract
Among direct recycling methods for spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries, solid&#8208;state regeneration is the route with minimal bottlenecks for industrial application and is highly compatible with the current industrial cathode materials production processes. However, surface structure degradation and interfacial impurities of spent cathodes significantly hinder Li+ replenishment during restoration. Herein, we propose a unique advanced oxidation strategy that leverages the inherent catalytic activity of spent layered cathode materials to address these challenges. This strategy decomposes H2O2 to generate &#8226;OH and &#8226;O2&#8722; free radicals, facilitating oxidation reactions with the surface of the spent cathode. As a result, this approach effectively elevates the Ni valence state, modifies the surface microstructure, and eliminates fluorine&#8208;containing interface impurities, thereby promoting the solid&#8208;state regeneration process. The regenerated LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cathodes demonstrate a specific capacity of 206&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C, comparable to commercially available cathodes. Meanwhile, this advanced oxidation strategy proves adaptable and scalable for treating industrial dismantled LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 black mass. A 3.1&#160;Ah pouch cell assembled with the regenerated LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 exhibits impressive capacity retention of 74% after 500 cycles.

&lt;p&gt;A novel advanced oxidation strategy leverages the inherent catalytic activity of spent layered cathode materials, facilitating the decomposition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to generate &#8226;OH and &#8226;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; free radicals, which promote oxidation reactions with the surface of the spent cathode. It effectively elevates the Ni valence state, modifies the surface microstructure, and eliminates fluorine-containing interface impurities, thereby promoting the solid-state regeneration process.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among direct recycling methods for spent lithium-ion batteries, solid-state regeneration is the route with minimal bottlenecks for industrial application and is highly compatible with the current industrial cathode materials production processes. However, surface structure degradation and interfacial impurities of spent cathodes significantly hinder Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; replenishment during restoration. Herein, we propose a unique advanced oxidation strategy that leverages the inherent catalytic activity of spent layered cathode materials to address these challenges. This strategy decomposes H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to generate &#8226;OH and &#8226;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; free radicals, facilitating oxidation reactions with the surface of the spent cathode. As a result, this approach effectively elevates the Ni valence state, modifies the surface microstructure, and eliminates fluorine-containing interface impurities, thereby promoting the solid-state regeneration process. The regenerated LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.83&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.12&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes demonstrate a specific capacity of 206&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1 C, comparable to commercially available cathodes. Meanwhile, this advanced oxidation strategy proves adaptable and scalable for treating industrial dismantled LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; black mass. A 3.1&#160;Ah pouch cell assembled with the regenerated LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits impressive capacity retention of 74% after 500 cycles. Additionally, a techno-economic analysis reveals that this strategy possesses low energy consumption, minimal environmental footprint, and high economic viability, suggesting its suitability for the battery recycling industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Control of Ferroelectric and Optical Properties in Molecular Ferroelectric for Multiplexing Nonvolatile Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on the synergistic control between ferroelectric polarization (FP) and optical properties in the molecular ferroelectric material, TMCM&#8208;MnCl3. It demonstrates that FP can modulate the photoluminescence (PL) emission, while optical writing can trigger FP reversal. This enables a seamless transition between electric&#8208;writing optical&#8208;reading and optical&#8208;writing electrical&#8208;reading modes, hinting at the viability of implementing multiplexing and multistate memory in ferroelectric fields.









Abstract
Utilizing the correlation among diverse physical properties to facilitate multiplexing and multistate memory is anticipated to emerge as an efficient strategy to enhance memory capacity, achieve device miniaturization, and ensure information security. As an important functional material, ferroelectrics have long been considered as a potential candidate in multistate memory devices. Furthermore, the integration of optical response offers an alternative path to realizing multiplexing features, further enhancing the versatility and efficiency of these devices. However, combining ferroelectricity and optical activity is always challenging because ferroelectricity is very sensitive to the crystal structure. In this study, on the correlation between ferroelectric polarization (FP) and optical properties in molecular ferroelectric material, trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichloromanganese (TMCM&#8208;MnCl3) is reported. This research demonstrated that the FP can modulate the photoluminescence (PL) emission, while optical illumination can trigger FP reversal. Based on these, both electric&#8208;writing optical&#8208;reading (EWOR) and optical&#8208;writing electrical&#8208;reading (OWER) modes have been conclusively established, and the seamless transition between these two modes can be achieved by adjusting the excitation light intensity. These findings reveal an intriguing physical interconnection and imply the viability of implementing multiplexing and multistate memory functionalities in systems based on ferroelectrics.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Scattering Perovskite Scintillator Arrays for High&#8208;Resolution Computed Tomography Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anti&#8208;scattering CsPbBr3 scintillator array embedded within a polyurethane acrylate matrix for CT imaging significantly suppresses light scattering and enhances the light collection efficiency by nearly two times compared to the monolithic film. The scintillator array provides a high spatial&#8208;resolution 3D reconstructed tooth image at a low X&#8208;ray dosage in CT imaging.








Abstract
Computed tomography (CT) imaging has emerge as an effective medical diagnostic technique due to its rapid and 3D imaging capabilities, often employing indirect imaging methods through scintillator materials. Arraying scintillators that can confine light scattering to enable high&#8208;resolution CT imaging remains an area of ongoing exploration for emerging perovskite scintillators. Here an anti&#8208;scattering cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) scintillator array embedded within a polyurethane acrylate matrix for CT imaging using a cost&#8208;effective solution&#8208;processed method is reported. Due to the large refractive index contrast between the scintillator and matrix, photon propagation can be well confined within the CsPbBr3 scintillator array to significantly suppress the light scattering and enhance the light collection efficiency by nearly two times compared to the monolithic film. Furthermore, the scintillator array exhibits low&#8208;dosage and high&#8208;resolution CT imaging capability by reconstructing a 3D tooth image with a good spatial resolution of 20.1 lp cm&#8722;1 at a low effective dose of 0.22 mSv. This work highlights that the CsPbBr3 scintillator array is a highly promising candidate for CT imaging.

         <title>2D Nanochannel Interlayer Realizing High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D porous silica nanosheets (PSN)/MXene nanochannel interlayer with selective cation transport characteristics facilitates lithium ion rapid transport while rejects translocation of polysulfides, and the raised p&#8208;band center of the surface O on PSN helps enhance polysulfide conversion kinetics. This work well addresses polysulfide shuttling and dendritic lithium growth, opening up new avenues for expanding application of nanofluidics in electrochemical energy storage and conversion.








Abstract
Commercialization of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries is largely limited by polysulfide shuttling and sluggish kinetics. Herein, 2D nanochannel interlayer composed of alternatively&#8208;stacked porous silica nanosheets (PSN) and Ti3C2Tx&#8208;MXene are developed. The 2D nanochannels with selective cation transport characteristics facilitate lithium ion rapid transport, while reject the translocation of polysulfide anions across the separator. The hydroxylated MXene shifts the p&#8208;band center of the surface O on PSN closer to the Fermi level, leading to strong absorptive/catalytic effect for polysulfides and thus fast polysulfide transformation kinetics. Together with the ion/electron bi&#8208;conduction function of PSN/MXene, the Li&#8211;S batteries deliver high initial capacity of 1443 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C, low&#8208;capacity decay rate of 0.049% per cycle over 800 cycles at 2 C, and excellent rate capability. At a high sulfur loading of 5.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the cells present higher areal specific capacity than commercial lithium ion batteries. The pouch cells with lean electrolyte (E/S = 3.9&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1) yield a capacity of 2&#8208;Ah at 100&#160;mA, high energy density and excellent cycling stability. This contribution opens up new avenues for expanding application of 2D nanofluidics in electrochemical energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Piezoelectric Vitamin&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Assemblies for Energy Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work systematically explores piezoelectric response of vitamin&#8208;based self&#8208;assemblies for power generation. Vitamin molecules can self&#8208;assemble into different supramolecular structures exhibiting tunable predicted piezoelectric coefficients. Vitamin B7 D&#8208;biotin (D&#8208;BIO) self&#8208;assemblies with high piezoelectricity are fabricated into piezoelectric devices for human motion monitoring and energy harvesting. These findings will facilitate the exploration and development of biomolecule&#8208;based piezoelectric materials.








Abstract
Structural diversity of biomolecules leads to various supramolecular organizations and asymmetric architectures of self&#8208;assemblies with significant piezoelectric response. However, the piezoelectricity of biomolecular self&#8208;assemblies has not been fully explored and the relationship between supramolecular structures and piezoelectricity remains poorly understood, which hinders the development of piezoelectric biomaterials. Herein, for the first time, the piezoelectricity of vitamin&#8208;based self&#8208;assemblies for power generation is systematically explored. X&#8208;ray diffraction studies revealed that vitamin molecules can self&#8208;assemble into different supramolecular structures, which exhibited tunable piezoelectric coefficients ranging from 3.8 to 42.8 pC&#160;N&#8722;1 by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Notably, vitamin B7 D&#8208;biotin (D&#8208;BIO) self&#8208;assemblies exhibited superior piezoelectricity due to low crystal symmetry and high polarization of supramolecular arrangements. The D&#8208;BIO assemblies&#8208;based piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) produced output voltages of &#8776;0.8 V under a mechanical force of 47 N, showing high mechanical durability after 5400 pressing&#8208;releasing cycles and high stability of at least three months. The PENG&#8208;based wearable sensor successfully detected bending motions of human limbs. Furthermore, the PENG&#8208;based insole converted biomechanical energy into stable electrical energy upon foot movement, illuminating 12 light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs).

&lt;p&gt;This work systematically explores piezoelectric response of vitamin-based self-assemblies for power generation. Vitamin molecules can self-assemble into different supramolecular structures exhibiting tunable predicted piezoelectric coefficients. Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; D-biotin (D-BIO) self-assemblies with high piezoelectricity are fabricated into piezoelectric devices for human motion monitoring and energy harvesting. These findings will facilitate the exploration and development of biomolecule-based piezoelectric materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structural diversity of biomolecules leads to various supramolecular organizations and asymmetric architectures of self-assemblies with significant piezoelectric response. However, the piezoelectricity of biomolecular self-assemblies has not been fully explored and the relationship between supramolecular structures and piezoelectricity remains poorly understood, which hinders the development of piezoelectric biomaterials. Herein, for the first time, the piezoelectricity of vitamin-based self-assemblies for power generation is systematically explored. X-ray diffraction studies revealed that vitamin molecules can self-assemble into different supramolecular structures, which exhibited tunable piezoelectric coefficients ranging from 3.8 to 42.8 pC&#160;N&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Notably, vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; D-biotin (D-BIO) self-assemblies exhibited superior piezoelectricity due to low crystal symmetry and high polarization of supramolecular arrangements. The D-BIO assemblies-based piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) produced output voltages of &#8776;0.8 V under a mechanical force of 47 N, showing high mechanical durability after 5400 pressing-releasing cycles and high stability of at least three months. The PENG-based wearable sensor successfully detected bending motions of human limbs. Furthermore, the PENG-based insole converted biomechanical energy into stable electrical energy upon foot movement, illuminating 12 light-emitting diodes (LEDs). This work fills knowledge gaps in piezoelectricity of vitamin-based self-assemblies, providing paradigms for realizing high-performance piezoelectric biomaterials through supramolecular engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shear&#8208;Mediated Stabilization of Spin Spiral Order in Multiferroic NiI2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magneto&#8208;structural phases of 2D multiferroic NiI2 are studied using resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray scattering and X&#8208;ray diffraction. A change of magnetic symmetry from incommensurate collinear to helical spin&#8208;spiral at a structural transition involving a significant interlayer shear is observed. These results highlight the role for interlayer magnetic exchange for driving the magnetic ground state and associated spin&#8208;induced ferroelectricity in NiI2.








Abstract
Type&#8208;II multiferroicity from non&#8208;collinear spin order is recently explored in the van der Waals material NiI2. Despite the importance for improper ferroelectricity, the microscopic mechanism of the helimagnetic order remains poorly understood. Here, the magneto&#8208;structural phases of NiI2 are investigated using resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray scattering (RXS) and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Two competing magnetic phases are identified. Below 60 K, an incommensurate magnetic reflection (q&#160;&#8776;&#160;[0.143,0,1.49] reciprocal lattice units) is observed which exhibits finite circular dichroism in RXS, signaling the inversion symmetry&#8208;breaking helimagnetic ground state. At elevated temperature, in the non&#8208;polar phase (60 K&#160;&lt;&#160;T&#160;&lt;&#160;75 K), a distinct q&#160;&#8776;&#160;[0.087,0.087,1.5] magnetic order is observed, attributed to a collinear incommensurate (CI) state. The first&#8208;order CI&#8208;helix transition is concomitant with a structural transition characterized by a significant interlayer shear, which drives the helimagnetic ground state as evidenced by a mean&#8208;field Heisenberg model including interlayer exchange and its coupling to the structural distortion. These findings identify interlayer magneto&#8208;structural coupling as the key driver behind multiferroicity in NiI2.

         <title>Fluorine Doping&#8208;Assisted Reconstruction of Isolated Cu Sites for CO2 Electroreduction Toward Multicarbon Products</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine (F) doping is an efficient strategy to facilitate the in situ aggregation of Cu single atoms and stabilize Cu+ species. Consequently, the F&#8208;doped Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits outstanding performance in CO2 electroreduction toward multicarbon products, achieving ultrahigh Cu utilization. This is attributed to the formation of abundant Cu nanocrystals with a high ratio of stable Cu+ species.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic synthesis of multicarbon compounds from CO2 is a promising method for storing renewable electricity and addressing global CO2 issues. Single&#8208;atom catalysts are promising candidates for CO2 reduction, but producing high&#8208;value multicarbon (C2+) products using a single&#8208;atom structure remains a significant challenge. In this study, a fluorine doping strategy is proposed to facilitate the reconstruction of isolated Cu atoms, promoting multicarbon generation. The in situ formed Cu nanocrystals contain a substantial amount of stable Cu+ species, demonstrating remarkable activity for CO2&#8722;to&#8208;multicarbon conversion. Notably, they achieve the highest Cu utilization, with a C2+ partial current density of &#8722;2.01 A mgper Cu&#8722;1and a C2+ formation rate of 7.03&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 mgper Cu&#8722;1at &#8776;&#8722;1&#160;V versus RHE. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations confirm the crucial role of fluorine atoms in structural evolution and electrolysis.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Nanozymes for Ulcerative Colitis</title>

         <dc:description>
A data&#8208;driven design strategy is developed for UC therapeutic nanozymes. The optimal CT&#8208;imageable oral UC therapeutic nanozyme SrDy2O4 is successfully discovered and the high&#8208;dimensional structure&#8208;activity relationships between the material database and nanozyme UC therapeutics are further elucidated by machine learning model interpretation in combination with the SISSO method.









Abstract
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder with rising prevalence. Due to the recurrent and difficult&#8208;to&#8208;treat nature of UC symptoms, current pharmacological treatments fail to meet patients' expectations. This study presents a machine learning&#8208;assisted high&#8208;throughput screening strategy to expedite the discovery of efficient nanozymes for UC treatment. Therapeutic requirements, including antioxidant property, acid stability, and zeta potential, are quantified and predicted by using a machine learning model. Non&#8208;quantifiable attributes, including intestinal barrier repair efficacy and biosafety, are assessed via high&#8208;throughput screening. Feature significance analysis, sure independence screening, and sparsifying operator symbolic regression reveal the high&#8208;dimensional structure&#8208;activity relationships between material features and therapeutic needs. SrDy2O4 with high stability, low toxicity, targeting ability, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capability is identified, which reduces ROS production, lowers cytochrome C levels in cytoplasm, and inhibits apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells by stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential. Mice treated with SrDy2O4 show improvements in colon length and body weight compared with dextran sodium sulfate salt&#8208;treated model group. Transcriptomic and 16S rRNA sequencing analyses show that SrDy2O4 boosts beneficial gut bacteria, and decreases pathogenic bacteria, thereby effectively restoring gut microbiota balance. Moreover, SrDy2O4 offers the advantage of X&#8208;ray imaging without side effects.

         <title>Stabilizing Layered Oxide Cathodes Based on Universal Surface Residual Alkali Conversion Chemistry for Rechargeable Secondary Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a universal surface residual alkali conversion strategy based on NH4F treatment and ring&#8208;opening polymerization of tetrahydrofuran. The approach transforms residual alkali into a stable polymer coating which can enhance interfacial stability, suppress lattice oxygen release and reduce side reactions, providing a promising solution to overcome residual alkali and interfacial instability issues for layered oxide cathodes in practical application.








Abstract
Layered transition metal oxides (LTMOs) are attractive cathode candidates for rechargeable secondary batteries because of their high theoretical capacity. Unfortunately, LTMOs suffer from severe capacity attenuation, voltage decay, and sluggish kinetics, resulting from irreversible lattice oxygen evolution and unstable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Besides, LTMOs accumulate surface residual alkali species, like hydroxides and carbonates, during synthesis, limiting their practical application. Herein, a universal strategy is suggested to in situ convert surface residual alkali into a stable polymer coating layer for LTMOs, thus turning wastes into treasure. The formation process of polymer coating involves NH4F treatment to consume residual alkali, then utilizing generated fluorides to induce the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of tetrahydrofuran. Implementing this strategy to Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based cathode materials (LRM) results in a notable reduction in voltage hysteresis, along with enhanced kinetics and cycling stability in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. With this layer of encapsulation, surface lattice oxygen release and layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition of LRM are significantly alleviated with minimal mechanical degradation and surface parasitic reactions. Such strategy can also be applied to air&#8208;sensitive sodium&#8208;rich LTMOs in sodium&#8208;ion batteries,&#160;which showcases superior universality. This work might provide a promising solution to overcome residual alkali and interfacial instability issues for LTMOs in practical application.

The approach transforms residual alkali into a stable polymer coating which can enhance interfacial stability, suppress lattice oxygen release and reduce side reactions, providing a promising solution to overcome residual alkali and interfacial instability issues for layered oxide cathodes in practical application.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layered transition metal oxides (LTMOs) are attractive cathode candidates for rechargeable secondary batteries because of their high theoretical capacity. Unfortunately, LTMOs suffer from severe capacity attenuation, voltage decay, and sluggish kinetics, resulting from irreversible lattice oxygen evolution and unstable cathode-electrolyte interface. Besides, LTMOs accumulate surface residual alkali species, like hydroxides and carbonates, during synthesis, limiting their practical application. Herein, a universal strategy is suggested to in situ convert surface residual alkali into a stable polymer coating layer for LTMOs, thus turning wastes into treasure. The formation process of polymer coating involves NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F treatment to consume residual alkali, then utilizing generated fluorides to induce the ring-opening polymerization of tetrahydrofuran. Implementing this strategy to Li-rich Mn-based cathode materials (LRM) results in a notable reduction in voltage hysteresis, along with enhanced kinetics and cycling stability in lithium-ion batteries. With this layer of encapsulation, surface lattice oxygen release and layered-to-spinel phase transition of LRM are significantly alleviated with minimal mechanical degradation and surface parasitic reactions. Such strategy can also be applied to air-sensitive sodium-rich LTMOs in sodium-ion batteries,&#160;which showcases superior universality. This work might provide a promising solution to overcome residual alkali and interfacial instability issues for LTMOs in practical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Photocatalytic Efficiency Through Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Driven Molecular Epitaxial Growth of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks on BiVO4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces an innovative method, achieving molecular&#8208;level epitaxial growth of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) on BiVO4 photoanodes by precisely controlling the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies. The seamless interface of BiVO4/MOF optimizes electron transfer and reduces recombination losses, elevating the overall efficiency of the PEC water oxidation.








Abstract
Efficient charge separation at the semiconductor/cocatalyst interface is crucial for high&#8208;performance photoelectrodes, as it directly influences the availability of surface charges for solar water oxidation. However, establishing strong molecular&#8208;level connections between these interfaces to achieve superior interfacial quality presents significant challenges. This study introduces an innovative electrochemical etching method that generates a high concentration of oxygen vacancy sites on BiVO4 surfaces (Ov&#8208;BiVO4), enabling interactions with the oxygen&#8208;rich ligands of MIL&#8208;101. This reduces the formation energy and promotes conformal growth on BiVO4. The Ov&#8208;BiVO4/MIL&#8208;101 composite exhibits an ideal semiconductor/cocatalyst interface, achieving an impressive photocurrent density of 5.91 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 VRHE, along with excellent stability. This high&#8208;performing photoanode enables an unbiased tandem device with an Ov&#8208;BiVO4/MIL&#8208;101&#8208;Si solar cell system, achieving a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency of 4.33%. The molecular&#8208;level integration mitigates surface states and enhances the internal electric field, facilitating the migration of photogenerated holes into the MIL&#8208;101 overlayer. This process activates highly efficient Fe catalytic sites, which effectively adsorb water molecules, lowering the energy barrier for water oxidation and improving interfacial kinetics. Further studies confirm the broad applicability of oxygen vacancy&#8208;induced molecular epitaxial growth in various MOFs, offering valuable insights into defect engineering for optimizing interfaces and enhancing photocatalytic activity.

         <title>Boosting Thermoelectric Performance of Semicrystalline Conducting Polymers by Simply Adding Nucleating Agent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simply adding a nucleating agent N,N&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenyl)diisonicotinamide (PDA)&#160;to poly(2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;alkylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (PBTTT&#8208;C14) precisely tunes its crystallization and maximizes structural order. The improved molecular packing reduces disorder and elevates charge mobility. With optimized doping, this polymer achieves remarkable electrical conductivity (up to 1968&#160;S&#160;cm&#8315;&#185;) and a power factor &#8776;176&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2, expanding possibilities for high&#8208;performance thermoelectrics.








Abstract
Controlling the microstructure of semiconducting polymers is critical for optimizing thermoelectric performance, yet remains challenging, requiring complex processing techniques like alignment. In this study, a straightforward strategy is introduced to enhance the thermoelectric properties of semi&#8208;crystalline polymer films by incorporating minimal amounts of nucleating agents, a method widely used in traditional polymer industries. By blending less than 1 wt% of N,N&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenyl)diisonicotinamide (PDA) into poly(2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;alkylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) (PBTTT&#8208;C14), controlled modulation of crystallization behavior is achieved, resulting in reduced structural disorder and enhanced charge carrier mobility. Systematic investigations reveal that an optimal PDA loading of 0.9 wt% increases the crystallization degree by 45% compared to pristine PBTTT&#8208;C14 films. Under these optimized conditions, the PDA&#8208;modified PBTTT&#8208;C14 films exhibit a maximum electrical conductivity of 1,894&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a maximum power factor of 176&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2, showing improvements of 96% and 433%, respectively, over doped pristine PBTTT&#8208;C14 films. These gains are attributed to the synergistic effects of polymer chain extension and reduced grain boundary resistance, which collectively enhance charge transport efficiency. Additionally, ion exchange doping is found to maintain a high charge carrier concentration while preserving the crystallinity introduced by PDA, paving the way for advanced thermoelectric materials and next&#8208;generation polymer&#8208;based electronics.

Cellulose nanofiber and alginate from natural sargassum are used to prepare a fire&#8208;retardant structural material through a hydrogel layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer method. This bio&#8208;based material has excellent mechanical properties, thermal stability, and fire retardancy. This work greatly improves the utilization of seaweed residues and natural polymers, provides a bio&#8208;based fire&#8208;retardant strategy, and has important potential in the future development of high&#8208;performance fiber&#8208;based materials.









Abstract
With increasing concern about the environmental pollution of petrochemical plastics, people are constantly exploring environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative materials. Compared with petrochemical materials, cellulose has overwhelming superiority in terms of mechanical properties, thermal properties, cost, and biodegradability. However, the flammability of cellulose hinders its practical application to a certain extent, so improving the fire&#8208;retardant properties of cellulose nanofiber&#8208;based materials has become a research focus. Here, cellulose nanofiber and alginate are extracted from abundant natural sargassum as high&#8208;strength nanoscale building blocks, and then a sargassum cellulose fire&#8208;retardant structural material is prepared through a bottom&#8208;up hydrogel layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer method. The structural materials obtained incorporate excellent mechanical properties (&#8776;297 MPa), thermal stability (&#8776;200&#160;&#176;C), low thermal expansion coefficient (&#8776;7.17 &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1), and fire&#8208;retardant properties. This work largely improves the utilization of seaweed residue and natural polymers, providing a bio&#8208;based fire&#8208;retardant strategy, and has a wide range of development prospects in the field of fiber&#8208;based high&#8208;performance structural materials in the future.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique Bi&#8208;RuO2 single&#8208;atom alloy oxide is rational designed and achieved by phase engineering of the hexagonal close&#8208;packed RuBi single&#8208;atom alloy, to boost oxygen evolution electrocatalysis. The incorporation of Bi1 improves the activity by electronic density optimization and the stability by hindering surface Ru demetallation, enabling a practical proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) that needs only 1.59 V to reach 1.0 A cm&#8722;2.









Abstract
Engineering nanomaterials at single&#8208;atomic sites can enable unprecedented catalytic properties for broad applications, yet it remains challenging to do so on RuO2&#8208;based electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Herein, the rational design and construction of Bi&#8208;RuO2 single&#8208;atom alloy oxide (SAAO) are presented to boost acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), via phase engineering a novel hexagonal close packed (hcp) RuBi single&#8208;atom alloy. This Bi&#8208;RuO2 SAAO electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 192&#160;mV and superb stability over 650&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, enabling a practical PEMWE that needs only 1.59&#160;V to reach 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 under industrial conditions. Operando differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy analysis, coupled with density functional theory studies, confirmed the adsorbate&#8208;evolving mechanism on Bi&#8208;RuO2 SAAO and that the incorporation of Bi1 improves the activity by electronic density optimization and the stability by hindering surface Ru demetallation. This work not only introduces a new strategy to fabricate high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts at atomic&#8208;level, but also demonstrates their potential use in industrial electrolyzers.

&lt;p&gt;A unique Bi-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; single-atom alloy oxide is rational designed and achieved by phase engineering of the hexagonal close-packed RuBi single-atom alloy, to boost oxygen evolution electrocatalysis. The incorporation of Bi&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; improves the activity by electronic density optimization and the stability by hindering surface Ru demetallation, enabling a practical proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) that needs only 1.59 V to reach 1.0 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering nanomaterials at single-atomic sites can enable unprecedented catalytic properties for broad applications, yet it remains challenging to do so on RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE).

         <title>A Wenzel Interfaces Design for Homogeneous Solute Distribution Obtains Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Wenzel model is successfully constructed at the interface to achieve a super&#8208;hydrophilic substrate, greatly alleviating the coffee&#8208;ring effect during the large&#8208;area perovskite film printing process. The highly hydrophilic nature of the interface, along with its unique microstructure, greatly facilitates the efficient and rapid deposition of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing process.








Abstract
The coffee&#8208;ring effect, caused by uneven deposition of colloidal particles in perovskite precursor solutions, leads to poor uniformity in perovskite films prepared through large&#8208;area printing. In this work, the surface of SnO2 is roughened to construct a Wenzel model, successfully achieving a super&#8208;hydrophilic interface. This modification significantly accelerates the spreading of the perovskite precursor solution, reducing the response delay time of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing process. Additionally, the micro&#8208;spherical depression structure on the SnO2 surface effectively inhibits the migration of colloidal particles toward the edges of liquid film, trapping perovskite colloidal particles at the buried interfaces and improving film uniformity. Due to the synergistic effect of super&#8208;hydrophilicity and micro&#8208;rough structure on the surface of SnO2, leading to a substantial improvement in the quality of perovskite crystals. Therefore, the efficiency of printing prepared flexible devices (0.101 cm2) reached 25.42% (certified 25.12%). Moreover, the efficiency of rigid and flexible large&#8208;scale perovskite solar modules (PSMs) based on meniscus&#8208;coating manufacture reached 21.34% and 16.99% (100 cm2), respectively, and demonstrated superior environmental stability by maintaining an initial efficiency of 91% after being stored in atmospheric conditions for 2000 h, offering practical guidance for fabricating high&#8208;performance and stable large&#8208;scale perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

         <title>Microglial&#8208;Biomimetic Memantine&#8208;Loaded Polydopamine Nanomedicines for Alleviating Depression</title>

         <dc:description>
A microglial&#8208;biomimetic memantine&#8208;loaded polydopamine nanomedicine, PDA&#8208;Mem@M, that achieves blood&#8208;brain barrier penetration and brain inflammation site targeting for rapid and precise treatment of depression is designed. PDA&#8208;Mem@M effectively alleviate depression&#8208;like behaviors. This synergistic strategy, with satisfactory biosafety and strong anti&#8208;inflammatory and synaptic plasticity restoration effects, is conducive to advances in depression therapy.








Abstract
Depression is a common psychiatric disorder, and monoamine&#8208;based antidepressants as first&#8208;line therapy remain ineffective in some patients. The synergistic modulation of neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity could be a major strategy for treating depression. In this study, an inflammation&#8208;targeted microglial biomimetic system, PDA&#8208;Mem@M, is reported for treating depression. Microglial membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles penetrate the blood&#8208;brain barrier and facilitate microglial targeting. Subsequently, owing to the excellent free radical&#8208;scavenging capacity, PDA&#8208;Mem@M attenuate&#160;the brain inflammatory microenvironment. After on&#8208;demand release from the nanoparticles, memantine increases&#160;the expression of brain&#8208;derived neurotrophic factors and reverses&#160;the loss of synaptic dendritic spines. Further, in vivo studies demonstrate that PDA&#8208;Mem@M effectively alleviate&#160;depression&#8208;like behaviors to a greater extent than memantine or polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA) monotherapy. This synergistic strategy, with satisfactory biosafety and strong anti&#8208;inflammatory and synaptic plasticity restoration effects, is conducive to advances in depression therapy.

         <title>Phytic Acid&#8208;Induced Gradient Hydrogels for Highly Sensitive and Broad Range Pressure Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distinct interactions between phytic acid and various polymers are discovered first and leveraged to construct a gradient ionic hydrogel&#8208;based pressure sensor, which offers excellent sensitivity, wide sensing range, and superior low&#8208;pressure detection performance. The gradient ionic hydrogel&#8208;based sensor recognizes subtle pressures from acoustic waves and airflow, moderate pressures due to speaking and finger pressing, and high magnitudes of plantar pressures.








Abstract
Ionic conductive hydrogels have emerged as an excellent option for constructing dielectric layers of interfacial iontronic sensors. Among these, gradient ionic hydrogels, due to the intrinsic gradient elastic modulus, can achieve a wide range of pressure responses. However, the fabrication of gradient hydrogels with optimal mechanical and sensing properties remains a challenge. In this study, it is discovered first that phytic acid (PA) interacts in remarkably distinct manners (i.e., plasticizing effects and phase separation) with different polymers (i.e., polyacrylamide and polyacrylic acid). This distinctive PA&#8208;polymer interacting mechanism is innovatively utilized to construct a modulus gradient ionic hydrogel through a simple precursor solution infiltration approach. The gradient hydrogel&#8208;based flexible pressure sensor not only achieves a high sensitivity (9.00&#160;kPa&#8722;1, &lt;15&#160;kPa) and a broad sensing range (from &#8776;3.7&#160;Pa to 1.2&#160;MPa) simultaneously, but also exhibits superior low pressure sensing performance. It successfully recognizes the subtle pressure due to acoustic waves and airflow, as well as the moderate pressure due to speaking and finger pressing and the high magnitude of plantar pressure. In addition, the gradient hydrogel demonstrates remarkable antibacterial properties and biocompatibility. This functional hydrogel with excellent sensing performance and bioactivity exhibits exceptional potential for wearable sensing applications.

         <title>All Light Controlled Five State Logic Gates on a Ferroelectric Ceramic Chip</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel planar three&#8208;electrode structure is constructed on the Ti3+ self&#8208;doping 0.5Ba(Zr0.2TI0.8)O3&#8208;0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 (BZT&#8208;BCT) ceramic surface that has an obvious photovoltaic and pyroelectric response. Through a specific polarization method, the device shows a region&#8208;dependent photoelectric response. Based on this, five basic optoelectronic logic gates are achieved on a single ferroelectric ceramic chip.








Abstract
Differentiating photoelectric response in a single material with a simple approach is desirable for all&#8208;in&#8208;one optoelectronic logical devices. In ferroelectric materials, significantly distinct photoelectric features should be observed if they are in diverse polarization states, unveiling a possible pathway to realize multifunctional optoelectronic logic gates through ferroelectric polarization design. In this study, the Ti3+ self&#8208;doping strategy is first applied to 0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3&#8208;0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 ferroelectric ceramics (BZT&#8208;BCT&#8208;xT) through co&#8208;firing metallic Ti powders and BZT&#8208;BCT powders to enhance photoelectric output. Subsequently, on the BZT&#8208;BCT&#8208;3T ceramic surface that has optimal photoelectric properties, three individual regions are separated and heterogeneously polarized by using a novel planar three&#8208;electrodes structure. Intriguing illumination region&#8208;dependent photocurrent directions are demonstrated in this as&#8208;fabricated device. Based on this, five basic optoelectronic logic gates are integrated into single ferroelectric ceramic via fully light&#8208;controlled methods, including &#8220;AND&#8221;, &#8220;OR&#8221;, &#8220;NOT&#8221;, &#8220;NAND&#8221; and &#8220;NOR&#8221;. These gates can be readily switched by simply altering the output electrodes or light intensity of 405&#160;nm LED modulating light. This work not only puts forward an innovative strategy for designing ferroelectric optoelectronic logic gates, but also provides feasibility for more ferroelectric materials to be applied in logical devices.

&lt;p&gt;A novel planar three-electrode structure is constructed on the Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; self-doping 0.5Ba(Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;TI&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-0.5(Ba&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;)TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (BZT-BCT) ceramic surface that has an obvious photovoltaic and pyroelectric response. Through a specific polarization method, the device shows a region-dependent photoelectric response. Based on this, five basic optoelectronic logic gates are achieved on a single ferroelectric ceramic chip.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differentiating photoelectric response in a single material with a simple approach is desirable for all-in-one optoelectronic logical devices. In ferroelectric materials, significantly distinct photoelectric features should be observed if they are in diverse polarization states, unveiling a possible pathway to realize multifunctional optoelectronic logic gates through ferroelectric polarization design. In this study, the Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; self-doping strategy is first applied to 0.5Ba(Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-0.5(Ba&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;)TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ferroelectric ceramics (BZT-BCT-&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;T) through co-firing metallic Ti powders and BZT-BCT powders to enhance photoelectric output. Subsequently, on the BZT-BCT-3T ceramic surface that has optimal photoelectric properties, three individual regions are separated and heterogeneously polarized by using a novel planar three-electrodes structure. Intriguing illumination region-dependent photocurrent directions are demonstrated in this as-fabricated device. Based on this, five basic optoelectronic logic gates are integrated into single ferroelectric ceramic via fully light-controlled methods, including &#8220;AND&#8221;, &#8220;OR&#8221;, &#8220;NOT&#8221;, &#8220;NAND&#8221; and &#8220;NOR&#8221;. These gates can be readily switched by simply altering the output electrodes or light intensity of 405&#160;nm LED modulating light. This work not only puts forward an innovative strategy for designing ferroelectric optoelectronic logic gates, but also provides feasibility for more ferroelectric materials to be applied in logical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Organic Nanofiller: A New Reinforcement Strategy for Dynamic Covalent Polymer Networks Toward Upcycling of Carbon Fiber Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new reinforcement strategy for DCPN involving the in situ formation of supramolecular organic nanofillers via asynchronous polymerization is proposed. The reinforcement and recyclability of the supramolecular organic nanofillers on DCPN considerably exceed those of traditional methods. This reinforcement strategy is versatile and can be successfully applied for the upcycling of high&#8208;performance CF composites.








Abstract
Dynamic covalent polymer networks (DCPN) provide an important solution to the challenging recyclability of thermoset elastomers. However, dynamic bonds exhibit relatively weak bond energies, considerably decreasing the mechanical properties of DCPN. Herein, a novel reinforcement strategy for DCPN involving the in situ formation of supramolecular organic nanofillers through asynchronous polymerization is proposed. Owing to the difference in the reactivity of the isocyanate groups and the gradual deblocking of aldimine, asynchronous cross&#8208;linking of hexamethylene diisocyanate and isocyanate&#8208;terminated prepolymer containing dynamic oxime&#8211;urethane bonds with the deblocked tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine facilitates the transition from the molecular interpenetration of chains into immiscible polymerization. This results in thermodynamic incompatibility between the hyperbranched clusters and long chains, inducing a spontaneous formation of supramolecular organic nanofillers. Compared to traditional reinforcement strategies, supramolecular organic nanofillers considerably improve the mechanical properties of DCPN. Furthermore, the supramolecular interactions between hyperbranched clusters and dynamic oxime&#8211;urethane bonds enable the network with excellent recyclability. The unique reinforcement and recyclability of the prepared DCPN allow their combination with carbon fibers (CF) to form CF composites with outstanding properties for personal&#8208;protection applications, achieving CF composite upcycling. This study offers a novel strategy on the reinforcement of DCPN and the upcycling of high&#8208;performance CF composites.

Abstract
New types of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials have great potential in solving the current global dilemma on energy, environment, and medical care. Herein, based on two kinds of biomolecule&#8208;MOFs (Bio&#8208;MOFs) with favorable biocompatibility and degradation&#8208;reconstruction characteristics, we have established a self&#8208;powered muti&#8208;functional device to achieve an efficient and broad&#8208;spectrum environmental energy collection and biomedical applications. Combining Zn(II) and carnosine&#8208;based Zn&#8208;Car_MOF possessing a high piezoelectric response (d33 = 11.17 pm V&#8722;1) with patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film, a tribo&#8208;piezoelectric hybrid nanogenerator (TPHG) is constructed with a synergy output of triboelectric and piezoelectric effects. The Zn&#8208;Car_TPHG demonstrates a high output performance (131&#160;V at 100&#160;kPa) and a wide range of pressure response (1&#160;Pa&#8211;100&#160;kPa), possessing applications in environmental energy collection and biomedical sensors. To expand the application of the wearable device, a conductive hexagonal prism MOF (Cu3(2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene)2 (Cu&#8208;HHTP)) is synthesized and employed to load thymol (Thy). Cooperating with Zn&#8208;Car_TPHG, the resulting Cu&#8208;HHTP/Thy can achieve an efficient self&#8208;powered ROS (singlet oxygen (1O2) and hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH)) generation and drug synergistic broad&#8208;spectrum sterilization effect (efficiency &#8805; 98%). In a word, the flexible wearable device based on the muti&#8208;functional Bio&#8208;MOFs is sustainable and environmentally friendly, possessing wide application potential in fields of environmental energy collection, biosensors, and self&#8208;powered antibacterial.

The high&#8208;entropy Na3.45V0.4Fe0.4Ti0.4Mn0.45Cr0.35(PO4)3 cathode material prepared by ultrafast high temperature shock inhibits the possibility of phase separation and achieves the reversible and stable multielectron transfer, fabulous cycling stability and excellent wide&#8208;temperature range operation from &#8722;50 to 60&#160;&#176;C. The ultrafast sintering strategy provides a broad platform for the development of polyanionic materials for long&#8208;lifespan and all&#8208;climate sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Avoiding severe structural distortion, irreversible phase transition, and realizing the stabilized multielectron redox are vital for promoting the development of high&#8208;performance NASICON&#8208;type cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a high&#8208;entropy Na3.45V0.4Fe0.4Ti0.4Mn0.45Cr0.35(PO4)3 (HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP) cathode material is prepared by ultrafast high&#8208;temperature shock, which inhibits the possibility of phase separation and achieves reversible and stable multielectron transfer of 2.4/2.8 e&#8722; at voltage range of 2.0&#8211;4.45/1.5&#8211;4.45 V versus Na+/Na (the capacity of 137.2/162.0 mAh g&#8722;1). The galvanostatic charge/discharge and in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction tests indicate the sequential redox reactions and approximate solid solution phase transition behavior of HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP. Density functional theory calculations analyze the migration pathways and energy barriers, further confirming the superior reaction kinetics of HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP. Accordingly, the HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP exhibits outstanding wide temperature applicability and can operate stably in the temperature range of &#8722;50&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C, accompanied by a capacity retention of 92.8% after 400 cycles at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C and a capacity of 73.7 mAh g&#8722;1 even at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C. The assembled hard carbon//HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP full&#8208;cell offers an energy density of &#8776;301 Wh kg&#8722;1 based on total cathode and anode active mass, verifying the application feasibility of HE&#8208;Na3.45TMP. This work provides an innovative and ultrafast pathway to rationally fabricate high&#8208;performance cathodes for SIBs.

         <title>Nano&#8208;Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Isolated in Mesoporous Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a general methodology for in situ synthesis of eight nanoMOFs which are exclusively located inside the internal mesochannels. This is the first report of the complete impregnation and even dispersion of nanoscale MOFs within the interior channels of mesoporous carbons, which can regulate Zn2+ plating electrochemistry toward stable aqueous Zn batteries.








Abstract
As an alternative to bulk counterparts, metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles isolated within conductive mesoporous carbon matrices are of increasing interest for electrochemical applications. Although promising, a &#8220;clean&#8221; carbon surface is generally associated with poor compatibility and weak interactions with metal/ligand precursors, which leads to the growth of MOFs with inhomogeneous particle sizes on outer pore walls. Here, a general methodology for in situ synthesis of eight nanoMOF composites within mesochannels with high dispersity and stability are reported. Mesoporous polydopamine (mesoPDA)&#8208;F127 nanospheres with unique surface chemistry, e.g., nanoconfined spaces, catechol functional groups, pyrrolic N doping, and hydrophilic PEO blocks, are found to be a suitable molecular platform. Sliced cross&#8208;sectional TEM, HAADF&#8208;STEM, and corresponding EDS elemental mapping, as well as nitrogen adsorption characterizations, are utilized to visualize the in situ growth process of ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles. These careful analyses provides direct evidence that the highly dispersed ZIF&#8208;8 is exclusively located inside the internal mesochannels. After moderate carbonization of the mesoPDA&#8208;F127/ZIF&#8208;8 nanocomposites, a prototype for a mesoporous carbon&#8208;isolated ZIF&#8208;8 nanostructure is achieved, which can regulate Zn2+ plating electrochemistry toward stable aqueous Zn batteries. This is the first report of the complete impregnation and even dispersion of nanoscale MOFs within the interior channels of mesoporous carbons.

         <title>Maximizing Output Energy via Suppressing Charge Loss and Increasing Load Voltage in Charge Extraction Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new charge loss and a voltage loss model are proposed and a historical record output energy density of 5.03 J m&#8722;2 is achieved by the effective collection of interface tribo&#8208;charges and the increase in load voltage during the charge extraction process.








Abstract
The effective collection of interfacial tribo&#8208;charges and an increase in load voltage are two essential factors that improve the output energy of triboelectric nanogenerators. However, some tribo&#8208;charges are hardly collected through one or multiple integrated side electrodes based on corona discharge, and their load voltages are limited by air breakdown in adjacent electrodes. In this study, a dynamic quasi&#8208;dipole potential distribution model is proposed to systematically reveal the mechanisms of interfacial tribo&#8208;charge loss. Based on this model, an optimization route is designed to reduce the interfacial charge loss stepwise, achieving a 15&#8208;fold improvement in charge collection from the tribo&#8208;interface.&#160;A potential difference enhancement strategy is used for the first time to increase the air breakdown threshold between the inner electrodes and increase the output voltage under a large load. By effective increase in charge collection efficiency and load voltage, a historical record output energy density of 5.03 J m&#8722;2 is obtained. This study refined and optimized the interfacial charge loss mechanisms and provided advanced guidance for efficiently extracting energy during the triboelectrification process.

         <title>3D&#8208;Porous Electrocatalyst with Tip&#8208;Enhanced Electric Field Effect Enables High&#8208;Performance Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzer</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficiently reactant&#8208;enriched and mass traffic system is developed through integrating high&#8208;curvature Pt nanocones with a 3D porous TiAl framework. The 3D multiple interconnected channels in TiAl boosts the mass transport rate, while the high curvature of Pt nanocones induces an ultrahigh local electric field, thereby accelerating the transfer of H3O+ during HER.








Abstract
Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as one of the most advanced methods for the green production of hydrogen, is greatly impeded by inefficient mass transfer. Here we present an efficiently reactant enriched and mass traffic system by integrating high&#8208;curvature Pt nanocones with 3D porous TiAl framework to enhance mass transfer rate. Theoretical simulations, in situ Raman spectroscopy and potential&#8208;dependent Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results disclose that the strong local electric field induced by high&#8208;curvature Pt can greatly promote the H3O+ supply rate during HER, resulting in &#8764;1.6 times higher H3O+ concentration around the Pt nanocone than that in electrolyte. X&#8208;ray computed tomography and molecular dynamic simulation demonstrate the diffusion coefficient of H3O+ in 3D TiAl framework surpasses that in commercial carbon support by more than 16.7 times. Consequently, Pt/TiAl&#8208;nanocone exhibits a high mass activity of 17.2 mA cm&#8722;2Pt at an overpotential of 100 mV with an ultrahigh TOF value of 42.9 atom&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. In a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, the Pt/TiAl&#8208;nanocone cathode achieves an industrial&#8208;scale current density of 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 with a cell voltage of 1.88 V at 60 &#176;C and can operate stably for at least 800 h with a sluggish voltage decay rate of 137 &#181;V h&#8722;1.

         <title>Local Polarization Piezoelectric Electric Field Promoted Water Dissociation for Hydroxyl Radical Generation under Ambient Humidity Condition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generated local polarization piezoelectric field (LPPEF) can be significantly enhanced through ball milling piezoelectric Pb2B5O9Cl (PBOC) by adsorbing trace amounts of water under ambient humidity conditions. Under this circumstance, the energy barrier for water dissociation can be largely lowered, thus facilitating the breaking of H&#8211;O&#8211;H bonds and the generation of hydroxyl radicals.








Abstract
Combining piezocatalysts with mechanical ball milling for dissociating water to generate hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH) offers unprecedented opportunities for energy conversion and environmental remediation. However, the in&#8208;depth insights into the relationship between water and local polarization piezoelectric electric field (LPPEF) are currently lacking, in particularly, the &#183;OH formation mechanism in ball milling driven piezocatalyst system is not systematically elucidated. To this end, the present work constructs a ball milling driven piezoelectric solid/liquid interface between piezoelectric Pb2B5O9Cl (PBOC) and different contents of water to investigate LPPEF initiated catalytic reaction. Results show that PBOC exhibits an excellent Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) degradation efficiency with a 68.94 and 12.43 times faster rate constant than traditional SiO2 and BaTiO3, respectively. Under ambient humidity condition, the lower energy barrier of water dissociation (0.23&#160;eV) endows &#183;OH generation more energetically favorable than under the water&#8208;oversaturated condition (0.66&#160;eV), and trace water magnifies the polarizability of [BO3] and [BO4] units in PBOC to initiate an enhanced LPPEF, thus it enhances the trapping of lone pairs electrons in trace adsorbed water by holes to contribute a higher yield of &#183;OH. This study constructs a highly correlated field&#8208;initiated electron transfer system that provides opportunities for promoting the performance of piezocatalytic materials.

         <title>Plasmonic Single&#8208;Molecule Affinity Detection at 10&#8722;20 Molar</title>

Surface&#8208;plasmon&#8208;resonance (SPR) typically detects in the nanomolar range. A pH&#8208;conditioning of a physisorbed biolayer, hosting trillions of capturing antibodies or probes enables SPR to detect a single protein or DNA&#8208;strand in 0.1 mL of plasma. The pH&#8208;conditioning transition the biolayer in a metastable state where a single affinity&#8208;biding event can trigger an amplification mechanism involving a broad self&#8208;propagating electrostatic rearrangement








Abstract
DNA can be readily amplified through replication, enabling the detection of a single&#8208;target copy. A comparable performance for proteins in immunoassays has yet to be fully assessed. Surface&#8208;plasmon&#8208;resonance (SPR) serves as a probe capable of performing assays at concentrations typically around 10&#8315;&#8313; molar. In this study, plasmonic single&#8208;molecule assays for both proteins and DNA are demonstrated, achieving limits&#8208;of&#8208;detections (LODs) as low as 10&#8315;2&#8304; molar (1&#160;&#177;&#160;1 molecule in 0.1&#160;mL), even in human serum, in 1 h. This represents an improvement in typical SPR LODs by eleven orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude. The single&#8208;molecule SPR assay is achieved with a millimeter&#8208;wide surface functionalized with a physisorbed biolayer comprising trillions of recognition&#8208;elements (antibodies or protein&#8211;probe complexes) which undergo an acidic or alkaline pH&#8208;conditioning. Potentiometric and surface&#8208;probing imaging experiments reveal the phenomenon underlying this extraordinary performance enhancement. The data suggest an unexplored amplification process within the biomaterial, where pH&#8208;conditioning, driving the biolayer in a metastable state, induces a self&#8208;propagating aggregation of partially misfolded proteins, following single&#8208;affinity binding. This process triggers an electrostatic rearrangement, resulting in the displacement of a charge equivalent to 1.5e per 102 recognition elements. Such findings open new opportunities for reliable SPR&#8208;based biosensing at the physical detection limits, with promising applications in point&#8208;of&#8208;care plasmonic systems.

         <title>Bioinspired Electrostatic Capture&#8208;and&#8208;Release System for Precise Microdroplet Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an innovative electrostatic capture&#8208;and&#8208;release manipulator enabling precise microdroplet emission and transportation. Utilizing electrostatic forces and dielectric pinning, it achieves controlled, contamination&#8208;free manipulation of nanoscale droplets. The study explores its application in diverse fields, including microfluidics, chemical reactions, and material fabrication, offering a sustainable and highly accurate platform for droplet&#8208;based technologies.








Abstract
The application of physical fields is crucial for droplet generation and manipulation, underpinning technologies like printing, microfluidic biochips, drug delivery, and flexible sensors. Despite advancements, precise micro/nanoscale droplet generation and accurate microfluidic reactions remain challenging. Inspired by the liquid ejection mechanisms in microscopic organisms, an electrostatic manipulator for the precise capture, emission, and transport of microdroplets is proposed. This approach enables the controlled and periodic emission of nanoscale daughter droplets from microscale parent droplets, achieved through dielectric pinning on surfaces and electrostatic field&#8208;driven forces. Results show precise nanoscale droplet release on inert polymer surfaces, enabling directional, contamination&#8208;free liquid manipulation. Moreover, leveraging surface treatment techniques and robust electrostatic force&#8208;driven transportation, a versatile strategy for droplet generation and manipulation, spanning from microfluidic devices to chemical reaction operations. The novel droplet manipulation phenomena and control strategies can advance the fields of electrostatic&#8208;based microfluidics, materials fabrication, and beyond.

         <title>Tailored Colloidal Shapes in Precursor Solutions for Efficient Blade&#8208;Coated Perovskite Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ellipsoidal colloids are tailored in the perovskite precursor solution by incorporating perovskite colloids and polymer additives. Due to the anisotropic driven force from the fluidic flow in the meniscus, perovskite film demonstrates more oriented packing during the blade&#8208;coating process. The regulated PSCs and PSMs achieve PCE of 24.31% and 21.67% (21.37% certified), respectively, for aperture areas of 0.09 and 13.94&#160;cm2.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technologies. However, perovskite films deposited by blade&#8208;coating usually exhibit inferior film morphology compared to those fabricated by spin&#8208;coating, which hinders the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of the scalable perovskite solar modules (PSMs). Herein, ellipsoidal colloids are tailored in the perovskite precursor solution by incorporating perovskite colloids and polymer additives. Compared to unregulated spherical colloids, the ellipsoidal colloids demonstrate more oriented packing during the blade&#8208;coating process, which is due to the anisotropic driven force from the fluidic flow in the meniscus. As a result of the improved film morphology, the regulated PSCs and PSMs achieve superior PCE of 24.31% and 21.67% (21.37% certified), respectively, for aperture areas of 0.09 and 13.94 cm2, and 89% initial PCE after 600&#160;h continuous operation.

         <title>Spin State Modulation with Oxygen Vacancy Orientates C/N Intermediates for Urea Electrosynthesis of Ultrahigh Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored transformation of high&#8208;spin Ni2+ (t2g6eg2) into low&#8208;spin Ni3+ (t2g6eg1) by introducing oxygen vacancies (Ov) can enhance reduction/adsorption of NO3&#8210;&#8594;*NO and subsequent protonation to generate *NH2 intermediate, which in situ acts as a localized proton donor to promote *CO2&#8594;*COOH on adjacent Ce3+&#8211;O site for generating *CO intermediate, following by cross&#8208;coupling of the reduced C&#8208;/N&#8208;intermediates to achieve efficient urea electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and NO3&#8722; to synthesize urea has become an effective pathway to alternate the conventional Bosch&#8208;Meiser process, while the complexity of C&#8208;/N&#8208;containing intermediates for C&#8722;N coupling results in the urea electrosynthesis of unsatisfactory efficiency. In this work, an electronic spin state modulation maneuver with oxygen vacancies (Ov) is unveiled to effectively meliorate the oriented generation of key intermediates *NH2 and *CO for C&#8722;N coupling, furnishing urea in ultrahigh yield of 2175.47&#160;&#181;g mg&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and Faraday efficiency of 70.1%. Mechanistic studies expound that Ov can induce the conversion of the high&#8208;spin state Ni2+ (t2g6eg2) of Ni@CeO2&#8722;x to the low&#8208;spin state Ni3+ (t2g6eg1), which markedly enhances the hybridization degree of the Ni 3d and the N 2p orbitals of *NO, facilitating the selective formation of *NH2. Notably, the in situ generated *NH2 intermediates can serve as a localized proton donor to promote the electroreduction of CO2 on the adjacent site Ce3+&#8722;O to exclusively afford *CO, followed by C&#8722;N coupling of each other to efficiently synthesize urea. The strategy of tailored switching of the active site spin state provides a reliable reference to rectify the electronic structure of electrocatalysts for directional CO2 valorization.

         <title>Engineering EVs&#8208;Mediated mRNA Delivery Regulates Microglia Function and Alleviates Depressive&#8208;Like Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual delivery system employing extracellular vesicles to mediate the co&#8208;delivery of mRNA and nanozymes exhibits synergistic effects on endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial injury, and their functional crosstalk. This system is capable of regulating microglia function from many aspects, including inhibiting NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling pathway, inhibiting microglia overactivation, and promoting microglia M2 polarization, and ultimately ameliorates depressive behaviors.









Abstract
The development of new non&#8208;neurotransmitter drugs is an important supplement to the clinical treatment of major depressive disorder. The latest development of mRNA therapy provides the possibility for the treatment of some major diseases. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria constitute a highly interconnected set of fundamental organelles within cells. The interconnection between them forms specific microdomains that play pivotal roles in calcium signaling, mitochondrial dynamics, inflammation, and autophagy. Perturbations in ER&#8208;mitochondrial connections may contribute to the progression of neurological disorders and other diseases. Herein, an extracellular vesicles&#8208;based delivery system, grounded in mRNA gene therapy and integrated with nanomedicine technology is devised. This system is engineered to traverse the blood&#8211;brain barrier and specifically target the central nervous system (CNS), facilitating the simultaneous delivery of mRNA drugs and metallic nanozymes into the brain. This dual&#8208;pronged approach, targeting ER and mitochondrial crosstalk, inhibits microglial overactivation, promotes M2 polarization of microglia, and suppresses the NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling pathway. Consequently, it significantly alleviates Lipopolysaccharides&#8208;induced neuroinflammatory responses and ameliorates anxiety&#8208; and depression&#8208;like behaviors. This study demonstrates a novel antidepressant therapeutic strategy and establishes a new paradigm for mRNA gene therapy in CNS diseases.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Biomass Oxidation via Acid&#8208;Induced In Situ Surface Reconstruction of Multivalent State Coexistence in Metal Foams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical biomass conversion offers a sustainable alternative to conventional chemical processes. This study introduces a novel acid&#8208;induced in situ surface reconstruction strategy on metal foams, enabling efficient biomass transformation. The approach is versatile, adaptable across metals and acids, and provides a scalable platform for green chemistry, demonstrating significant potential for advancing resource recycling and sustainable industrial applications.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic biomass conversion offers a sustainable route for producing organic chemicals, with electrode design being critical to determining reaction rate and selectivity. Herein, a prediction&#8208;synthesis&#8208;validation approach is developed to obtain electrodes for precise biomass conversion, where the coexistence of multiple metal valence states leads to excellent electrocatalytic performance due to the activated redox cycle. This promising integrated foam electrode is developed via acid&#8208;induced surface reconstruction to in situ generate highly active metal (oxy)hydroxide or oxide (MOxHy or MOx) species&#160;on inert foam electrodes, facilitating the electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (5&#8208;HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Taking nickel foam electrode as an example, the resulting NiOxHy/Ni catalyst, featuring the coexistence of multivalent states of Ni, exhibits remarkable activity and stability with a FDCA yields over 95% and a Faradaic efficiency of 99%. In situ Raman spectroscopy and theoretical analysis reveal an Ni(OH)2/NiOOH&#8208;mediated indirect pathway, with the chemical oxidation of 5&#8208;HMF as the rate&#8208;limiting step. Furthermore, this in situ surface reconstruction approach can be extended to various metal foams (Fe, Cu, FeNi, and NiMo), offering a mild, scalable, and cost&#8208;effective method for preparing potent foam catalysts. This approach promotes a circular economy by enabling more efficient biomass conversion processes, providing a versatile and impactful tool in the field of sustainable catalysis.

         <title>Bioinspired Smart Triboelectric Soft Pneumatic Actuator&#8208;Enabled Hand Rehabilitation Robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative, lobster tail&#8208;inspired triboelectric soft pneumatic actuator (TENG&#8208;SPA) is introduced, featuring self&#8208;powered sensing capabilities. Leveraging these features, a smart TENG&#8208;SPA&#8208;enabled hand rehabilitation robot is developed, showing great promise in replacing the traditional assessment method&#8212;which relies on clinicians for manual stretching, subjective resistance evaluation, and experience&#8208;based scoring&#8212;thereby driving the transformation from traditional rehabilitation medicine to modern digital rehabilitation medicine.









Abstract
Quantitative assessment for post&#8208;stroke spasticity remains a significant challenge due to the encountered variable resistance during passive stretching, which can lead to the widely used modified Ashworth scale (MAS) for spasticity assessment depending heavily on rehabilitation physicians. To address these challenges, a high&#8208;force&#8208;output triboelectric soft pneumatic actuator&#160;(TENG&#8208;SPA) inspired by a lobster tail is developed. The bioinspired TENG&#8208;SPA can generate approximately 20 N at 0.1&#160;MPa, providing sufficient stretching force for spastic fingers. The anti&#8208;interference, durability, and electrical output characteristics of the TENG&#8208;SPA under varying conditions&#8212;such as different air pressures, bending frequencies, and simulated spastic finger stretching&#8212;are explored, demonstrating TENG&#8208;SPA's ability to sense resistance during the stretching process. Furthermore, a TENG&#8208;SPA&#8208;enabled hand rehabilitation robot system integrated with the convolutional neural network (CNN) is further developed, which is tested in a clinical trial involving 15 stroke patients. The results have demonstrated that a classification accuracy for the levels of finger spasticity reaches 93.3% and the MAS scores predicted by the CNN regression model exhibit a strong linear relationship with the actual MAS (R2 = 0.8451, p &lt;&#160;0.01). This study presents promising potential applications in digital rehabilitation medicine, human&#8211;machine interaction, biomedicine, and related fields.

         <title>Engineering Highly Aligned and Densely Populated Cardiac Muscle Bundles via Fibrin Remodeling in 3D&#8208;Printed Anisotropic Microfibrous Lattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the development of 3D&#8208;printed anisotropic InterPore microfibrous lattices for engineering aligned and densely populated cardiac muscle bundles. By promoting cardiomyocyte alignment and facilitating cell&#8208;mediated remodeling in these lattices, the approach improves high&#8208;density tissue organization, enhances electrophysiological function, and supports the maturation of cardiac tissues.








Abstract
Replicating the structural and functional features of native myocardium, particularly its high&#8208;density cellular alignment and efficient electrical connectivity, is essential for engineering functional cardiac tissues. Here, novel electrohydrodynamically printed InterPore microfibrous lattices with anisotropic architectures are introduced to promote high&#8208;density cellular alignment and enhanced tissue interconnectivity. The interconnected pores in the microfibrous lattice enable dynamic, cell&#8208;mediated remodeling of fibrous hydrogels, resulting in continuous, mechanically stable tissue bundles. Compared to lattices with isolated pores, the engineered aligned cardiac tissues from neonatal rat cardiomyocytes exhibit improved electrophysiological properties and synchronous contractions. Using a multiseeding strategy, an equivalent cell seeding density of 8 &#215; 107 cells&#160;mL&#8722;1, facilitating the formation of multicellular, vascularized cardiac structures with maintained tissue viability and integrity, is achieved. As a demonstration, human&#8208;induced pluripotent stem cell&#8208;derived cardiac tissues are engineered with progressive maturation and functional integration over time. These findings underscore the potential of InterPore microfibrous lattices for applications in cardiac tissue engineering, drug discovery, and therapeutic development.

         <title>Dynamic Reconstruction of Fluid Interface Manipulated by Fluid Balancing Agent for Scalable Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methanol (MeOH) is introduced as a fluid balance agent to regulate Marangoni convection, thereby mitigating disordered colloidal particle motion. As a result, record power conversion efficiencies of 24.45% and 20.32% are achieved for small&#8208;area FAPbI3 devices (0.07&#160;cm2) and large&#8208;area modules (21&#160;cm2), respectively.








Abstract
Laboratory&#8208;scale spin&#8208;coating techniques are widely employed for fabricating small&#8208;size, high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells. However, achieving large&#8208;area, high&#8208;uniformity perovskite films and thus high&#8208;efficiency solar cell devices remain challenging due to the complex fluid dynamics and drying behaviors of perovskite precursor solutions during large&#8208;area fabrication processes. In this work, a high&#8208;quality, pinhole&#8208;free, large&#8208;area FAPbI3 perovskite film is successfully obtained via scalable blade&#8208;coating technology, assisted by a novel bidirectional Marangoni convection strategy. By incorporating methanol (MeOH) as a fluid balance agent, the direction of Marangoni convection is effectively regulated, mitigating the disordered motion of colloidal precursor particles during the printing process. As a result, champion power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.45% and 20.32% are achieved for small&#8208;area FAPbI3 devices (0.07&#160;cm2) and large&#8208;area modules (21&#160;cm2), respectively. Notably, under steady illumination, the device reached a stabilized PCE of 24.28%.

To demonstrate the universality of this strategy, a blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diode is fabricated, showing an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 14.78% and an electroluminescence wavelength (EL) of 494&#160;nm.

&lt;p&gt;Methanol (MeOH) is introduced as a fluid balance agent to regulate Marangoni convection, thereby mitigating disordered colloidal particle motion. As a result, record power conversion efficiencies of 24.45% and 20.32% are achieved for small-area FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; devices (0.07&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and large-area modules (21&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laboratory-scale spin-coating techniques are widely employed for fabricating small-size, high-efficiency perovskite solar cells. However, achieving large-area, high-uniformity perovskite films and thus high-efficiency solar cell devices remain challenging due to the complex fluid dynamics and drying behaviors of perovskite precursor solutions during large-area fabrication processes. In this work, a high-quality, pinhole-free, large-area FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite film is successfully obtained via scalable blade-coating technology, assisted by a novel bidirectional Marangoni convection strategy. By incorporating methanol (MeOH) as a fluid balance agent, the direction of Marangoni convection is effectively regulated, mitigating the disordered motion of colloidal precursor particles during the printing process. As a result, champion power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.45% and 20.32% are achieved for small-area FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; devices (0.07&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and large-area modules (21&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively. Notably, under steady illumination, the device reached a stabilized PCE of 24.28%. Furthermore, the unencapsulated device exhibited remarkable operational stability, retaining 92.03% of its initial PCE after 1800&#160;h under ambient conditions (35&#160;&#177;&#160;5% relative humidity, 30&#160;&#176;C). To demonstrate the universality of this strategy, a blue perovskite light-emitting diode is fabricated, showing an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 14.78% and an electroluminescence wavelength (EL) of 494&#160;nm. This work provides a significant technique for advancing solution-processed, industrial-scale production of high-quality and stable perovskite films and solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sole&#8208;Solvent High&#8208;Entropy Electrolyte Realizes Wide&#8208;Temperature and High&#8208;Voltage Practical Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Pouch Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A sole&#8208;solvent high&#8208;entropy electrolyte is capable of forming stable anion&#8208;derived electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphases, extending the temperature extremes of the battery. Consequently, high&#8208;voltage anode&#8208;free sodium batteries with cycling ability in a wide temperature range (&#8722;20&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C) are realized. Furthermore, Ah&#8208;level pouch cell delivers a leadingly high energy density (209 Wh kg&#8722;1) and a high capacity retention (83.1%) after 100 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium batteries (AFSBs) hold great promise for high&#8208;density energy storage. However, high&#8208;voltage AFSBs, especially those can stably cycle at a wide temperature range are challenging due to the poor electrolyte compatibility toward both the cathode and anode. Herein, high&#8208;voltage AFSBs with cycling ability in a wide temperature range (&#8722;20&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C) are realized for the first time via a sole&#8208;solvent high&#8208;entropy electrolyte based on the diethylene glycol dibutyl ether solvent (D2) and NaPF6 salt. The sole&#8208;solvent high&#8208;entropy electrolyte with unique solvent&#8208;ions effect of strong anion interaction and weak cation solvation enables entropy&#8208;driven electrolyte salt disassociation and high&#8208;concentration contact ion pairs, thus simultaneously forming stable anion&#8208;derived electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphases on cathode and anode. Moreover, the wide liquid range of D2 further extends the temperature extremes of the battery. Consequently, ampere&#8208;hour (Ah)&#8208;level anode&#8208;free sodium pouch cells with cyclability in a wide temperature range of &#8722;20&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C are realized. Impressively, the pouch cell achieves a leadingly high cell&#8208;level energy density of 209&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and a high capacity retention of 83.1% after 100 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C. This work provides inspirations for designing advanced electrolytes for practical AFSBs.

         <title>U&#8208;Shaped Dimeric Acceptors for Balancing Efficiency and Stability in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
U&#8208;shaped dimeric acceptors, 5&#8208;IDT and 6&#8208;IDT, are introduced into the binary OSCs as a third component. The efficiencies of 6&#8208;IDT&#8211; and 5&#8208;IDT&#8208;treated OSCs are significantly improved to 19.32% and 19.96%, respectively. Moreover, the smaller molecular length of 5&#8208;IDT can well stabilize the phase&#8208;separated morphology of the active layer, thereby significantly improving the thermal stability.








Abstract
Despite significant improvements in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs), achieving excellent stability remains a great challenge to their commercial feasibility. Here, U&#8208;shaped dimeric acceptors (5&#8208;IDT and 6&#8208;IDT) with different molecular lengths are introduced into the binary OSCs as a third component, respectively. The introduction of the third component effectively reduces the energetic disorder and non&#8208;radiative voltage losses and improves the exciton dissociation and charge transport of the devices. Consequently, the PCEs of the 6&#8208;IDT&#8208; and 5&#8208;IDT&#8208;treated OSCs are significantly improved to 19.32% and 19.96%, respectively, which is the highest PCE for oligomeric acceptors&#8208;based ternary OSCs to date. Meanwhile, the thermal stability of the treated devices is dramatically improved, with the initial efficiency retention of the 6&#8208;IDT&#8208; and 5&#8208;IDT&#8208;treated devices increasing from 18% to 32% and 75%, respectively, after 1000&#160;h of thermal stress. This is mainly attributed to the ability of the smaller molecular length of 5&#8208;IDT to stabilize the phase&#8208;separated morphology of the polymeric donor and small molecular acceptor, rather than the high glass transition temperature and low diffusion coefficient.

         <title>Supramolecular Scale Hydrophilicity Regulation Enabling Efficient Dewatering and Assembly of Nanocellulose into Dense and Strong Bulk Materials as Sustainable Plastic Substitutes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dewatering difficulty of nanocellulose dispersion has long been a major challenge hindering its practical utilization. Here, through a supramolecular scale hydrophilicity regulation, the water retention value is substantially decreased and efficient dewatering of cellulose nanofibers (CNF) dispersion is realized, enabling the fabrication of highly dense, strong, fire&#8208;retardant, and moldable CNF bulk materials as sustainable plastic substitutes.








Abstract
Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are ideal building blocks for creating lightweight and strong bulk structural materials due to their unique supramolecular structure and exceptional mechanical properties within the crystalline regions. However, assembling CNFs into dense bulk structural materials with customizable shape and functionalities remains a great challenge, hindering their practical applications. Here, the dewatering issue of aqueous CNF dispersions is addressed by regulating supramolecular scale hydrophilicity using lactic acid, combined with hot&#8208;press molding. This approach enables the fabrication of transparent CNF bulk structural materials with a density of up to 1.426&#160;g cm&#8722;3. The mechanical properties, including isotropic in&#8208;plane tensile strength (75.5 &#177; 4.5&#160;MPa), flexural strength (198 &#177; 20&#160;MPa), and hardness (&#8776;300&#160;MPa), surpass most engineering plastics. Moreover, unlike conventional CNF based materials, the CNF bulk structural materials exhibit remarkable water stability and flame retardancy. These unique advantages open a new avenue to bottom&#8208;up assembly of CNFs into high&#8208;performance multifunctional eco&#8208;friendly structural materials, dedicating to substitution of plastics and easing the consumption of petrochemical resources.

This approach enables optimal adsorption and desorption of various intermediates in the multi&#8208;step NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion, effectively overcoming energy&#8208;scaling limitations for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis.








Abstract
Electrochemically converting nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) is a complex process involving an eight&#8208;electron transfer and numerous intermediates, presenting a significant challenge for optimization. A multi&#8208;elemental synergy strategy to regulate the local electronic structure at the atomic level is proposed, creating a broad adsorption energy landscape in high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) catalysts. This approach enables optimal adsorption and desorption of various intermediates, effectively overcoming energy&#8208;scaling limitations for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis. The HEA catalyst achieved a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.5&#160;&#177;&#160;4.3% and a yield rate of 10.2&#160;&#177;&#160;0.5&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1. It also demonstrated remarkable stability over 250 h in an integrated three&#8208;chamber device, coupling electrocatalysis with an ammonia recovery unit for continuous NH3 collection. This work elucidates the catalytic mechanisms of multi&#8208;functional HEA systems and offers new perspectives for optimizing multi&#8208;step reactions by circumventing adsorption&#8208;energy scaling limitations.

         <title>Development of Marine&#8208;Degradable Poly(Ester Amide)s with Strong, Up&#8208;Scalable, and Up&#8208;Cyclable Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for fabricating poly(ester amide)s combines the benefits of biodegradable polyesters and strong polyamides. These materials, made from upcycled monomers, form films, and yarns with a tensile strength of 109 MPa, tenacity of 5.0 g de&#8722;1, and withstand ironing temperatures. They achieve 92% marine biodegradability in 12 months and have a low environmental impact.








Abstract
Biodegradable polyesters provide an attractive alternative to non&#8208;degradable plastics but often encounter a tradeoff between biodegradability and mechanical properties because esters are rotational and lack hydrogen bonds. Conversely, natural polyamides, i.e., silk exhibit excellent mechanical strength because amides are non&#8208;rotational and form hydrogen bonds. Unlike esters, the nitrogen in amides can enhance microbial biodegradation. However, protein engineering exhibits limited productivity, and artificial polyamides, i.e., nylon remain non&#8208;degradable due to their hydrophobic nature. Herein, a method is proposed for developing poly(ester amide)s (PEA)s, a polyester and polyamide hybrid, to address prevailing production challenges. These materials are synthesized from upcycled monomers in a 10 L reactor and converted into films and yarns. They achieve a tensile strength of 109 MPa and tenacity of 5.0 g de&#8722;1, while withstanding ironing temperatures. They achieve a remarkable 92% marine biodegradability in 12 months, which is rarely attained by current bioplastics, and exhibit low environmental impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. While biodegradable polyesters have remained within the performance range of commodity plastics, PEAs fall into the high&#8208;performance category, potentially reaching markets that existing biodegradable plastics have not, such as fishing lines and clothing.

         <title>Surface Modification of 3D Biomimetic Shark Denticle Structures for Drag Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic shark denticles with alternating superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic regions are fabricated through 3D printing. Superhydrophobic and partially superhydrophobic denticles exhibit superior drag reduction performance compared to superhydrophilic ones by minimizing vortex formation, presenting a novel approach to the biomimetic design of shark denticles for optimal drag reduction.








Abstract
Shark skin features superhydrophilic and riblet&#8208;textured denticles that provide drag reduction, antifouling, and mechanical protection. The artificial riblet structures exhibit drag reduction capabilities in turbulent flow. However, the effects of the surface wettability of shark denticles and the cavity region underneath the denticle crown on drag reduction remain insufficiently explored. Here, 3D printing is utilized to fabricate realistic staggered and overlapped denticle arrays, modified to achieve superhydrophilic, superhydrophobic, and hybrid configurations, including external riblets hydrophilic/internal cavities hydrophobic (ELIB), and vice versa (EBIL). Denticles of varying heights are also fabricated. The results indicate that superhydrophobic, ELIB, and EBIL denticles outperform superhydrophilic ones in reducing drag, achieving a peak drag reduction rate of &#8776;20%. Notably, shorter denticles further improve drag reduction. Reduced vortex formation within the underneath cavity correlates with improved drag reduction. These vortices can function similarly to rolling bearings while facilitating momentum exchange and increasing skin friction drag. Superhydrophobic or partially superhydrophobic denticles (ELIBD/EBILD) mitigate this effect. This study suggests that sharks may secrete mucus on specific sections of their denticles to further reduce vorticity and drag, offering novel insights into the biomimetic design of shark denticles for optimized drag reduction.

         <title>Boosting Amino Acid Synthesis with WOx Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 9, March 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adjusting the size of tungsten oxide cluster through carbon defects, sub&#8208;nanoclusters are applied to electrocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling for amino acid synthesis. Unlike nanoclusters, sub&#8208;nanoclusters facilitate potential tuning to optimize hydroxylamine yield, enabling the production of diverse amino acids with &#945;&#8208;keto acids. This study offers an innovative perspective for catalyst design in high&#8208;value electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The conversion of nitrate&#8208;rich wastewater and biomass&#8208;derived blocks into high&#8208;value products using renewably generated electricity is a promising approach to modulate the artificial carbon and nitrogen cycle. Here, a new synthetic strategy of WOx sub&#8208;nanoclusters is reported and supported on carbon materials as novel efficient electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction and its coupling with &#945;&#8208;keto acids. In acidic solutions, the NH3&#8208;NH2OH selectivity can also optimized by adjusting the potential, with the total FE exceeding 80% over a wide potential range. After introducing &#945;&#8208;keto acids, the WOx/D&#8208;CB electrode achieves remarkable activity and selectivity toward C2&#8208;C6 amino acids. For glycine and alanine, impressive FEs of 49.34% and 38.22% based on transitional metal oxides can be obtained, surpassing those of WOx nanoclusters with larger size. In situ analysis and mechanistic studies reveal the critical role of WOx sub&#8208;nanoclusters in reducing the energy barriers of key steps in alanine synthesis. This work opens up new insights into the rational design of cluster catalysts to promote electrochemical amino acid synthesis.

         <title>Hydration Induces Dehydration: Creating Negative Swelling Gel by a Paradox</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negative swelling of hydrogel is achieved via a paradoxical hydration&#8208;induced&#8208;dehydration pathway. Chemically crosslinked polymer network generates considerable hydrostatic pressure upon swelling, which forces transformable polymers to self&#8208;assemble and collapse. The as&#8208;fabricated gels can lose 35% weight underwater and exhibit water&#8208;strengthened mechanical properties, enhanced structural responsiveness, underwater repair ability, resistance to deformation, and swelling turn&#8208;off effect, which significantly broadened potential applications.









Abstract
Swelling positively in water is a common behavior of hydrogels, which, however, can lead to reduced mechanical performance and stability. Enabling negative swelling represents a promising way to address those issues but is extremely challenging to realize. Here, real negative swelling hydrogels are successfully prepared for the first time through a unique molecular architecture. Specifically designed interpenetrating transformable&#8208;rigid polymer network undergoes self&#8208;assembly and collapses upon hydration, which in turn dehydrates itself. This paradoxical hydration&#8208;induced&#8208;dehydration process brings about revolutionary outcomes. Gels can now lose up to 35% weight underwater and exhibit water&#8208;strengthened mechanical properties, enhanced structural responsiveness, underwater repair ability, resistance to deformation, and swelling turn&#8208;off effect. Those unique properties allow future material development and applications to be carried out in much broader dimensions.

Those unique properties allow future material development and applications to be carried out in much broader dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

It paves the way for researchers and engineers seeking to develop safer, more reliable energy&#8208;harvesting technologies.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have gained significant attention for ability to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. As the applications of TENG devices expand, their safety and reliability becomes priority, particularly where there is risk of fire or spontaneous combustion. Flame&#8208;retardant materials can be employed to address these safety concerns without compromising the performance and efficiency of TENGs. The primary focus of this review is on flame&#8208;retardant materials, including polymers, biomaterials, liquid polymers, aerogels, and carbon&#8208;based materials. The fundamental properties of these materials for TENG applications are elucidated. The characteristics of each material type are described, along with their potential to boost the safety and performance of TENGs. The importance of flame retardancy in advancing TENG technology can be projected from its usage in wearable electronics, self&#8208;powered sensors, and smart textiles. Current challenges such as material compatibility, fabrication complexity, and environmental concerns are addressed, along with proposed strategies for overcoming them. This review underscores the significance of flame&#8208;retardant materials in strengthening the functionality and safety of TENG devices, paving the way for their widespread adoption across various industries. &#160;

         <title>Negative&#8208;Valent Platinum Stabilized by Pt&#9472;Ni Electron Bridges on Oxygen&#8208;Deficient NiFe&#8208;LDH for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Pt anchored in oxygen&#8208;deficient NiFe&#8208;LDH via Pt&#9472;Ni bonds reduces Pt's valence state, enhancing hydrogen evolution reaction performance. Oxygen vacancies facilitate electron transfer, while elevated Ni valence boosts hydrophilicity and lowers hydrolysis barriers. The catalyst achieves ultra&#8208;low overpotentials and significantly higher mass activity compared to Pt/C, showcasing a novel coordination design strategy.








Abstract
The unique hydrogen adsorption characteristics of negatively charged platinum play a crucial role in enhancing the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. However, atomically dispersed Pt atoms are typically anchored to the support through non&#8208;metallic atom bonds, resulting in a high oxidation state. Here, atomically dispersed Pt atoms are anchored in oxygen&#8208;deficient NiFe&#8208;LDH. Electron transfer between Pt and NiFe&#8208;LDH occurs primarily through Pt&#9472;Ni bonds rather than the conventional Pt&#9472;O bonds. Oxygen vacancies in the NiFe&#8208;LDH promote additional electron transfer from Ni to Pt, thereby reducing the valence state of Pt and enhancing hydrogen adsorption. Meanwhile, the elevated valence state of Ni increases the catalyst's hydrophilicity and reduces the energy barrier for hydrolysis dissociation. This catalyst demonstrates remarkably low overpotentials of 4 and 9&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1&#160;m KOH and 1&#160;m KPi, respectively. Additionally, its mass activity is 51.5 and 23.7 times higher that of Pt/C, respectively. This study presents a novel strategy for enhancing electrocatalytic performance through the rational design of coordination environments and electronic structures in supported metal catalysts.

         <title>Lean&#8208;Water Hydrogel with Multipolar Sites for Flexible and High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Aluminum Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a novel inorganic/organic hybrid hydrogel electrolyte is prepared via in situ sol&#8208;gel polymerization. A high ion conductivity is achieved even under a lean&#8208;water condition. Abundant polar functional groupstend to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, thereby reducing the hydrogen evolution reaction. This hydrogel electrolyte exhibits excellent performance in both symmetrical Al batteries and full batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous aluminum ion batteries (AAIBs) offer a promising avenue for achieving safe, high&#8208;energy, and low&#8208;cost large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. However, the practical development of AAIBs is hindered by competitive reduction reactions in the aqueous solution, which lead to insufficient aluminum (Al) deposition and a severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HRE). In this work, an inorganic/organic hybrid hydrogel with a stable silicon&#8208;based network and multiple polar sites is successfully fabricated via an in situ sol&#8208;gel polymerization method. The preferential formation of hydrogen bonds between the polar functional groups and water molecules effectively reduces the thermodynamic reactivity of water. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS) analyses confirm the formation of a stable, inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, which kinetically suppresses undesirable side reactions. This hydrogel electrolyte exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 2.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C, even under lean&#8208;water conditions. As a result, Al|hydrogel|potassium nickel hexacyanoferrate (KNHCF) full cells demonstrate excellent cycling performance, delivering a high initial discharge capacity of 74.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 mA g&#8722;1 and achieving an outstanding capacity retention of 90.0% after 200 cycles. Additionally, pouch cells exhibit stable open&#8208;circuit voltage under various mechanical abuse conditions.

         <title>Critical Ingredients Revitalize Magnesium&#8208;Metal Batteries: Rationality and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Critical ingredients can revitalize magnesium&#8208;metal anode in conventional electrolytes. Mechanistic insights, with an emphasis on Mg&#8208;ion solvation structure regulation, interfacial evolution, solvent ionization, and weak interfacial passivation, have been especially underscored in terms of the close relationship between electrolyte chemistries and weakly&#8208;passivated interphase properties.









Abstract
Multivalent&#8208;metal batteries hold tremendous promise in solving safety and sustainability problems encountered by common lithium&#8208;ion batteries, but the lack of ideal electrolyte solutions restricts their large&#8208;scale adoption. Tuning electrolyte structures with functional ingredients, especially amines/methoxy&#8208;based amines and phosphates, can revitalize multivalent&#8208;metal anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes in conventional electrolytes, unlocking their full potential. However, a rational and clear understanding of the implications of these ingredients, notwithstanding critically important to commercially available electrolyte design, has not been widely accepted. This concise perspective aims to provide timely analysis and discussion on ingredients&#8217; functionalities of solvation shell speciation, interphase evolution, and consequently metal plating/stripping kinetics acceleration. In addition to prevailing coordination interactions, fresh understandings of intermolecular ionization/association and unique interphase formation are underscored by the close relationship between electrolyte chemistries and weakly passivated interphase properties. The existing understandings and proposed outlooks are expected to promote the next breakthroughs for rechargeable multivalent&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Xantphos&#8211;Cu&#8208;Decorated Covalent Organic Frameworks for C&#9472;H Arylation through Sensitized Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of a tetrahedral Cu(I) single site into the bipyridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) is shown to effectively drive photocatalytic carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation through simultaneous energy and electron transfer pathways. The COF&#8208;based photocatalyst demonstrates efficient and durable performance for the preparation of a series of oxindole and isoindolinones.








Abstract
The isoindolinone scaffold is an important structural motif found in a wide range of naturally occurring and synthetic biologically active compounds. However, the synthesis of isoindolinone derivatives typically requires multi&#8208;step procedures or the use of palladium&#8208;based catalysts, which are often hampered by low reaction yields and high costs. Recently, covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8212;emerging crystalline and porous materials&#8212;have gained considerable attention for their applications in various organic transformations, particularly in C&#9472;H functionalization, cross&#8208;coupling and redox reactions. Although COFs have been extensively studied for photocatalysis, the development of sustainable heterogeneous catalysts using low&#8208;cost transition metal&#8208;based photosensitizers is still in its early stages. Herein, a strategy is presented to incorporate a copper&#8208;Xantphos complex with a tetrahedral Cu(I) geometry into a crystalline and porous COF matrix. This modification enables unprecedented simultaneous electron and energy transfer efficiency during photocatalysis. The Cu&#8211;Xantphos coordinated COF exhibits potent photocatalytic activity for the synthesis of isoindolinone derivatives via C&#9472;Br and C&#9472;H bond cleavage followed by C&#9472;C bond formation.

&lt;p&gt;The incorporation of a tetrahedral Cu(I) single site into the bipyridine-based covalent organic framework (COF) is shown to effectively drive photocatalytic carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation through simultaneous energy and electron transfer pathways. The COF-based photocatalyst demonstrates efficient and durable performance for the preparation of a series of oxindole and isoindolinones.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The isoindolinone scaffold is an important structural motif found in a wide range of naturally occurring and synthetic biologically active compounds. However, the synthesis of isoindolinone derivatives typically requires multi-step procedures or the use of palladium-based catalysts, which are often hampered by low reaction yields and high costs. Recently, covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8212;emerging crystalline and porous materials&#8212;have gained considerable attention for their applications in various organic transformations, particularly in C&#9472;H functionalization, cross-coupling and redox reactions. Although COFs have been extensively studied for photocatalysis, the development of sustainable heterogeneous catalysts using low-cost transition metal-based photosensitizers is still in its early stages. Herein, a strategy is presented to incorporate a copper-Xantphos complex with a tetrahedral Cu(I) geometry into a crystalline and porous COF matrix. This modification enables unprecedented simultaneous electron and energy transfer efficiency during photocatalysis. The Cu&#8211;Xantphos coordinated COF exhibits potent photocatalytic activity for the synthesis of isoindolinone derivatives via C&#9472;Br and C&#9472;H bond cleavage followed by C&#9472;C bond formation. In addition, the catalyst shows excellent recyclability as it can be rejuvenated by reintroducing the Cu&#8211;Xantphos complex after multiple photocatalytic cycles&#8212;highlighting its potential as a sustainable and cost-effective solution for valuable organic transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Frozen by Heating: Temperature Controlled Dynamic States in Droplet Microswimmers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the design of smart materials based on active agents or microswimmers, the gaits or motile states of the agents are to be controlled, preferably by external parameters that do not require modifying the composition of the system. A facile, universal parameter is temperature. Here, in the experimental model system of self&#8208;propelling active emulsions, a temperature sensitive mixture of co&#8208;surfactants is used as fuel for propulsion. It is demonstrated that three distinct states of reorienting, then straight motion, and subsequent arrest, can be accessed, counterintuitively, with increasing temperature.








Abstract
Self&#8208;propelling active matter relies on the conversion of energy from the undirected, nanoscopic scale to directed, macroscopic motion. One of the challenges in the design of synthetic active matter lies in the control of dynamic states, or motility gaits. Here, an experimental system of self&#8208;propelling droplets with thermally controllable and reversible dynamic states is presented, from unsteady over meandering to persistent to arrested motion. These states are known to depend on the P&#233;clet number of the molecular process powering the motion, which can now be tuned by using a temperature sensitive mixture of surfactants as propulsion fuel. The droplet dynamics are quantified by analyzing flow and chemical fields for the individual states, comparing them to canonical models for autophoretic particles. In the context of these models, in situ, the fundamental first broken symmetry that translates an isotropic, immotile base state to self&#8208;propelled&#160;motility, is experimentally demonstrated.

         <title>Colored Radiative Cooling: from Photonic Approaches to Fluorescent Colors and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colored radiative cooling (CRC) has become a prevailing technology for achieving colorful appearance and simultaneously enhancing the effective solar reflectance of cooling coatings. This review presents recent advancements in CRC and its profound impact on energy savings in real&#8208;world applications. After introducing the fundamentals of CRC and color characterization methods, it reviews CRC coloration approaches, including photonic structural colors, complementary color absorption and Purcell&#8208;enhanced fluorescent colors. The review concludes with self&#8208;adaptive CRC materials featuring dynamic optical modulation and their potentially practical applications as well as critical challenges.









Abstract
Radiative cooling technology is gaining prominence as a sustainable solution for improving thermal comfort and reducing energy consumption associated with cooling demands. To meet diverse functional requirements such as aesthetics, switchable cooling, camouflage, and colored smart windows, color is often preferred over a white opaque appearance in the design of radiative cooling materials. Colored radiative cooling (CRC) has emerged as a prevailing technology not only for achieving a colorful appearance but also for increasing the effective solar reflectance to enhance cooling performance (through the incorporation of fluorescent materials). This paper reviews recent advancements in CRC and its profound impact on energy savings and real&#8208;world applications. After introducing the fundamentals of CRC and color characterization, various photonic approaches are explored that leverage resonant structures to achieve coloration in radiative cooling, comparing them with conventional coloration methods based on optical materials like fluorescent pigments that can convert absorbed ultraviolet light into visible&#8208;light emission. Furthermore, the review delves into self&#8208;adaptive CRC materials featuring dynamic optical modulation that responds to temperature fluctuations. Lastly, the potential application of CRC materials is assessed, a comprehensive outlook on their future development is offered, and the critical challenges in practical applications are discussed.

         <title>Heterostructured Electrocatalysts: from Fundamental Microkinetic Model to Electron Configuration and Interfacial Reactive Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterostructures have emerged as advanced electrocatalysts to convert earth&#8208;abundant simple molecules into high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. On the basis of atomistic understanding to accelerate the electrochemical processes, the architecture of heterostructured electrocatalysts is comprehensively discussed from the point of view of modulating electronic configuration and interface reactive microenvironment. The influence of rectification, space charge region, built&#8208;in electric field, synergistic interactions, lattice strain, and geometric effect is considered.








Abstract
Electrocatalysts can efficiently convert earth&#8208;abundant simple molecules into high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. In this context, heterostructures, which are largely determined by the interface, have emerged as a pivotal architecture for enhancing the activity of electrocatalysts. In this review, the atomistic understanding of heterostructured electrocatalysts is considered, focusing on the reaction kinetic rate and electron configuration, gained from both empirical studies and theoretical models. We start from the fundamentals of the microkinetic model, adsorption energy theory, and electric double layer model. The importance of heterostructures to accelerate electrochemical processes via modulating electron configuration and interfacial reactive microenvironment is highlighted, by considering rectification, space charge region, built&#8208;in electric field, synergistic interactions, lattice strain, and geometric effect. We conclude this review by summarizing the challenges and perspectives in the field of heterostructured electrocatalysts, such as the determination of transition state energy, their dynamic evolution, refinement of the theoretical approaches, and the use of machine learning.

         <title>Towards Stable Metal&#8211;I2 Battery: Design of Iodine&#8211;Containing Functional Groups for Enhanced Halogen Bond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A halogen bond (XB)&#8208;enhanced strategy is proposed, where &#9472;B(OH)I3 groups are incorporated into a highly integrated porous carbon/I2 cathode (HOCF&#8211;BIn) to extend interactions between &#9472;B(OH)I3 and subsequent I2 molecules. The strong intermolecular forces in HOCF&#8211;BIn cathodes significantly enhance I2/I3&#8722;/I&#8722; confinement, enabling exceptional cycling stability at I2 loadings of 1.8&#8211;6.2 mg cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The redox chemistries of iodine have attracted tremendous attention for charge storage owing to their high theoretical specific capacity and natural abundance. However, the practical capacity and cycle life are greatly limited by the active mass loss originating from the dissolved iodine species in either non&#8208;aqueous or aqueous batteries. Despite intensive progress in physical and physicochemical confinements of iodine species (I2/I3&#8722;/I&#8722;), less attention has been paid to confining iodine species beyond the host&#8211;iodine interface, inhibiting further development of iodine cathodes with high I2 contents. Here a halogen bond (XB)&#8211; enhanced design concept is proposed between I2 molecules to achieve stable cycling performances, as exemplified by the Na&#8211;I2 battery. The enhanced XB is derived from the incorporation of &#8211;B(OH)I3 groups in highly integrated porous carbon/I2 cathode (HOCF&#8211;BIn), which can generate extended interactions between &#8211;B(OH)I3 and following I2 molecules. Due to the strong intermolecular force between I2 molecules, the HOCF&#8211;BIn cathodes exhibit substantially strengthened I2/I3&#8722;/I&#8722; confinement, enabling outstanding cycling stability at I2 loading ranging from 1.8 to 6.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. This findings demonstrate a functional group to manipulate XB chemistry within I2 molecules and polyiodides for stable and low&#8208;cost metal&#8211;iodine batteries.

         <title>Engineered Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles&#8208;Based Doxorubicin and CD47&#8208;siRNA Co&#8208;Delivery Nanoplatform Overcomes Immune Resistance to Potentiate the Immunotherapy of Glioblastoma</title>

         <dc:description>
The nanoplatform based on engineered attenuated OMVs has good biosafety and can cross the BBB and target GBM with the assistance of Angiopep&#8208;2. The co&#8208;delivery of doxorubicin and CD47&#8208;siRNA and the immunogenicity of OMVs synergistically overcome the intrinsic and adaptive immune resistance of GBM, which ultimately triggers a powerful antitumor immune response.








Abstract
Apart from the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB), the efficacy of immunotherapy for glioblastoma (GBM) is limited by the presence of intrinsic and adaptive immune resistance, implying that co&#8208;delivery of various immunotherapeutic agents or simultaneous regulation of different cells is urgently needed. Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) offer a unique advantage in the treatment of GBM, owing to their multifunctional properties as carriers and immune adjuvants and their ability to cross the BBB. However, traditional OMVs can lead to toxic side effects and disruption of tight junctions in the BBB. Therefore, to enhance the in vivo safety and targeting capability of OMVs, we introduced engineered OMVs to reduce toxicity and further constructed a modularly assembled nanoplatform by performing simple peptide modifications. This nanoplatform demonstrates satisfactory biosafety and is able to continuously cross the BBB and target GBM with the assistance of Angiopep&#8208;2. Subsequently, immunogenic substances on OMVs, along with carried small&#8208;interfering RNA (siRNA) and doxorubicin, can promote and enhance the reprogramming and phagocytic abilities of macrophages and microglia, respectively, and increase the immunogenicity of GBM, ultimately overcoming GBM immune resistance to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. This OMVs&#8208;based nanoplatform provides a new paradigm and insights into the development of immunotherapy for GBM.

         <title>Proton Exchange Membrane Water Splitting: Advances in Electrode Structure and Mass&#8208;Charge Transport Optimization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review probes recent advancements in PEMWEs for green hydrogen production from the perspective of acidic OER, identifies challenges related to corrosive environments and oxidative conditions, and proposes strategies to enhance the long&#8208;term stability of PEMWEs by addressing both catalyst and membrane electrode assembly deactivation.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) represents a promising technology for renewable hydrogen production. However, the large&#8208;scale commercialization of PEMWE faces challenges due to the need for acid oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with long&#8208;term stability and corrosion&#8208;resistant membrane electrode assemblies (MEA). This review thoroughly examines the deactivation mechanisms of acidic OER and crucial factors affecting assembly instability in complex reaction environments, including catalyst degradation, dynamic behavior at the MEA triple&#8208;phase boundary, and equipment failures. Targeted solutions are proposed, including catalyst improvements, optimized MEA designs, and operational strategies. Finally, the review highlights perspectives on strict activity/stability evaluation standards, in situ/operando characteristics, and practical electrolyzer optimization. These insights emphasize the interrelationship between catalysts, MEAs, activity, and stability, offering new guidance for accelerating the commercialization of PEMWE catalysts and systems.

         <title>Covalent Anchoring of Mechanical Polymer for Highly Stable Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable Zn interfacial architecture is established, where a robust polyimide nanofilm is covalently anchored to the Zn substrate through electronegative F atoms. The strong covalent interactions provide excellent interfacial adhesion during repeated Zn/Zn2+ cycling. The remarkable resilience, modulus, and low creep of FPI film effectively resist the impact stress from electroplated Zn while maintaining structural integrity.








Abstract
Artificial interfacial protective coatings (IPCs) on Zn anodes provide a viable solution for suppressing dendritic growth by spatially confining and homogenizing the Zn2+ flux. However, repeated Zn deformation during electroplating/stripping cycles can lead to the rupture or exfoliation of IPCs, as well as the formation of detrimental interfacial gaps. Herein, a highly durable IPC is developed on a Zn substrate using a mechanically robust fluorinated polyimide nanofilm (FPI). This unique FPI interphase forms strong covalent bonds with Zn through electronegative fluorine atoms, facilitating Zn plating/stripping while maintaining interfacial adhesion. The superior resilience, modulus, and low creep of the FPI film resist the impact stresses from electroplated Zn, ensuring structural integrity. With this FPI coating, the FPI&#8208;Cu||Zn half cells demonstrate high reversibility in Zn2+ electroplating/stripping over 4000 h, maintaining Coulombic efficiency above 99.33%. When coupled with a MnO2 cathode, the MnO2||FPI&#8208;Zn full cells exhibit a long lifespan, surpassing 5000 cycles, with a high specific capacity retention of 75.21%. This study highlights the importance of achieving a balance between the customized compatibility and mechanical properties of IPCs to modulate zinc interfacial chemistries.

         <title>Infrared In&#8208;Sensor Computing Based on Flexible Photothermoelectric Tellurium Nanomesh Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An infrared&#8208;sensitive image sensor based on self&#8208;welded tellurium (Te) nanomesh is proposed, demonstrating advancements in flexible integration and scalable fabrication. By leveraging the unique photothermolelectric (PTE) operation, thermal&#8208;coupled bi&#8208;directional photoresponse is explored to illustrate the proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle in&#8208;sensor convolutional network for edge computing.








Abstract
The inherent limitations of traditional von Neumann architectures hinder the rapid development of internet of things technologies. Beyond conventional, complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor technologies, imaging sensors integrated with near&#8208; or in&#8208;sensor computing architectures emerge as a promising solution. In this study, the multi&#8208;scale van der Waals (vdWs) interactions in 1D tellurium (Te) atomic chains are explored, leading to the deposition of a photothermoelectric (PTE) Te nanomesh on a polymeric polyimide substrate. The self&#8208;welding process enables the lateral vapor growth of a well&#8208;connected Te nanomesh with robust electrical and mechanical properties, including a PTE responsivity of &#8776;120&#160;V&#160;W&#8722;1 in the infrared light regime. Leveraging the PTE operation, the thermal&#8208;coupled bi&#8208;directional photoresponse is investigated to demonstrate a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle in&#8208;sensor convolutional network for edge computing. This work presents a scalable approach for assembling functional vdWs Te nanomesh and highlights its potential applications in PTE image sensing and convolutional processing.

         <title>Advancing Beyond 800 Nm: Highly Stable Near&#8208;Infrared Thermally Activated Delayed Lasing Triggered by Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A D&#8211;A&#8211;D type TADF molecule, TPA&#8208;DHAQ, is designed and synthesized by introducing an ESIPT&#8208;active molecule DHAQ as the acceptor unit, based on which the NIR TADF laser with a low threshold and high stability is successfully realized. In addition, a single&#8208;mode NIR TADF laser can be realized by adjusting the size of the resonator. This work provides a novel molecular design strategy to overcome the problem of poor stability of conventional NIR organic lasers.









Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic lasers have undergone rapid development in recent years, but still facing challenges in lowering the threshold and improving the stability. Herein, to overcome these challenges, a &#8220;two in one&#8221; strategy involving the integration of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) activity in a single molecule is proposed. Specifically, a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor type TADF material 2,6&#8208;bis[4&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl]&#8208;1,5&#8208;dihydroxyanthraquinone (TPA&#8208;DHAQ) with an ESIPT&#8208;active moiety as the acceptor, is designed and synthesized, based on which, a NIR organic laser at 820&#160;nm with an exceptionally low threshold of 6.3&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2 can be realized. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the TADF property and the ESIPT process, the resulting organic laser showed excellent stability by maintaining the laser intensity at &#8776;80% of the initial value after 580 min of continuous excitation. Finally, by modulating the size of the resonator, a single&#8208;mode NIR laser is successfully realized. This work provides a novel molecular design strategy for the development of new TADF gain materials to overcome the problem of high threshold and poor stability of conventional NIR organic lasers, and shed light on the future development of NIR organic lasers.

         <title>Meter&#8208;Scale Wearable Multifunctional Core&#8208;Shell Nanofiber Textiles for Ultra&#8208;Broadband Electromagnetic Interference Shielding and Infrared Stealth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Meter&#8208;scale MXene/GO@monstera nanocellulose core&#8208;shell nanofiber textiles are produced, integrating ultra&#8208;broadband EMI shielding covering GHz and THz bands, super&#8208;strong stealth properties within NIR and MIR ranges, and excellent multifunctionality, including heat resistance, flame retardant, joule heating, and stress sensing capabilities, which are promising for comprehensive electromagnetic defense in both military and civilian fields.








Abstract
The rapid development of wireless communication and infrared (IR) detection technologies has generated an increasing demand for large&#8208;size high&#8208;performance wearable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and IR stealth textiles. Herein, meter&#8208;scale MXene/graphene oxide (MG)@monstera nanocellulose (MC) core&#8208;shell nanofiber textiles are fabricated for the first time using a multi&#8208;stage cryogenic drying&#8208;assisted coaxial wet spinning assembly strategy, with MG as the conductive composite core and MC as the organic skeleton shell. The highly aligned shell and dense core endow the nanofibers with a great toughness of &#8776;39.6&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, a strong strength &gt;&#8776;180&#160;MPa, and a high conductivity of 6.4 &#215; 103 S&#160;m&#8722;1. The textiles exhibit unprecedented ultra&#8208;broadband EMI shielding performance covering gigahertz and terahertz bands, with optimal shielding effectiveness up to 84 and 85&#160;dB in the band of 8.2&#8211;26.5&#160;GHz and 0.3&#8211;1.5 THz, respectively, at only 185&#160;&#181;m thick. Superb IR stealth performance in the near&#8208; and mid&#8208;IR ranges is also achieved, benefitting from their good heat resistance and low IR emissivity. Furthermore, the textiles also demonstrate excellent dyeability, flame retardancy, Joule heating, and stress&#8208;sensing properties. Such scalable prepared core&#8208;shell nanofiber textiles with superior comprehensive performance have broad application prospects in future smart wearable protective devices.

         <title>Transparent and Conductive Polyimide&#8208;Ionene Hybrid Interlayers for High Performance and Cost&#8208;Effective Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel polyimide&#8208;ionene hybrids that exhibit desirable alcohol processability, conductivity, transparency, and metal/semiconductor interface modification ability are furnished by melding pyromellitic diimides into ionene backbones. These merits render them universal cathode interlayer materials with outstanding thickness tolerance, leading to not only highly efficient and stable opaque devices but also high&#8208;performance semitransparent devices even when pairing with low&#8208;cost Cu electrodes.








Abstract
The contradiction between high transmittance and favorable conductivity poses a great challenge in developing effective cathode interlayer (CIL) materials with sufficient thickness tolerance, which hinders the further advancement of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a completely new class of alcohol processable polyimide&#8208;ionene hybrids (PIIHs) is proposed by melding pyromellitic diimide (PMD) subunits into imidazolium&#8208;based ionenes backbone covalently. These PIIHs, named PMD&#8208;DI and PMD&#8208;PD, boast high transparency, suitable energy levels, and decent conductivity. A higher PMD content endows PMD&#8208;PD with improved work function tunability, electrical properties, and crystallinity, enabling PMD&#8208;PD as CIL material with excellent thickness&#8208;insensitive characteristics, while simultaneously improving device stability significantly. Furthermore, PMD&#8208;PD also exhibits good compatibility with various electrodes and active layers, offering solar cell efficiencies of up to 19.91% and 19.29% with Ag and Cu cathodes, respectively. More importantly, the application of PMD&#8208;PD can improve the performance of semi&#8208;transparent OSCs without losing transmittance, thereby drastically enhancing the light utilization efficiency to 4.04% with an ultrathin, low&#8208;cost Cu cathode, that competes with leading optical modulation&#8208;free semitransparent OSCs with expensive Ag cathodes. This work opens a pathway to realize transparent and conductive interlayers by strategic molecular design, leading to highly efficient, stable, and cost&#8208;effective OSCs suitable for diverse applications.

         <title>Nanopore&#8208;Functionalized Hybrid Lipid&#8208;Block Copolymer Membranes Allow Efficient Single&#8208;Molecule Sampling and Stable Sensing of Human Serum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological nanopores are highly promising tools for single&#8208;molecule biosensors, but the fragile supporting lipid membranes is a major bottleneck. An alternative hybrid membrane is presented, comprising phospholipids and block co&#8208;polymers, that can be functionalized by a broad variety of nanopores for single&#8208;molecule sensing. Crucially, the hybrid membrane provides substantially increased stability to harsh conditions, providing new opportunities for nanopore&#8208;based biosensors.








Abstract
Biological nanopores are powerful tools for single&#8208;molecule detection, with promising potential as next&#8208;generation biosensors. A major bottleneck in nanopore analysis is the fragility of the supporting lipid membranes, that easily rupture after exposure to biological samples. Membranes comprising PMOXA&#8208;PDMS&#8208;PMOXA (poly(2&#8208;methyloxazoline&#8208;b&#8208;dimethylsiloxane&#8208;b&#8208;2&#8208;methyloxazoline)) or PBD&#8208;PEO (poly(1,2&#8208;butadiene)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide)) polymers may form robust alternatives, but their suitability for the reconstitution of a broad range of nanopores has not yet been investigated. Here, PBD&#8208;PEO membranes are found to be highly robust toward applied voltages and human serum, while providing a poor environment for nanopore reconstitution. However, hybrid membranes containing a similar molar ratio of PBD11PEO8 polymers and diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPhPC) lipids show the best of both worlds: highly robust membranes suitable for the reconstitution of a wide variety of nanopores. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that lipids form &#8776;12&#160;nm domains interspersed by a polymer matrix. Nanopores partition into these lipid nanodomains and sequester lipids, possibly offering the same binding strength as in a native bilayer. Nanopores reconstituted in hybrid membranes yield efficient sampling of biomolecules and enable sensing of high concentrations of human serum. This work thus shows that hybrid membranes functionalized with nanopores allow single&#8208;molecule sensing, while forming robust interfaces, resolving an important bottleneck for novel nanopore&#8208;based biosensors.

         <title>Elimination of Concentration Polarization Under Ultra&#8208;High Current Density Zinc Deposition by Nanofluid Self&#8208;Driven Ion Enrichment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc anodes face severe instability under extreme conditions of high current density, high areal capacity, and high depth of discharge (DOD) due to severe concentration polarization caused by the imbalance between Zn2&#8314; consumption and transfer rates. To overcome this, a nanofluid layer is introduced to rapidly absorb Zn2&#8314; and regulate interfacial ion transport, effectively mitigating polarization and enabling stable zinc deposition. This work provides key insights into interfacial engineering for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
The commercialization of zinc metal batteries aims at high&#8208;rate capability and lightweight, which requires zinc anodes working at high current density, high areal capacity, and high depth of discharge. However, frequent zinc anode fades drastically under extreme conditions. Herein, it is revealed that the primary reason for the anode instability is the severe concentration polarization caused by the imbalanced consumption rate and transfer rate of Zn2+ under extreme conditions. Based on this finding, a nanofluid layer is constructed to rapidly absorb Zn2+ and mitigate the polarization induced by the nonlinear transport of interfacial ions. The modified zinc anode sustains at extreme conditions for over 1573 h (40 mA cm&#8722;2, 40 mAh cm&#8722;2, DOD = 75.97%) and 490 h (100 mA cm&#8722;2, 100 mAh cm&#8722;2, DOD = 90.91%), and achieving an unprecedented cumulative capacity of 62.92 Ah cm&#8722;2. This work offers both fundamental and practical insights for the interface design in energy storage devices.

         <title>Electrolyte Regulation toward Cathodes with Enhanced&#8208;Performance in Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to highlight the effect of electrolyte regulation on alleviating issues on the cathode side in aqueous ZIBs. The recent advances of electrolyte regulation strategies are present, with a comprehensive discussion and summary of regulation mechanisms, which can provide guidance to develop novel and multifunctional electrolytes for next&#8208;generation aqueous ZIBs.








Abstract
Enhancing cathodic performance is crucial for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, with the primary focus of research efforts being the regulation of the intrinsic material structure. Electrolyte regulation is also widely used to improve full&#8208;cell performance, whose main optimization mechanisms have been extensively discussed only in regard to the metallic anode. Considering that ionic transport begins in the electrolyte, the modulation of the electrolyte must influence the cathodic performance or even the reaction mechanism. Despite its importance, the discussion of the optimization effects of electrolyte regulation on the cathode has not garnered the attention it deserves. To fill this gap and raise awareness of the importance of electrolyte regulation on cathodic reaction mechanisms, this review comprehensively combs the underlying mechanisms of the electrolyte regulation strategies and classifies the regulation mechanisms into three main categories according to their commonalities for the first time, which are ion effect, solvating effect, and interfacial modulation effect, revealing the missing puzzle piece of the mechanisms of electrolyte regulation in optimizing the cathode.

         <title>Titanium Self&#8208;Intercalation in Titanium Diselenide Devices: Insights from In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates bias&#8208;induced structural transformations in 1T&#8208;TiSe2 devices, focusing on the transition from the 1T metallic phase to the distorted 1Td phase and ultimately to an orthorhombic Ti9Se2 conducting phase. Using ex&#8208;situ and in&#8208;situ TEM, dynamic structural changes and insights into the effect of thickness on phase transitions, providing valuable information for CDW&#8208;based device applications, are revealed. 









Abstract
Metallic transition metal dichalcogenides (MTMDCs) are of significant attention for various electronic applications due to their anisotropic conductivity, high electron mobility, superconductivity, and charge&#8208;density&#8208;waves (CDW). Understanding the correlations between electronic properties and structural transformations is crucial. In this study, a bias&#8208;induced structural transformation in vertical CDW&#8208;based 1T&#8208;TiSe2 devices, transitioning from a 1T metallic phase to a distorted transition 1Td phase and subsequently to an orthorhombic Ti9Se2 conducting phase, is reported. Using ex&#8208;situ and in&#8208;situ biasing transmission electron microscopy, dynamic structural changes, while electron energy loss spectroscopy analysis revealed valence state modifications in Ti and Se within the Ti&#8208;rich layer after biasing, are observed. In addition, the effect of varying 1T&#8208;TiSe2 thickness on the maximum current value is investigated. These observations reveal that increased thickness requires higher voltage to induce phase transitions. These insights contribute to understanding the structural and electronic dynamics of 1T&#8208;TiSe2, highlighting its potential as a promising material for future CDW&#8208;based device applications.

         <title>Engineering Ultra&#8208;Small Ag Nanoparticles with Enhanced Activity in Microporous Polymer Membranes for C2H4/C2H6 Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;small silver nanoparticles are formed in situ and activated in an amidoxime&#8208;modified polymer of intrinsic microporosity to fabricate a metallic nanocomposite membrane for C2H4/C2H6 separation. The activated silver nanoparticles promote C2H4 transport and effectively enhance C2H4/C2H6 separation selectivity, resulting in an outstanding membrane separation performance with C2H4 permeability of 322.1 barrer and C2H4/C2H6 selectivity as high as 8.8.








Abstract
The separation of C2H4 and C2H6 is a critical yet energy&#8208;intensive operation in the petrochemical industry. Gas separation membranes offer energy&#8208;efficient alternatives, but their effectiveness is hindered by the similar physical properties of C2H4 and C2H6. Here, a metallic nanocomposite membrane (MNM) comprising ultra&#8208;small Ag nanoparticles embedded in an amidoxime&#8208;modified polymer of intrinsic microporosity (AOPIM&#8208;1) is reported for highly efficient C2H4/C2H6 separation. The microporous structure of AOPIM&#8208;1, combined with anchoring groups (amidoxime groups) inside the microcavities, enables size&#8208;controlled growth of Ag nanoparticles with &#8210;&#8776;3&#160;nm diameter, which maximizes the contact with ethylene molecules. The amidoxime groups as electron acceptors effectively enrich the positive charge on the surface of Ag nanoparticles. The activated Ag form reversible complexes with ethylene molecules endowing them with preferential affinity over ethane. The resulting Ag nanocomposite membrane demonstrates a &#8776;10&#8208;fold increase in C2H4 permeability, reaching 322.1 barrer, and a &#8776;3&#8208;fold increase in C2H4/C2H6 selectivity, reaching 8.8. The comprehensive separation performance is superior over all the polymer membranes and mixed matrix membranes reported so far. The MNMs also demonstrate stable mixed gas separation performance under elevated feed gas pressures. This study provides valuable insights into designing and fabricating polymer membranes with high C2H4/C2H6 separation performance.

         <title>Co Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis for High&#8208;Efficiency LiCl/Cl2 Conversion in Rechargeable Lithium&#8208;Chlorine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co single&#8208;atom catalyst (Co&#8208;N&#8324;) enhances Cl&#8322; adsorption and lowers LiCl reaction barriers in Li&#8208;Cl&#8322; batteries. The Li&#8208;Cl&#8322;@Co&#8208;NC battery exhibits &gt;600 cycles at 1500&#160;mA&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at room temperature and 650 cycles at 500&#160;mA&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, with a 0.6 V reduction in polarization voltage. This strategy delivers high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;Cl&#8322; batteries with wide temperature adaptability.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;chlorine (Li&#8208;Cl2) secondary batteries are emerging as promising candidates for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density power sources and an extensive operational temperature range. However, conventional electrode materials suffer from weak adsorption for&#160;chlorine gas (Cl2) and low conversion efficiency of lithium chloride (LiCl), leading to significant loss of chlorine&#8208;based active materials. This issue hampers the cyclability of Li&#8208;Cl2 batteries. In this work, it is demonstrated that synergistic Cl2 adsorption on the electrode surface and the energy barrier for LiCl reactions are crucial for enhancing Cl2/LiCl conversion efficiency. Consequently, a cobalt (Co) single&#8208;atom site catalyst with a Co&#8208;N4 coordination environment has been developed, which significantly diminishes the transformation barrier of solid LiCl particles into Cl2 and concurrently enhances the chemical adsorption of Cl2, facilitating uniform nucleation of LiCl. As a result, the Li&#8208;Cl2@Co&#8208;NC battery developed has achieved a 0.6&#160;V reduction in polarization voltage under high current densities, effectively addressing the issue of low conversion efficiency between Cl2 and LiCl. At room temperature, the Li&#8208;Cl2@Co&#8208;NC battery achieves over 600 cycles at 1500&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1; At &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, it reaches 650 cycles at 500&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1. The research overcomes the cycle stability barrier in high&#8208;current Li&#8208;Cl2 batteries and offers a strategy for batteries with a wide temperature range and long cycle life.

The transparent PSDIC&#8208;gel exhibits remarkable tensile strength, high toughness, excellent ionic conductivity, improved water tolerance, and rapid room temperature self&#8208;healing ability, thus, has wide application prospects in wearable electronics.








Abstract
Eutectogels are emerging as the next&#8208;generation stretchable electronics due to their superior ionic conductivity, non&#8208;volatility, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Nevertheless, most eutectogels suffer from weak mechanical strength and toughness and pronounced hygroscopicity. Herein, a strategy is proposed to fabricate phase&#8208;separated eutectogels with dual ionic channels (PSDIC&#8208;gel), which exhibit exceptional integrative properties, especially water resistance. By blending hydrophilic/hydrophobic polymerizable deep eutectic solvents, dual ionic channels spontaneously form via polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation. The hydrophilic poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) phase containing Li+&#8208;channels, rich in hydrogen bonding and ion&#8208;dipole interactions, provides mechanical strength and conductivity. The hydrophobic poly(hexafluorobutyl acrylate) (PHFBA) phase incorporating cholinium cation (Ch+) channels enhances toughness, conductivity, and water resistance. Adjusting the phase ratio yields a microphase&#8208;separated transparent eutectogel with high tensile strength (6.03&#160;MPa), toughness (16.18&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), excellent ionic conductivity (1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S&#160;m&#8722;1), strong substrate adhesion, and rapid room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing. Solid&#8208;state NMR reveals the conductive mechanism and the phase&#8208;separated structure featuring dual ionic channels in PSDIC&#8208;gels, advancing the understanding of complex ionic interactions at the atomic level. The PSDIC&#8208;gel enables a flexible triboelectric nanogenerator for accurate real&#8208;time self&#8208;powered human motion sensing. This work advances eutectogel design through structure&#8208;property engineering, offering a universal strategy to reconcile mechanical robustness, environmental suitability, and ionic conductivity for wearable electronics.

         <title>Stereoisomerism of Vicinal Polydichloronorbornene for Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoisomerism engineering plays a crucial role in tailoring the properties of vicinal dichloronorbornene (PDCNB), with profound effects in backbone spacing, &#960;&#8208;stacking, barrier height, and trap states, empowering PDCNB with superior capacitive performance that outperforms existing polymers and nanocomposites in capacitive energy storage at 250 &#176;C.








Abstract
The emergence of high&#8208;density electronics in aerospace and renewable energies demands high temperature dielectrics. Molecular engineering represents a vital strategy for designing dielectric polymers, yet the influence of stereochemistry remains untapped. Herein, by designing halogen substituents of an aromatic pendant attached to a bicyclic mainchain, vicinal polydichloronorbornene (PDCNB) with a high glass&#8208;transition temperature (Tg) of 263&#160;&#176;C is obtained. Further study unveils the profound effect of stereochemistry on the properties of exo&#8208; and endo&#8208;PDCNB. Both isomers show identical high Tg and bandgap (4.3 eV), imparting PDCNBs with remarkable capacitive energy storage, outperforming existing polymers and nanocomposites with two orders of magnitude lower conduction at an ultra&#8208;high temperature of 250&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the effect of stereoisomerism is manifested in the differences in backbone spacing, &#960;&#8208;stacking, barrier height, and trap states, and the resulting distinct high field performance. Exo&#8208;PDCNB displays an extremely low conduction of 6.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;14 S&#160;m&#8315;1 at 200 mV&#160;m&#8315;1 and maintains a record charge&#8208;discharge efficiency of 82% at 450 mV&#160;m&#8315;1, while endo&#8208;PDCNB exhibits a high breakdown strength of 600 mV&#160;m&#8315;1 with a remarkable discharged density of 4.47 J&#160;cm&#8315;3, all at 250 &#176;C. This study unleashes a stereochemistry&#8208;based strategy with vicinal dichloro substitution to further boost the Tg of polynorbornene for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;temperature&#160;applications.

         <title>Development of Ternary Hydrogel Electrolytes for Superior Gel Thermocells: Exceptional Anti&#8208;Drying, Anti&#8208;Freezing, and Mechanical Robustness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible wearable ternary gel thermocell (TGTC) by integrating a thermosensitive crystallizing agent, and supporting electrolyte into a natural nanocellulose hydrogel matrix is designed and constructed, which exhibits a remarkable thermopower, an optimized effective ionic conductivity, anti&#8208;drying, freezing resistance, and mechanical robustness. This work provides a versatile strategy for developing TGTC, contributing to advancements in low&#8208;grade energy harvesting and wearable electronics for the Internet of Things era.








Abstract
Gel thermocells (GTCs) provide a safe, facile, and scalable solution for harvesting waste heat to power ubiquitous electronics. However, achieving a harmonious integration of high power density, wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range stability, and mechanical robustness in GTCs remains a significant challenge. In this work, a novel ternary gel thermocell (TGTC) is proposed and fabricated by integrating ferro/ferricyanide (Fe(CN)63&#8722;/4&#8722;) redox couples, thermosensitive crystallizing agents guanidinium chloride (GdmCl), and supporting electrolytes lithium chloride (LiCl) into natural nanocellulose hydrogels to enhance overall performance. GdmCl selectively induces Fe(CN)64&#8722; crystallization, increasing the concentration difference of redox pairs, resulting in improving thermopower and significantly increased fiber friction, while LiCl rapidly balances charges through electromigration promoting efficient ion transport and reconstructing hydrogen bond networks, contributing to an excellent output power density and the capture of water molecules, which are further elucidated by simulations, achieving synchronous enhancement of anti&#8208;drying, anti&#8208;freezing and mechanical properties. Consequently, the TGTC achieves a remarkable thermopower of 3.42&#160;mV K&#8722;1, a maximum power density of 2.8&#160;mW m&#8722;2 K&#8722;2, multiple continuous stable cycles at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, and an impressive strength of 3.06&#160;MPa. Notably, this study elucidates the design principles and underlying mechanisms of ternary gel electrolytes, offering a practical strategy for advancing GTC technology.

         <title>M&#246;bius Solvation Structure for Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, in a bold departure from convention, the Ouzo effect is pioneeringly utilized to design surfactant&#8208;free microemulsion electrolyte (SFMEE), creating the first application of water&#8208;in&#8208;oil type M&#246;bius polarity topological solvation in zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This approach enables dual regulation of both the solvent environment and the solvation structure, thereby enhancing battery performance.








Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have promising prospects in energy storage field, but the water molecules in aqueous electrolytes significantly compromise the stability of the anode and cathode interfaces and hinder the low&#8208;temperature performance. Herein, water&#8208;in&#8208;oil type M&#246;bius polarity topological solvation composed of oil, water, and amphiphilic salt are first&#8208;ever pioneered, forming the surfactant&#8208;free microemulsion electrolyte (SFMEE). This water&#8208;in&#8208;oil type M&#246;bius solvation structure, characterized by its distinct inner and outer layers and a polarity inversion feature, successfully connects the non&#8208;polar phase with the polar phase, eliminating the need for surfactants to reduce costs and system complexity. The amphiphilic anion of salt creates a polarity singularity and stabilizes the polarity&#8208;reversed encapsulation. The outer oil layer disrupts the cohesive polarity network of water and constructs a polarity&#8208;reversed cage to restrict water. A series of SFMEE combinations are investigated and then directly applied to ZIBs, confirming excellent universality and durability of this design. The Zn||NVO (NaV&#8323;O&#8328;&#183;1.5H&#8322;O) cells using SFMEE can stably cycle for 4000 cycles with a capacity of 125 mAh g&#8722;1 and 86.8% capacity retention. This discovery of M&#246;bius solvation structure unlock unprecedented levels of electrolyte design and illuminate the development of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance energy storage systems.

The Zn||NVO (NaV&#8323;O&#8328;&#183;1.5H&#8322;O) cells using SFMEE can stably cycle for 4000 cycles with a capacity of 125 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 86.8% capacity retention. This discovery of M&#246;bius solvation structure unlock unprecedented levels of electrolyte design and illuminate the development of next-generation high-performance energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hole&#8208;selective Transparent In Situ Passivation Contacts for Efficient and Stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p Graded Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an in situ internal encapsulation strategy by integrating cross&#8208;linkable p&#8208;type small molecules into the antisolvent to construct a highly hole&#8208;selective, transparent, and robust passivation contact. The 1.65 eV n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSC achieves a 19.8% PCE, with better thermal, UV, and operational stabilities, and a bifaciality of 101.4%, alongside a 29.2% certified PCE tandem cell.








Abstract
The optically deficient and intrinsically unstable hole transport layer (HTL) is the Achilles&#8217; heel of n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite/silicon tandems. Here, a minimalist transparent hole&#8208;selective contact is developed without additional HTL by simply integrating cross&#8208;linkable p&#8208;type small molecules into antisolvent. This strategy not only improves the perovskite crystallinity, shields the perovskite from external stressors, and suppresses interfacial mass exchange, but also provides efficient defect passivation and favorable band alignment via the formation of graded heterojunction. Consequently, the corresponding 1.65 eV perovskite solar cell achieves a stabilized efficiency of 19.6%, alongside significantly improved thermal, ultraviolet, and operation stabilities. Furthermore, leveraging its outstanding transparency, a bifacial single&#8208;junction device is showcased achieving a record bifaciality of 101.4%, and a monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem boasting a certified efficiency of 29.2% for 1.04 cm2, which represents the highest certified efficiency achieved for n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite/silicon tandems. The demonstration of efficient and stable minimalist hole&#8208;selective contacts encourages the tandem community to reevaluate the n&#8211;i&#8211;p structure, with the goal of harnessing the high open&#8208;circuit voltage of single&#8208;junction n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Reinforcing Ether Coordination of Localized High Concentration Electrolyte Enables High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust strategy is proposed by adding ionic liquid of Pyr13TFSI as co&#8208;solvent into the bulk electrolyte. The Pyr13TFSI can balance the interaction among the electrolyte components to reduce the dynamic de&#8208;coordinated DME molecules and promote the formation of anion&#8208;derived cathode electrolyte interphase with excellent electrochemical stability and high Li+ transport dynamics.








Abstract
The decomposition of 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) in localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) under high voltage produces fragile and unstable organic fragments at the cathode/electrolyte interphase, which greatly damages the cycling performance of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries. Herein, a robust strategy is proposed by adding ionic liquid of 1&#8208;Methyl&#8208;1&#8208;propyl pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Pyr13TFSI) as co&#8208;solvent into the bulk electrolyte to significantly improve the stability of solvated DME through reinforcing the ion&#8208;dipole interaction between TFSI&#8722; and DME. The Pyr13TFSI can balance the interaction among the electrolyte components to reduce the dynamic de&#8208;coordinated DME molecules and promote the formation of anion&#8208;derived cathode electrolyte interphase with excellent electrochemical stability and high Li+ transport dynamics. The Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 coin cells with Pyr13TFSI exhibit capacity retention of 76.1% after 1800 cycles at 1&#160;C rate (4.5 V), and 77.1% after 800 cycles at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6 V. Furthermore, the cells using Li anode with the thickness of 50 &#181;m and high LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 loading of 18.68 mg cm&#8722;2 can operate for 175 cycles with high&#8208;capacity retention of 73.35%. This work demonstrates that modulating the interactions among electrolyte components using ionic liquid can optimize the coordination chemistry for advanced high&#8208;energy density Li metal batteries.

         <title>Reduction of Nonradiative Recombination at Perovskite/C60 Interface in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adopting a bimolecular synergistic passivation strategy, it is feasible to achieve micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;structural modulation of the perovskite surface, thereby passivating surface defects, regulating interface energy levels, and enhancing the interface electric field. This approach maximizes the reduction of nonradiative recombination at the perovskite/C60 interface and demonstrates universal applicability across perovskite/C60 interfaces with different bandgaps.








Abstract
Although p&#8208;i&#8208;n type inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) achieve excellent photoelectric efficiencies, the nonradiative recombination at the perovskite/C60 interface is still the key factor affecting the overall efficiency of p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs. Herein, a synergistic passivation strategy (meta&#8208;fluoro&#8208;phenylethylammonium iodide and piperazine iodide) is developed to modify the perovskite/C60 interface in p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs. This strategy facilitates in situ reconstruction of the perovskite film to obtain a smooth and flat perovskite surface. Furthermore, the two molecules work synergistically to passivate surface defects, adjust the interface energy levels, and bolster the interface electric field, all of which reduce the nonradiative recombination losses at the perovskite/C60 interface. The optimal PSCs adopting this strategy achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.85%. (certified value of 25.22%). After operating at the maximum power point for 1000 h, the 95% initial efficiency can be maintained. Furthermore, this process is universally applicable and scalable.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Responsive H2S Composite System Regulates the Nerve Regeneration Microenvironment Through Multiple Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article designs and prepares a photo&#8208;responsive H2S composite nerve transplantation conduit using electrospinning technology and drug delivery system, combining aligned structure, RGD peptide, H2S, and Zn&#8208;CA MOFs. This system can not only achieve artificially controlled H2S release, but also slowly release Zn2+, achieving the joint regulation of Zn2+ and H2S in the nerve regeneration microenvironment.








Abstract
After injury, the imbalance of the regeneration microenvironment caused by inflammation, oxidative stress, insufficient neurovascularization, and inadequate energy supply affects nerve regeneration. Drug&#8208;delivery nerve conduits play a role in repairing the regenerative microenvironment. However, traditional drugs often fail to cross the blood&#8208;nerve barrier and lack multifunctionality, limiting the effectiveness of conduit therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to construct a multifunctional conduit that regulate the regeneration microenvironment timely and effectively. Herein, a photo&#8208;responsive hydrogen sulfide (H2S) composite nerve conduit, artificially controlled H2S release, is developed. A new structure of zinc&#8208;citric acid organic metal framework (Zn&#8208;CA MOFs) is utilized to improve its drug loading rate, achieving the joint regulation of the nerve regeneration microenvironment by H2S and Zn2+. In addition, RGD modification of polyester amide (P(CL&#8208;MMD&#8208;MAC)&#8208;RGD)) combined with aligned structure is used to improve the performance of the conduit. Relevant results demonstrate that H2S and Zn2+ can regulate inflammatory response and oxidative stress and promote mitochondrial function recovery and angiogenesis. Furthermore, the aligned structure can promote cell adhesion and guide cell directed migration. Overall, this study provides a method of combining gas neurotransmitters with ions to improve the nerve regeneration microenvironment, accelerate nerve regeneration, and restore motor function.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Artificial Cell Micromotors for Degenerative Knee Osteoarthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized artificial cellular micromotors are synthesized to achieve phototropic movement under light conditions. The protons released by the light reaction inside the micromotor combine with the natural ATP synthase on the surface to synthesize and release ATP, which slows down the disease process of degenerative knee osteoarthritis to a certain extent.








Abstract
Combining artificial cellular compartmentalization and intelligent motion benefits of micro/nanomotors, light is used as energy input to construct an artificial cell&#8208;based micromotor capable of photosynthetic anabolism and intelligent directional movement. This system is assembled from phospholipids functionalized with F&#8208;ATP synthase and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoparticles (Vesical@MoS2&#8208;ATPase). The underlying mechanism involves the generation of protons (H+) through photo&#8208;hydrolysis of MoS2 nanoparticles within vesicles, which generates a local electroosmotic flow inside the vesicles and drives the negatively charged MoS2 toward light. The established proton gradient across the phospholipid membrane, in turn, drives the ATP synthase to catalyze ATP production. Both in vitro and in vivo models demonstrate that the micromotor can elevate local intracellular ATP levels upon light and improve the metabolism of denatured chondrocytes. This cell mimicry, with capabilities of migration and biosynthesis, emerges as a promising platform for the next generation of functional bio&#8208;interface.

         <title>Highly Bright Pure Room Temperature Phosphorescence for Circularly Polarized Organic Hyperafterglow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy is proposed for achieving highly bright and narrowband organic hyperafterglow by isolating conjugated energy donor with circularly polarized luminescence and energy acceptor with multi&#8208;resonance effect into a rigid host. Efficient energy and chirality transfers afford multi&#8208;color hyperafterglow with photoluminescence efficiency of&#8776;90%, full&#8208;width at half maxima of 31&#8211;39 nm, lifetime of 120&#8211;770 ms, and luminescent dissymmetry of&#8776;10&#8722;3.








Abstract
Pure room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (pRTP) promises great advantages in both exciton utilization and lifetime manipulation over existing organic luminophores for a variety of emerging applications, but the low brightness, low efficiency, and low color purity constrain the afterglow luminescence significantly. Here, a promising approach to design highly bright, efficient, and narrowband pRTP with long&#8208;lifetime for organic hyperafterglow is proposed by isolating a conjugated energy donor with circularly polarized (CP) luminescence and energy acceptor with multi&#8208;resonance effect into a rigid host. It is shown that the aggregation of chiral P&#8208;containing binaphthyl promotes the generation of CP&#8208;pRTP and afterglow with high brightness up to &#8776;50&#160;cd m&#8722;2, while the simultaneous energy transfer and chirality transfer afford multi&#8208;color organic hyperafterglow with photoluminescence efficiency of &#8776;90%, full&#8208;width at half maxima of 31&#8211;39&#160;nm, lifetime of 120&#8211;770&#160;ms, and luminescent dissymmetry of &#8776;10&#8722;3. Also, excellent stability capable of resisting quenching effects of oxygen, organic solvents, and aqueous solutions of strong acids and bases are observed. With these advantages, applications of chirality information encryption, afterglow grayscale imaging, and 3D high&#8208;resolution afterglow models are realized, promoting significantly the fundamental understandings on the modulation of organic afterglow brightness and construction of high&#8208;performance pRTP materials with advanced photophysical properties and applications.

         <title>Abnormal Slow Phonon Dynamics Toward Prolonging Excited States Dynamics Enabled by Crystalline&#8208;Assembling Donor&#8211;Acceptor Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline&#8208;packing donor&#8211;acceptor molecular structures into dipolar crystals enables slow phonon dynamics from lattice vibrations when optical phonons develop mutual&#8208;opposite phase relations. Through electron&#8211;phonon coupling, slow phonon dynamics interact with light&#8208;emitting singlet charge&#8208;transfer states containing contribution from triplets through triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet intersystem crossing, consequently leading to extended excited states dynamics with prolonged PL lifetime shown as super&#8208;delayed fluorescence in dipolar organic crystals.








Abstract
Phonon dynamics are a critical factor to control the optical properties of excited states in light&#8208;emitting materials. Here, we report an extremely slow relaxation of photoexcited lattice vibrations enabled by assembling the donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) molecules [2&#8208;(9,9&#8208;dimethylacridin&#8208;10(9H)&#8208;yl)&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;thioxanthene 10,10&#8208;dioxide], namely AC molecules, into dipolar crystal. By using photoexcitation&#8208;modulated Raman spectroscopy, we find that the crystalline&#8208;lattice vibrations monitored by Raman&#8208;scattering laser beam of 785&#160;nm demonstrate an un&#8208;usual slow relaxation in the time scale of seconds after ceasing photoexcitation beam of 343&#160;nm in such dipolar crystal. This presents extremely slow phonon dynamics enabled by crystalline&#8208;assembling the D&#8211;A molecules into a dipolar crystal. Simultaneously, the photoluminescence (PL) exhibits a prolonged behavior, lasting 10&#160;ms after ceasing photoexcitation in dipolar AC crystal. This phenomenon provides an experimental hypothesis that the slow phonon dynamics function as an important mechanism to unusually prolong excited states dynamics upon crystalline&#8208;assembling the D&#8211;A molecules into dipolar crystal. This hypothesis can be verified by directly suppressing the phonon dynamics through freezing D&#8211;A molecular liquid into dipolar crystalline solid at 77 K to largely prolong the PL to 1 s&#8208; after removing photoexcitation. Clearly, crystalline&#8208;assembling D&#8211;A molecules provide the necessary conditions to enable slow phonon dynamics toward prolonging excited states dynamics.

         <title>Benchmarking Corrosion with Anionic Polarity Index for Stable and Fast Aqueous Batteries Even in Low&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Since the water&#8208;induced corrosion in aqueous electrolytes, including spontaneous chemical and electrochemical hydrogen evolution corrosion, will have a very adverse impact on the lifespan and rate performance of aqueous batteries. Through theoretical simulation, a strategy of anionic polarity index is proposed to resist corrosion by manipulating interfacial and solvated water simultaneously, thus realizing stable and fast Zn aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Despite aqueous electrolyte endowing batteries with the merits of safe operation, low&#8208;cost fabrication, and high ionic conductivity, water&#8208;induced corrosion, including spontaneous chemical and electrochemical hydrogen evolution corrosion, adversely affects lifespan and rate capability. There is still a lack of selection criteria for benchmarking corrosion behavior qualitatively. Through theoretical simulation, an anionic polarity index (API) tactic is proposed to resist corrosion by manipulating interfacial and solvated water concomitantly, thus realizing stable and fast Zn aqueous batteries (ZABs). As proof of concept, a low&#8208;cost zinc salt of 0.5 m zinc bis(4&#8208;hydroxybenzenesulphonate) (Zn(HBS)2) with low&#8208;API anion is prioritized. Combined in situ spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses reveal that, even in a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte, the low&#8208;API anion reduces interfacial water in the inner Helmholtz plane, shielding the chemical water dissociation. Meanwhile, their entering into the solvation sheath of Zn2+ lowers the solvent&#8208;separated ion pair, suppressing the electrochemical corrosion. The elaborated API&#8208;screened zinc salt endows fast plating kinetics of 50 mA cm&#8722;2 (119.1 mV polarization), high coulombic efficiency of 99.8%, dendrite&#8208;free cycling over 1600 h, and prolonged lifespan over 5000 cycles for the Zn&#8208;V cell. The results provide new metrics that can benchmark the success of ZABs for large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Red, Green and Blue Liquid&#8208;Film Lasers Based on Colloidal Quantum&#8208;Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) in liquid films achieve breakthrough vertical&#8208;cavity surface&#8208;emitting lasers across red, green, and blue spectra. By leveraging entropic ligands for ultrahigh solubility and integrating microfluidic cooling, this work overcomes thermal quenching, enabling stable lasing at MHz repetition rates. The platform unlocks customizable, solution&#8208;processed lasers for tunable wavelengths and diverse applications.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (cQD) are heralded for their tunable bandgaps, solution&#8208;processibility, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, making them ideal candidates for lasing applications. However, previous cQD lasing demonstrations have largely depended on close&#8208;packed solid&#8208;state films, which are deemed essential to counteract the rapid decay of material gain.

&lt;p&gt;Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) in liquid films achieve breakthrough vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers across red, green, and blue spectra. By leveraging entropic ligands for ultrahigh solubility and integrating microfluidic cooling, this work overcomes thermal quenching, enabling stable lasing at MHz repetition rates. The platform unlocks customizable, solution-processed lasers for tunable wavelengths and diverse applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colloidal quantum dots (cQD) are heralded for their tunable bandgaps, solution-processibility, and cost-effectiveness, making them ideal candidates for lasing applications. However, previous cQD lasing demonstrations have largely depended on close-packed solid-state films, which are deemed essential to counteract the rapid decay of material gain. In this study, a novel approach is introduced utilizing &#8220;entropic ligands and solvent&#8221; to enhance the solubility of cQDs in solution. By achieving the necessary critical volume fraction for lasing, this strategy leads to the groundbreaking development of the first liquid-state vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) based on cQDs across the blue and green spectrum, encompassing diverse material systems such as CdSe-based and InP-based cQDs.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Based Multicompartment Photonic Pigments: Unlocking Non&#8208;Iridescent Pure RGB Structural Colors for Versatile Chromatic Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research presents a novel class of multicompartment photonic pigments derived from vegetable oils, leveraging biodegradable bottlebrush block copolymers to effectively mitigate Ostwald ripening in complex emulsion systems. Through the development of an innovative structural model, non&#8208;iridescent pure red hues are achieved in photonic glass, enabling unprecedented versatility in chromatic engineering via an RGB three&#8208;primary color mixing strategy.








Abstract
Non&#8208;iridescent photonic glass pigments of block copolymers show great potential for sustainable structural coloration. However, the ability to create accurate RGB color mixtures for real&#8208;world applications is limited by the prevalent use of non&#8208;degradable, fossil oil&#8208;derived components and the difficulty in achieving pure red hues. This work presents an alternative strategy for achieving more sustainable structural coloration by fabricating composite photonic pigments through controlled self&#8208;assembly of water, vegetable oil, and biodegradable bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) in a complex emulsion system. The obtained photonic balls feature unprecedented multicompartment structures characterized by a short&#8208;range ordered assembly of water nanodroplets stabilized by the BBCPs, along with oil droplets stabilized by these nanodroplets, which substantially enhances resistance to Ostwald ripening. Furthermore, a new structural model is introduced to eliminate disordered scattering, successfully creating a pure red structural color and overcoming a long&#8208;standing limitation in versatile chromatic engineering.

Smart windows with anti&#8208;UV, fast&#8208;response, and thermally stable characteristics for all&#8208;day modulation are crafted, demonstrating appealing stability and durability for practical building energy&#8208;saving applications.








Abstract
Thermochromic smart windows offer energy&#8208;saving potential through temperature&#8208;responsive optical transmittance adjustments, yet face challenges in achieving anti&#8208;UV radiation, fast response, and high&#8208;temperature stability characteristics for long&#8208;term use. Herein, the rational design of Hofmeister effect&#8208;enhanced, nanoparticle&#8208;shielded composite hydrogels, composed of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) (PDMAA), sodium sulfate, and polydopamine nanoparticles, for anti&#8208;UV, fast&#8208;response, and all&#8208;day&#8208;modulated smart windows is reported. Specifically, a three&#8208;dimensional network of PDMAA is created as the supporting skeleton, markedly enhancing the thermal stability of pristine HPMC hydrogels. Sodium sulfate induces a Hofmeister effect, lowering the lower critical solution temperature to 32 &#176;C while accelerating phase transition rates fivefold (30 s vs. 150 s). Intriguingly, small&#8208;sized polydopamine nanoparticles simultaneously enable high luminous transmittance of 66.9% and outstanding anti&#8208;UV capability. Additionally, the smart window showcases a high solar modulation (51.2%) and maintains a 10.2 &#176;C temperature reduction versus a glass window during all&#8208;day modulation applications. The design strategy is effective, opening up new avenues for manufacturing fast&#8208;response and durable thermochromic smart windows for energy savings and emission reduction.

         <title>Mixed Electrolyte Enabling Ultrafast Mass Transport and Compatibility with Polypropylene Separator for Stable and Low&#8208;Cost Aluminum Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed electrolyte (IL&#8208;FB (1:5)) for aluminum ion batteries is synthesized by incorporating fluorobenzene into ionic liquid electrolyte. The IL&#8208;FB (1:5) promotes mass transport, enabling cycling for 7500 h under high current density and capacity (8 mA cm&#8722;2, 8 mAh cm&#8722;2). IL&#8208;FB (1:5) also exhibits significantly improved wetting ability with the polypropylene separator, guaranteeing 60% reduction in the cost of the AIB.








Abstract
The energy industry has taken notice of aluminum ion batteries (AIB) for their low cost, high safety, and high capacity. However, using the ionic liquid electrolyte results in the uneven Al electrodeposition and the reliance on expensive glass fiber separators, due to the sluggish mass transport and low wettability for the polypropylene separator. Herein, a mixed electrolyte is introduced by incorporating the co&#8208;solvent fluorobenzene into the traditional AlCl3/1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride ionic liquid, in which the fluorobenzene (FB) mitigates electrostatic interactions between ions and facilitates the ion diffusion. The optimization principle for the mixed electrolyte is proposed based on maximizing the mass transportation, as indicated by the limiting current density. The optimized mixed electrolyte IL&#8208;FB (1:5) offers the highest limiting current density of 12&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, highly reversible plate/stripe of Al, and thus stable cycling for 7500 h with the high current density and capacity (8 mA cm&#8722;2, 8 mAh cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, IL&#8208;FB (1:5) also shows enhanced wettability for the polypropylene separator. The AIB with the polypropylene separator, exhibiting 60% decrease in cost, is achieved for the first time by using IL&#8208;FB (1:5), presenting a crucial step toward the initial practical application.

         <title>A Soft Nonpolar&#8208;Soluble Two&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite for General Construction of Mixed&#8208;Dimensional Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonpolar soluble 2D perovskite, noted as TPA2PbI4, is developed to construct controllable mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite heterojunctions without solid reactions with the initial 3D perovskite films. This strategy improves both the performance of small&#8208;area perovskite solar cells and large&#8208;area perovskite modules, promoting 30&#160;cm &#215; 30&#160;cm FAPbI3 perovskite submodules to achieve a certified efficiency of 22.06%.








Abstract
Constructing mixed&#8208;dimensional heterojunctions through ion exchange between functional organic ammonium halides and the already&#8208;deposited bulk 3D perovskite films is a widely adopted strategy to effectively passivate and stabilize perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Such process poses challenges in precisely controlling the composition and distribution of the heterojunctions across the film, in particular for large&#8208;area applications. Here, a soft 2D perovskite based on tetrapheptyl&#8208;ammonium iodide (TPAI), noted as TPA2PbI4 is reported. It is the first&#8208;reported nonpolar readily soluble 2D perovskite, leading to highly compact and oriented perovskite layers. In addition, this nonpolar soluble TPA2PbI4 is beneficial to universally construct thickness&#8208;controllable mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite heterojunctions to suppress the non&#8208;radiative recombination and promote charge&#8208;carrier transfer on all the FA&#8208;, MA&#8208; and CsPbI3 PSCs. Such a unique strategy is also suitable for upscaling fabrication, demonstrated by 30&#160;cm &#215; 30&#160;cm FAPbI3 perovskite submodules with a certified efficiency of 22.06%.

         <title>Molecular Design of Dimeric Acceptor Enables Binary Organic Solar Cells with 19.78% Efficiency and Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By optimizing building blocks and linking modes, a dimeric acceptor, named DY&#8208;FL, is innovatively designed and synthesized. Benefiting from the efficient molecular design strategy, DY&#8208;FL&#8208;based binary OSCs rendered an efficiency of 19.78%. Importantly, DY&#8208;FL&#8208;based devices showcased significantly enhanced photo/thermal stability in comparison to small molecule acceptor&#8208;based OSCs.








Abstract
The development of organic solar cells (OSCs) with high efficiency and stability is highly desirable to facilitate its commercial applications. Although dimeric acceptors with distinctive advantages have been widely studied, high&#8208;performance binary OSCs based on such molecules have rarely been achieved. In this work, a new dimeric acceptor (DY&#8208;FL) is constructed by simultaneously optimizing the linking sites and units, as well as the building blocks. Thanks to the effective molecular design, DY&#8208;FL provides improved molecular stacking for fibrous morphology with favorable exciton/charge dynamics. Consequently, DY&#8208;FL&#8208;based binary OSCs render a superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.78%, representing a record&#8208;breaking efficiency for binary OSCs based on dimeric acceptors. Importantly, DY&#8208;FL&#8208;based devices display significantly enhanced operational stability under external stimuli such as light and heat, in comparison to their small molecule acceptor (Y&#8208;F)&#8208;based counterpart. These findings highlight the significance of building blocks and linking modes, providing insight into the effective molecular design strategy of dimeric acceptors for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSCs.

         <title>Thermal Processing Creates Water&#8208;Stable PEDOT:PSS Films for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Instead of using chemical cross&#8211;linkers, it is shown that PEDOT:PSS thin films for bioelectronics become water&#8208;stable after a simple heat treatment. The heat treatment is compatible with a range of rigid and elastomeric substrates and films are stable in vivo for &gt;20 days. 2D and 3D PEDOT:PSS structures can be patterned by delivering heat with a focused femtosecond laser.









Abstract
Organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors have emerged as a key material for the development of bioelectronic devices due to their soft mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and high volumetric capacitance. In particular, PEDOT:PSS has become a choice material because it is highly conductive, easily processible, and commercially available. However, PEDOT:PSS is dispersible in water, leading to delamination of films when exposed to biological environments. For this reason, chemical cross&#8211;linking agents such as (3&#8208;glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GOPS) are used to stabilize PEDOT:PSS films in water, but at the cost of decreased electrical performance. Here, it is shown that PEDOT:PSS thin films become water&#8208;stable by simply baking at high temperatures (&gt;150 &#176;C) for a short time (&#8776; 2 min). It is shown that heat&#8208;treated PEDOT:PSS films are as stable as their chemically&#8208;cross&#8211;linked counterparts, with their performance maintained for &gt;20 days both in vitro and in vivo. The heat&#8208;treated films eliminate electrically insulating cross&#8211;linkers, resulting in a 3&#215; increase in volumetric capacitance. Applying thermal energy using a focused femtosecond laser enables direct patterning of 3D PEDOT:PSS microstructures. The thermal treatment method is compatible with a wide range of substrates and is readily substituted into existing workflows for manufacturing devices, enabling its rapid adoption in the field of bioelectronics.

         <title>Incorporating Ordered Indium Sites into Rhodium for Ultra&#8208;Low Potential Electrocatalytic Conversion of Ethylene Glycol to Glycolic Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating ordered oxyphilic In sites into Rh to form RhIn intermetallic compounds (IMCs) facilitates the ultra&#8208;low&#8208;potential electrooxidation of ethylene glycol into the high&#8208;value chemical, glycolic acid. The synthesized RhIn IMCs&#160;also exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Using RhIn&#160;IMCs as bifunctional catalysts, a two&#8208;electrode system is established for ethylene glycol electrooxidation coupled with hydrogen production.








Abstract
The upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) to glycolic acid (GA, a biodegradable polymer monomer) via electrocatalysis not only produces valuable chemicals but also mitigates plastic pollution. However, the current reports for electrooxidation of EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA usually operate at reaction potentials of &gt;1.0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), much higher than the theoretical potential (0.065 V vs RHE), resulting in substantial energy wastage. Herein, body&#8208;centered cubic RhIn intermetallic compounds (IMCs) anchored on carbon support (denoted as RhIn/C) are synthesized, which shows excellent performance for the EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA with an onset potential of only 0.35 V vs RHE, lower than the values reported in current literature. The catalyst also possesses satisfactory GA selectivity (85% at 0.65 V vs RHE). Experimental results combined with density functional theory calculations demonstrate that RhIn IMCs enhance the adsorption of EG and OH&#8722;, facilitating the generation of reactive oxygen species and thereby improving catalytic performance. RhIn/C also exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction, ensuring that it can be used as a bifunctional catalyst in the two&#8208;electrode system for EG electrooxidation coupled with hydrogen production. This work opens new avenues for reducing the energy consumption of electrocatalytic upcycling of PET&#8208;derived EG and clean energy production.

         <title>Kinetically Dormant Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathode During High&#8208;Voltage Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;rich layered cathode remains thermodynamically reversible but undergoes dramatic kinetic degradation at high voltage, leading to the commonly observed capacity loss that in fact can be recovered under kinetic&#8208;free conditions. Such kinetic dormant behavior highly synchronizes with the lattice strain evolution stemming from layered/rock&#8208;salt structural heterogeneity during charge.








Abstract
The degradation of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes during long&#8208;term operation at high voltage has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. Despite many post&#8208;mortem qualitative structural analyses, precise quantification of their individual and coupling contributions to the overall capacity degradation remains challenging. Here, by leveraging multiscale synchrotron X&#8208;ray probes, electron microscopy, and post&#8208;galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, the thermodynamically irreversible and kinetically reversible capacity loss is successfully deconvoluted in a polycrystalline LiNi0.83Mn0.1Co0.07O2 cathode during long&#8208;term charge/discharge cycling in full cell configuration. Contradicting the dramatic capacity loss, the layered structure remains highly alive even after 1000 cycles at 4.6 V while undergoing a three&#8208;order of magnitude reduction in the mass transfer kinetics, leading to almost fully recoverable capacity under kinetic&#8208;free conditions. Such kinetic dormant behavior after cycling is not simply ascribed to poor chemical diffusion by reconstructed cathode surface but highly synchronizes with the lattice strain evolution stemming from the structural heterogeneity between deeply delithiated layered and degraded rock&#8208;salt phases at high voltage. These findings deepen the degradation mechanism of high&#8208;voltage cathodes to achieve long&#8208;cycling and fast&#8208;charging performance.

         <title>Adhesives with Debonding&#8208;On&#8208;Demand Capability: Leveraging Responsive Microcapsules for Mechanically&#8208;Induced Debonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Debondable adhesives hold promise for advancing sustainable bonding solutions, yet their adoption is often constrained by synthetic challenges that limit practicality and scalability. This study demonstrates how encapsulated plasticizers can impart mechanically triggered debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand functionality to commercial adhesives. By offering a straightforward, adaptable approach, it advances the development of more sustainable, versatile adhesives with enhanced debonding capabilities.








Abstract
Temporary adhesives capable of forming strong yet easily reversible bonds are garnering significant interest as sustainable materials that facilitate the recycling and recovery of high&#8208;value components. Herein is presented a comprehensive design and parameterization framework for developing effective temporary adhesives with mechanically induced debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand capabilities. This framework is achieved by incorporating hexyl acetate&#8208;filled microcapsules into commercial polyvinyl acetate adhesives, creating a responsive adhesive composite. Under controlled compression, these microcapsules rupture precisely, releasing their contents to induce sufficient adhesive plasticization to enable effortless debonding. Our results indicate that while the inclusion of microcapsules affects adhesion strength and toughness, the overall mechanical performance remains stable across different concentrations. Thermal tests highlight a 50&#160;wt.% microcapsule concentration as optimal for enhanced plasticization, while compression tests show that an applied force of 5&#160;kN achieves maximum capsule rupture without compromising substrate integrity. Ultimately, specimens bonded with the responsive composite under compression exhibit a striking 1200% increase in creep rates compared to those bonded with the neat adhesive, allowing for effective debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand&#8212;an outcome unattainable with the neat adhesive.

&lt;p&gt;Debondable adhesives hold promise for advancing sustainable bonding solutions, yet their adoption is often constrained by synthetic challenges that limit practicality and scalability. This study demonstrates how encapsulated plasticizers can impart mechanically triggered debonding-on-demand functionality to commercial adhesives. By offering a straightforward, adaptable approach, it advances the development of more sustainable, versatile adhesives with enhanced debonding capabilities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temporary adhesives capable of forming strong yet easily reversible bonds are garnering significant interest as sustainable materials that facilitate the recycling and recovery of high-value components. Herein is presented a comprehensive design and parameterization framework for developing effective temporary adhesives with mechanically induced debonding-on-demand capabilities. This framework is achieved by incorporating hexyl acetate-filled microcapsules into commercial polyvinyl acetate adhesives, creating a responsive adhesive composite. Under controlled compression, these microcapsules rupture precisely, releasing their contents to induce sufficient adhesive plasticization to enable effortless debonding. Our results indicate that while the inclusion of microcapsules affects adhesion strength and toughness, the overall mechanical performance remains stable across different concentrations. Thermal tests highlight a 50&#160;wt.% microcapsule concentration as optimal for enhanced plasticization, while compression tests show that an applied force of 5&#160;kN achieves maximum capsule rupture without compromising substrate integrity. Ultimately, specimens bonded with the responsive composite under compression exhibit a striking 1200% increase in creep rates compared to those bonded with the neat adhesive, allowing for effective debonding-on-demand&#8212;an outcome unattainable with the neat adhesive. This simple and highly versatile approach lays the groundwork for advancing the development of more sustainable and functional adhesive materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pillared Laminar Vermiculite Membranes with Tunable Monovalent and Multivalent Ion Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alumina pillared vermiculite membrane is fabricated with a laminar structure. Enhanced water stability is observed due to the strengthened interlamellar binding. Through cation doping, the surface charge and pore size of the pillared laminar membrane are tuned, demonstrating highly selective and tunable ion sieving performance promising for water treatment and resource recovery applications.








Abstract
Effective membrane separation of Li+ from Na+ and Mg2+ is crucial for lithium extraction from water yet challenging for conventional polymeric membranes. Two dimensional (2D)&#160;membranes with ordered laminar structures and tunable physicochemical properties offer distinctive ion&#8208;sieving capabilities promising for lithium extraction. Recently, phyllosilicates are introduced as abundant and cost&#8208;effective source materials for such membranes. However, their water instability and low inherent ion transport selectivity hinder practical applications. Herein, a new class of laminar membranes with excellent stability and tunable ion sieving is reported by incorporating inorganic alumina pillars into vermiculite interlayers. Crosslinking vermiculite flakes with alumina pillars significantly strengthens interlamellar interactions, resulting in robust water stability. Doping of Na+ before the pillaring process reverses the membrane's surface charge, substantially boosting Li+ separation from multivalent cations via electrostatic interactions. Lithium extraction is often complicated by the presence of co&#8208;existing monovalent cations (e.g., Na+) at higher concentrations. Here, by introducing excess Na+ into the membrane after the pillaring process, the separation of Li+ from monovalent cations is enhanced through steric effects. This work realizes both monovalent/multivalent and monovalent/monovalent selective ion sieving with the same membrane platform. A separation mechanism is proposed based on Donnan exclusion and size exclusion, providing new insights for membrane design for resource recovery applications.
