         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Guided, rAAV&#8208;Mediated IGF&#8208;I Overexpression Enables Long&#8208;Term Cartilage Repair and Protection against Perifocal Osteoarthritis in a Large&#8208;Animal Full&#8208;Thickness Chondral Defect Model at One Year In Vivo</title>

Alginate&#8208;hydrogel&#8208;guided delivery of a recombinant adeno&#8208;associated virus vector coding for a human insulin&#8208;like growth factor I (IGF&#8208;I) gene sequence (IGF&#8208;I/AlgPH155) safely enhances the repair of full&#8208;thickness chondral defects and reduces perifocal osteoarthritis and inflammation in minipigs in vivo over one year via effective IGF&#8208;I overexpression relative to control (reporter lacZ/AlgPH155) vector delivery.








Abstract
The regeneration of focal articular cartilage defects is complicated by the reduced quality of the repair tissue and the potential development of perifocal osteoarthritis (OA). Biomaterial&#8208;guided gene therapy may enhance cartilage repair by controlling the release of therapeutic sequences in a spatiotemporal manner. Here, the benefits of delivering a recombinant adeno&#8208;associated virus (rAAV) vector coding for the human insulin&#8208;like growth factor I (IGF&#8208;I) via an alginate hydrogel (IGF&#8208;I/AlgPH155) to enhance repair of full&#8208;thickness chondral defects following microfracture surgery after one year in minipigs versus control (lacZ/AlgPH155) treatment are reported. Sustained IGF&#8208;I overexpression is significantly achieved in the repair tissue of defects treated with IGF&#8208;I/AlgPH155 versus those receiving lacZ/AlgPH155 for one year and in the cartilage surrounding the defects. Administration of IGF&#8208;I/AlgPH155 significantly improves parameters of cartilage repair at one year relative to lacZ/AlgPH155 (semiquantitative total histological score, cell densities, matrix deposition) without deleterious or immune reactions. Remarkably, delivery of IGF&#8208;I/AlgPH155 also significantly reduces perifocal OA and inflammation after one year versus lacZ/AlgPH155 treatment. Biomaterial&#8208;guided rAAV gene transfer represents a valuable clinical approach to promote cartilage repair and to protect against OA.

         <title>Reverse&#8208;Engineering Strain in Nanocrystallites by Tracking Trimerons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tracking the orbital molecule formation through the Verwey transition temperature (TV) in nanorods provides a unique window into nanocrystallite strain. Particles with uniaxial tensile strain show the highest TV = 150&#160;K reported to date.








Abstract
Although strain underpins the behavior of many transition&#8208;oxide&#8208;based magnetic nanomaterials, it is elusive to quantify. Since the formation of orbital molecules is sensitive to strain, a metal&#8211;insulator transition should be a window into nanocrystallite strain. Using three sizes of differently strained Fe3O4 polycrystalline nanorods, the impact of strain on the Verwey transition and the associated formation and dissolution processes of quasiparticle trimerons is tracked. In 40 and 50&#160;nm long nanorods, increasing isotropic strain results in Verwey transitions going from TV &#8776; 60 K to 20&#160;K. By contrast, 700&#160;nm long nanorods with uniaxial strain along the (110) direction have TV &#8776; 150&#160;K&#8212;the highest value reported thus far. A metal&#8211;insulator transition, like TV in Fe3O4, can be used to determine the effective strain within nanocrystallites, thus providing new insights into nanoparticle properties and nanomagnetism.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Triggered Self&#8208;Healing Flexible Perovskite Photodetectors with Excellent Mechanical Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A moisture&#8208;triggered self&#8208;healing flexible perovskite photodetector is presented. The lateral photodetector shows a high responsivity of 11.3&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and a good stability to both moisture and mechanical damage. Meanwhile, damaged perovskite film can repair cracks with the assistance of a poly(vinyl alcohol) microscaffold under a humid environment and recover to 90% of its initial performance for several cycles.








Abstract
Flexible devices are urgently required to meet the demands of next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices and metal halide perovskites are proven to be suitable materials for realizing flexible photovoltaic devices. However, the tolerance to moisture corrosion and repeated mechanical bending remains a critical challenge for flexible perovskite devices. Herein, a self&#8208;healing formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) film is fabricated to cure mechanical damage by absorbing moisture from the surrounding environment. A poly(vinyl alcohol) microscaffold is designed not only to stabilize the black phase of the FAPbI3 film but also to endow it with self&#8208;healing ability in a humid environment. The photodetector based on a self&#8208;healing film exhibits a high responsivity of 11.3&#160;A W&#8722;1 and recovers to over 90% of the initial responsivity after the self&#8208;healing process. This work provides an effective self&#8208;healing strategy to stabilize the operation of flexible perovskite devices under normal high&#8208;humidity environmental conditions.

         <title>Tunable Electrocatalytic Behavior of Sodiated MoS2 Active Sites toward Efficient Sulfur Redox Reactions in Room&#8208;Temperature Na&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elaborate multifunctional S cathode achieves superior electrochemical performance and prolonged cycling lifespan in room&#8208;temperature Na&#8211;S batteries. Beyond the physical confinement and chemical binding of polarized N&#8208;doped carbonaceous microflowers, the MoS2 active sites play a key role in catalyzing polysulfide redox reactions, and the electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 can be tunable via adjusting the discharge depth.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature (RT) sodium&#8211;sulfur (Na&#8211;S) batteries hold great promise for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the advantages of high energy density, low cost, and resource abundance. The research progress on RT Na&#8211;S batteries, however, has been greatly hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the sulfur redox reactions. Herein, an elaborate multifunctional architecture, consisting of N&#8208;doped carbon skeletons and tunable MoS2 sulfiphilic sites, is fabricated via a simple one&#8208;pot reaction followed by in situ sulfurization. Beyond the physical confinement and chemical binding of polarized N&#8208;doped carbonaceous microflowers, the MoS2 active sites play a key role in catalyzing polysulfide redox reactions, especially the conversion from long&#8208;chain Na2Sn (4 &#8804; n&#160;&#8804; 8) to short&#8208;chain Na2S2 and Na2S. Significantly, the electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 can be tunable via adjusting the discharge depth. It is remarkable that the sodiated MoS2 exhibits much stronger binding energy and electrocatalytic behavior compared to MoS2 sites, effectively enhancing the formation of the final Na2S product. Consequently, the S cathode achieves superior electrochemical performance in RT Na&#8211;S batteries, delivering a high capacity of 774.2 mAh g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, and an ultrahigh capacity retention with a capacity decay rate of only 0.0055% per cycle over 2800 cycles.

&lt;/i&gt; (4 &#8804; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8804; 8) to short&#8208;chain Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. Significantly, the electrocatalytic activity of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be tunable via adjusting the discharge depth. It is remarkable that the sodiated MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits much stronger binding energy and electrocatalytic behavior compared to MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sites, effectively enhancing the formation of the final Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S product. Consequently, the S cathode achieves superior electrochemical performance in RT Na&#8211;S batteries, delivering a high capacity of 774.2 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 800 cycles at 0.2 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and an ultrahigh capacity retention with a capacity decay rate of only 0.0055% per cycle over 2800 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>MBene as a Theranostic Nanoplatform for Photocontrolled Intratumoral Retention and Drug Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D zirconium boride nanosheets (ZBNs) are developed as a versatile drug delivery nanoplatform to realize near infrared (NIR)&#8208;controlled intratumoral retention and drug release by the photopyrolysis of borate ester on the surface. Combined chemothermal/gasothermal therapies based on ZBN eradicate primary tumors and interdict tumor metastasis by changing the tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;targeted drug delivery by nanomaterials is important to improve tumor therapy efficacy and reduce toxic side effects, but its efficiency is quite limited. In this work, a new type of MBene, zirconium boride nanosheet (ZBN), as a versatile nanoplatform to realize near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;controlled intratumoral retention and drug release is developed. ZBN exhibits high NIR&#8208;photothermal conversion efficiency (76.8%), surface modification with hyaluronic acid (HA) by polyol&#8722;borate esterfication endows ZBN&#8208;HA with good dispersion, and the photopyrolysis of borate ester causes HA detachment and ZBN aggregation, enabling NIR&#8208;controlled intratumoral retention to achieve high intratumoral accumulation. By virtue of surface borate esterfication, polyol chemotherapeutic drug (doxorubicin, DOX), and NO prodrug (&#946;&#8208;galactosyl&#8208;diazeniumdiolate, Gal&#8208;NO) can be efficiently and stably conjugated on the surface of ZBN&#8208;HA (1.21&#160;g DOX or 0.57&#160;g Gal&#8208;NO per gram ZBN) without visible drug leakage, and the photopyrolysis of borate ester enables NIR&#8208;controlled drug release with high responsiveness and controllability. Combined chemothermal/gasothermal therapies based on ZBN&#8208;HA/DOX and ZBN&#8208;HA/NO nanomedicines eradicate primary tumors and interdict tumor metastasis by changing the tumor microenvironment and killing cancer cells in primary tumors. The developed NIR&#8208;photothermal MBene is confirmed as a versatile nanoplatform capable of high&#8208;efficacy tumor&#8208;targeted drug delivery and controlled drug release.

         <title>Anomalous Motion of Charged Domain Walls and Associated Negative Capacitance in Copper&#8211;Chlorine Boracite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
During switching, specific charged 90&#176; domain walls in copper&#8211;chlorine boracite are seen to move in the opposite direction to that expected, increasing the size of the domain in which polarization is anti&#8208;aligned with the applied electric field. Polarization&#8211;field hysteresis loops show negative gradients and measured switching currents confirm the negative&#8208;capacitance contribution to the overall dielectric response.








Abstract
During switching, the microstructure of a ferroelectric normally adapts to align internal dipoles with external electric fields. Favorably oriented dipolar regions (domains) grow at the expense of those in unfavorable orientations and this is manifested in a predictable field&#8208;induced motion of the walls that separate one domain from the next. Here, the discovery that specific charged 90&#176;domain walls in copper&#8211;chlorine boracite move in the opposite direction to that expected, increasing the size of the domain in which polarization is anti&#8208;aligned with the applied field, is reported. Polarization&#8211;field (P&#8211;E) hysteresis loops, inferred from optical imaging, show negative gradients and non&#8208;transient negative capacitance, throughout the P&#8211;E cycle. Switching currents (generated by the relative motion between domain walls and sensing electrodes) confirm this, insofar as their signs are opposite to those expected conventionally. For any given bias, the integrated switching charge due to this anomalous wall motion is directly proportional to time, indicating that the magnitude of the negative capacitance component should be inversely related to frequency. This passes Jonscher's test for the misinterpretation of positive inductance and gives confidence that field&#8208;induced motion of these specific charged domain walls generates a measurable negative capacitance contribution to the overall dielectric response.

         <title>Time&#8208;Dependent Phosphorescence Colors from Carbon Dots for Advanced Dynamic Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) change from orange to green is realized in carbon dots (CDs) for advanced dynamic information encryption. The TDPC arises from the dual phosphorescence centers of the CDs having different decay rates, which can be simultaneously activated by irradiating with a suitable light energy (around 395 nm).








Abstract
The development of phosphorescent materials with time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence colors (TDPCs) is of considerable interest for application in advanced dynamic information encryption. In this study, TDPC is realized in carbon dots (CDs) synthesized by the one&#8208;pot hydrothermal treatment of levofloxacin. CD ink printed on paper (CD@paper) exhibits a change in phosphorescence color from orange to green, 1 s after irradiation with 395 nm light. However, when irradiated with wavelengths shorter or longer than 395 nm, the CD@paper exhibits only green or red phosphorescence, respectively. The red and green phosphorescence originates from the low&#8208;energy surface oxide triplet state and high&#8208;energy N&#8208;related triplet state, respectively. When irradiated with a suitable light energy (around 395 nm wavelength), the two phosphorescent centers can be simultaneously activated, emitting red and green phosphorescence with different decay rates. The red and green phosphorescence merge into an orange phosphorescence initially, exhibiting the TDPC phenomenon. Based on the unusual phosphorescent properties of the CDs, a kind of multilevel, dynamic phosphorescence colored 3D code is designed for advanced dynamic information encryption.

         <title>Boosting Wide&#8208;Range Tunable Long&#8208;Afterglow in 1D Metal&#8211;Organic Halide Micro/Nanocrystals for Space/Time&#8208;Resolved Information Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
New metal&#8211;organic halide micro/nanocrystals with tunable afterglow luminescence, which exhibit excitation&#8208;dependent optical waveguide properties across a wide color range, as well as space/time dual&#8208;resolved afterglow, are developed. They have great potential in wavelength&#8208;division multiplexing information photonics and optical logic gates.








Abstract
Molecular afterglow materials with ultralong&#8208;lived excited states have attracted considerable interest owing to their promise for light&#8208;emitting devices, optical imaging, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications. However, the realization of ultralong afterglow emission in low&#8208;dimensional micro/nanostructures has remained an open challenge, limiting progress toward new&#8208;generation photonic applications. In this work, new types of mono/binuclear metal&#8211;organic halide micro/nanocrystals with tunable afterglow properties, made possibly by the rational control over both ultralong&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence, are developed. Interestingly, the mono/binuclear coordination complexes present excitation&#8208;dependent luminescence across a wide range (wavelength &gt; 150&#160;nm) with broad emission color differences from blue to yellow owing to the multiple long&#8208;lived excited states. The 1D binuclear metal&#8211;organic microrods further exhibit excitation&#8208;dependent optical waveguide and space/time dual&#8208;resolved afterglow emission properties, endowing them with great potential in wavelength&#8208;division multiplexing information photonics and logic gates. Therefore, this work not only communicates the first example of wide&#8208;range tunable ultralong afterglow of low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic micro/nanocrystals under ambient conditions but also provides a new route to achieve optical communications and photonic logic compilation at the micro/nanoscale.

Therefore, this work not only communicates the first example of wide&#8208;range tunable ultralong afterglow of low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic micro/nanocrystals under ambient conditions but also provides a new route to achieve optical communications and photonic logic compilation at the micro/nanoscale.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Significantly Improving the Bioefficacy for Rheumatoid Arthritis with Supramolecular Nanoformulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of active nanotherapeutic formulations employing genetically engineered interleukin1 receptor antagonist (IL1ra) protein complexes is developed through a non&#8208;covalent supramolecular assemble approach. Extraordinary bioavailability and ultralong&#8208;acting pharmacokinetics are realized for long&#8208;acting rheumatoid arthritis therapy.








Abstract
As a typical inflammatory disease with chronic pain syndromes, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) generally requires long&#8208;term treatment with frequent injection administration at 1&#8211;2 times per day, because common medications such as interleukin1 receptor antagonist (IL1ra) have poor bioavailability and very limited half&#8208;life residence. Here a novel strategy to fabricate nanotherapeutic formulations employing genetically engineered IL1ra protein complexes, yielding ultralong&#8208;lasting bioefficacy is developed rationally. Using rat models, it is shown that these nanotherapeutics significantly improved drug regimen to a single subcutaneous administration in a 14&#8208;day therapy, suggesting their extraordinary bioavailability and ultralong&#8208;acting pharmacokinetics. Specifically, the half&#8208;life and bioavailability of the nanoformulations are boosted to the level of 30 h and by 7 times, respectively, significantly greater than other systems. This new strategy thus holds great promise to potently improve patient compliance in RA therapy, and it can be adapted for other therapies that suffer similar drawbacks.

         <title>Non&#8208;Solvent Induced Phase Separation Enables Designer Redox Flow Battery Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;solvent induced phase separation is introduced as a versatile and facile method to synthesize redox flow battery electrodes with hierarchical microstructures unachievable via conventional manufacturing approaches. Flow cell studies reveal that the novel materials can outperform conventional carbon fiber electrodes owing to better mass transfer and higher surface area, demonstrating that this method may enable new classes of porous electrodes tailored for particular electrochemical flow technologies.








Abstract
Porous carbonaceous electrodes are performance&#8208;defining components in redox flow batteries (RFBs), where their properties impact the efficiency, cost, and durability of the system. The overarching challenge is to simultaneously fulfill multiple seemingly contradictory requirements&#8212;i.e., high surface area, low pressure drop, and facile mass transport&#8212;without sacrificing scalability or manufacturability. Here, non&#8208;solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) is proposed as a versatile method to synthesize tunable porous structures suitable for use as RFB electrodes. The variation of the relative concentration of scaffold&#8208;forming polyacrylonitrile to pore&#8208;forming poly(vinylpyrrolidone) is demonstrated to result in electrodes with distinct microstructure and porosity. Tomographic microscopy, porosimetry, and spectroscopy are used to characterize the 3D structure and surface chemistry. Flow cell studies with two common redox species (i.e., all&#8208;vanadium and Fe2+/3+) reveal that the novel electrodes can outperform traditional carbon fiber electrodes. It is posited that the bimodal porous structure, with interconnected large (&gt;50 &#181;m) macrovoids in the through&#8208;plane direction and smaller (&lt;5 &#181;m) pores throughout, provides a favorable balance between offsetting traits. Although nascent, the NIPS synthesis approach has the potential to serve as a technology platform for the development of porous electrodes specifically designed to enable electrochemical flow technologies.

         <title>From Lingering to Rift: Metasurface Decoupling for Near&#8208; and Far&#8208;Field Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabled with independent control of the amplitude and phase of light, a general platform is proposed for completely decoupling the near&#8208; and far&#8208;field functionalities of metasurfaces. As a paradigm, a single&#8208;cell metasurface implementing the dual&#8208;functions of a metalens and a nanoprint is demonstrated; high&#8208;performance characteristics are demonstrated for both functions.








Abstract
Metasurfaces, simultaneously operating in near&#8208; and far&#8208;fields, can be employed as a promising candidate to implement different functions, thus significantly improving the information density, security, and system integration. Recent works have showcased some approaches for decoupling&#8208;at&#8208;large between near&#8208; and far&#8208;field functionalities, but unfortunately, their coupling effects are just reduced and mitigated to some extent rather than eradicated, which in turn leads to the performance limitation of metadevices. Herein, we propose a general platform for the complete rift between near&#8208; and far&#8208;field functionalities, enabled by strictly decoupled manipulation of optical amplitude and phase, leading to their distinct functions in the near&#8208; and far&#8208;fields, respectively. This concept is experimentally demonstrated by integrating the functions of a phase&#8208;only metalens and an amplitude&#8208;only grayscale&#8208;imaging nanoprint into a single&#8208;cell metasurface. Because of their completely decoupled functions, both meta&#8208;elements show high&#8208;performance characteristics, i.e., imaging quality close to the diffraction limit and high&#8208;definition grayscale&#8208;imaging with resolution as high as 63&#160;500 dots per inch (dpi). The validated recipe may empower advanced explorations and applications in highly integrated nano&#8208;optoelectronics requiring high performance and less crosstalk.

         <title>Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly&#8208;Facilitated Aggregation of Tumor&#8208;Specific Transmembrane Receptors for Signaling Activation and Converting Immunologically Cold to Hot Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular self&#8208;assembling peptide&#8208;based molecule&#8208;targeted anticancer agent (named DBT&#8208;2FFGYSA) is designed and synthesized, which can precisely visualize transmembrane EphA2 receptors in a fluorescence turn&#8208;on manner, selectively kill EphA2 receptor&#8208;overexpressed cancer cells through making the receptors form large aggregates that activate antitumorigenic signaling, and effectively convert immunologically cold tumors to hot by recruiting tumor&#8208;infiltrating T cells.








Abstract
Supramolecular self&#8208;assembling peptide systems are attracting increasing interest in the field of cancer theranostics. Additionally, transformation of the immunologically cold tumor microenvironment into hot is of great importance for obtaining high antitumor responses for most immunotherapies. However, as far as it is known, there are nearly no studies on self&#8208;assembling peptides reported to be able to convert cold to hot tumors. Herein, a self&#8208;assembling peptide&#8208;based cancer theranostic agent (named DBT&#8208;2FFGYSA) is designed and synthesized, which can target tumor&#8208;specific transmembrane Eph receptor A2 (EphA2) receptors selectively and make the receptors form large aggregates. Such aggregate formation promotes the cross&#8208;phosphorylations among EphA2 receptors, leading to signal transduction of antitumor pathway. As a consequence, DBT&#8208;2FFGYSA can not only visualize EphA2 receptors in a fluorescence turn&#8208;on manner, but also specifically suppress the EphA2 receptor&#8208;overexpressed cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. What is more, DBT&#8208;2FFGYSA also serves as an effective agent to convert immunologically cold tumors to hot by inducing the immunogenic cell death of EphA2 receptor&#8208;overexpressed cancer cells and recruiting massive tumor&#8208;infiltrating T cells. This study, thus, introduces a new category of agents capable of converting cold to hot tumors by pure supramolecular self&#8208;assembly without any aid of known anticancer drugs.

PdRuIr ternary solid&#8208;solution alloy nanoparticles exhibit highly durable and active three&#8208;way catalyst performance. This work provides insights into the design of highly durable and efficient functional alloy catalysts, guiding how to best take advantage of the configurational entropy in addition to the mixing enthalpy.








Abstract
Since 1970, people have been making every endeavor to reduce toxic emissions from automobiles. After the development of a three&#8208;way catalyst (TWC) that concurrently converts three harmful gases, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HCs), and nitrogen oxides (NOx), Rh became an essential element in automobile technology because only Rh works efficiently for catalytic NOx reduction. However, due to the sharp price spike in 2007, numerous efforts have been made to replace Rh in TWCs. Nevertheless, Rh remains irreplaceable, and now, the price of Rh is increasing significantly again. Here, it is demonstrated that PdRuM ternary solid&#8208;solution alloy nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit highly durable and active TWC performance, which will result in a significant reduction in catalyst cost compared to Rh. This work provides insights into the design of highly durable and efficient functional alloy NPs, guiding how to best take advantage of the configurational entropy in addition to the mixing enthalpy.

         <title>Programmable Design and Performance of Modular Magnetic Microswimmers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic micromodules of customized shape and position assemble to form flexible microswimmers. Through educated design, the swimming speed is optimized and the study of flocks of swimmers reveals new interactions between co&#8208;moving magnetic beaters at the low Reynolds number limit.








Abstract
Synthetic biomimetic microswimmers are promising agents for in vivo healthcare and important frameworks to advance the understanding of locomotion strategies and collective motion at the microscopic scale. Nevertheless, constructing these devices with design flexibility and in large numbers remains a challenge. Here, a step toward meeting this challenge is taken by assembling such swimmers via the programmed shape and arrangement of superparamagnetic micromodules. The method's capacity for design flexibility is demonstrated through the assembly of a variety of swimmer architectures. On their actuation, strokes characterized by a balance of viscous and magnetic forces are found in all cases, but swimmers formed from a series of size&#8208;graded triangular modules swim quicker than more traditional designs comprising a circular &#8220;head&#8221; and a slender tail. Linking performance to design, rules are extracted informing the construction of a second&#8208;generation swimmer with a short tail and an elongated head optimized for speed. Its fast locomotion is attributed to a stroke that better breaks beating symmetry and an ability to beat fully with flex at high frequencies. Finally, production at scale is demonstrated through the assembly and swimming of a flock of the triangle&#8208;based architectures to reveal four types of swimmer couplings.

         <title>Luminescent Erbium&#8208;Doped Silicon Thin Films for Advanced Anti&#8208;Counterfeit Labels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of security label based on downconversion photoluminescence from erbium&#8208;doped silicon is demonstrated. For fabrication of these labels, a femtosecond laser is applied to selectively irradiate Er/Si thin film and incorporate Er ions into the silicon matrix. The labels are realized by the single&#8208;step selective femtosecond&#8208;laser writing of luminescent areas or addition of chemical etching and laser writing of non&#8208;luminescent holes over the initially recorded image.








Abstract
The never&#8208;ending struggle against counterfeit demands the constant development of security labels and their fabrication methods. This study demonstrates a novel type of security label based on downconversion photoluminescence from erbium&#8208;doped silicon. For fabrication of these labels, a femtosecond laser is applied to selectively irradiate a double&#8208;layered Er/Si thin film, which is accomplished by Er incorporation into a silicon matrix and silicon&#8208;layer crystallization. The study of laser&#8208;induced heating demonstrates that it creates optically active erbium centers in silicon, providing stable and enhanced photoluminescence at 1530 nm. Such a technique is utilized to create two types of anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels. The first type is realized by the single&#8208;step direct laser writing of luminescent areas and detected by optical microscopy as holes in the film forming the desired image. The second type, with a higher degree of security, is realized by adding other fabrication steps, including the chemical etching of the Er layer and laser writing of additional non&#8208;luminescent holes over an initially recorded image. During laser excitation at 525 nm of luminescent holes of the labels, a photoluminescent picture repeating desired data can be seen. The proposed labels are easily scalable and perspective for labeling of goods, securities, and luxury&#160;items.

         <title>A Wetting&#8208;Enabled&#8208;Transfer (WET) Strategy for Precise Surface Patterning of Organohydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general wetting&#8208;enabled&#8208;transfer (WET) strategy is developed to construct discretionary shape&#8208;defined surface patterns of organohydrogels along with their monolithic formation either from flat to curved surfaces or from microscale to macroscale. The surface&#8208;patterned organohydrogels show excellent solvent resistance and mechanical properties, and can act as a soft printing template to transfer intact and robust patterns on hydrogel surfaces.








Abstract
The ability to manipulate water and oil phases in a designable manner is of great significance in widespread fields from art paintings to materials science. However, achieving precise and stable surface patterns for two immiscible phases of water and oil remains a challenge. Herein, a general wetting&#8208;enabled&#8208;transfer (WET) strategy is reported to construct discretionary shape&#8208;defined surface patterns of organohydrogels along with their monolithic formation either from flat to curved surfaces or from the microscale to the macroscale. Locally differentiated wettability induces hydrophilic monomers and hydrophobic monomers from an emulsion system onto the wettability&#8208;matching regions of the prepatterned substrates, subsequently forming corresponding hydrogel and organogel patterns on the organohydrogel surface after in situ photopolymerization. The precision of the surface patterns can be controlled by optimizing the gel monomers, emulsion droplet size, and surface chemical composition of the prepatterned substrates. This finding may provide a feasible strategy for precisely patterning functional materials from two&#8208;immiscible&#8208;phase systems.

         <title>CoPSe: A New Ternary Anode Material for Stable and High&#8208;Rate Sodium/Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;phase ternary cobalt phosphoselenide nanoparticles embedded in a layered metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped carbon matrix (CoPSe/NC) are fabricated through in situ synchronous phosphorization/selenization reactions using the MOF as both a template and precursor. The CoPSe/NC anode holds a set of intrinsic merits relative to its counterparts of CoSe2 or CoPS, representing an ultrastable, high&#8208;rate, and high&#8208;energy anode material for sodium/potassium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The exploration of ideal electrode materials overcoming the critical problems of large electrode volume changes and sluggish redox kinetics induced by large ionic radius of Na+/K+ ions is highly desirable for sodium/potassium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs/PIBs) toward large&#8208;scale applications. The present work demonstrates that single&#8208;phase ternary cobalt phosphoselenide (CoPSe) in the form of nanoparticles embedded in a layered metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped carbon matrix (CoPSe/NC) represents an ultrastable and high&#8208;rate anode material for SIBs/PIBs. The CoPSe/NC is fabricated by using the MOF as both a template and precursor, coupled with in situ synchronous phosphorization/selenization reactions. The CoPSe anode holds a set of intrinsic merits such as lower mechanical stress, enhanced reaction kinetics, as well as higher theoretical capacity and lower discharge voltage relative to its counterpart of CoSe2, and suppressed shuttle effect with higher intrinsic electrical conductivity relative to CoPS. The involved mechanisms are evidenced by substantial characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Consequently, the CoPSe/NC anode shows an outstanding long&#8208;cycle stability and rate performance for SIBs and PIBs. Moreover, the CoPSe/NC&#8208;based Na&#8208;ion full cell can achieve a higher energy density of 274&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, surpassing that based on CoSe2/NC and most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Na&#8208;ion full cells based on P&#8208;, Se&#8208;, or S&#8208;containing binary/ternary anodes to date.

&lt;p&gt;Single&#8208;phase ternary cobalt phosphoselenide nanoparticles embedded in a layered metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped carbon matrix (CoPSe/NC) are fabricated through in situ synchronous phosphorization/selenization reactions using the MOF as both a template and precursor. The CoPSe/NC anode holds a set of intrinsic merits relative to its counterparts of CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or CoPS, representing an ultrastable, high&#8208;rate, and high&#8208;energy anode material for sodium/potassium&#8208;ion batteries.


&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exploration of ideal electrode materials overcoming the critical problems of large electrode volume changes and sluggish redox kinetics induced by large ionic radius of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions is highly desirable for sodium/potassium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs/PIBs) toward large&#8208;scale applications. The present work demonstrates that single&#8208;phase ternary cobalt phosphoselenide (CoPSe) in the form of nanoparticles embedded in a layered metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped carbon matrix (CoPSe/NC) represents an ultrastable and high&#8208;rate anode material for SIBs/PIBs. The CoPSe/NC is fabricated by using the MOF as both a template and precursor, coupled with in situ synchronous phosphorization/selenization reactions. The CoPSe anode holds a set of intrinsic merits such as lower mechanical stress, enhanced reaction kinetics, as well as higher theoretical capacity and lower discharge voltage relative to its counterpart of CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and suppressed shuttle effect with higher intrinsic electrical conductivity relative to CoPS. The involved mechanisms are evidenced by substantial characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Consequently, the CoPSe/NC anode shows an outstanding long&#8208;cycle stability and rate performance for SIBs and PIBs. Moreover, the CoPSe/NC&#8208;based Na&#8208;ion full cell can achieve a higher energy density of 274&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing that based on CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NC and most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Na&#8208;ion full cells based on P&#8208;, Se&#8208;, or S&#8208;containing binary/ternary anodes to date.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Flexible Noncontact Sensing for Human&#8211;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible noncontact sensing based on a high&#8208;sensitivity humidity sensor is realized by anchoring multilayer graphene (MG) into electrospun polyamide (PA) 66 for human&#8211;machine interaction systems, which can achieve not only asthma detection, via monitoring the respiration rate in real time, and remote alarm systems, but also touchless interfaces in medicine delivery for bedridden patients.








Abstract
From typical electrical appliances to thriving intelligent robots, the exchange of information between humans and machines has mainly relied on the contact sensor medium. However, this kind of contact interaction can cause severe problems, such as inevitable mechanical wear and cross&#8208;infection of bacteria or viruses between the users, especially during the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Therefore, revolutionary noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction (HMI) is highly desired in remote online detection and noncontact control systems. In this study, a flexible high&#8208;sensitivity humidity sensor and array are presented, fabricated by anchoring multilayer graphene (MG) into electrospun polyamide (PA) 66. The sensor works in noncontact mode for asthma detection, via monitoring the respiration rate in real time, and remote alarm systems and provides touchless interfaces in medicine delivery for bedridden patients. The physical structure of the large specific surface area and the chemical structure of the abundant water&#8208;absorbing functional groups of the PA66 nanofiber networks contribute to the high performance synergistically. This work can lead to a new era of noncontact HMI without the risk of contagiousness and provide a general and effective strategy for the development of smart electronics that require noncontact interaction.

         <title>An Ultrasoft Self&#8208;Fused Supramolecular Polymer Hydrogel for Completely Preventing Postoperative Tissue Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
One more methylene makes a difference: introducing one extra methylene between two amides in the side chain of poly(N&#8208;acryloyl alaninamide) weakens the H&#8208;bonding interaction, resulting in an ultrasoft and highly swollen supramolecular polymer hydrogel that can be tuned to form a transient network with a self&#8208;fused and antifouling ability, which is harnessed to completely prevent postoperative tissue adhesion.








Abstract
The intermolecular H&#8208;bonding density heavily influences the gelation and rheological behavior of hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymer hydrogels, thus offering a delicate pathway to tailor their physicochemical properties for meeting a specific biomedical application. Herein, one methylene spacer between two amides in the side chain of N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide (NAGA) is introduced to generate a variant monomer, N&#8208;acryloyl alaninamide (NAAA). Polymerization of NAAA in aqueous solution affords an unprecedented ultrasoft and highly swollen supramolecular polymer hydrogel due to weakened H&#8208;bonds caused by an extra methylene spacer, which is verified by variable&#8208;temperature Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and simulation calculation. Intriguingly, poly(N&#8208;acryloyl alaninamide) (PNAAA) hydrogel can be tuned to form a transient network with a self&#8208;fused and excellent antifouling capability that results from the weakened dual amide H&#8208;bonding interactions and enhanced water&#8208;amide H&#8208;bonding interactions. This self&#8208;fused PNAAA hydrogel can completely inhibit postoperative abdominal adhesion and recurrent adhesion after adhesiolysis in vivo. This transient hydrogel network allows for its disintegration and excretion from the body. The molecular mechanism studies reveal the signal pathway of PNAAA hydrogel in inhibiting inflammatory response and regulating fibrinolytic system balance. This self&#8208;fused, antifouling ultrasoft supramolecular hydrogel is promising as a barrier biomaterial for completely preventing postoperative tissue adhesion.

         <title>General and Robust Photothermal&#8208;Heating&#8208;Enabled High&#8208;Efficiency Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deposited Co3O4 thin films manifest a compelling photothermal effect upon exposure to near&#8208;infrared irradiation and raises the temperature of both inner BiVO4 nanoworms and outer FeOOH/NiOOH cocatalyst in situ, thereby leading to superior photocurrent density of 6.34&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 at 1.23 VRHE in a judiciously designed NiOOH/FeOOH/Co3O4/BiVO4 photoanode.








Abstract
The ability of photoanodes to simultaneously tailor light absorption, charge separation, and water oxidation processes represents an important endeavor toward highly efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Here, a robust strategy is reported to render markedly improved PEC water splitting via sandwiching a photothermal Co3O4 layer between a BiVO4 photoanode film and an FeOOH/NiOOH electrocatalyst sheet. The deposited Co3O4 layer manifests compelling photothermal effect upon near&#8208;infrared irradiation and raises the temperature of the photoanodes in situ, leading to extended light absorption, enhanced charge transfer, and accelerated water oxidation kinetics simultaneously. The judiciously designed NiOOH/FeOOH/Co3O4/BiVO4 photoanode renders a superior photocurrent density of 6.34&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 at 1.23&#160;V versus a reversible reference electrode (VRHE) with outstanding applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency of 2.72% at 0.6&#160;VRHE. In addition to the metal oxide, a wide variety of metal sulfides, nitrides, and phosphides (e.g., CoS, CoN, and CoP) can be exploited as the heaters to yield high&#8208;performance BiVO4&#8208;based photoanodes. Apart from BiVO4, other metal oxides (e.g., Fe2O3 and TiO2) can also be covered by photothermal materials to impart significantly promoted water splitting. This simple yet general strategy provides a unique platform to capitalize on their photothermal characteristics to engineer high&#8208;performing energy conversion and storage materials and devices.

         <title>In Situ Ultrafast and Patterned Growth of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides from Inkjet&#8208;Printed Aqueous Precursors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area patterned transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) films with centimeter size and good controllability of the thickness and TMDC heterostructures are achieved by a facile, low&#8208;cost strategy involving printing using an industrial inkjet&#8208;printer with precisely tuned inkjet&#8208;printing parameters followed by a rapid heating process. High&#8208;quality single&#8208;domain monolayer TMDCs with millimeter size can be easily synthesized within 30 s by this method.








Abstract
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been widely used to synthesize high&#8208;quality 2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) from different precursors. At present, quantitative control of the precursor with high precision and good repeatability is still challenging. Moreover, the process to synthesize TMDCs with designed patterns is complicated. Here, by using an industrial inkjet&#8208;printer, an in situ aqueous precursor with robust usage control at the picogram (10&#8722;12 g) level is achieved, and by precisely tuning the inkjet&#8208;printing parameters, followed by a rapid heating process, large&#8208;area patterned TMDC films with centimeter size and good thickness controllability, as well as heterostructures of the TMDCs, are achieved facilely, and high&#8208;quality single&#8208;domain monolayer TMDCs with millimeter&#8208;size can be easily synthesized within 30 s (corresponding to a growth rate up to 36.4 &#181;m s&#8722;1). The resulting monolayer MoS2 and MoSe2 exhibits excellent electronic properties with carrier mobility up to 21 and 54 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, respectively. The study paves a simple and robust way for the in situ ultrafast and patterned growth of high&#8208;quality TMDCs and heterostructures with promising industrialization prospects. Moreover, this ultrafast and green method can be easily used for synthesis of other 2D materials with slight modification.

&lt;p&gt;Large&#8208;area patterned transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) films with centimeter size and good controllability of the thickness and TMDC heterostructures are achieved by a facile, low&#8208;cost strategy involving printing using an industrial inkjet&#8208;printer with precisely tuned inkjet&#8208;printing parameters followed by a rapid heating process. High&#8208;quality single&#8208;domain monolayer TMDCs with millimeter size can be easily synthesized within 30 s by this method.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been widely used to synthesize high&#8208;quality 2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) from different precursors. At present, quantitative control of the precursor with high precision and good repeatability is still challenging. Moreover, the process to synthesize TMDCs with designed patterns is complicated. Here, by using an industrial inkjet&#8208;printer, an in situ aqueous precursor with robust usage control at the picogram (10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;12&lt;/sup&gt; g) level is achieved, and by precisely tuning the inkjet&#8208;printing parameters, followed by a rapid heating process, large&#8208;area patterned TMDC films with centimeter size and good thickness controllability, as well as heterostructures of the TMDCs, are achieved facilely, and high&#8208;quality single&#8208;domain monolayer TMDCs with millimeter&#8208;size can be easily synthesized within 30 s (corresponding to a growth rate up to 36.4 &#181;m s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The resulting monolayer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits excellent electronic properties with carrier mobility up to 21 and 54 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The study paves a simple and robust way for the in situ ultrafast and patterned growth of high&#8208;quality TMDCs and heterostructures with promising industrialization prospects. Moreover, this ultrafast and green method can be easily used for synthesis of other 2D materials with slight modification.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Smart Self&#8208;Assembly Amphiphilic Cyclopeptide&#8208;Dye for Near&#8208;Infrared Window&#8208;II Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
The complex and ambiguous chemical formulas of the majority of traditional  nanoparticles stand in the way of their clinical translation. A small&#8208;molecular&#8208;based sharp pH&#8208;responding fluorescent nanoprobe for NIR&#8208;II imaging of various tumor models with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and long retention time is developed. This nanoparticle's definite chemical structure and simple production process properties highly increase its clinical translation potential.








Abstract
Development of novel nanomaterials for disease theranostics represents an important direction in chemistry and precision medicine. Fluorescent molecular probes in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#160;nm) show high promise because of their exceptional high detection sensitivity, resolution, and deep imaging depth. Here, a sharp pH&#8208;sensitive self&#8208;assembling cyclopeptide&#8208;dye, SIMM1000, as a smart nanoprobe for NIR&#8208;II imaging of diseases in living animals, is reported. This small molecule assembled nanoprobe exhibits smart properties by responding to a sharp decrease of pH in the tumor microenvironment (pH 7.0 to 6.8), aggregating from small nanoprobe (80&#160;nm at pH 7.0) into large nanoparticles (&gt;500&#160;nm at pH 6.8) with &#8776;20&#8211;30 times enhanced fluorescence compared with the non&#8208;self&#8208;assembled CH&#8208;4T. It yields micrometer&#8208;scale resolution in blood vessel imaging and high contrast and resolution in bone and tumor imaging in mice. Because of its self&#8208;aggregation in acidic tumor microenvironments in situ, SIMM1000 exhibits high tumor accumulation and extremely long tumor retention (&gt;19 days), while being excretable from normal tissues and safe. This smart self&#8208;assembling small molecule strategy can shift the paradigm of designing new nanomaterials for molecular imaging and drug development.

         <title>Redox Flow Batteries: Non&#8208;Solvent Induced Phase Separation Enables Designer Redox Flow Battery Electrodes (Adv. Mater. 16/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox flow batteries have the potential to accelerate the transition to a green&#8208;energy economy by integrating renewable technologies into the electrical grid. Their porous carbon electrodes need to balance the trade&#8208;off between mass transport and kinetics. In article number 2006716, Antoni Forner&#8208;Cuenca and co&#8208;workers show that non&#8208;solvent induced phase separation can be leveraged as a versatile and facile method for fabricating high&#8208;surface&#8208;area microstructures, with hierarchical porous architectures well&#8208;suited for use in flow batteries.

A small&#8208;molecular&#8208;based self&#8208;assembling and pH&#8208;responding NIR&#8208;II fluorescent nanoprobe is developed by Zhenhua Hu, Jie Tian, Zhen Cheng, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2006902. This nanoprobe sharply responds to a decrease of pH in the tumor microenvironment. It aggregates from small nanoprobes (80 nm at pH 7.0) into large nanoparticles (&gt;500 nm at pH 6.8), resulting in high tumor contrast and prolonged tumor retention (&gt;19d). Thus, the bright clinical translational potential of small&#8208;molecular self&#8208;assembly nanoparticles is demonstrated.

         <title>In Vitro Mineralization of Collagen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in vitro mineralization of collagen deals with the mechanisms of bone formation and the synthesis of tissue engineering scaffolds. Due to their biological relevance, the extra&#8208; and intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen with hydroxyapatite and silica are the focus of this review. A general mechanism for the intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen is proposed.








Abstract
Collagen mineralization is a biological process in many skeletal elements in the animal kingdom. Examples of these collagen&#8208;based skeletons are the siliceous spicules of glass sponges or the intrafibrillar hydroxyapatite platelets in vertebrates. The mineralization of collagen in vitro has gained interest for two reasons: understanding the processes behind bone formation and the synthesis of scaffolds for tissue engineering. In this paper, the efforts toward collagen mineralization in vitro are reviewed. First, general introduction toward collagen type I, the main component of the extracellular matrix in animals, is provided, followed by a brief overview of collagenous skeletons. Then, the in vitro mineralization of collagen is critically reviewed. Due to their biological abundance, hydroxyapatite and silica are the focus of this review. To a much lesser extent, also some efforts with other minerals are outlined. Combining all minerals and the suggested mechanisms for each mineral, a general mechanism for the intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen is proposed. This review concludes with an outlook for further improvement of collagen&#8208;based tissue engineering scaffolds.

         <title>Rare&#8208;Earth Incorporated Alloy Catalysts: Synthesis, Properties, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare&#8208;earth alloys are emerging catalytic materials in the field of energy conversion. They have unique electronic structures and spatial characteristics. The families of all rare&#8208;earth&#8208;alloy catalytic materials are reviewed, focusing on their synthesis, properties, structure, and applications.








Abstract
To improve the performance of metallic catalysts, alloying provides an efficient methodology to design state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials. As emerging functional materials, rare&#8208;earth metal compounds can integrate the unique orbital structure and catalytic behavior of rare earth elements into metallic materials. Such rare&#8208;earth containing alloy catalysts proffer an opportunity to tailor electronic properties, tune charged carrier transport, and synergize surface reactivity, which are expected to significantly improve the performance and stability of catalysis. Despite its significance, there are only few reviews on rare earth containing alloys or related topics. This review summarizes the composition, synthesis, and applications of rare earth containing alloys in the field of catalysis. Subsequent to comprehensively summarizing and constructively discussing the existing work, the challenges and possibilities of future research on rare&#8208;earth metal compound materials are evaluated.

The major challenges, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments on rational structure design strategies, surface/interface engineering, industrial anode/cathode selection, and advanced in situ/operando characterizations toward deep understanding of the working mechanism of Si&#8208;based electrodes are reviewed. It is demonstrated that Si&#8208;based anodes are promising candidates in configurations of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, Li&#8211;S batteries, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, and beyond.








Abstract
The increasing demand for higher&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries driven by advancements in electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, and portable electronic devices necessitates the development of alternative anode materials with a specific capacity beyond that of traditional graphite anodes. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments made in the rational design of Si&#8208;based electrodes and their progression toward practical application are presented. First, a comprehensive overview of fundamental electrochemistry and selected critical challenges is given, including their large volume expansion, unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) growth, low initial Coulombic efficiency, low areal capacity, and safety issues. Second, the principles of potential solutions including nanoarchitectured construction, surface/interface engineering, novel binder and electrolyte design, and designing the whole electrode for stability are discussed in detail. Third, applications for Si&#8208;based anodes beyond LIBs are highlighted, specifically noting their promise in configurations of Li&#8211;S batteries and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Fourth, the electrochemical reaction process, structural evolution, and degradation mechanisms are systematically investigated by advanced in situ and operando characterizations. Finally, the future trends and perspectives with an emphasis on commercialization of Si&#8208;based electrodes are provided. Si&#8208;based anode materials will be key in helping keep up with the demands for higher energy density in the coming decades.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 16, April 22, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal dichalcogenide stacking&#8208;engineered heterostructures, from controllable fabrication to typical characterization, are reviewed in detail and the stacking&#8208;correlated physical behaviors are presented. Furthermore, recent advances in stacking design, such as stacking sequence, twist angles, and moir&#233; superlattice heterojunctions, are also comprehensively summarized. Finally, the remaining challenges and possible strategies for using stacking engineering to tune the properties of 2D materials are outlined.








Abstract
The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide monolayer blocks to form a 3D stack, with a precisely chosen sequence/angle, is the newest development for these materials. In this way, one can create &#8220;van der Waals heterostructures (HSs),&#8221; opening up a new realm of materials engineering and novel devices with designed functionalities. Herein, a detailed systematic review of transition metal dichalcogenide stacking&#8208;engineered heterostructures, from controllable fabrication to typical characterization, and stacking&#8208;correlated physical behaviors is presented. Furthermore, recent advances in stacking design, such as stacking sequence, twist angles, and moir&#233; superlattice heterojunctions, are also comprehensively summarized.

         <title>Top&#8208;Level Design Strategy to Construct an Advanced High&#8208;Entropy Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo (Oxy)Hydroxide Electrocatalyst for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A top&#8208;level design strategy assisted by density functional theory is reported to guide and design advanced high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts and their enhanced catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is successfully predicted. A new low&#8208;temperature electrochemical reconstruction method is developed to fabricate the as&#8208;predicted high&#8208;entropy catalysts. The as&#8208;prepared high&#8208;entropy Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalyst exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic OER performance, consistent with theory calculations.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials are new&#8208;generation electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their excellent reactivity and highly tailorable electrochemical properties. Herein, a powerful top&#8208;level design strategy is reported to guide and design advanced high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts by establishing reaction models (e.g., reaction energy barrier, conductivity, adsorption geometries for intermediates, and rate&#8208;determining step) to predict performance with the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Accordingly, novel high&#8208;entropy Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalysts are fabricated by a new low&#8208;temperature electrochemical reconstruction method and their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties are thoroughly characterized. These as&#8208;prepared quaternary metallic (oxy)hydroxides present much better OER performance than ternary Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide, Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide, and other counterparts, and are demonstrated with a low overpotential of 199&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a 48.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 Tafel slope in 1 m KOH and excellent stability without decay over 72 h. The performance enhancement mechanism is also unraveled by synchrotron radiation. The work verifies the usefulness of high&#8208;entropy design and the great synergistic effect on OER performance by the incorporation of four elements, and also provides a new method for the construction of advanced high&#8208;entropy materials for energy conversion and storage.

         <title>Polymer Dielectrics with Simultaneous Ultrahigh Energy Density and Low Loss</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zwitterion&#8208;functionalized polymers are synthsized with a record&#8208;high breakdown strength of 1300 MV&#160;m&#8722;1, energy density above 35 J&#160;cm&#8722;3, and charge&#8211;discharge efficiency of &gt;90%, taking advantage of the covalent&#8208;bonding restricted ion polarization and the charge trapping of the ion cluster phase.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics are highly desirable in capacitor applications due to their low cost, high breakdown strength, and unique self&#8208;healing capability. However, existing polymer dielectrics suffer from either a low energy density or a high dielectric loss, thereby hindering the development of compact, efficient, and reliable power electronics. Here, a novel type of polymer dielectrics simultaneously exhibiting an extraordinarily high recoverable energy density of 35 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and a low dielectric loss is reported. It is synthesized by grafting zwitterions onto the short side chains of a poly(4&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;pentene) (PMP)&#8208;based copolymer, which increases its dielectric constant from &#8776;2.2 to &#8776;5.2 and significantly enhances its breakdown strength from &#8776;700 MV&#160;m&#8722;1 to &#8776;1300 MV&#160;m&#8722;1 while maintaining its low dielectric loss of &lt;0.002 and high charge&#8211;discharge efficiency of &gt;90%. Based on a combination of the phase&#8208;field method description of mesoscale structures, Maxwell equations, and theoretical analysis, it is demonstrated that the outstanding combination of high energy density and low dielectric loss of zwitterions&#8208;grafted copolymers is attributed to the covalent&#8208;bonding restricted ion polarization and the strong charge trapping by the zwitterions. This work represents a new strategy in polymer dielectrics for achieving simultaneous high energy density and low dielectric loss.

&lt;p&gt;Zwitterion&#8208;functionalized polymers are synthsized with a record&#8208;high breakdown strength of 1300 MV&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, energy density above 35 J&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and charge&#8211;discharge efficiency of &amp;gt;90%, taking advantage of the covalent&#8208;bonding restricted ion polarization and the charge trapping of the ion cluster phase.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymer dielectrics are highly desirable in capacitor applications due to their low cost, high breakdown strength, and unique self&#8208;healing capability. However, existing polymer dielectrics suffer from either a low energy density or a high dielectric loss, thereby hindering the development of compact, efficient, and reliable power electronics. Here, a novel type of polymer dielectrics simultaneously exhibiting an extraordinarily high recoverable energy density of 35 J&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a low dielectric loss is reported. It is synthesized by grafting zwitterions onto the short side chains of a poly(4&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;pentene) (PMP)&#8208;based copolymer, which increases its dielectric constant from &#8776;2.2 to &#8776;5.2 and significantly enhances its breakdown strength from &#8776;700 MV&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; to &#8776;1300 MV&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; while maintaining its low dielectric loss of &amp;lt;0.002 and high charge&#8211;discharge efficiency of &amp;gt;90%. Based on a combination of the phase&#8208;field method description of mesoscale structures, Maxwell equations, and theoretical analysis, it is demonstrated that the outstanding combination of high energy density and low dielectric loss of zwitterions&#8208;grafted copolymers is attributed to the covalent&#8208;bonding restricted ion polarization and the strong charge trapping by the zwitterions. This work represents a new strategy in polymer dielectrics for achieving simultaneous high energy density and low dielectric loss.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Programmed Size&#8208;Changeable Nanotheranostic Agents for Enhanced Imaging&#8208;Guided Chemo/Photodynamic Combination Therapy and Fast Elimination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanotheranostic agent, which can realize two&#8208;stage programmed size changes, is developed for enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#8208;guided chemo/photodynamic combination therapy. Once the nano&#8208;sized agents reach the acidic tumor microenvironment, large aggregates will be formed for enhanced MRI. After their theranostic functionalities exhaust, large&#8208;sized aggregates will be transformed into monodisperse small&#8208;sized particles for fast elimination.








Abstract
An ideal nanotheranostic agent should be able to achieve efficient tumor accumulation, retention, and fast elimination after its theranostic functions exhausts. However, there is an irreconcilable contradiction on optimum sizes for effective tumor retention and fast elimination. Herein, a programmed size&#8208;changeable nanotheranostic agent based on polyprodrug&#8208;modified iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer is developed for enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#8208;guided chemo/photodynamic combination therapy. The nano&#8208;sized theranostic agents with an initial diameter of about 90&#160;nm can accumulate in tumor tissue through passive targeting. In the acidic tumor microenvironment, large aggregates of IONPs are formed, realizing enhanced tumor retention and MR signal enhancement. Under the guidance of MRI, light irradiation is applied to the tumor site for triggering the generation of reactive oxygen species and drug release. Moreover, after chemo/photodynamic combination therapy, the large&#8208;sized aggregates are re&#8208;dispersed into small&#8208;sized IONPs for fast elimination, reducing the risk of toxicity caused by long&#8208;term retention. Therefore, this study provides a promising size&#8208;changeable strategy for the development of nanotheranostic agents.

         <title>Polyphenol&#8208;Containing Nanoparticles: Synthesis, Properties, and Therapeutic Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review is provided on the synthesis, properties, and biomedical applications of polyphenol&#8208;containing nanomaterials. The problems in the current polyphenol&#8208;based nanosystems and the future research directions in this field are also discussed.








Abstract
Polyphenols, the phenolic hydroxyl group&#8208;containing organic molecules, are widely found in natural plants and have shown beneficial effects on human health. Recently, polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles have attracted extensive research attention due to their antioxidation property, anticancer activity, and universal adherent affinity, and thus have shown great promise in the preparation, stabilization, and modification of multifunctional nanoassemblies for bioimaging, therapeutic delivery, and other biomedical applications. Additionally, the metal&#8722;polyphenol networks, formed by the coordination interactions between polyphenols and metal ions, have been used to prepare an important class of polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles for surface modification, bioimaging, drug delivery, and disease treatments. By focusing on the interactions between polyphenols and different materials (e.g., metal ions, inorganic materials, polymers, proteins, and nucleic acids), a comprehensive review on the synthesis and properties of the polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles is provided. Moreover, the remarkable versatility of polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles in different biomedical applications, including biodetection, multimodal bioimaging, protein and gene delivery, bone repair, antibiosis, and cancer theranostics is also demonstrated. Finally, the challenges faced by future research regarding the polyphenol&#8208;containing nanoparticles are discussed.

         <title>Supramolecular Nanofibrils Formed by Coassembly of Clinically Approved Drugs for Tumor Photothermal Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular nanofibrils with photothermal immunomodulatory function are formed by coassembly of clinically approved peptide (thymopentin) and photosensitizer (indocyanine green), mainly associated with hydrogen bonds. The complementary effects of rapid photothermal therapy of indocyanine green and long&#8208;term immunomodulation of thymopentin can be integrated for suppressing the tumor growth and metastasis.








Abstract
Pancreatic cancer, one of the most lethal malignancies, compromises the performance of traditional therapeutic regimens in the clinic because of stromal resistance to systemic drug delivery and poor prognosis caused by tumor metastasis. Therefore, a biocompatible therapeutic paradigm that can effectively inhibit pancreatic tumor growth while simultaneously eliminating tumor metastasis is urgently needed. Herein, supramolecular nanofibrils are fabricated through coassembly of clinically approved immunomodulatory thymopentin and near&#8208;infrared indocyanine green for localized photothermal immunotherapy of pancreatic tumors. The resulting long&#8208;range ordered fibrous nanodrugs show improved photophysical capabilities for fluorescence imaging and photothermal conversion and significantly promote the proliferation and differentiation of antitumor immune cells. Hence, the integration of rapid photothermal therapy and moderate immunomodulation for inhibiting tumor growth and eliminating tumor metastasis is promising. The utilization of clinically approved molecules to construct nanodrugs administered via localized injection amplifies the complementary photothermal immunotherapeutic effects of the components, creating opportunities for clinical translation as a treatment for pancreatic cancer.

         <title>Toward Planar and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Electrodepositions by Regulating Sn&#8208;Crystal Textured Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface of a Zn&#8208;metal anode is reconstructed with Sn&#8208;crystal textures via a facile chemical displacement reaction. Such a Sn&#8208;textured surface not only endows reduced Zn deposition energy barrier but also regulates lateral growth of Zn crystals, which promotes dendrite&#8208;free electrodeposits and leads to the achievement of an extremely low voltage hysteresis of 20&#160;mV and prolonged cycling performance over 500 h.








Abstract
The propensity of Zn&#8208;metal anodes to form non&#8208;uniform or dendritic electrodeposits is bound up with the nature of the electrode surface. However, the effect of surface structure on the inherent nucleation and deposition of Zn is not yet well understood. Here, the surface structure of a Zn&#8208;metal anode is reconstructed with Sn&#8208;crystal textures via a facile chemical displacement reaction. Compared to the bare Zn, the high&#8208;affinity Zn binding sites of Sn afford lower deposition energy barrier, which promotes deposition kinetics. What is more, a Sn&#8208;textured surface with moderate Zn affinity but high average surface energy ensures a better wettability from the deposits, leading to the lateral growth of Zn crystals. The resultant Sn&#8208;textured Zn&#8208;metal anode exhibits an extremely low voltage hysteresis of 20&#160;mV and achieves a prolonged cycling stability over 500 h cycles without dendrite formation. This work provides new insights into the crystal&#8208;texture&#8208;dependent Zn electrodeposition process and offers direction for direct surface texturing to better stabilize Zn&#8208;metal anodes with improved reversibility.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Substitution Promoted Ultrawide Bandgap up to 4.5&#160;eV in a 2D Semiconductor: Gallium Thiophosphate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cross&#8208;substitution process is used to design 2D ultrawide bandgap semiconductor GaPS4 by employing GeS2 as a similar structural model. Monolayer GaPS4 exhibits ultrawide optical bandgap of 4.50&#160;eV. The polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on the GaPS4 material display high selectivity and linear dichroic ratio in solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet region.








Abstract
Exploring 2D ultrawide bandgap semiconductors (UWBSs) will be conductive to the development of next&#8208;generation nanodevices, such as deep&#8208;ultraviolet photodetectors, single&#8208;photon emitters, and high&#8208;power flexible electronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;A cross&#8208;substitution process is used to design 2D ultrawide bandgap semiconductor GaPS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; by employing GeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a similar structural model. Monolayer GaPS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits ultrawide optical bandgap of 4.50&#160;eV. The polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on the GaPS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; material display high selectivity and linear dichroic ratio in solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet region.


&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring 2D ultrawide bandgap semiconductors (UWBSs) will be conductive to the development of next&#8208;generation nanodevices, such as deep&#8208;ultraviolet photodetectors, single&#8208;photon emitters, and high&#8208;power flexible electronic devices. However, a gap still remains between the theoretical prediction of novel 2D UWBSs and the experimental realization of the corresponding materials. The cross&#8208;substitution process is an effective way to construct novel semiconductors with the favorable parent characteristics (e.g., structure) and the better physicochemical properties (e.g., bandgap).

         <title>Orthogonal Images Concealed Within a Responsive 6&#8208;Dimensional Hypersurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for printing copolymer brush patterns is reported, where the composition across the array and along the polymer chain can be controlled precisely at each pixel. This advance is enabled by an approach that accelerates the understanding and optimization of reaction conditions on polymer growth. The power of this strategy is demonstrated by printing a copolymer brush pattern where, under illumination, one image appears, and a different image emerges upon heating.








Abstract
A photochemical printer, equipped with a digital micromirror device (DMD), leads to the rapid elucidation of the kinetics of the surface&#8208;initiated atom&#8208;transfer radical photopolymerization of N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide (DMA) and N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) monomers. This effort reveals conditions where polymer brushes of identical heights can be grown from each monomer. With these data, hidden images are created that appear upon heating the substrate above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of polyNIPAM. By introducing a third monomer, methacryloxyethyl thiocarbamoyl rhodamine B, a second, orthogonal image appears upon UV&#8208;irradiation. With these studies, it is shown how a new photochemical printer accelerates discovery, creates arbitrary patterns, and addresses long&#8208;standing problems in brush polymer and surface chemistry. With this technology in hand a new method is demonstrated to encrypt data within hypersurfaces.

         <title>Benzene Ring Knitting Achieved by Ambient&#8208;Temperature Dehalogenation via Mechanochemical Ullmann&#8208;Type Reductive Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Construction of conjugated porous networks (CPN) is realized via straight&#8208;forward aromatic ring knitting derived from reductive dehalogenation of aromatic halides promoted by mechanochemical Ullmann&#8208;type reactions in the presence of magnesium under neat and ambient conditions.








Abstract
The current approaches capable of affording conjugated porous networks (CPNs) still rely on solution&#8208;based coupling reactions promoted by noble metal complexes or Lewis acids, on&#8208;surface polymerization conducted in ultrahigh&#8208;vacuum environment at very high temperatures (&gt;200 &#176;C), or mechanochemical Scholl&#8208;type reactions limited to electron&#8208;rich substrates. To develop simple and scalable approaches capable of making CPNs under neat and ambient conditions, herein, a novel and complementary method to the current oxidative Scholl coupling processes is demonstrated to afford CPNs via direct aromatic ring knitting promoted by mechanochemical Ullmann&#8208;type reactions. The key to this strategy lies in the dehalogenation of aromatic halides in the presence of Mg involving the formation of Grignard reagent intermediates. Products (Ph&#8208;CPN&#8208;1) obtained via direct C&#63743;C bond formation between 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrabromobenzene (TBB) monomer feature high surface areas together with mesoporous architecture. The versatility of this approach is confirmed by the successful construction of various CPNs via knitting of the corresponding aromatic rings (e.g., pyrene and triphenylene), and even highly crystalline graphite product&#160;was obtained. The CPNs exhibit good electrochemical performance as the anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). This approach expands the frontiers of CPN synthesis and provides new opportunities to their scalable applications.

         <title>Fast X&#8208;ray Nanotomography with Sub&#8208;10&#160;nm Resolution as a Powerful Imaging Tool for Nanotechnology and Energy Storage Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optomechanical breakthroughs in X&#8208;ray nanotomography, leading to fast 3D tomographic acquisitions (85 min) with sub&#8208;10 nm spatial resolution, are reported. These new achievements are first validated by 3D characterizations of novel X&#8208;ray diffractive optics made by nanolithography and nanometer&#8208;thick film electrodes synthesized by atomic layer deposition and magnetron sputtering deposition methods on 3D silicon scaffolds for electrochemical energy storage applications.








Abstract
In the last decade, transmission X&#8208;ray microscopes (TXMs) have come into operation in most of the synchrotrons worldwide. They have proven to be outstanding tools for non&#8208;invasive ex and in situ 3D characterization of materials at the nanoscale across varying range of scientific applications. However, their spatial resolution has not improved in many years, while newly developed functional materials and microdevices with enhanced performances exhibit nanostructures always finer. Here, optomechanical breakthroughs leading to fast 3D tomographic acquisitions (85 min) with sub&#8208;10 nm spatial resolution, narrowing the gap between X&#8208;ray and electron microscopy, are reported. These new achievements are first validated with 3D characterizations of nanolithography objects corresponding to ultrahigh&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio hard X&#8208;ray zone plates. Then, this powerful technique is used to investigate the morphology and conformality of nanometer&#8208;thick film electrodes synthesized by atomic layer deposition and magnetron sputtering deposition methods on 3D silicon scaffolds for electrochemical energy storage&#160;applications.

         <title>Rheological Aspects of Cellulose Nanomaterials: Governing Factors and Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superior rheological properties (e.g., viscosity, yield stress, shear&#8208;thinning behavior, thixotropy, and viscoelasticity) of cellulose nanomaterials (CNMs) have enabled them to be effective rheology modifiers. The dependence of CNM rheology on a wide spectrum of parameters and the application of CNMs as rheology modifiers in several emerging industrial sectors are systematically described.








Abstract
Cellulose nanomaterials (CNMs), mainly including nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), have attained enormous interest due to their sustainability, biodegradability, biocompatibility, nanoscale dimensions, large surface area, facile modification of surface chemistry, as well as unique optical, mechanical, and rheological performance. One of the most fascinating properties of CNMs is their aqueous suspension rheology, i.e., CNMs helping create viscous suspensions with the formation of percolation networks and chemical interactions (e.g., van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic attraction/repulsion, and hydrophobic attraction). Under continuous shearing, CNMs in an aqueous suspension can align along the flow direction, producing shear&#8208;thinning behavior. At rest, CNM suspensions regain some of their initial structure immediately, allowing rapid recovery of rheological properties. These unique flow features enable CNMs to serve as rheological modifiers in a wide range of fluid&#8208;based applications. Herein, the dependence of the rheology of CNM suspensions on test protocols, CNM inherent properties, suspension environments, and postprocessing is systematically described. A critical overview of the recent progress on fluid applications of CNMs as rheology modifiers in some emerging industrial sectors is presented as well. Future perspectives in the field are outlined to guide further research and development in using CNMs as the next generation rheological modifiers.

         <title>Realizing Colorful Holographic Mimicry by Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;efficiency colorful holographic device is reported. Dynamically tunable and wavelength&#8208;multiplexed functions of the device are realized by combining the idea of biological mimicry and the rich degrees of freedom in metasurfaces. The research findings may produce novel applications for optical information encryption, virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR), and military camouflage.








Abstract
Mimicry is a biological camouflage phenomenon whereby an organism can change its shape and color to resemble another object. Herein, the idea of biological mimicry and rich degrees of freedom in metasurface designs are combined to realize holographic mimicry devices. A general mathematical method, called phase matrix transformation, to accomplish the holographic mimicry process is proposed. Based on this method, a dynamic metasurface hologram is designed, which shows an image of a &#8220;bird&#8221; in the air, and a distinct image of a &#8220;fish&#8221; when the environment is changed to oil. Furthermore, to make the mimicry behavior more generic, holographic mimicry operating at dual wavelengths is also designed and experimentally demonstrated. Moreover, the fully independent phase modulation realized by phase matrix transformation makes the working efficiency of the device relatively higher than the conventional multiwavelength holographic devices with off&#8208;axis illumination or interleaved subarrays. The work potentially opens a new research paradigm interfacing bionics with nanophotonics, which may produce novel applications for optical information encryption, virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR), and military camouflage systems.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Preferred Crystal Plane for a Stable and Reversible Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports a novel stable and reversible Zn anode with surface preferred crystal plane via crystal orientation and reveals the relationship between the surface structure and the interfacial reaction of Zn anode. Both theoretical and experimental analyses indicate Zn anode with more (002) basal plane exposed exhibits free dendrites, no by&#8208;products and weak hydrogen evolution compared to the (100) one.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are largely restricted by the unsatisfactory performance of zinc (Zn) anodes, including their poor stability and irreversibility. In particular, the mechanism behind the electrochemical contrast caused by the surface crystal plane, which is a decisive factor of the electrochemical characteristics of the hostless Zn anode, is still relatively indistinct. Hence, new insight into a novel anode with a surface&#8208;preferred (002) crystal plane is provided. The interfacial reaction and morphology evolution are revealed by theoretical analysis and post&#8208;mortem/operando experimental techniques, indicating that Zn anodes with more exposed (002) basal planes exhibit free dendrites, no by&#8208;products, and weak hydrogen evolution, in sharp contrast to the (100) plane. These features benefit the Zn (002) anode by enabling a long cyclic life of more than 500 h and a high average coulombic efficiency of 97.71% for symmetric batteries, along with delivering long cycling stability and reversibility with life spans of over 2000 cycles for full batteries. This work provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance Zn anodes for large&#8208;scale energy storage and can potentially be applied to other metal anodes suffering from instability and irreversibility.

         <title>Heterochromatic Nonlinear Optical Responses in Upconversion Nanoparticles for Super&#8208;Resolution Nanoscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diverse photoresponses from different energy levels in lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles are proposed to simultaneously generate multiple point spread functions for improving the super&#8208;resolution imaging quality. The method requires only one doughnut&#8208;shaped scanning excitation beam that extends the capabilities of the engineered point spread functions to cover both low&#8208; and high&#8208;frequency information for optimizing the averaged resolution.








Abstract
Point spread function (PSF) engineering by an emitter's response can code higher&#8208;spatial&#8208;frequency information of an image for microscopy to achieve super&#8208;resolution. However, complexed excitation optics or repetitive scans are needed, which explains the issues of low speed, poor stability, and operational complexity associated with the current laser scanning microscopy approaches. Here, the diverse emission responses of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are reported for super&#8208;resolution nanoscopy to improve the imaging quality and speed. The method only needs a doughnut&#8208;shaped scanning excitation beam at an appropriate power density. By collecting the four&#8208;photon emission of single UCNPs, the high&#8208;frequency information of a super&#8208;resolution image can be resolved through the doughnut&#8208;emission PSF. Meanwhile, the two&#8208;photon state of the same nanoparticle is oversaturated, so that the complementary lower&#8208;frequency information of the super&#8208;resolution image can be simultaneously collected by the Gaussian&#8208;like emission PSF. This leads to a method of Fourier&#8208;domain heterochromatic fusion, which allows the extended capability of the engineered PSFs to cover both low&#8208; and high&#8208;frequency information to yield optimized image quality. This approach achieves a spatial resolution of 40&#160;nm, 1/24th of the excitation wavelength. This work suggests a new scope for developing nonlinear multi&#8208;color emitting probes in super&#8208;resolution nanoscopy.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Derived TinO2n&#8722;1 Quantum Dots Distributed on Porous Carbon Nanosheets for Stable and Long&#8208;Life Li&#8211;S Batteries: Enhanced Polysulfide Mediation via Defect Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A remarkable conversion kinetics&#8208;enhanced polysulfide mediator is proposed via in situ preparation of oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich TinO2n&#8722;1 quantum dots (OV&#8211;TnQDs) distributed on porous carbon nanosheet (PCN) using 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene as starting material. The obtained OV&#8211;TnQDs@PCN/S cathode exhibits an ultrastable and long&#8208;life Li+ storage at high current density, demonstrating its great potential for next&#8208;generation Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
The application of Li&#8211;S batteries has been hindered by the shuttling behavior and sluggish reaction kinetics of polysulfides. Here an effective polysulfide immobilizer and catalytic promoter is developed by proposing oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich TinO2n&#8722;1 quantum dots (OV&#8211;TnQDs) decorated on porous carbon nanosheets (PCN), which are modulated using Ti3C2Tx MXene as starting materials. The TnQDs not only confine polysulfides through strong chemisorption but also promote polysulfide conversion via redox&#8208;active catalysis. The introduction of oxygen vacancies further boosts the immobilization and conversion of polysulfides by lowering the adsorption energy and shortening the bond lengths. The PCN provides a physical polysulfide confinement as well as a flexible substrate preventing OV&#8211;TnQDs from aggregation. Moreover, the two building blocks are conductive, thereby effectively improving the electron/charge transfer. Finally, the ultrasmall size of QDs along with the porous structure endows OV&#8211;TnQDs@PCN with large specific surface area and pore volume, affording adequate space for S loading and volume expansion. Therefore, the OV&#8211;TnQDs@PCN/S delivers a high S loading (79.1 wt%), good rate capability (672 mA h g&#8722;1 at 2 C), and excellent long&#8208;term cyclability (88% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 2 C). It also exhibits good Li+ storage under high S&#8208;mass loading and lean electrolyte.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electroluminescence from Narrowband Green Circularly Polarized Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two pairs of circularly polarized multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF) enantiomers are developed by combining the merits of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and MR&#8208;TADF. This is the first example of a highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) that exhibits circularly polarized electroluminescence signal, narrowband emission, and TADF concurrently.








Abstract
Purely organic fluorescent materials that concurrently exhibit high efficiency, narrowband emission, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) remain an unaddressed issue despite their promising applications in wide color gamut&#8208; and 3D&#8208;display. Herein, the CPL optical property and multiple resonance (MR) effect induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emission are integrated with high color purity and luminous efficiency together. Two pairs of highly efficient green CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF enantiomers, namely, (R/S)&#8208;OBN&#8208;2CN&#8208;BN and (R/S)&#8208;OBN&#8208;4CN&#8208;BN, are developed. The enantiomer&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) exhibit pure green emission with narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 30 and 33&#160;nm, high maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 29.4% and 24.5%, and clear circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) signals with electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gEL) of +1.43 &#215; 10&#8722;3/&#8722;1.27 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and +4.60 &#215; 10&#8722;4/&#8722;4.76 &#215; 10&#8722;4, respectively. This is the first example of a highly efficient OLED that exhibits CPEL signal, narrowband emission, and TADF concurrently.

         <title>Perovskite Solar Cells for Space Applications: Progress and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are considered as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation space photovoltaic technology. Key space environments and specific requirements for space photovoltaics are outlined. Some recent advances in terms of performance evolution and mechanism exploration of perovskite films and devices under space extreme environments are summarized. Progress and challenges associated with space applications of PSCs are highlighted.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have aroused burgeoning interest in the field of photovoltaics owing to their versatile optoelectronic properties. The outstanding power conversion efficiency, high specific power (i.e., power to weight ratio), compatibility with flexible substrates, and excellent radiation resistance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) enable them to be a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation space photovoltaic technology. Nevertheless, compared with other practical space photovoltaics, such as silicon and III&#8208;V multi&#8208;junction compound solar cells, the research on PSCs for space applications is just in the infancy stage. Therefore, there are considerable interests in further strengthening relevant research from the perspective of both mechanism and technology. Consequently, the approaches used for and the consequences of PSCs for space applications are reviewed. This review provides an overview of recent progress in PSCs for space applications in terms of performance evolution and mechanism exploration of perovskite films and devices under space extreme environments.

         <title>Engineered Protein Photo&#8208;Thermal Hydrogels for Outstanding In Situ Tongue Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a new type of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;responsive protein hybrid hydrogel is fabricated by the complexation of genetically engineered anionic protein, chitosan, and Ag3AuS2 NP. With the properties of the large&#8208;scale production, low immunogenicity, and outstanding photothermal conversion efficiency, the hydrogel is promising to realize photothermal therapy for in situ tongue tumors.








Abstract
Surgical excision is the main choice for tongue cancer treatment. However, the physiological functions of oral and maxillofacial regions might be severely impaired and high risk of tongue tumor recurrence cannot be avoided. It is thus becoming urgently important to develop alternative strategies for tongue cancer therapy. In this regard, a new class of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;responsive and peritumoral injectable hydrogel is fabricated with extraordinary photothermal therapy (PTT) for in situ tongue tumors. The as&#8208;prepared soft material exhibits good biocompatibility and ultra&#8208;strong photothermal effect due to the formed network by negatively charged proteins, chitosan molecules, and Ag3AuS2 nanoparticles (NPs). In a well&#8208;constructed in situ tongue tumor model, tumors can be efficiently eradicated by one&#8208;time PTT treatment. Importantly, there are no side effects on surrounding normal tissues and potential tumor recurrence is inhibited. In stark contrast to traditional surgical excision, such biomaterials hold great potential for clinical treatment of oral cancers.

         <title>Strong Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectricity in Strained SrTiO3 Homoepitaxial Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity is achieved in strained SrTiO3 homoepitaxial films by introducing unprecedented Ti/O&#8208;deficient perovskite nanoregions. These nanoregions impose a large tensile strain on the matrix, leading to a large polar tetragonality (c/a&#160;= 1.038) and paraelectric&#8208;to&#8208;ferroelectric transition. As a result, the polarization can rival classic ferroelectrics like BaTiO3, and the ferroelectricity can be maintained up to &#8776;1098 K.








Abstract
Although the discovery of exceptional ferroelectricity in paraelectrics offers great opportunities to enrich the diversity of the ferroelectric family and promote the development of novel functionalities, transformation of paraelectric phases into ferroelectric phases remains challenging. Herein, a method is presented for driving paraelectrics into ferroelectric states via the introduction of M/O&#8208;deficient (M for metal) perovskite nanoregions. Using this method, strong ferroelectricity, equivalent to that of classic ferroelectrics, is achieved in a prototype paraelectric strontium titanate (SrTiO3) homoepitaxial film embedded with Ti/O&#8208;deficient perovskite nanoregions. It is shown that these unique nanoregions impose large out&#8208;of&#8208;plane tensile strain and electron&#8208;doping effects on the matrix to form a tetragonal structure (tetragonality = 1.038), driving the off&#8208;center movements of Ti and Sr atoms. This leads to a significant room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric polarization (maximum polarization = 41.6 &#181;C cm&#8722;2 and spontaneous polarization = 25.2 &#181;C cm&#8722;2 at 1.60 MV cm&#8722;1) with a high thermal stability (Tstable&#160;&#8776; 1098 K). The proposed approach can be applied to various paraelectrics for creating ferroelectricity and generating emergent physical properties, opening the door to a new realm of materials design.

         <title>Bioinspired Soft Microactuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired soft microactuators (BSMAs) are designed with inspiration from the dermic of the sea cucumber and from plant tendrils, for simultaneous achievement of programmable actuation and high mechanical property contrast. Droplet microfluidics allows miniaturized, facile, and seamless fabrication of the BSMAs. Applications of the BSMAs as microlifters, reversible microgrippers, artificial tendrils, and microrobots for object manipulation/transportation in different and complex environments are demonstrated.








Abstract
Soft actuators have the potential of revolutionizing the field of robotics. However, it has been a long&#8208;standing challenge to achieve simultaneously: i) miniaturization of soft actuators, ii) high contrast between materials properties at their &#8220;on&#8221; and &#8220;off&#8221; states, iii) significant actuation for high&#8208;payload mechanical work, and iv) ability to perform diverse shape transformations. This challenge is addressed by synergistically utilizing structural concepts found in the dermis of sea cucumbers and the tendrils of climbing plants, together with microfluidic fabrication to create diatomite&#8208;laden hygroscopically responsive fibers with a discontinuous ribbon of stiff, asymmetrically shaped, and hygroscopically inactive microparticles embedded inside. The microactuators can undergo various deformations and have very high property contrast ratios (20&#8211;850 for various mechanical characteristics of interest) between hydrated and dehydrated states. The resulting energy density, actuation strain, and actuation stress are shown to exceed those of natural muscle by &#8776;4, &gt;2, and &gt;30 times, respectively, and their weight&#8208;lifting ratio is 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher than the value of recent hygroscopic actuators. This work offers a new and general way to design and fabricate next&#8208;generation soft microactuators, and thus advances the field of soft robotics by tailoring the structure and properties of deformable elements to suit a desired application.

The resulting energy density, actuation strain, and actuation stress are shown to exceed those of natural muscle by &#8776;4, &amp;gt;2, and &amp;gt;30 times, respectively, and their weight&#8208;lifting ratio is 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher than the value of recent hygroscopic actuators. This work offers a new and general way to design and fabricate next&#8208;generation soft microactuators, and thus advances the field of soft robotics by tailoring the structure and properties of deformable elements to suit a desired application.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Materials for Improving Immune Cell Transfection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The therapeutic efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor immune cell therapy requires immune cells to be successfully transfected with biomolecules like oligonucleotides and proteins. The progress in immune cell transfection using emerging materials, including microfluidics, nanoparticles, and high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanostructures is discussed, and their promise and drawbacks against conventional tools like viral vectors and electroporation are evaluated.








Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR&#8208;T) therapy holds great promise for preventing and treating deadly diseases such as cancer. However, it remains challenging to transfect and engineer primary immune cells for clinical cell manufacturing. Conventional tools using viral vectors and bulk electroporation suffer from low efficiency while posing risks like viral transgene integration and excessive biological perturbations. Emerging techniques using microfluidics, nanoparticles, and high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanostructures can overcome these challenges, and on top of that, provide universal and high&#8208;throughput cargo delivery. Herein, the strengths and limitations of traditional and emerging materials for immune cell transfection, and commercial development of these tools, are discussed. To enhance the characterization of transfection techniques and uptake by the clinical community, a list of in vitro and in vivo assays to perform, along with relevant protocols, is recommended. The overall aim, herein, is to motivate the development of novel materials to meet rising demand in transfection for clinical CAR&#8208;T cell manufacturing.

         <title>Giant Ferroelectric Resistance Switching Controlled by a Modulatory Terminal for Low&#8208;Power Neuromorphic In&#8208;Memory Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric switching in a van der Waals ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 is used to achieve a resistance&#8208;switching ratio of heterosynaptic memristors above 103. The &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 heterosynaptic memristors feature picojoule read&#8208;energy consumption. The simulation proves that both supervised and unsupervised learning manners can be implemented in &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 neutral networks with high image recognition accuracy. Moreover, these devices can also realize in&#8208;memory computing.








Abstract
Ferroelectrics have been demonstrated as excellent building blocks for high&#8208;performance nonvolatile memories, including memristors, which play critical roles in the hardware implementation of artificial synapses and in&#8208;memory computing. Here, it is reported that the emerging van der Waals ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 can be used to successfully implement heterosynaptic plasticity (a fundamental but rarely emulated synaptic form) and achieve a resistance&#8208;switching ratio of heterosynaptic memristors above 103, which is two orders of magnitude larger than that in other similar devices. The polarization change of ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 channel is responsible for the resistance switching at various paired terminals. The third terminal of &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 memristors exhibits nonvolatile control over channel current at a picoampere level, endowing the devices with picojoule read&#8208;energy consumption to emulate the associative heterosynaptic learning. The simulation proves that both supervised and unsupervised learning manners can be implemented in &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 neutral networks with high image recognition accuracy. Moreover, these heterosynaptic devices can naturally realize Boolean logic without an additional circuit component. The results suggest that van der Waals ferroelectrics hold great potential for applications in complex, energy&#8208;efficient, brain&#8208;inspired computing systems and logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory computers.

         <title>From Chaos to Control: Programmable Crack Patterning with Molecular Order in Polymer Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cracks are normally classified as material failures to be prevented. A crack patterning strategy is described that allows freely programmable patterns of cracks guided by the alignment of liquid crystal polymer networks. This programmable cracking enables high&#8208;resolution patterning in a high&#8208;throughput manner without the use of expensive lithography procedures and may serve as an alternative fabrication strategy for various applications.








Abstract
Cracks are typically associated with the failure of materials. However, cracks can also be used to create periodic patterns on the surfaces of materials, as observed in the skin of crocodiles and elephants. In synthetic materials, surface patterns are critical to micro&#8208; and nanoscale fabrication processes. Here, a strategy is presented that enables freely programmable patterns of cracks on the surface of a polymer and then uses these cracks to pattern other materials. Cracks form during deposition of a thin film metal on a liquid crystal polymer network (LCN) and follow the spatially patterned molecular order of the polymer. These patterned sub&#8208;micrometer scale cracks have an order parameter of 0.98&#160;&#177; 0.02 and form readily over centimeter&#8208;scale areas on the flexible substrates. The patterning of the LCN enables cracks that turn corners, spiral azimuthally, or radiate from a point. Conductive inks can be filled into these oriented cracks, resulting in flexible, anisotropic, and transparent conductors. This materials&#8208;based processing approach to patterning cracks enables unprecedented control of the orientation, length, width, and depth of the cracks without costly lithography methods. This approach promises new architectures of electronics, sensors, fluidics, optics, and other devices with micro&#8208; and nanoscale features.

         <title>New Silk Road: From Mesoscopic Reconstruction/Functionalization to Flexible Meso&#8208;Electronics/Photonics Based on Cocoon Silk Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the mesoscopic multi&#8208;levels of structures and the intermolecular nucleation control mechanism, a revolutionary materials strategy from mesoscopic reconstruction to the fabrication of new conceptual meso&#8208;electronic/photonic devices is presented based on silk fibroin materials. This development turns out to be very crucial in the field of flexible electronics, optics/photonics, and biomedical/healthcare, which leads to the New Silk Road in big health and the artificial intelligence era.








Abstract
Two of the key questions to be addressed are whether and how one can turn cocoon silk into fascinating materials with different electronic and optical functions so as to fabricate the flexible devices. In this review, a comprehensive overview of the unique strategy of mesoscopic functionalization starting from silk fibroin (SF) materials to the fabrication of various meso flexible SF devices is presented. Notably, SF materials with novel and enhanced properties can be achieved by mesoscopically reconstructing the hierarchical structures of SF materials. This is based on rerouting the refolding process of SF molecules by meso&#8208;nucleation templating. As&#8208;acquired functionalized SF materials can be applied to fabricate bio&#8208;compatible/degradable flexible/implantable meso&#8208;optical/electronic devices of various types. Consequently, functionalized SF can be fabricated into optical elements, that is, nonlinear photonic and fluorescent components, and make it possible to construct silk meso&#8208;electronics with high&#8208;performance. These advances enable the applications of SF&#8208;material based devices in the areas of physical and biochemical sensing, meso&#8208;memristors, transistors, brain electrodes, and energy generation/storage, applicable to on&#8208;skin long&#8208;term monitoring of human physiological conditions, and in&#8208;body sensing, information processing, and storage.

         <title>25 Years of Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells: A Flexible and Stretchable Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For 25 years, the unique structural and operating properties of light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) have invited creative research exploration. A discussion of how the LEC became a robust and fault&#8208;tolerant platform for mechanically flexible and stretchable devices through the integration of new emissive and electrode materials is presented. Printing fabrication methods, vital for the commercialization of flexible LECs, are also discussed.








Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are simple electroluminescent devices comprising an emissive material containing mobile ions sandwiched between two electrodes.

&lt;p&gt;For 25 years, the unique structural and operating properties of light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) have invited creative research exploration. A discussion of how the LEC became a robust and fault&#8208;tolerant platform for mechanically flexible and stretchable devices through the integration of new emissive and electrode materials is presented. Printing fabrication methods, vital for the commercialization of flexible LECs, are also discussed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are simple electroluminescent devices comprising an emissive material containing mobile ions sandwiched between two electrodes. The operating mechanism of the LEC involves both ionic and electronic transport, distinguishing it from its more well&#8208;known cousin, the organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED). While OLEDs have become a leading player in commercial displays, LECs have flourished in academic research due to the simple device architecture and unique features of its operating mechanism, inviting exploration of new materials and fabrication strategies.

         <title>Dispersion&#8208;Controlled Gold&#8211;Aluminum&#8211;Silicon Dioxide&#8211;Aluminum Nanopawn Structures for Visible to NIR Light Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dispersion&#8208;controlled Au nanocolloidal lithography is developed, offering high selectivity for Al and SiO2 over Au nanoparticles. By customizing the SF6 etching&#8208;gas flow and inductively coupled plasma power conditions, uniformly dispersed multi&#8208;material nanopawn structures with good sidewall verticality (&#8776;90&#176;) and high aspect ratio (&gt;1) are demonstrated. As practical applications, triple&#8208;channel color filters and complementary&#8208;color information encryption are demonstrated.








Abstract
As an efficient patterning method for nanostructures, nanocolloidal lithography (NCL) presents a controllable and scalable means for achieving a uniform and good sidewall profile, and a high aspect ratio. While high selectivity between the etching mask and targeted materials is also essential for NCL&#8208;based precision nanophotonic structures, its realization in multi&#8208;material nanophotonic structures still remains a challenge due to the dielectric&#8208; or metallic&#8208;material&#8208;dependent etching selectivity. Here, dispersion&#8208;controlled Au&#8208;NCL is proposed, which enables high selectivity for Al and SiO2 over a Au nanoparticle (Au&#8208;NP) mask. Utilizing the proposed process, wafer&#8208;scale, uniformly dispersed multi&#8208;material nanopawn structures (Au&#8208;NPs/Al&#8211;SiO2 cylinders) on an Al ultrathin film are realized, obtaining excellent vertical sidewall (&#8776;90&#176;) and aspect ratio (&gt;1). The high sidewall verticality and aspect ratio of the nanopawn structures support optical modes highly sensitive to the excitation direction of incident waves through the mixing of the interface&#8208;gap&#8208;assisted localized surface plasmons (GLSPs) formed in between the Au&#8208;NP and Al&#8208;disk interface, and plasmonic Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) modes formed in between the Al&#8208;disk and Al substrate; complementary spectral responses between reflected and scattered light are also demonstrated. As an application example, information encryption based on the triple&#8208;channel (i.e., reflection, scattering, and transmission) angle&#8208;dependent complementary&#8208;color responses is presented.

         <title>Epitaxial Single&#8208;Crystal Growth of Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Monolayers via the Atomic Sawtooth Au Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic sawtooth Au surface allows the anisotropic adsorption energy of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMdC) clusters to yield unidirectional epitaxial growth of triangular TMdC grains, eventually forming a single&#8208;crystal TMdC film, regardless of the Miller indices. Growth using the atomic sawtooth gold surface as a universal growth template is further demonstrated for several TMdC monolayer films, including WS2, WSe2, MoS2, the MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructure, and W1&#8722;xMoxS2 alloys.








Abstract
Growth of 2D van der Waals layered single&#8208;crystal (SC) films is highly desired not only to manifest the intrinsic physical and chemical properties of materials, but also to enable the development of unprecedented devices for industrial applications. While wafer&#8208;scale SC hexagonal boron nitride film has been successfully grown, an ideal growth platform for diatomic transition metal dichalcogenide (TMdC) films has not been established to date. Here, the SC growth of TMdC monolayers on a centimeter scale via the atomic sawtooth gold surface as a universal growth template is reported. The atomic tooth&#8208;gullet surface is constructed by the one&#8208;step solidification of liquid gold, evidenced by transmission electron microscopy. The anisotropic adsorption energy of the TMdC cluster, confirmed by density&#8208;functional calculations, prevails at the periodic atomic&#8208;step edge to yield unidirectional epitaxial growth of triangular TMdC grains, eventually forming the SC film, regardless of the Miller indices. Growth using the atomic sawtooth gold surface as a universal growth template is demonstrated for several TMdC monolayer films, including WS2, WSe2, MoS2, the MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructure, and W1&#8722;xMoxS2 alloys. This strategy provides a general avenue for the SC growth of diatomic van der Waals heterostructures on a wafer scale, to further facilitate the applications of TMdCs in post&#8208;silicon technology.

         <title>Perovskite Quantum Dots with Ultralow Trap Density by Acid Etching&#8208;Driven Ligand Exchange for High Luminance and Stable Pure&#8208;Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes based on stable small&#8208;sized CsPbBr3 quantum dots obtained by a novel acid etching&#8208;driven ligand exchange exhibit blue emission (470&#160;nm) with record luminance of 3850&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, external quantum efficiency of 4.7%, and long&#8208;term operational stability of 12 h.








Abstract
The research on metal halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with green and infrared emission has demonstrated significant progress in achieving higher functional performance. However, the realization of stable pure&#8208;blue (&#8776;470&#160;nm wavelength) PeLEDs with increased brightness and efficiency still constitutes a considerable challenge. Here, a novel acid etching&#8208;driven ligand exchange strategy is devised for achieving pure&#8208;blue emitting small&#8208;sized (&#8776;4&#160;nm) CsPbBr3 perovskite quantum dots (QDs) with ultralow trap density and excellent stability. The acid, hydrogen bromide (HBr), is employed to etch imperfect [PbBr6]4&#8722; octahedrons, thereby removing surface defects and excessive carboxylate ligands. Subsequently, didodecylamine and phenethylamine are successively introduced to bond the residual uncoordinated sites of the QDs and attain in situ exchange with the original long&#8208;chain organic ligands, resulting in near&#8208;unity quantum yield (97%) and remarkable stability. The QD&#8208;based PeLEDs exhibit pure&#8208;blue electroluminescence at 470&#160;nm (corresponding to the Commission Internationale del'Eclairage (CIE) (0.13,&#160;0.11) coordinates), an external quantum efficiency of 4.7%, and a remarkable luminance of 3850&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which is the highest brightness reported so far for pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs. Furthermore, the PeLEDs exhibit robust durability, with a half&#8208;lifetime exceeding 12 h under continuous operation, representing a record performance value for blue PeLEDs.

         <title>3D Printing of Transparent Spinel Ceramics with Transmittance Approaching the Theoretical Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnesium aluminate spinel transparent ceramics with transmittance reaching 97% of the theoretical limit are successfully 3D printed with a high printing resolution of &#8776;100&#8211;200&#160;&#181;m. Application of the printed ceramics for optical imaging and photocatalyst support is explored.








Abstract
3D printing of transparent ceramics has attracted great attention recently but faces the challenges of low transparency and low printing resolution. Herein, magnesium aluminate spinel transparent ceramics with transmittance reaching 97% of the theoretical limit are successfully fabricated using a stereolithography&#8208;based 3D printing method assisted by hot isostatic pressing and the critical factors governing the transparency are revealed. Various transparent spinel lenses and microlattices are printed at a high resolution of &#8776;100&#8211;200&#160;&#181;m. The 3D printed spinel lens demonstrates fairly good optical imaging ability, and the printed spinel diamond microlattices as a transparent photocatalyst support for TiO2 significantly enhance its photocatalytic efficiency compared with its opaque counterparts. Compared with other 3D printed transparent materials such as silica glass or organic polymers, the printed spinel ceramics have the advantages of broad optical window, high hardness, excellent high&#8208;temperature stability, and chemical resistance and therefore, have great potential to be used in various optical lenses/windows and photocatalyst supports for application in harsh environments.

         <title>Wicking&#8211;Polarization&#8208;Induced Water Cluster Size Effect on Triboelectric Evaporation Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A textile that can couple active triboelectric polarization and passive wicking to break&#8208;up large&#8208;sized water clusters into small&#8208;sized water clusters or water monomers is reported to promote sweat evaporation. This textile is a useful weapon for eliminating sweat produced by strenuous exercise, and it also shows broad application prospects in quick&#8208;drying sportswear, cooling fabrics and wireless sports monitoring insoles.








Abstract
Sweating during exercise, physical labor, or hot weather leads to a feeling of discomfort. The stuffiness, stickiness, and heaviness brought by sweat may promote negative emotions or disease. Clothing, textiles, and wearable devices exacerbate these problems by restricting evaporation of sweat. Here, a textile that can promote and enhance sweat evaporation by coupling wicking and polarization is reported. The wicking is produced by the wettability gradient and pore size, which make the surface moisture content of the textile in contact with the skin strictly 0%. The polarization is driven by a ferroelectric&#8208;enhanced triboelectric textile. This textile degrades large&#8208;sized water clusters into small&#8208;sized water clusters or water monomers, so that the textiles have an excellent moisture evaporation rate (4.4 and 3.6 times faster than the cotton and polyester textiles, respectively). This work provides a new source of inspiration for quick&#8208;drying textiles and also finds an attractive application for triboelectric technology.

         <title>Color of Copper/Copper Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically flat perfect single&#8208;crystal Cu films prepared by the atomic&#8208;sputtering epitaxy method realize the coherent propagation of an oxidation front and display full&#8208;color by controlling the oxide&#8208;layer thickness. More than 50% of the standard red/green/blue color space is covered. Laser&#8208;oxide lithography forming a microscale local oxide embedded in metal is introduced.








Abstract
Stochastic inhomogeneous oxidation is an inherent characteristic of copper (Cu), often hindering color tuning and bandgap engineering of oxides. Coherent control of the interface between metal and metal oxide remains unresolved. Coherent propagation of an oxidation front in single&#8208;crystal Cu thin film is demonstrated to achieve a full&#8208;color spectrum for Cu by precisely controlling its oxide&#8208;layer thickness. Grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;free and atomically flat films prepared by atomic&#8208;sputtering epitaxy allow tailoring of the oxide layer with an abrupt interface via heat treatment with a suppressed temperature gradient. Color tuning of nearly full&#8208;color red/green/blue indices is realized by precise control of the oxide&#8208;layer thickness; the samples cover &#8776;50.4% of the standard red/green/blue color space. The color of copper/copper oxide is realized by the reconstruction of the quantitative yield color from the oxide &#8220;pigment&#8221; (complex dielectric functions of Cu2O) and light&#8208;layer interference (reflectance spectra obtained from the Fresnel equations) to produce structural color. Furthermore, laser&#8208;oxide lithography is demonstrated with micrometer&#8208;scale linewidth and depth through local phase transformation to oxides embedded in the metal, providing spacing necessary for semiconducting transport and optoelectronics functionality.

         <title>Anomalous High&#8208;Temperature Superconductivity in YH6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel yttrium hexahydride YH6 is synthesized, an outstanding high&#8208;TC superconductor with critical temperature of 224&#8211;226&#160;K and unexpectedly large upper critical magnetic field &#8776;116&#8211;158 T. YH6 demonstrates high critical current density of &#8776;3500&#160;A mm&#8722;2 at 4&#160;K, which is above that of NbTi and YBCO. This study points to a possible additional nonconventional contribution to superconductivity in YH6.








Abstract
Pressure&#8208;stabilized hydrides are a new rapidly growing class of high&#8208;temperature superconductors, which is believed to be described within the conventional phonon&#8208;mediated mechanism of coupling. Here, the synthesis of one of the best&#8208;known high&#8208;TC superconductors&#8212;yttrium hexahydride Im3&#175;m&#8208;YH6 is reported, which displays a superconducting transition at &#8776;224&#160;K at 166&#160;GPa. The extrapolated upper critical magnetic field Bc2(0)&#160;of YH6 is surprisingly high: 116&#8211;158&#160;T, which is 2&#8211;2.5 times larger than the calculated value. A pronounced shift of TC in yttrium deuteride YD6 with the isotope coefficient 0.4 supports the phonon&#8208;assisted superconductivity. Current&#8211;voltage measurements show that the critical current IC and its density JC may exceed 1.75&#160;A and 3500&#160;A mm&#8722;2 at 4&#160;K, respectively, which is higher than that of the commercial superconductors, such as NbTi and YBCO. The results of superconducting density functional theory (SCDFT) and anharmonic calculations, together with anomalously high critical magnetic field, suggest notable departures of the superconducting properties from the conventional Migdal&#8211;Eliashberg and Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer theories, and presence of an additional mechanism of superconductivity.

A curcumin (CUR) and cisplatin (CDDP) co&#8208;incorporating multichannel calcium&#8208;ion (Ca2+) nanomodulator (PEGCaNMCUR+CDDP) demonstrates enhanced anticancer efficacy owing to induced multilevel mitochondrial damage by Ca2+ overload, which is promoted by the degradation of amorphous calcium carbonate, the CUR&#8208;mediated Ca2+ metabolism, and the CDDP&#8208;augmented synergistic destruction of mitochondria, which can be visualized by both fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging.








Abstract
Subcellular organelle&#8208;targeted nanoformulations for cancer theranostics are receiving increasing attention owing to their benefits of precise drug delivery, maximized therapeutic index, and reduced off&#8208;target side effects. Herein, a multichannel calcium ion (Ca2+) nanomodulator (CaNMCUR+CDDP), i.e., a cisplatin (CDDP) and curcumin (CUR) co&#8208;incorporating calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticle, is prepared by a facile one&#8208;pot strategy in a sealed container with in situ synthesized polydopamine (PDA) as a template to enhance Ca2+&#8208;overload&#8208;induced mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer therapy. After systemic administration, the PEGylated CaNMCUR+CDDP (PEGCaNMCUR+CDDP) selectively accumulates in tumor tissues, enters tumor cells, and induces multilevel destruction of mitochondria by the combined effects of burst Ca2+ release, Ca2+ efflux inhibition by CUR, and chemotherapeutic CDDP, thereby observably boosting mitochondria&#8208;targeted tumor inhibition. Fluorescence imaging of CUR combined with photoacoustic imaging of PDA facilitates the visualization of the nanomodulator. The facile and practical design of this multichannel Ca2+ nanomodulator will contribute to the development of multimodal bioimaging&#8208;guided organelle&#8208;targeted cancer therapy in the future.

         <title>Mechanically Efficient Cellular Materials Inspired by Cuttlebone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex structure and functional advantages of the cuttlebone are revealed. The cuttlebone structure, constructed like lamellar septa, separated by asymmetric, distorted S&#8208;shaped walls, exhibits superior strength and energy&#8208;absorption capability to the octet&#8208;truss lattice and conventional polymer and metal foams. This study represents an effective approach for the design and engineering of high&#8208;performance cellular materials through bioinspired 3D printing.








Abstract
Cellular materials with excellent mechanical efficiency are essential for aerospace structures, lightweight vehicles, and energy absorption. However, current synthetic cellular materials, such as lattice materials with a unit cell arranged in an ordered hierarchy, are still far behind many biological cellular materials in terms of both structural complexity and mechanical performance. Here, the complex porous structure and the mechanics of the cuttlebone are studied, which acts as a rigid buoyancy tank for cuttlefish to resist large hydrostatic pressure in the deep&#8208;sea environment. The cuttlebone structure, constructed like lamellar septa, separated by asymmetric, distorted S&#8208;shaped walls, exhibits superior strength and energy&#8208;absorption capability to the octet&#8208;truss lattice and conventional polymer and metal foams. Inspired by these findings, mechanically efficient cellular materials are designed and fabricated by 3D printing, which are greatly demanded for many applications including aerospace structures and tissue&#8208;engineering&#8208;scaffold. This study represents an effective approach for the design and engineering of high&#8208;performance cellular materials through bioinspired 3D printing.

         <title>Electrically Tunable Singular Phase and Goos&#8211;H&#228;nchen Shifts in Phase&#8208;Change&#8208;Material&#8208;Based Thin&#8208;Film Coatings as Optical Absorbers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically tunable phase and Goos&#8211;H&#228;nchen (G&#8211;H)&#160;shifts in the visible wavelengths using an innovative design of lithography&#8208;free nanophotonic cavities are experimentally presented. By using the temperature&#8208;induced refractive index changes of transparent dielectric film and the structural phase&#8208;change properties of chalcogenide phase&#8208;change material, wide tunability in G&#8211;H&#160;shift at the singular phase of light is demonstrated.








Abstract
The change of the phase of light under the evolution of a nanomaterial with time is a promising new research direction. A phenomenon directly related to the sudden phase change of light is the Goos&#8211;H&#228;nchen&#160;(G&#8211;H) shift, which describes the lateral beam displacement of the reflected light from the interface of two media when the angles of incidence are close to the total internal reflection angle or Brewster angle. Here, an innovative design of lithography&#8208;free nanophotonic cavities to realize electrically tunable G&#8211;H shifts at the singular phase of light in the visible wavelengths is reported. Reversible electrical tuning of phase and G&#8211;H shifts is experimentally demonstrated using a microheater integrated optical cavity consisting of a dielectric film on an absorbing substrate through a Joule heating mechanism. In particular, an enhanced G&#8211;H shift of 110 times of the operating wavelength at the Brewster angle of the thin&#8208;film cavity is reported. More importantly, electrically tunable G&#8211;H shifts are demonstrated by exploiting the significant tunable phase change that occurs at the Brewster angles, due to the small temperature&#8208;induced refractive index changes of the dielectric film. Realizing efficient electrically tunable G&#8211;H shifts with miniaturized heaters will extend the research scope of the G&#8211;H shift phenomenon and its applications.

The pursuit for high bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity is the key issue to achieve advanced rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. In article number 2008606, Bo&#8208;Quan Li and co&#8208;workers fabricate a composite noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst with bifunctional activity of &#916;E = 0.63 V. Such high bifunctional activity greatly refreshes the record by ca. 50 mV and renders extraordinary performances of corresponding rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Monotherapy and Combination Therapy Using Anti&#8208;Angiogenic Nanoagents to Fight Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of monotherapy and combination therapy using anti&#8208;angiogenic agents for fighting cancer is presented. Traditional cancer anti&#8208;angiogenic monotherapy and its limitations are summarized. Then, anti&#8208;angiogenic nanoagents and how they can be used in combined strategies with chemo/radio/photo/immunotherapy are illustrated. This review can provide valuable instruction on anti&#8208;angiogenic and combined strategies to improve anti&#8208;tumor outcome.








Abstract
Anti&#8208;angiogenic therapy, targeting vascular endothelial cells (ECs) to prevent tumor growth, has been attracting increasing attention in recent years, beginning with bevacizumab (Avastin) through its Phase II/III clinical trials on solid tumors. However, these trials showed only modest clinical efficiency; moreover, anti&#8208;angiogenic therapy may induce acquired resistance to the drugs employed. Combining advanced drug delivery techniques (e.g., nanotechnology) or other therapeutic strategies (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, phototherapy, and immunotherapy) with anti&#8208;angiogenic therapy results in significantly synergistic effects and has opened a new horizon in fighting cancer. Herein, clinical difficulties in using traditional anti&#8208;angiogenic therapy are discussed. Then, several promising applications of anti&#8208;angiogenic nanoagents in monotherapies and combination therapies are highlighted. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of anti&#8208;angiogenic cancer therapy are summarized. A useful introduction to anti&#8208;angiogenic strategies, which may significantly improve therapeutic outcomes, is thus provided.

Then, anti&#8208;angiogenic nanoagents and how they can be used in combined strategies with chemo/radio/photo/immunotherapy are illustrated. This review can provide valuable instruction on anti&#8208;angiogenic and combined strategies to improve anti&#8208;tumor outcome.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti&#8208;angiogenic therapy, targeting vascular endothelial cells (ECs) to prevent tumor growth, has been attracting increasing attention in recent years, beginning with bevacizumab (Avastin) through its Phase II/III clinical trials on solid tumors. However, these trials showed only modest clinical efficiency; moreover, anti&#8208;angiogenic therapy may induce acquired resistance to the drugs employed. Combining advanced drug delivery techniques (e.g., nanotechnology) or other therapeutic strategies (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, phototherapy, and immunotherapy) with anti&#8208;angiogenic therapy results in significantly synergistic effects and has opened a new horizon in fighting cancer. Herein, clinical difficulties in using traditional anti&#8208;angiogenic therapy are discussed. Then, several promising applications of anti&#8208;angiogenic nanoagents in monotherapies and combination therapies are highlighted. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of anti&#8208;angiogenic cancer therapy are summarized. A useful introduction to anti&#8208;angiogenic strategies, which may significantly improve therapeutic outcomes, is thus provided.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Photodetectors of 2D Materials from Ultraviolet to Terahertz Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main mechanisms and recent significant progress of 2D material photodetectors from ultraviolet to terahertz waves are summarized. The overestimated performance of 2D material photodetectors is revealed. Photodetectors of 2D materials are compared with conventional materials, and an electromagnetic induced well (EIW) mechanism strategy is proposed to utilize the thinness advantage of 2D materials to develop excellent photodetectors.








Abstract
2D materials are considered to be the most promising materials for photodetectors due to their unique optical and electrical properties. Since the discovery of graphene, many photodetectors based on 2D materials have been reported. However, the low quantum efficiency, large noise, and slow response caused by the thinness of 2D materials limit their application in photodetectors. Here, recent progress on 2D material photodetectors is reviewed, covering the spectrum from ultraviolet to terahertz waves. First the interaction of 2D materials with light is analyzed in terms of optical physics. Then the present methods to improve the performance of 2D material photodetectors are summarized, such as defect engineering, p&#8211;n junctions and hybrid detectors, and the issue of serious overestimation of the performance in reported photodetectors based on 2D materials is discussed. Next, a comparison of 2D material photodetectors with traditional commercially available detectors shows that it is difficult to balance the current 2D material photodetectors with regard to having simultaneously both high sensitivity and fast response. Finally, a possible novel EIW mechanism is suggested to advance the performance of 2D material photodetectors in the future.

         <title>2D Homojunctions for Electronics and Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The booming development of 2D homojunctions has received tremendous attention over the past years. The recent research progress on the construction strategies and device applications in electronics and optoelectronics is comprehensively summarized.








Abstract
In the post&#8208;Moore era, 2D materials with rich physical properties have attracted widespread attention from the scientific and industrial communities. Among 2D materials, the 2D homojunctions are of great promise in designing novel electronic and optoelectronic devices due to their unique geometries and properties such as homogeneous components, perfect lattice matching, and efficient charge transfer at the interface. In this article, a pioneering review focusing on the structural design and device application of 2D homojunctions such as p&#8211;n homojunctions, heterophase homojunctions, and layer&#8208;engineered homojunctions is provided. The preparation strategies to construct 2D homojunctions including vapor&#8208;phase deposition, lithium intercalation, laser irradiation, chemical doping, electrostatic doping, and photodoping are summarized in detail. Specifically, a careful review on the applications of the 2D homojunctions in electronics (e.g., field&#8208;effect transistors, rectifiers, and inverters) and optoelectronics (e.g., light&#8208;emitting diodes, photovoltaics, and photodetectors) is provided. Eventually, the current challenges and future perspectives are commented for promoting the rapid development of 2D homojunctions.

         <title>Diffusive and Drift Halide Perovskite Memristive Barristors as Nociceptive and Synaptic Emulators for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskite memristive barristors (diodes with variable Schottky barriers) portraying tunable diffusive dynamics and ionic drift as nociceptive and synaptic emulators for neuromorphic sensory signal computing are experimentally demonstrated. Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate interfaces promote diffusive kinetics while NiOx interfaces support drift kinetics with CH3NH3PbBr3 as the switching matrix, resulting in modulatable diffusive and drift memristors respectively.








Abstract
With the current research impetus on neuromorphic computing hardware, realizing efficient drift and diffusive memristors are considered critical milestones for the implementation of readout layers, selectors, and frameworks in deep learning and reservoir computing networks. Current demonstrations are predominantly limited to oxide insulators with a soft breakdown behavior. While organic ionotronic electrochemical materials offer an attractive alternative, their implementations thus far have been limited to features exploiting ionic drift a.k.a. drift memristor technology. Development of diffusive memristors with organic electrochemical materials is still at an early stage, and modulation of their switching dynamics remains unexplored. Here, halide perovskite (HP) memristive barristors (diodes with variable Schottky barriers) portraying tunable diffusive dynamics and ionic drift are proposed and experimentally demonstrated. An ion permissive poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate interface that promotes diffusive kinetics and an ion source nickel oxide (NiOx) interface that supports drift kinetics are identified to design diffusive and drift memristors, respectively, with methylammonuim lead bromide (CH3NH3PbBr3) as the switching matrix. In line with the recent interest on developing artificial afferent nerves as information channels bridging sensors and artificial neural networks, these HP memristive barristors are fashioned as nociceptive and synaptic emulators for neuromorphic sensory signal computing.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Operational Stability &gt;300 h</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermodynamically stable &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystals are prepared, and they are demonstrated to function as a stable, efficient red&#8208;emitting layer. With incorporation of poly(maleic anhydride&#8208;alt&#8208;1&#8208;octadecene), the &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 further exhibits reduced deep defects of PbCs, increased exciton binding energy, and reduced longitudinal&#8208;optical phonon energy. Red&#8208;emitting perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) based on &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 achieve both high external quantum efficiency and superior operational stability.








Abstract
The long&#8208;term operational stability of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), especially red PeLEDs with only several hours typically, has always faced great challenges. Stable &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystals (NCs) are demonstrated for highly efficient and stable red&#8208;emitting PeLEDs through incorporation of poly(maleic anhydride&#8208;alt&#8208;1&#8208;octadecene) (PMA) in synthesizing the NCs. The PMA can chemically interact with PbI2 in the precursors via the coupling effect between O groups in PMA and Pb2+ to favor crystallization of stable &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 NCs. Meanwhile, the cross&#8208;linked PMA significantly reduces the PbCs anti&#8208;site defect on the surface of the &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 NCs. Benefiting from the improved crystal phase quality, the photoluminescence quantum yield for &#946;&#8208;CsPbI3 NCs films remarkably increases from 34% to 89%. The corresponding red&#8208;emitting PeLEDs achieves a high external quantum efficiency of 17.8% and superior operational stability with the lifetime, the time to half the initial electroluminescence intensity (T50) reaching 317 h at a constant current density of 30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Trap Energy Upconversion&#8208;Like Near&#8208;Infrared to Near&#8208;Infrared Light Rejuvenateable Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new paradigm of trap energy upconversion&#8208;like near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to NIR light rejuvenateable persistent luminescence in bismuth&#8208;doped calcium stannate phosphors and nanoparticles is reported. These materials enable the occurrence of a reversed transition of the carriers from a deep&#8208;level energy trap to a shallow&#8208;level trap upon excitation by low&#8208;energy NIR photons. Thus they can be charged circularly via deep&#8208;tissue penetrable NIR photons.








Abstract
Persistent&#8208;luminescence phosphors (PLPs) have a wide variety of applications in the fields of photonics and biophotonics due to their ultralong afterglow lifetime. However, the existing PLPs are charged and recharged with short&#8208;wavelength high&#8208;energy photons or inconvenient and potentially risky X&#8208;ray beams. To date, deep tissue penetrable NIR light has mainly been used for photostimulated afterglow emission, which continues to decay and weaken after each cycle, Herein, a new paradigm of trap energy upconversion&#8208;like near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to near&#8208;infrared light rejuvenateable persistent luminescence in bismuth&#8208;doped calcium stannate phosphors and nanoparticles is reported. In contrast to the existing PLPs and persistent&#8208;luminescence nanoparticles, the materials enable the occurrence of a reversed transition of the carriers from a deep&#8208;level energy trap to a shallow&#8208;level trap upon excitation by low&#8208;energy NIR photons. Thus these new materials can be charged circularly via deep&#8208;tissue penetrable NIR photons, which is unable to be done for existing PLPs, and emit afterglow signals. This conceptual work will lay the foundation to design new categories of NIR&#8208;absorptive&#8211;NIR&#8208;emissive PLPs and nanoparticles featuring physically harmless and deep tissue penetrable NIR light renewability and sets the stage for numerous biological applications, which have been limited by current materials.

         <title>Stable Unbiased Photo&#8208;Electrochemical Overall Water Splitting Exceeding 3% Efficiency via Covalent Triazine Framework/Metal Oxide Hybrid Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rationally designed covalent triazine frameworks are conformably deposited on both photocathodes and photoanodes, successfully addressing the trade&#8208;off between stability and efficiency of photoelectrodes for photo&#8208;electrochemical water splitting. Coupling organic semiconductors with inorganic photoelectrodes could be a feasible means for practical photo&#8208;electrochemical water splitting.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) water splitting systems using oxide&#8208;based photoelectrodes are highly attractive for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. However, despite decades&#8208;long efforts, it is still challenging to develop efficient and stable photoelectrodes for practical applications. Here, thin layers of covalent triazine frameworks (CTF&#8208;BTh) containing a bithiophene moiety are conformably deposited onto the surfaces of a Cu2O photocathode and a Mo&#8208;doped BiVO4 photoanode via electropolymerization to construct new hybrid photoelectrodes, successfully addressing the efficiency and stability issues. The CTF&#8208;BTh possesses a suitable band structure to form favorable band edge alignment with each metal oxide, creating a p&#8211;n junction and a staggered type&#8208;II heterojunction with Cu2O and Mo&#8208;doped BiVO4, respectively. Thus, the as&#8208;fabricated hybrid photoelectrodes exhibit substantially increased PEC performances. Meanwhile, the CTF&#8208;BTh film also serves as an effective corrosion&#8208;resistant overlayer for both photoelectrodes to inhibit photocorrosion and enable long&#8208;term operation for 150 h with only &#8776;10% loss in photocurrent densities. Furthermore, a stand&#8208;alone unbiased PEC tandem device comprising CTF&#8208;BTh&#8208;coated photoelectrodes exhibits 3.70% solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency. Even after continuous operation for 120 h, the efficiency can still retain at 3.24%.

         <title>Thermoregulating Separators Based on Phase&#8208;Change Materials for Safe Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally self&#8208;regulating separators are designed and fabricated to enhance the safety of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) through a nanoscale incorporation route, whereby a phase&#8208;change material capable of thermal storage is encapsulated coaxially into polymeric nanofibers. Such an unusual separator can alleviate the internal heat accumulation and temperature rise inside LIBs even under abuse conditions.








Abstract
Safety issues in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have aroused great interest owing to their wide applications, from miniaturized devices to large&#8208;scale storage plants. Separators are a vital component to ensure the safety of LIBs; they prevent direct electric contact between the cathode and anode while allowing ion transport. In this study, the first design is reported for a thermoregulating separator that responds to heat stimuli. The separator with a phase&#8208;change material (PCM) of paraffin wax encapsulated in hollow polyacrylonitrile nanofibers renders a wide range of enthalpy (0&#8211;135.3 J g&#8722;1), capable of alleviating the internal temperature rise of LIBs in a timely manner. Under abuse conditions, the generated heat in batteries stimulates the melting of the encapsulated PCM, which absorbs large amounts of heat without creating a significant rise in temperature. Experimental simulation of the inner short&#8208;circuit in prototype pouch cells through nail penetration demonstrates that the PCM&#8208;based separator can effectively suppress the temperature rise due to cell failure. Meanwhile, a cell penetrated by a nail promptly cools down to room temperature within 35 s, benefiting from the latent heat&#8208;storage of the unique PCM separator. The present design of separators featuring latent heat&#8208;storage provides effective strategies for overheat protection and enhanced safety of LIBs.

         <title>Robust Superamphiphilic Membrane with a Closed&#8208;Loop Life Cycle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new generation of biobased superamphiphilic vitrimer epoxy resin membranes to separate oil and water efficiently is reported. Similar to classical epoxy resins, this membrane shows strong mechanical robustness and sustains exposure to aqua regia and sodium hydroxide solutions. Furthermore, the blocked membrane can be easily recovered when contaminated with mixed foulants by using dynamic transesterification reactions.








Abstract
Oil&#8208;spill remediation is an international environmental challenge, and superamphiphilic membranes, as a promising solution, have recently drawn lots of attention. However, the robustness of the conventional membrane design is less satisfying under severe conditions during practical applications. Additionally, it is unavoidable for the membranes to face a series of foulants in their practical working environment, for example, algae and sand. These foulants will block the membrane, which leads to a new economic and environmental problem in terms of waste management at the end of their life. To address the aforementioned challenges, a new generation of superamphiphilic vitrimer epoxy resin membranes (SAVER) to separate oil and water efficiently is reported. Similar to classical epoxy resins, SAVER shows strong mechanical robustness and sustains exposure to aqua regia and sodium hydroxide solutions. Furthermore, the blocked membrane can be easily recovered when contaminated with mixed foulants by using dynamic transesterification reactions in the polymer network. The ease with which biobased SAVER can be manufactured, used, recycled, and re&#8208;used without losing value points to new directions in designing a closed&#8208;loop superamphiphilic membrane life cycle.

A smart color&#8208;variation evaluation system based on a fluorescent metal&#8211;organic framework probe and smartphone&#8208;based portable device is designed for on&#8208;site inspection of food quality. The freshness of raw fish samples can be accurately and monitored in real time by the naked eye by the clearly distinguishable color transition from orange red to green.








Abstract
Due to increasing food&#8208;safety issues, exploiting efficient approaches for food quality assessment and instrumentation has attracted concerns worldwide. Herein, a smart evaluation system based on a fluorescent metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is developed for real&#8208;time visual monitoring of food freshness. Via post&#8208;synthetic modification, a ratiometric fluorescent MOF probe is constructed by covalently coupling fluorescein 5&#8208;isothiocyanate (5&#8208;FITC) with NH2&#8208;rich lanthanide MOF. The probes exhibit a dual&#8208;emissive&#8208;responsive to biogenic amine, resulting in an increase in FITC emission along with a decrease in Eu3+ emission accompanied by a clear distinguishable color transition from orange red to green. After doping the probes on a flexible substrate, the obtained MOF composite film can be integrated with a smartphone&#8208;based portable platform easily. It is proved that this smart evaluation system can be used for on&#8208;site inspection of the freshness of raw fish samples. This work develops a fluorescent MOF&#8208;based smart evaluation system as a novel platform for application in food monitoring, which not only has enormous economic value but also holds great public health significance.

         <title>General Design Methodology for Organic Eutectic Electrolytes toward High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general formation mechanism of organic eutectic electrolytes is developed to enable highly concentrated eutectic electrolytes for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density redox flow batteries (RFBs). Organic molecules containing carbonyl, nitroxyl radical, and methoxy groups are essential to achieve eutectic systems. Furthermore, over threefold enhancement in solubility is achieved for the methoxy&#8208;modified ferrocene derivative, exhibiting good cycling stability and high energy density (188&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8208;1) in solvent&#8208;free conditions.








Abstract
By virtue of strong molecular interactions, eutectic electrolytes provide highly concentrated redox&#8208;active materials without other auxiliary solvents, hence achieving high volumetric capacities and energy density for redox flow batteries (RFBs). However, it is critical to unveil the underlying mechanism in this system, which will be undoubtedly beneficial for their future research on high&#8208;energy storage systems. Herein, a general formation mechanism of organic eutectic electrolytes (OEEs) is developed, and it is found that molecules with specific functional groups such as carbonyl (C&#63742;O), nitroxyl radical (N&#63743;O&#8226;), and methoxy (OCH3) groups can coordinate with alkali metal fluorinated sulfonylimide salts (especially for bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, TFSI), thereby forming OEEs. Molecular designs further demonstrate that the redox&#8208;inactive methoxy group functionalized ferrocene derivative maintains the liquid OEE at both reduced and oxidized states. Over threefold increase in solubility is obtained (2.8 m for ferrocene derivative OEE) and high actual discharge energy density of 188&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8208;1 (75% of the theoretical value) is achieved in the Li hybrid cell. The established mechanism presents new ways of designing desirable electrolytes through molecular interactions for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density organic RFBs.

         <title>Tunable Linearity of High&#8208;Performance Vertical Dual&#8208;Gate vdW Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertical dual&#8208;gate van der Waals (vdW) phototransistors are fabricated based on ambipolar WSe2. With the tunability of the opposite dual&#8208;gating, a linear photoresponse can be obtained with a high responsivity and low noise level, resulting in a high detectivity. The linear photoresponse with high performance of these phototransistors offers the possibility of achieving high&#8208;resolution and quantitative light detection with layered 2D semiconductors.








Abstract
Layered 2D semiconductors have been widely exploited in photodetectors due to their excellent electronic and optoelectronic properties. To improve their performance, photogating, photoconductive, photovoltaic, photothermoelectric, and other effects have been used in phototransistors and photodiodes made with 2D semiconductors or hybrid structures. However, it is difficult to achieve the desired high responsivity and linear photoresponse simultaneously in a monopolar conduction channel or a p&#8211;n junction. Here, dual&#8208;channel conduction with ambipolar multilayer WSe2 is presented by employing the device concept of dual&#8208;gate phototransistor, where p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type channels are produced in the same semiconductor using opposite dual&#8208;gating. It is possible to tune the photoconductive gain using a vertical electric field, so that the gain is constant with respect to the light intensity&#8212;a linear photoresponse, with a high responsivity of &#8776;2.5 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1. Additionally, the 1/f noise of the device is kept at a low level under the opposite dual&#8208;gating due to the reduction of current and carrier fluctuation, resulting in a high detectivity of &#8776;2 &#215; 1013 Jones in the linear photoresponse regime. The linear photoresponse and high performance of the dual&#8208;gate WSe2 phototransistor offer the possibility of achieving high&#8208;resolution and quantitative light detection with layered 2D semiconductors.

         <title>Tin Oxide Electron&#8208;Selective Layers for Efficient, Stable, and Scalable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Notable developments of SnO2 as an electron&#8208;selective layer for efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are reviewed, along with an overview of the fabrication methods and interfacial passivation routes. Furthermore, techno&#8208;economic and toxicology analyses of SnO2 are discussed for possible large&#8208;scale deployment of PSCs. Finally, the role of SnO2 in scaled module and tandem solar cell production is revealed.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become a promising photovoltaic (PV) technology, where the evolution of the electron&#8208;selective layers (ESLs), an integral part of any PV device, has played a distinctive role to their progress. To date, the mesoporous titanium dioxide (TiO2)/compact TiO2 stack has been among the most used ESLs in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PSCs. However, this material requires high&#8208;temperature sintering and may induce hysteresis under operational conditions, raising concerns about its use toward commercialization. Recently, tin oxide (SnO2) has emerged as an attractive alternative ESL, thanks to its wide bandgap, high optical transmission, high carrier mobility, suitable band alignment with perovskites, and decent chemical stability. Additionally, its low&#8208;temperature processability enables compatibility with temperature&#8208;sensitive substrates, and thus flexible devices and tandem solar cells. Here, the notable developments of SnO2 as a perovskite&#8208;relevant ESL are reviewed with emphasis placed on the various fabrication methods and interfacial passivation routes toward champion solar cells with high stability. Further, a techno&#8208;economic analysis of SnO2 materials for large&#8208;scale deployment, together with a processing&#8208;toxicology assessment, is presented. Finally, a perspective on how SnO2 materials can be instrumental in successful large&#8208;scale module and perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cell manufacturing is provided.

         <title>A Dendrite&#8208;Free Tin Anode for High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal anode based on the Sn(OH)62&#8722;/Sn redox couple at &#8722;0.921 V vs standard hydrogen electrode is reported. In contrast to severe Zn dendrites, Sn metal prefers isotropic crystal growth without dendrites, leading to superior performance in lifespan and areal capacity in Sn&#8211;I cells. The Sn anode represents a promising electrode candidate for metal&#8208;based rechargeable aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;based aqueous redox flow batteries (ARFBs) such as zinc&#8208;based ARFBs have attracted remarkable attention owing to their intrinsic high energy density. However, severe dendrite issues limit their efficiency and lifespan. Here an aqueous metal anode operating between Sn(OH)62&#8722; (stannate) and metal Sn is presented, providing a reversible four&#8208;electron transfer at &#8722;0.921 V vs standard hydrogen electrode. In strong contrast to severe Zn dendrites, the Sn(OH)62&#8722;/Sn electrode shows smooth and dendrite&#8208;free morphology, which can be attributed to its intrinsic low&#8208;surface&#8208;energy anisotropy which facilitates isotropic crystal growth of Sn metal. By coupling with iodide/tri&#8208;iodide (I&#8722;/I3&#8722;), the static Sn&#8211;I cell demonstrates a stable cycling for 500 cycles (more than 2 months). In contrast, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Zn anode suffers from serious dendrites and lasts less than 45 cycles (190 h) in Zn&#8211;I cells. A stable continuous flow cycling of Sn&#8211;I cell achieves a Sn areal capacity of 73.07 mAh cm&#8722;2 at an average discharge voltage of 1.3 V for 350 h. The alkaline Sn electrode demonstrates dendrite&#8208;free morphology and superior performance in cycle life and areal capacity compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Zn metal anodes, offering a promising metal anode for high&#8208;energy ARFBs and other metal&#8208;based rechargeable aqueous batteries.

         <title>Colorful Efficient Moir&#233;&#8208;Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A moir&#233; interference structure augments light&#8208;diffraction channels, leading to elongated optical paths, and &#8220;folds&#8221; sunlight into the perovskite layer. Besides, the sets of moir&#233; diffracted light achieve &#8220;1 + 1 = 3&#8221; comparing to the single diffraction grating. Therefore, moir&#233; perovskite solar cells are constructed by way of a commercial DVD disc, resulting in a champion efficiency up to 20.17% (MAPbI3) and 21.76% ((FAPbI3)1&#8208;x(MAPbBr3)x).








Abstract
Light harvesting is crucial for thin&#8208;film solar cells. To substantially reduce optical loss in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), hierarchical light&#8208;trapping nano&#8208;architectures enable absorption enhancement to exceed the conventional upper limit and have great potential for achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the art optoelectronic performances. However, it remains a great challenge to design and fabricate a superior hierarchical light&#8208;trapping nano&#8208;architecture, which exhibits extraordinary light&#8208;harvesting ability and simultaneously avoids deteriorating the electrical performance of PSCs. Herein, colorful efficient moir&#233;&#8208;PSCs are designed and fabricated incorporating moir&#233; interference structures by the imprinting method with the aid of a commercial DVD disc. It is experimentally and theoretically demonstrated that the light harvesting ability of the moir&#233; interference structure can be well manipulated through changing the rotation angle (0&#176;&#8211;90&#176;). The boosted short&#8208;circuit current is credited to augment light diffraction channels, leading to elongated optical paths, and fold sunlight into the perovskite layer. Moreover, the imprinting process suppresses the trap sites and voids at the active&#8208;layer interfaces with eliminated hysteresis. The moir&#233;&#8208;PSC with an optimized 30&#176; rotation angle achieves the best enhancement of light harvesting (28.5% higher than the pristine), resulting in efficiencies over 20.17% (MAPbI3) and 21.76% ((FAPbI3)1&#8208;x (MAPbBr3)x).

         <title>A &#916;E&#160;= 0.63 V Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalyst Enables High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Cycling Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 15, April 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrahigh bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction and evolution is achieved with the indicator &#916;E&#160;= 0.63&#160;V, far exceeding the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmark and most reported electrocatalysts. Corresponding rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries afford ultralong lifespan over 3600 cycles at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and ultrahigh cycling current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries constitute promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their intrinsic safety, low cost, and feasibility to realize high cycling current density and long cycling lifespan. Nevertheless, their cathodic reactions involving oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution are highly sluggish in kinetics, requiring high&#8208;performance noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalysts that exceed the current noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmarks. Herein, a noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalyst is fabricated, which demonstrates ultrahigh bifunctional activity and renders excellent performance in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. Concretely, atomic Co&#8211;N&#8211;C and NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are respectively selected as oxygen reduction and evolution active sites and are further rationally integrated to afford the resultant CoNC@LDH composite electrocatalyst. The CoNC@LDH electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable bifunctional activity delivering an indicator &#916;E of 0.63&#160;V, far exceeding the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based Pt/C+Ir/C benchmark (&#916;E = 0.77&#160;V) and most reported electrocatalysts. Correspondingly, ultralong lifespan (over 3600 cycles at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and excellent rate performances (cycling current density at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) are achieved in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. This work highlights the current advances of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis and endows high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycling rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries for efficient sustainable energy storage.

         <title>Smart Doppler Cloak Operating in Broad Band and Full Polarizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept and realization of &#8220;smart Doppler cloak&#8221; for self&#8208;adaptive anti&#8208;Doppler shift is demonstrated. The smart Doppler cloak is implemented by integrating a broadband and full&#8208;polarization time&#8208;modulated metasurface with a velocity sensor&#8208;based intelligent control system, which can cancel automatically different Doppler shifts by sensing the variant velocities without the aid of human beings, as if it possesses a chameleon's ability.








Abstract
Invisibility cloaks, a class of attractive devices that can hide objects from external observers, have become practical reality owing to the advent of metamaterials. In previous cloaking schemes, almost all demonstrated cloaks are time&#8208;invariant and are investigated in the system that is motionless, and hence they are limited to hide stationary objects. In addition, the current cloaks are typically static or require manual operation to achieve dynamic cloaking. Here, a smart Doppler cloak operating in broadband and full polarizations is reported, which consists of a time&#8208;modulated reflective metasurface and a sensing&#8208;feedback time&#8208;varying electronic control system. Experimental results show that the smart Doppler cloak is able to respond self&#8208;adaptively and rapidly to the ever&#8208;changing velocity of moving objects and then cancel different Doppler shifts in real time, without any human intervention. Moreover, the wideband and polarization&#8208;insensitive features enable the cloak to be more robust and practical. To illustrate the capabilities of the proposed approach, the smart Doppler cloak is measured in three scenarios with two different groups of linearly&#8208;polarized incidences at 3.3 and 4.9&#160;GHz, and one group circularly&#8208;polarized incidences at 6.0&#160;GHz, respectively.

Experimental results show that the smart Doppler cloak is able to respond self&#8208;adaptively and rapidly to the ever&#8208;changing velocity of moving objects and then cancel different Doppler shifts in real time, without any human intervention. Moreover, the wideband and polarization&#8208;insensitive features enable the cloak to be more robust and practical. To illustrate the capabilities of the proposed approach, the smart Doppler cloak is measured in three scenarios with two different groups of linearly&#8208;polarized incidences at 3.3 and 4.9&#160;GHz, and one group circularly&#8208;polarized incidences at 6.0&#160;GHz, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>2D MXene&#8211;Molecular Hybrid Additive for High&#8208;Performance Ambipolar Polymer Field&#8208;Effect Transistors and Logic Gates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intercalation of Ti3C2Tx MXene with didecyldimethyl ammonium bromide (DDAB) yields an additive for polymer transistors. Ti3C2Tx&#8211;DDAB boosts simultaneously the hole and electron mobility of conjugated polymers. A counterbalancing doping is revealed, featuring DDAB's n&#8208;doping effect and Ti3C2Tx's electron&#8208;accepting capability. Based on this intercalation engineering, complementary logic gates are demonstrated with well&#8208;centered trip points.








Abstract
MXenes are highly conductive layered materials that are attracting a great interest for high&#8208;performance opto&#8208;electronics, photonics, and energy applications.. Their non&#8208;covalent functionalization with ad hoc molecules enables the production of stable inks of 2D flakes to be processed in thin&#8208;films. Here, the formation of stable dispersions via the intercalation of Ti3C2Tx with didecyldimethyl ammonium bromide (DDAB) yielding Ti3C2Tx&#8211;DDAB, is demonstrated. Such functionalization modulates the properties of Ti3C2Tx, as evidenced by a 0.47&#160;eV decrease of the work function. It is also shown that DDAB is a powerful n&#8208;dopant capable of enhancing electron mobility in conjugated polymers and 2D materials. When Ti3C2Tx&#8211;DDAB is blended with poly(diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;co&#8208;selenophene) [(PDPP&#8211;Se)], a simultaneous increase by 170% and 152% of the hole and electron field&#8208;effect mobilities, respectively, is observed, compared to the neat conjugated polymer, with values reaching 2.0 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. By exploiting the balanced ambipolar transport of the Ti3C2Tx&#8211;DDAB/PDPP&#8211;Se hybrid, complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) logic gates are fabricated that display well&#8208;centered trip points and good noise margin (64.6% for inverter). The results demonstrate that intercalant engineering represents an efficient strategy to tune the electronic properties of Ti3C2Tx yielding functionalized MXenes for polymer transistors with unprecedented performances and functions.

         <title>A Monomaterial Nernst Thermopile with Hermaphroditic Legs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermopile is a key component of thermoelectric technology. The contact between P and N legs of a Seebeck thermopile is one issue hindering widespread usage of these devices. The anomalous Nernst effect of a topological magnet is used to build a monomaterial thermopile, where a tilted bicrystal becomes a hermaphroditic leg and extrinsic contacts are not required.








Abstract
A large transverse thermoelectric response, known as the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) has been recently observed in several topological magnets. Building a thermopile employing this effect has been the subject of several recent propositions. Here, a thermopile is designed and built with an array of tilted adjacent crystals of Mn3Sn. The design employs a single material and replaces pairs of P and N thermocouples of the traditional design with hermaphroditic legs. The design exploits the large lag angle between the applied field and the magnetization, which is attributed to the interruption of magnetic octupoles at the edge of the xy&#8208;plane. Eliminating extrinsic contact between the legs will boost the efficiency, simplify the process, and pave the way for a new generation of&#160;thermopiles.

         <title>A Molecular Drone for Atomic&#8208;Scale Fabrication Working under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the enormous potential, atomic&#8208;scale technologies have been hindered by difficulties in processing. Surface atom complexation is exploited as a new paradigm for sub&#8208;nanometric fabrication. A coordination compound behaves as a &#8220;molecular drone&#8221;: it lands on to the surface, bonds to an atom, and then leaves the surface, thus creating an atomic vacancy stable under ambient condition.








Abstract
The direct manipulation of individual atoms has led to the advancement of exciting cutting&#8208;edge technologies in sub&#8208;nanometric fabrication, information storage and to the exploration of quantum technologies. Atom manipulation is currently performed by scanning probe microscopy (SPM), which enables an extraordinary spatial control, but provides a low throughput, requiring complex critical experimental conditions and advanced instrumentation. Here, a new paradigm is demonstrated for surface atom manipulation that overcomes the limitations of SPM techniques by replacing the SPM probe with a coordination compound that exploits surface atom complexation as a tool for atomic&#8208;scale fabrication. The coordination compound works as a &#8220;molecular drone&#8221;: it lands onto a substrate, bonds to a specific atom on the surface, picks it up, and then leaves the surface along with the extracted atom, thus creating an atomic vacancy in a specific position on the surface. Remarkably, the feasibility of the process is demonstrated under electrochemical control and the stability of the fabricated pattern at room temperature, under ambient conditions.

         <title>Ion Exchange Lithography: Localized Ion Exchange Reactions for Spatial Patterning of Perovskite Semiconductors and Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion exchange lithography (IEL) for integrating user&#8208;defined patterns of desirable chemical compositions in thin films is introduced. In IEL, a reactive nanoparticle &#8220;canvas&#8221; is locally converted by printing ion exchange &#8220;inks&#8221;. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept and versatility are demonstrated by printing, painting, and airbrushing inks to create perovskite semiconductors with tunable composition. The functional potential is explored by fabricating light&#8208;emitting diodes.








Abstract
Patterning materials with different properties in a single film is a fundamental challenge and essential for the development of next&#8208;generation (opto)electronic functional components. This work introduces the concept of ion exchange lithography and demonstrates spatially controlled patterning of electrically insulating films and semiconductors with tunable optoelectronic properties. In ion exchange lithography, a reactive nanoparticle &#8220;canvas&#8221; is locally converted by printing ion exchange &#8220;inks.&#8221; To demonstrate the proof of principle, a canvas of insulating nanoporous lead carbonate is spatioselectively converted into semiconducting lead halide perovskites by contact printing an ion exchange precursor ink of methylammonium and formamidinium halides. By selecting the composition of the ink, the photoluminescence wavelength of the perovskite semiconductors is tunable over the entire visible spectrum. A broad palette of conversion inks can be applied on the reactive film by printing with customizable stamp designs, spray&#8208;painting with stencils, and painting with a brush to inscribe well&#8208;defined patterns with tunable optoelectronic properties in the same canvas. Moreover, the optoelectronic properties of the converted canvas are exploited to fabricate a green light&#8208;emitting diode (LED), demonstrating the functionality potential of ion exchange lithography.

         <title>A Generalized Method for High&#8208;Speed Fluorination of Metal Oxides by Spark Plasma Sintering Yields Ta3O7F and TaO2F with High Photocatalytic Activity for Oxygen Evolution from Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spark plasma sintering (SPS) allows the solid&#8208;state fluorination of Ta2O5 to TaO2F and Ta3O7F with poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE, Teflon) on a minute scale, which reduces the preparation time compared to conventional chemistry by three orders of magnitude. The microstructure of SPS&#8208;prepared TaO2F and Ta3O7F leads to high photocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution from water, whereas TaO2F and Ta3O7F prepared by conventional chemistry are catalytically almost inactive.








Abstract
A general method to carry out the fluorination of metal oxides with poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE, Teflon) waste by spark plasma sintering (SPS) on a minute scale with Teflon is reported. The potential of this new approach is highlighted by the following results. i) The tantalum oxyfluorides Ta3O7F and TaO2F are obtained from plastic scrap without using toxic or caustic chemicals for fluorination. ii) Short reaction times (minutes rather than days) reduce the process time the energy costs by almost three orders of magnitude. iii) The oxyfluorides Ta3O7F and TaO2F are produced in gram amounts of nanoparticles. Their synthesis can be upscaled to the kg range with industrial sintering equipment. iv) SPS processing changes the catalytic properties: while conventionally prepared Ta3O7F and TaO2F show little catalytic activity, SPS&#8208;prepared Ta3O7F and TaO2F exhibit high activity for photocatalytic oxygen evolution, reaching photoconversion efficiencies up to 24.7% and applied bias to photoconversion values of 0.86%. This study shows that the materials properties are dictated by the processing which poses new challenges to understand and predict the underlying factors.

         <title>Capturing Cytokines with Advanced Materials: A Potential Strategy to Tackle COVID&#8208;19 Cytokine Storm</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabled by recent advances in materials science and nanotechnology, emerging biomaterials hold great potential to provide better solutions for COVID&#8208;19 cytokine storm and other inflammatory diseases. By reviewing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cytokine neutralization systems and highlighting the promising technology development, this work intends to spark further research and development activity in this critical research area.








Abstract
The COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2), has caused great impact on the global economy and people's daily life. In the clinic, most patients with COVID&#8208;19 show none or mild symptoms, while approximately 20% of them develop severe pneumonia, multiple organ failure, or septic shock due to infection&#8208;induced cytokine release syndrome (the so&#8208;called &#8220;cytokine storm&#8221;). Neutralizing antibodies targeting inflammatory cytokines may potentially curb immunopathology caused by COVID&#8208;19; however, the complexity of cytokine interactions and the multiplicity of cytokine targets make attenuating the cytokine storm challenging. Nonspecific in vivo biodistribution and dose&#8208;limiting side effects further limit the broad application of those free antibodies. Recent advances in biomaterials and nanotechnology have offered many promising opportunities for infectious and inflammatory diseases. Here, potential mechanisms of COVID&#8208;19 cytokine storm are first discussed, and relevant therapeutic strategies and ongoing clinical trials are then reviewed. Furthermore, recent research involving emerging biomaterials for improving antibody&#8208;based and broad&#8208;spectrum cytokine neutralization is summarized. It is anticipated that this work will provide insights on the development of novel therapeutics toward efficacious management of COVID&#8208;19 cytokine storm and other inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Tailoring Surface Self&#8208;Organization for Nanoscale Polygonal Morphology on Germanium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easy and single&#8208;step method to manipulate the morphology of circular nanoholes via ion beam irradiation is presented. Through nanoscale control over self&#8208;organization process dynamics on the (100) surface of germanium, polygonal structures such as squares, triangles, and hexagons are realized. Highly periodic and protruding nanoscale&#8208;polygons indicate potential applications toward hierarchical and 3D nanostructures for multifunctional nanodevices.








Abstract
The evolution of polygonal&#8208;shaped nanoholes on the (100) surface of germanium, aided by focused ion beam induced self&#8208;organization, is presented. The energetic beam of ions creates a viscous phase which, at a thermodynamical minimum, leads to surface self&#8208;organization. A directed viscous&#8208;flow along the predefined nanoholes provides well&#8208;ordered polygonal nanostructures, ranging from triangles to hexagons and octagons, as desired. The amorphization exhibiting a confined viscous&#8208;flow at the walls of nanoholes is attributed to the localized melting zones induced by site&#8208;specific thermal spikes during ion irradiation, as revealed by microscopy and molecular dynamics studies. This leads to a local self&#8208;organization in the vicinity of each circular nanohole via a viscous&#8208;fingering process at the nanoscale. Such controlled self&#8208;organization, with the help of a predefined scanning grid, transforms the circular holes into the desired polygonal shape. The present morphology manipulation promises to surmount the barriers concerning the size reduction efforts in the field of nanofabrication.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Memristive Materials for Artificial Synapses and Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The working principles and characteristics of biological neurons and synapses, as well as recent developments of memristive materials and devices that emulate synaptic functions based on electric, magnetic, and optical stimulations are highlighted.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing holds promise for building next&#8208;generation intelligent systems in a more energy&#8208;efficient way than the conventional von Neumann computing architecture. Memristive hardware, which mimics biological neurons and synapses, offers high&#8208;speed operation and low power consumption, enabling energy&#8208; and area&#8208;efficient, brain&#8208;inspired computing. Here, recent advances in memristive materials and strategies that emulate synaptic functions for neuromorphic computing are highlighted. The working principles and characteristics of biological neurons and synapses, which can be mimicked by memristive devices, are presented. Besides device structures and operation with different external stimuli such as electric, magnetic, and optical fields, how memristive materials with a rich variety of underlying physical mechanisms can allow fast, reliable, and low&#8208;power neuromorphic applications is also discussed. Finally, device requirements are examined and a perspective on challenges in developing memristive materials for device engineering and computing science is given.

         <title>Directional Modulation of Exciton Emission Using Single Dielectric Nanospheres</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly miniaturized platform for the control of emission is explored based on individual subwavelength silicon nanospheres. Simultaneous modulation of the directional excitation and exciton emission of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides is demonstrated with controllable forward&#8208;to&#8208;backward intensity ratios. A modified Mie theory for dipole&#8211;sphere hybrid systems is derived to instruct the optimal design for desirable modulation performance.








Abstract
Coupling emitters with nanoresonators is an effective strategy to control light emission at the subwavelength scale with high efficiency. Low&#8208;loss dielectric nanoantennas hold particular promise for this purpose, owing to their strong Mie resonances. Herein, a highly miniaturized platform is explored for the control of emission based on individual subwavelength Si nanospheres (SiNSs) to modulate the directional excitation and exciton emission of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs). A modified Mie theory for dipole&#8211;sphere hybrid systems is derived to instruct the optimal design for desirable modulation performance. Controllable forward&#8208;to&#8208;backward intensity ratios are experimentally validated in 532&#160;nm laser excitation and 635&#160;nm exciton emission from a monolayer WS2. Versatile light emission control is achieved for different emitters and excitation wavelengths, benefiting from the facile size control and isotropic shape of SiNSs. Simultaneous modulation of excitation and emission via a single SiNS at visible wavelengths significantly improves the efficiency and directionality of TMD exciton emission and leads to the potential of multifunctional integrated photonics. Overall, the work opens promising opportunities for nanophotonics and polaritonic systems, enabling efficient manipulation, enhancement, and reconfigurability of light&#8211;matter interactions.

         <title>Conversion of Waste Plastics into Value&#8208;Added Carbonaceous Fuels under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several strategies including solar&#8208;driven conversion, enzyme&#8208;driven conversion, and low&#8208;temperature&#8208;driven catalytic conversion are developed for converting non&#8208;recyclable plastic wastes into value&#8208;added fuels under mild conditions.








Abstract
Owing to the extremely difficult breakage of the adamant cross&#8208;linked structures, converting non&#8208;recyclable plastic wastes into valuable fuels usually demands rigorous conditions, wherein the required high temperature and pressure is inevitably energy&#8208;wasting and environment&#8208;polluting. Given this aspect, herein, the recent achievements in the conversion of plastics into value&#8208;added carbonaceous fuels under mild conditions are summarized. In detail, solar&#8208;driven conversion of commercial plastics into liquid fuels in alkaline solutions or pure water at ambient temperature and pressure are surveyed; also, enzyme&#8208;driven conversion of polyethylene terephthalate into terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol at a mild temperature are emphasized; and low&#8208;temperature&#8208;driven catalytic conversion of polyethylene into oils and waxes with the help of a light alkane are reviewed. Finally, other potentially used strategies and in situ characterization technologies in plastics degradation under moderate conditions are presented.

         <title>The Intrinsic Charge Carrier Behaviors and Applications of Polyoxometalate Clusters Based Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the links between the intrinsic charge carrier behaviors of polyoxometalates (POMs) from a chemistry&#8208;oriented view and their recent ground&#8208;breaking developments in related areas, including molecular&#8208;level electronic devices, solar&#8208;driven, thermal&#8208;driven, and electrochemical&#8208;driven energy generation, conversion and storage systems. Finally, present challenges and the fundamental insights for advanced design and self&#8208;assembly of POM building blocks are also discussed.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are a series of molecular metal oxide clusters, which span the two domains of solutes and solid metal oxides. The unique characters of POMs in structure, geometry, and adjustable redox properties have attracted widespread attention in functional material synthesis, catalysis, electronic devices, and electrochemical energy storage and conversion. This review is focused on the links between the intrinsic charge carrier behaviors of POMs from a chemistry&#8208;oriented view and their recent ground&#8208;breaking developments in related areas. First, the advantageous charge transfer behaviors of POMs in molecular&#8208;level electronic devices are summarized. Solar&#8208;driven, thermal&#8208;driven, and electrochemical&#8208;driven charge carrier behaviors of POMs in energy generation, conversion and storage systems are also discussed. Finally, present challenges and fundamental insights are discussed as to the advanced design of functional systems based upon POM building blocks for their possible emerging application areas.

         <title>A Systematic Strategy of Combinational Blow for Overcoming Cascade Drug Resistance via NIR&#8208;Light&#8208;Triggered Hyperthermia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new hydrophobic photothermal conjugated polymer, DAP&#8208;F, is synthesized and utilized to prepare a combined nanoparticle system F&#8211;Pt&#8208;nanoparticles (NPs) with a Pt(IV) prodrug. Mild hyperthermia (43 &#176;C), generated from F&#8211;Pt&#8208;NPs induced by an 808 nm near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser, shows potential for clinical translation in therapy of cancer via systematically overcoming the cascade drug resistance (CDR) of cisplatin.








Abstract
A systematic combination strategy is proposed for overcoming cisplatin resistance using near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;light&#8208;triggered hyperthermia. A new photothermal polymer DAP&#8208;F is complexed with a reduction&#8208;sensitive amphiphilic polymer P1 to form F&#8208;NPs with photothermal effect. Subsequently, to build the final nanosystem F&#8211;Pt&#8208;NPs, F&#8208;NPs are combined with Pt&#8208;NPs, which are obtained by encapsulating a Pt(IV) prodrug with P1. Mild hyperthermia (43 &#176;C), generated from F&#8211;Pt&#8208;NPs induced by an 808 nm NIR laser, have various effects such as: i) enhancing the cellular membrane permeability to promote the uptake of drugs; ii) activating cisplatin by accelerating the glutathione consumption; iii) increasing the Pt&#8208;DNA adducts formation and possibly the formation of a portion of irreparable Pt&#8208;DNA interstrand crosslinks, thereby inhibiting the repair of DNA. In vitro, it is found that even on cisplatin&#8208;resistant A549DDP cells, the IC50 of F&#8211;Pt&#8208;NPs (43 &#176;C) is only 7.0 &#215; 10&#8722;6 m Pt mL&#8722;1. In vivo, on a patient&#8208;derived xenograft model of multidrug resistant lung cancer, the efficacy of the F&#8211;Pt&#8208;NPs (43 &#176;C) treatment group shows a tumor inhibition rate of 94%. Taken together, here, an important perspective of resolving cascade drug resistance with the assistance of mild hyperthermia triggered by NIR light is presented, which can be of great significance for clinic translation.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Based Adaptive Structural Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;based adaptive structural materials play a significant role not only in scientific research but also in industrial production. Herein, the recent progress in the development of liquid&#8208;based adaptive structural materials, including liquid with particles, liquid with surfaces, and liquid with membranes, along with their structure&#8211;function relationship and applications are discussed and summarized.








Abstract
The development of structural materials that are capable of adapting to a variety of environments, is promising for smart buildings and therefore providing better&#8208;quality living with energy efficiency. One of the tendencies is to increasingly employ liquid phase materials, owing to their spontaneous and dynamic properties. Bridging the gap between dynamic liquid phase and conventional solid materials, liquid&#8208;based adaptive structural materials (LASMs) have been demonstrated to show unprecedented properties of dynamicity, stability, adaptivity, and stimulus&#8208;responsiveness, which are desired in many applications such as 3D printing, soft robotics, omniphobic surface, microfluidics, multiphase separation, etc. This research news discusses and summarizes the recent progresses made with LASMs, including liquid with particles, liquid with surfaces, as well as liquid with membranes. Besides, the opportunities and challenges are also showcased for promoting the development of LASMs. The authors hope this research news will attract more researchers&#8217; attention to transform the LASMs into more real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Emerging Materials and Methods toward Ammonia&#8208;Based Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of ammonia for energy storage and conversion raises demands for the improvement of existing technologies and development of new methods and materials. The recent advances of materials and methods toward ammonia synthesis, storage or separation, and utilization are presented. Key scientific challenges and perspectives are provided to stimulate further studies enabling ammonia&#8208;based sustainable energy supply in the future.








Abstract
Efficient storage and conversion of renewable energies is of critical importance to the sustainable growth of human society. With its distinguishing features of high hydrogen content, high energy density, facile storage/transportation, and zero&#8208;carbon emission, ammonia has been recently considered as a promising energy carrier for long&#8208;term and large&#8208;scale energy storage. Under this scenario, the synthesis, storage, and utilization of ammonia are key components for the implementation of ammonia&#8208;mediated energy system. Being different from fossil fuels, renewable energies normally have intermittent and variable nature, and thus pose demands on the improvement of existing technologies and simultaneously the development of alternative methods and materials for ammonia synthesis and storage. The energy release from ammonia in an efficient manner, on the other hand, is vital to achieve a sustainable energy supply and complete the nitrogen circle. Herein, recent advances in the thermal&#8208;, electro&#8208;, plasma&#8208;, and photocatalytic ammonia synthesis, ammonia storage or separation, ammonia thermal/electrochemical decomposition and conversion are summarized with the emphasis on the latest developments of new methods and materials (catalysts, electrodes, and sorbents) for these processes. The challenges and potential solutions are discussed.

         <title>Activatable 19F MRI Nanoprobes for Visualization of Biological Targets in Living Subjects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
19F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with activatable nanoprobes enables real&#8208;time, deep&#8208;tissue, and background&#8208;free imaging of cells and biomolecules in living subjects. Recent progress on activatable 19F MRI nanoprobes made from three major 19F&#8208;containing compounds as well as present challenges and potential opportunities are discussed, giving more insights into activatable probe design for this emerging and encouraging field.








Abstract
Visualization of biological targets such as crucial cells and biomolecules in living subjects is critical for the studies of important biological processes. Though 1H magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has demonstrated its power in offering detailed anatomical and pathological information, its capacity for in vivo tracking of biological targets is limited by the high biological background of 1H. 19F distinguishes itself from its competitors as an exceptional complement to 1H in MRI through its high sensitivity, low biological background, and broad chemical shift range. The specificity and sensitivity of 19F MRI can be further boosted with activatable nanoprobes. The advantages of 19F MRI with activatable nanoprobes enable in vivo detection and imaging at the cellular or even molecular level in deep tissues, rendering this technique appealing as a potential solution for visualization of biological targets in living subjects. Here, recent progress over the past decades on activatable 19F MRI nanoprobes made from three major 19F&#8208;containing compounds, as well as present challenges and potential opportunities, are summarized to provide a panoramic prospective for the people who are interested in this emerging and exciting field.

         <title>Single&#8208;Domain Multiferroic Array&#8208;Addressable Terfenol&#8208;D (SMArT) Micromagnets for Programmable Single&#8208;Cell Capture and Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terfenol&#8208;D micromagnets exhibit single magnetic domains on par with the size of a single cell &#8776;10&#160;&#181;m. These single&#8208;domain magnetic microstructures allow programmable multiferroic modulation of micromagnetic fields to selectively capture and release single&#8208;cells. Smart programmable multiferroic materials lay the groundwork for large&#8208;scale automated single&#8208;cell sorting and enable a broad spectrum of biomedical engineering applications.








Abstract
Programming magnetic fields with microscale control can enable automation at the scale of single cells &#8776;10&#160;&#181;m. Most magnetic materials provide a consistent magnetic field over time but the direction or field strength at the microscale is not easily modulated. However, magnetostrictive materials, when coupled with ferroelectric material (i.e., strain&#8208;mediated multiferroics), can undergo magnetization reorientation due to voltage&#8208;induced strain, promising refined control of magnetization at the micrometer&#8208;scale. This work demonstrates the largest single&#8208;domain microstructures (20&#160;&#181;m) of Terfenol&#8208;D (Tb0.3Dy0.7Fe1.92), a material that has the highest magnetostrictive strain of any known soft magnetoelastic material. These Terfenol&#8208;D microstructures enable controlled localization of magnetic beads with sub&#8208;micrometer precision. Magnetically labeled cells are captured by the field gradients generated from the single&#8208;domain microstructures without an external magnetic field. The magnetic state on these microstructures is switched through voltage&#8208;induced strain, as a result of the strain&#8208;mediated converse magnetoelectric effect, to release individual cells using a multiferroic approach. These electronically addressable micromagnets pave the way for parallelized multiferroics&#8208;based single&#8208;cell sorting under digital control for biotechnology applications.

         <title>Chemical Insights into Interfacial Effects in Inorganic Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfaces between inorganic functional nanomaterials and their surface modifiers play important roles in determining their chemical and physical properties. Strategies toward the fabrication of model inorganic nanomaterials with well&#8208;defined and detectable interfaces for deep understanding of complicated interfacial effects at the molecular level are highlighted.








Abstract
The interfaces between inorganic functional nanomaterials and their surface modifiers play important roles in determining their chemical and physical properties. In numerous situations, interfaces created by organic ligands or secondary inorganic components on inorganic nanomaterials induce significant effects to promote their performances. However, it still remains challenging to understand those interfacial effects at the molecular level. Herein, strategies via the design of model inorganic nanomaterials with well&#8208;defined and detectable interfaces to simplify the investigation of interfacial effects in inorganic nanomaterials are summarized. While atomically precise metal nanoclusters enable &#8220;seeing&#8221; how organic ligands are coordinated on metal surface to create nanoscale metal&#8211;organic interfaces, ultrathin low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials modified with organic ligands make it possible to extract the metal&#8211;organic interface structure from the average signal to investigate how steric and electronic effects enhance catalysis. The molecular mechanisms of the interfacial effects in supported metal catalysts are disclosed by designing two unique structures of supported catalysts. The interfacial engineering approach will be further extended to optimize the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Finally, a perspective on the development of operando characterization techniques is provided to track the dynamic interfacial structures during catalysis.

         <title>Tunable Sponge&#8208;Like Hierarchically Porous Hydrogels with Simultaneously Enhanced Diffusivity and Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach is developed to produce hierarchically structured hydrogels with highly interconnected pores, resulting in unprecedented simultaneously enhanced mass transport and mechanical properties. This approach is applied to several polymer systems and is compatible with 3D printing. This universal technique should greatly benefit the fundamental study of cononsolvency and the development of functionalized porous materials with mitigated diffusion limits.








Abstract
Crosslinked polymers and gels are important in soft robotics, solar vapor generation, energy storage, drug delivery, catalysis, and biosensing. However, their attractive mass transport and volume&#8208;changing abilities are diffusion&#8208;limited, requiring miniaturization to avoid slow response. Typical approaches to improving diffusion in hydrogels sacrifice mechanical properties by increasing porosity or limit the total volumetric flux by directionally confining the pores. Despite tremendous efforts, simultaneous enhancement of diffusion and mechanical properties remains a long&#8208;standing challenge hindering broader practical applications of hydrogels. In this work, cononsolvency photopolymerization is developed as a universal approach to overcome this swelling&#8211;mechanical property trade&#8208;off. The as&#8208;synthesized poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel, as an exemplary system, presents a unique open porous network with continuous microchannels, leading to record&#8208;high volumetric (de)swelling speeds, almost an order of magnitude higher than reported previously. This swelling enhancement comes with a simultaneous improvement in Young's modulus and toughness over conventional hydrogels fabricated in pure solvents. The resulting fast mass transport enables in&#8208;air operation of the hydrogel via rapid water replenishment and ultrafast actuation. The method is compatible with 3D printing. The generalizability is demonstrated by extending the technique to poly(N&#8208;tertbutylacrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;polyacrylamide) and polyacrylamide hydrogels, non&#8208;temperature&#8208;responsive polymer systems, validating the present hypothesis that cononsolvency is a generic phenomenon driven by competitive adsorption.

         <title>Inorganic&#8211;Organic Hybrid Molecular Materials: From Multiferroic to Magnetoelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetoelectricity plays a huge role in the development of next&#8208;generation devices. Since the discovery of multiferroic properties in inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid molecular materials, the related magnetoelectric behaviors have been gradually discovered and advanced at a vigorous pace. This brief development of multiferroicity/magnetoelectricity in inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid molecular materials shows the prospect for future development.








Abstract
Inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid molecular multiferroic and magnetoelectric materials, similar to multiferroic oxide compounds, have recently attracted increasing attention because they exhibit diverse architectures, a flexible framework, fascinating physics, and potential magnetoelectric functionalities in novel multifunctional devices such as energy transformation devices, sensors, and information storage systems. Herein, the classification of multiferroicity and magnetoelectricity is briefly outlined and then the recent advances in the multiferroicity and magnetoelectricity of inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid molecular materials, particularly magnetoelectricity and the relevant magnetoelectric mechanisms and their categories are summarized. In addition, a personal perspective and an outlook are provided.

         <title>Widening the Range of Trackable Environmental and Health Pollutants for Li&#8208;Garnet&#8208;Based Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemistry, material selection, and design of a Li&#8208;garnet Li7La3Zr2O12&#8208;based electrochemical sensor, targeting the highly corrosive environmental pollutant sulfur dioxide, are presented. The insights on the sensing electrochemistry, reactions involved, and control over the interface sensing electrode/Li+ electrolyte structures and phase stability provide first guidelines for future Li&#8208;garnet sensors to monitor a wider range of environmental pollutants with fast response.








Abstract
Classic chemical sensors integrated in phones, vehicles, and industrial plants monitor the levels of humidity or carbonaceous/oxygen species to track environmental changes. Current projections for the next two decades indicate the strong need to increase the ability of sensors to sense a wider range of chemicals for future electronics not only to continue monitoring environmental changes but also to ensure the health and safety of humans. To achieve this goal, more chemical sensing principles and hardware must be developed. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle for the specific electrochemistry, material selection, and design of a Li&#8208;garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO)&#8208;based electrochemical sensor is provided, targeting the highly corrosive environmental pollutant sulfur dioxide (SO2). This work extends the prime use of LLZO as a battery component as well as the range of trackable pollutants for potential future sensor&#8208;noses. Novel composite sensing&#8208;electrode designs using LLZO&#8208;based porous scaffolds are employed to define a high number of reaction sites, and successfully track SO2 at the dangerous levels of 0&#8211;10 ppm with close&#8208;to&#8208;theoretical SO2 sensitivity. The insights on the sensing electrochemistry, phase stability and sensing electrode/Li+ electrolyte structures provide first guidelines for future Li&#8208;garnet sensors to monitor a wider range of environmental pollutants and toxins.

         <title>Correlating Surface Crystal Orientation and Gas Kinetics in Perovskite Oxide Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen&#8208;exchange kinetics in the perovskite oxide La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3 are found to be strongly dependent on the exposed crystallographic surface. An all&#8208;perovksite, epitaxial half&#8208;cell is developed and characterized. The electrochemical performance of the different surface orientations is explained with insights from synchrotron&#8208;based ambient&#8208;pressure spectroscopy and density functional theory.








Abstract
Solid&#8211;gas interactions at electrode surfaces determine the efficiency of solid&#8208;oxide fuel cells and electrolyzers. Here, the correlation between surface&#8211;gas kinetics and the crystal orientation of perovskite electrodes is studied in the model system La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3. The gas&#8208;exchange kinetics are characterized by synthesizing epitaxial half&#8208;cell geometries where three single&#8208;variant surfaces are produced [i.e., La0.8Sr0.2Co0.2Fe0.8O3/La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.95Mg0.05O3&#8722;&#948;/SrRuO3/SrTiO3 (001), (110), and (111)]. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and electrical conductivity relaxation measurements reveal a strong surface&#8208;orientation dependency of the gas&#8208;exchange kinetics, wherein (111)&#8208;oriented surfaces exhibit an activity &gt;3&#8208;times&#160;higher as compared to (001)&#8208;oriented surfaces. Oxygen partial pressure (pO2)&#8208;dependent electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies reveal that while the three surfaces have different gas&#8208;exchange kinetics, the reaction mechanisms and rate&#8208;limiting steps are the same (i.e., charge&#8208;transfer to the diatomic oxygen species). First&#8208;principles calculations suggest that the formation energy of vacancies and adsorption at the various surfaces is different and influenced by the surface polarity. Finally, synchrotron&#8208;based, ambient&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray spectroscopies reveal distinct electronic changes and surface chemistry among the different surface orientations. Taken together, thin&#8208;film epitaxy provides an efficient approach to control and understand the electrode reactivity ultimately demonstrating that the (111)&#8208;surface exhibits a high density of active surface sites which leads to higher activity.

         <title>Polymorph Engineering for Boosted Volumetric Na&#8208;Ion and Li&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the inherent high electronic conductivity of metallic tetragonal FeSe, a conducting additive&#8208;free (CA&#8208;free) electrode configuration is realized. The CA&#8208;free electrode demonstrates high volumetric and high initial Coulombic efficiency for sodium storage. The proposed design strategy is also expanded to a Li&#8208;storage system, which exhibits superior volumetric energy and power densities.








Abstract
To meet the ever&#8208;growing demand for advanced rechargeable batteries with light weight and compact size, much effort has been devoted to improving the volumetric capacity of electrodes. Herein, an effective strategy of polymorph engineering is proposed to boost the volumetric capacity of FeSe. Owing to the inherent metallic electronic conductivity of tetragonal&#8208;FeSe, a conductive additive&#8208;free electrode (hereafter denoted as CA&#8208;free) can be assembled with an enhanced sodium storage volumetric capacity of 1011 mAh cm&#8722;3, significantly higher than semiconducting hexagonal&#8208;FeSe. Impressively, the CA&#8208;free electrode can achieve an extremely high active material utilization of 96.7&#160;wt% and high initial Coulombic efficiency of 96%, superior to most of the anodes for Na&#8208;ion storage. Moreover, the design methodology is branched out using tetragonal FeSe as the cathode for Li&#8208;ion batteries. The CA&#8208;free tetragonal&#8208;FeSe electrode can achieve a high volumetric energy density of 1373&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and power density of 7200 W L&#8722;1, outperforming most metal chalcogenides. Reversible conversion reactions are revealed by in situ XRD for both sodium and lithium systems. The proposed design strategy provides new insight and inspiration to aid in the ongoing quest for better electrode materials.

         <title>Printable Off&#8211;On Thermoswitchable Fluorescent Materials for Programmable Thermally Controlled Full&#8208;Color Displays and Multiple Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance, full&#8208;color, off&#8211;on thermoswitchable fluorescent materials (TFMs) are achieved successfully. They benefit from thermoinduced &#8220;dual/multichannel&#8221; synergistic changes of the fluorophores and fluorescence modifier, as well as the corresponding F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. These TFMs are easy to prepare and have high fluorescence emission contrast, great reversibility, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;adjust response temperature. All of these features contribute their potential in multiple advanced applications.








Abstract
Thermoswitchable fluorescent materials (TFMs) have received special attention due to their unique fluorescent colorimetric responses to temperature. Conventional TFMs generally display unicolor with switching from one color to another, showing unprintable and unsatisfied performances. These limitations greatly hinder their development and expansion toward advanced applications. Herein, the superior integration of full&#8208;color, off&#8211;on switching mode, printability, and high performance to TFMs is achieved successfully. The success is due to a thermally induced synchronous &#8220;dual/multichannel&#8221; stimulus&#8211;response mode regulated by a self&#8208;crystalline phase&#8208;change material; that is, synergistic changes of the molecular existence states and subsequent colors/spectra of the fluorescent modifier and fluorophores, accompanied by corresponding high&#8208;efficiency on&#8211;off switching of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. These TFMs are simple to prepare and show good performance, such as high fluorescence emission contrast (&gt;100), great reversibility (&gt;200 cycles), and easy&#8208;to&#8208;adjust response temperature. Particularly, these R/G/B TFMs can be prepared as tricolor fluorescent inks, and thus full&#8208;color emissions on flexible substrate can be easily obtained by printing. Finally, their great potential in switchable dynamic interior decoration, programmatic temperature&#8208;control information display, and senior information encryption are illustrated. This successful exploration offers a new perspective for designing and optimizing various other switchable materials with higher comprehensive performances.

These TFMs are simple to prepare and show good performance, such as high fluorescence emission contrast (&amp;gt;100), great reversibility (&amp;gt;200 cycles), and easy&#8208;to&#8208;adjust response temperature. Particularly, these R/G/B TFMs can be prepared as tricolor fluorescent inks, and thus full&#8208;color emissions on flexible substrate can be easily obtained by printing. Finally, their great potential in switchable dynamic interior decoration, programmatic temperature&#8208;control information display, and senior information encryption are illustrated. This successful exploration offers a new perspective for designing and optimizing various other switchable materials with higher comprehensive performances.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Near Unit Internal Quantum Efficiency at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature high&#8208;efficiency light&#8208;emitting diodes based on metal halide perovskite FAPbI3 can work perfectly at low temperatures. A peak external quantum efficiency of 32.8%, corresponding to an internal quantum efficiency of 100%, is achieved at 45&#160;K. Importantly, the device shows almost no degradation after working at a constant current density of 200&#160;mA&#160;m&#8722;2 for 330&#160;h.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature&#8208;high&#8208;efficiency light&#8208;emitting diodes based on metal halide perovskite FAPbI3 are shown to be able to work perfectly at low temperatures. A peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 32.8%, corresponding to an internal quantum efficiency of 100%, is achieved at 45&#160;K. Importantly, the devices show almost no degradation after working at a constant current density of 200&#160;mA&#160;m&#8722;2 for 330&#160;h. The enhanced EQEs at low temperatures result from the increased photoluminescence quantum efficiencies of the perovskite, which is caused by the increased radiative recombination rate. Spectroscopic and calculation results suggest that the phase transitions of the FAPbI3 play an important role for the enhancement of exciton binding energy, which increases the recombination rate.

         <title>Mimicking Nature's Butterflies: Electrochromic Devices with Dual&#8208;Sided Differential Colorations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Janus&#8208;structured electrochromic devices are evolved from traditional electrochromic structures by inserting an optically thin (4&#8211;8 nm) metallic layer with&#160;complex refractive index. These unique differentially colored devices are used to mimick the butterfly Kallima inachus, which closely resembles a dry leaf when its wings are close and exhibits various bright colors when its wings are open.








Abstract
Some butterfly species such as the orange oakleaf (Kallima inachus) have strikingly different colors on the dorsal (front) sides of their wings compared to those on the ventral (back) sides of their wings, which helps camouflage the butterflies from predators and attract potential mates. However, few human&#8208;made materials, devices, and technologies can mimic such differential coloring for a long time. Here, a new type of Janus&#8208;structured two&#8208;sided electrochromic device is developed that, upon application of different voltages, exhibits a coloration state on one side that is distinctly different from that on the other side. This is achieved by inserting an optically thin (4&#8211;8 nm) metallic layer with a complex refractive index, such as a layer composed of tungsten, titanium, copper or silver, into typical electrochromic structures.

         <title>Supramolecular Pins with Ultralong Efficient Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to intramolecular charge transfer enhanced by cucurbit[8]uril, a supramolecular pin shows afterglow with high phosphorescence quantum yield (99.38%) after incorporation into a rigid matrix, which is the highest yield reported to date for phosphorescent materials. Moreover, supramolecular pins are applied for targeted phosphorescence imaging of mitochondria.








Abstract
Constructing ultralong organic phosphorescent materials possessing a high quantum yield is challenging. Herein, assemblies of purely organic supramolecular pins composed of alkyl&#8208;bridged phenylpyridinium salts and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) are reported. Different from &#8220;one host with two guests&#8221; and &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; binding, the binding formation of supramolecular pins is &#8220;one host with one guest&#8221; and &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head,&#8221; which overcomes electrostatic repulsion and promotes intramolecular charge transfer. The supramolecular pin 1/CB[8] displays afterglow with high phosphorescence quantum yield (99.38%) after incorporation into a rigid matrix, which is the highest yield reported to date for phosphorescent materials. Moreover, multicolor photoluminescence can be obtained by different excitation wavelengths and ratios of host to guest. Owing to the redshift of the absorption, the supramolecular pins are applied for targeted phosphorescence imaging of mitochondria. This work will provide a reasonable supramolecular strategy to achieve redshifted and efficient phosphorescence both in the solid state and in aqueous solution.

         <title>A Novel Soft&#8208;Magnetic B2&#8208;Based Multiprincipal&#8208;Element Alloy with a Uniform Distribution of Coherent Body&#8208;Centered&#8208;Cubic Nanoprecipitates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Al1.5Co4Fe2Cr multiprincipal element alloy with ultrafine ferromagnetic body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) coherent nanoprecipitates in a B2 matrix is developed via tuning the chemical composition to manipulate the microstructure. It exhibits a prominent soft&#8208;magnetic property, high Curie temperature, and electrical resistivity, apparently attributable to the excellent stability of the coherent microstructure. The current approach offers a new way to design high&#8208;performance soft&#8208;magnetic alloys for high&#8208;temperature applications.








Abstract
Multiprincipal&#8208;element alloys (MPEAs), including high&#8208;entropy alloys, are a new class of materials whose thermodynamical properties are mainly driven by configuration entropy, rather than enthalpy in the traditional alloys, especially at high temperatures. Herein, the design of a novel soft&#8208;magnetic nonequiatomic, quaternary MPEA is described, via tuning its chemical composition to deliberately manipulate its microstructure, such that it contains ultrafine ferromagnetic body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) coherent nanoprecipitates (3&#8211;7&#160;nm) uniformly distributed in a B2&#8208;phase matrix. The new alloy Al1.5Co4Fe2Cr exhibits high saturation magnetization (MS&#160;= 135.3 emu g&#8208;1), low coercivity (HC&#160;= 127.3 A m&#8208;1), high Curie temperature (TC&#160;= 1061 K), and high electrical resistivity (&#961;&#160; =&#160;244 &#956;&#937; cm), promising for soft magnets. More importantly, these prominent soft&#8208;magnetic properties are observed to be retained even after the alloy is thermally exposed at 873 K for 555 h, apparently attributable to the excellent stability of the coherent microstructure. The versatility of the magnetic properties of this new alloy is discussed in light of the microstructural change induced by tuning the chemical composition, and the enhanced performance of the alloy is compared directly with that of the traditional soft&#8208;magnetic alloys.

     alt="A Novel Soft&#8208;Magnetic B2&#8208;Based Multiprincipal&#8208;Element Alloy with a Uniform Distribution of Coherent Body&#8208;Centered&#8208;Cubic Nanoprecipitates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel Al&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cr multiprincipal element alloy with ultrafine ferromagnetic body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) coherent nanoprecipitates in a B2 matrix is developed via tuning the chemical composition to manipulate the microstructure. It exhibits a prominent soft&#8208;magnetic property, high Curie temperature, and electrical resistivity, apparently attributable to the excellent stability of the coherent microstructure. The current approach offers a new way to design high&#8208;performance soft&#8208;magnetic alloys for high&#8208;temperature applications.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiprincipal&#8208;element alloys (MPEAs), including high&#8208;entropy alloys, are a new class of materials whose thermodynamical properties are mainly driven by configuration entropy, rather than enthalpy in the traditional alloys, especially at high temperatures. Herein, the design of a novel soft&#8208;magnetic nonequiatomic, quaternary MPEA is described, via tuning its chemical composition to deliberately manipulate its microstructure, such that it contains ultrafine ferromagnetic body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) coherent nanoprecipitates (3&#8211;7&#160;nm) uniformly distributed in a B2&#8208;phase matrix. The new alloy Al&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cr exhibits high saturation magnetization (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;= 135.3 emu g&lt;sup&gt;&#8208;1&lt;/sup&gt;), low coercivity (&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;= 127.3 A m&lt;sup&gt;&#8208;1&lt;/sup&gt;), high Curie temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;= 1061 K), and high electrical resistivity (&#961;&#160; =&#160;244 &#956;&#937; cm), promising for soft magnets. More importantly, these prominent soft&#8208;magnetic properties are observed to be retained even after the alloy is thermally exposed at 873 K for 555 h, apparently attributable to the excellent stability of the coherent microstructure. The versatility of the magnetic properties of this new alloy is discussed in light of the microstructural change induced by tuning the chemical composition, and the enhanced performance of the alloy is compared directly with that of the traditional soft&#8208;magnetic alloys. The perspective is also addressed to design high&#8208;performance soft&#8208;magnetic alloys for high&#8208;temperature applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>In Situ Tracking of Wetting&#8208;Front Transient Heat Release on a Surface&#8208;Mounted Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile capillary&#8208;driven liquid&#8208;imbibition approach is developed for in situ tracking of transient heat release at the wetting front of surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic frameworks (SURMOFs) on cellulosic fiber papers. As a potential disruption to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in trace&#8208;solvent detection technologies, the study shows promise for the integration of SURMOFs in future sensor devices.








Abstract
Transient heat generation during guest adsorption and host&#8211;guest interactions is a natural phenomenon in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) chemistry. However, in situ tracking of such MOF released heat is an insufficiently researched field due to the fast heat dissipation to the surroundings. Herein, a facile capillary&#8208;driven liquid&#8208;imbibition approach is developed for in situ tracking of transient heat release at the wetting front of surface&#8208;mounted MOFs (SURMOFs) on cellulosic fiber substrates. Spatiotemporal temperature distributions are obtained with infrared thermal imaging for a range of MOF&#8208;based substrates and imbibed liquids. Temperature rises at the wetting front of water and binary mixtures with organic solvents are found to be over 10&#160;K with an ultrafast and distinguishable thermal signal response (&lt;1 s) with a detectable concentration limit &#8804;1 wt%. As an advancement to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in trace&#8208;solvent detection technologies, this study shows great prospects for the integration of SURMOFs in future sensor devices. Inspired by this prototypal study, SURMOF&#8208;based transient heat signal transduction is likely to be extended to an ever&#8208;expanding library of SURMOFs and other classes of surface&#8208;grafted porous materials, translating into a wide range of convenient, portable, and ubiquitous sensor devices.

         <title>Frequency&#8208;Independent Terahertz Anomalous Hall Effect in DyCo5, Co32Fe68, and Gd27Fe73 Thin Films from DC to 40 THz</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a fundamental spintronic phenomenon that is a potentially essential ingredient of future high&#8208;speed spintronic devices operating at terahertz (THz) frequencies. It is revealed that the AHE remains operative from DC up to 40 THz with a flat frequency response in thin films of three technologically relevant magnetic materials: DyCo5, Co32Fe68, and Gd27Fe73.








Abstract
The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a fundamental spintronic charge&#8208;to&#8208;charge&#8208;current conversion phenomenon and closely related to spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge&#8208;current conversion by the spin Hall effect. Future high&#8208;speed spintronic devices will crucially rely on such conversion phenomena at terahertz (THz) frequencies. Here, it is revealed that the AHE remains operative from DC up to 40 THz with a flat frequency response in thin films of three technologically relevant magnetic materials: DyCo5, Co32Fe68, and Gd27Fe73. The frequency&#8208;dependent conductivity&#8208;tensor elements &#963;xx and &#963;yx&#8197;are&#8197;measured, and good agreement with DC measurements is found. The experimental findings are fully consistent with ab initio calculations of &#963;yx for CoFe and highlight the role of the large Drude scattering rate (&#8776;100&#160;THz) of metal thin films, which smears out any sharp spectral features of the THz AHE. Finally, it is found that the intrinsic contribution to the THz AHE dominates over the extrinsic mechanisms for the Co32Fe68 sample. The results imply that the AHE and related effects such as the spin Hall effect are highly promising ingredients of future THz spintronic devices reliably operating from DC to 40 THz and beyond.

         <title>Fabrication of Quasi&#8208;2D Shape&#8208;Tailored Microparticles using Wettability Contrast&#8208;Based Platforms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin polymeric films with well&#8208;defined lateral size and geometry are fabricated taking advantage of the wettability contrast of oleophilic&#8211;oleophobic patterned surfaces. Cells mediate the pliability of quasi&#8208;2D films, and their integration in 3D cellular aggregates leads to enhanced cell metabolic activity and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor.








Abstract
The ability to fabricate materials with ultrathin architectures enables the breakthrough of low&#8208;dimensional structures with high surface area that showcase distinctive properties from their bulk counterparts. They are exploited in a wide range of fields, including energy harvesting, catalysis, and biomedicine. Despite such versatility, the fine tuning of the lateral dimensions and geometry of these structures remains challenging. Prepatterned platforms gain significant attention as enabling technologies to process materials with highly controlled shapes and dimensions. Herein, different nanometer&#8208;thick particles of various lateral sizes and geometries (e.g., squares, circles, triangles, hexagons) are processed with high precision and definition, taking advantage of the wettability contrast of oleophilic&#8211;oleophobic patterned surfaces. Quasi&#8208;2D polymeric microparticles with high shape&#8208; and size&#8208;fidelity can be retrieved as freestanding objects in a single step. These structures show cell&#8208;mediated pliability, and their integration in gravity&#8208;enforced human adipose&#8208;derived stem cell spheroids leads to an enhanced metabolic activity and a modulated secretion of proangiogenic factors.

         <title>Photodriven Transient Picosecond Top&#8208;Layer Semiconductor to Metal Phase&#8208;Transition in p&#8208;Doped Molybdenum Disulfide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface S&#8211;Mo&#8211;S sheet of the p&#8208;doped indirect semiconductor 2H&#8208;MoS2 is found to undergo a transient 1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;metallization of the surface layer by optical excitation with distinct threshold and saturation behaviour. This finding builds on the essential sensitivity of time&#8208;resolved electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis with tuneable synchrotron radiation.








Abstract
Visible light is shown to create a transient metallic S&#8211;Mo&#8211;S surface layer on bulk semiconducting p&#8208;doped indirect&#8208;bandgap 2H&#8208;MoS2. Optically created electron&#8211;hole pairs separate in the surface band bending region of the p&#8208;doped semiconducting crystal causing a transient accumulation of electrons in the surface region. This triggers a reversible 2H&#8208;semiconductor to 1T&#8208;metal phase&#8208;transition of the surface layer. Electron&#8211;phonon coupling of the indirect&#8208;bandgap p&#8208;doped 2H&#8208;MoS2 enables this efficient pathway even at a low density of excited electrons with a distinct optical excitation threshold and saturation behavior. This mechanism needs to be taken into consideration when describing the surface properties of illuminated p&#8208;doped 2H&#8208;MoS2. In particular, light&#8208;induced increased charge mobility and surface activation can cause and enhance the photocatalytic and photoassisted electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction of water on 2H&#8208;MoS2. Generally, it opens up for a way to control not only the surface of p&#8208;doped 2H&#8208;MoS2 but also related dichalcogenides and layered systems. The findings are based on the sensitivity of time&#8208;resolved electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis with photon&#8208;energy&#8208;tuneable synchrotron&#160;radiation.

         <title>Harnessing Ionic Power from Equilibrium Electrolyte Solution via Photoinduced Active Ion Transport through van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals&#8208;Like Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenide&#8208;based van der Waals multilayer heterostructures are used to harvest ionic power from equilibrium electrolyte solutions via a coupled photon&#8208;carrier&#8211;ion&#8208;transport mechanism. Under optimized conditions, a power density of nearly 2 mW&#160;m&#8211;2 is achieved under one sun equivalent excitation.








Abstract
Nanofluidic ion transport through van der Waals heterostructures, composed of two or more types of reconstructed 2D nanomaterials, gives rise to fascinating opportunities for light&#8208;energy harvesting, due to coupling between the optoelectronic properties of the layered constituents and ion transport in between the atomic layers. Here, a photoinduced active ion transport phenomenon through transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)&#8208;based van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals&#8208;like multilayer heterostructures is reported for harnessing ionic power from equilibrium electrolyte solution. The binary heterostructure comprises sequentially stacked 2D&#8208;WS2 and 2D&#8208;MoS2 multilayers with sub&#8208;1 nm interlayer spacing. Upon visible&#8208;light illumination, a net ionic flow is initiated through the Janus membrane, suggesting a directional cationic transport from WS2 to MoS2 part. The transport mechanism is explained in terms of a photovoltaic effect due to type II band alignment of WS2/MoS2 heterostructures. The driving mechanism can be generally applied to a variety of heterogeneous TMD membranes with type II semiconductor heterojunctions. In equilibrium ionic solutions, the maximum ionic photoresponse approaches &#8776;21 &#181;A&#160;cm&#8211;2 and &#8776;45&#160;mV under one sun equivalent excitation. Under optimized conditions, the harvested power density reaches 2&#160;mW&#160;m&#8211;2. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of photonic&#8208;to&#8208;ionic power generation within angstrom&#8208;scale confinement anticipates potential for light&#8208;controlled ionic circuits, artificial photosynthesis, and biomimetic energy conversion.

         <title>Embolization of Vascular Malformations via In Situ Photocrosslinking of Mechanically Reinforced Alginate Microfibers using an Optical&#8208;Fiber&#8208;Integrated Microfluidic Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;crosslinked alginate&#8208;based hydrogel with tantalum nanopowder is proposed that employs the synergistic effect of covalent crosslinking through visible&#8208;light irradiation and ionic crosslinking by Ca2+ in the blood. Furthermore, an effective strategy to design and produce an optical&#8208;fiber&#8208;integrated microfluidic device that can continuously form hydrogel microfibers by in situ photocrosslinking in extreme endovascular environments is developed.








Abstract
Embolization, which is a minimally invasive endovascular treatment, is a safe and effective procedure for treating vascular malformations (e.g., aneurysms). Hydrogel microfibers obtained via spatiotemporally controllable in situ photocrosslinking exhibit great potential for embolizing aneurysms. However, this process is challenging because of the absence of biocompatible and morphologically stable hydrogels and the difficulty in continuously spinning the microfibers via in situ photocrosslinking in extreme endovascular environments such as those involving a tortuous geometry and high absorbance. A double&#8208;crosslinked alginate&#8208;based hydrogel with tantalum nanopowder (DAT) that exploits the synergistic effect of covalent crosslinking by visible&#8208;light irradiation and ionic crosslinking using Ca2+, which is present in the blood, is developed in this study. Furthermore, an effective strategy to design and produce an optical&#8208;fiber&#8208;integrated microfluidic device (OFI&#8208;MD) that can continuously spin hydrogel microfibers via in situ photocrosslinking in extreme endovascular environments is proposed. As an embolic material, DAT exhibits promising characteristics such as radiopacity, nondissociation, nonswelling, and constant mechanical strength in blood, in addition to excellent cyto&#8208; and hemo&#8208;compatibilities. Using OFI&#8208;MD to spin DAT microfibers continuously can help fill aneurysms safely, uniformly, and completely within the endovascular simulator without generating microscopic fragments, which demonstrates its potential as an effective embolization strategy.

         <title>Selenic Acid Etching Assisted Vacancy Engineering for Designing Highly Active Electrocatalysts toward the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general, selenic&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted etching strategy from a metal&#8211;organic framework as a precursor is developed to realize carbon&#8208;coated 3d metal selenides MmSen (Co0.85Se1&#8722;x, NiSe2&#8722;x, FeSe2&#8208;x) with rich Se vacancies as high&#8208;performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals a mechanism that the introduction of abundant Se vacancies can improve the conductivity and reduce reaction barriers for the formation of intermediates.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution electrocatalysts are central to overall water splitting, and they should meet the requirements of low cost, high activity, high conductivity, and stable performance. Herein, a general, selenic&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted etching strategy is designed from a metal&#8211;organic framework as a precursor to realize carbon&#8208;coated 3d metal selenides MmSen (Co0.85Se1&#8722;x, NiSe2&#8722;x, FeSe2&#8722;x) with rich Se vacancies as high&#8208;performance precious metal&#8208;free oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Specifically, the as&#8208;prepared Co0.85Se1&#8722;x@C nanocages deliver an overpotential of only 231&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for the OER and the corresponding full water&#8208;splitting electrolyzer requires only a cell voltage of 1.49&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in alkaline media. Density functional theory calculation reveals the important role of abundant Se vacancies for improving the catalytic activity through improving the conductivity and reducing reaction barriers for the formation of intermediates. Although phase change after long&#8208;term operation is observed with the formation of metal hydroxides, catalytic activity is not obviously affected, which strengthens the important role of the carbon network in the operating stability. This study provides a new opportunity to realize high&#8208;performance OER electrocatalysts by a general strategy on selenic acid etching assisted vacancy engineering.

This study provides a new opportunity to realize high&#8208;performance OER electrocatalysts by a general strategy on selenic acid etching assisted vacancy engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Spider&#8208;Silk&#8208;Inspired Wet Adhesive with Supercold Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spider&#8208;silk&#8208;inspired wet adhesive (SA) composed of polyurethane@poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PU@PVP, core@sheath) nanostructured fibers is fabricated by coaxial electrospinning. The SA achieves robust wet adhesion through a unique dissolving&#8211;wetting&#8211;adhering process of the core&#8211;sheath nanostructured fibers. Furthermore, the SA retains reliable adhesion from 4 to &#8722;196&#160;&#176;C, and even maintains constant adhesion after being stored in liquid nitrogen, showing promising applicability in cryogenic environments.








Abstract
Conventional adhesives often encounter interfacial failure in humid conditions due to small droplets of water condensed on surface, but spider silks can capture prey in such environment. Here a robust spider&#8208;silk&#8208;inspired wet adhesive (SA) composed of core&#8211;sheath nanostructured fibers with hygroscopic adhesive nanosheath (poly(vinylpyrrolidone)) and supporting nanocore (polyurethane) is reported. The wet adhesion of the SA is achieved by a unique dissolving&#8211;wetting&#8211;adhering process of core&#8211;sheath nanostructured fibers, revealed by in situ observations at macro&#8208; and microscales. Further, the SA maintains reliable adhesion on wet and cold substrates from 4 to &#8722;196&#160;&#176;C and even tolerates splashing, violent shaking, and weight loading in liquid nitrogen (&#8722;196&#160;&#176;C), showing promising applicability in cryogenic environments. This study will provide an innovative route to design functional wet adhesives.

         <title>Porous Semiconducting Polymers Enable High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porous polymer films is fabricated using the efficient breath figure method and their performance in organic electrochemical transistors is investigated. Introducing the porosity significantly enhances the ion penetration rates and results in high transconductance and fast switching properties.








Abstract
Organic polymer electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are of great interest for flexible electronics and bioelectronics applications owing to their high transconductance and low operating voltage. However, efficient OECT operation must delicately balance the seemingly incompatible materials optimizations of redox chemistry, active layer electronic transport, and ion penetration/transport. The latter characteristics are particularly challenging since most high&#8208;mobility semiconducting polymers are hydrophobic, which hinders efficient ion penetration, hence limiting OECT performance. Here, the properties and OECT response of a series of dense and porous semiconducting polymer films are compared, the latter fabricated via a facile breath figure approach. This methodology enables fast ion doping, high transconductance (up to 364 S cm&#8722;1), and a low subthreshold swing for the hydrophobic polymers DPPDTT and P3HT, rivalling or exceeding the metrics of the relatively hydrophilic polymer, Pg2T&#8208;T. Furthermore, the porous morphology also enhances the transconductance of hydrophilic polymers, offering a general strategy for fabricating high&#8208;performance electrochemical transistors.

         <title>Biologically Plausible Artificial Synaptic Array: Replicating Ebbinghaus&#8217; Memory Curve with Selective Attention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the memorization process of the human brain, an artificial synaptic array is developed, which mimics the biological memorization process by replicating Ebbinghaus&#8217; forgetting curve. To construct the artificial synaptic array, signal&#8208;transmitting access transistors and artificial synaptic memory transistors are designed using indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc&#8208;oxide and poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), respectively.








Abstract
The nature of repetitive learning and oblivion of memory enables humans to effectively manage vast amounts of memory by prioritizing information for long&#8208;term storage. Inspired by the memorization process of the human brain, an artificial synaptic array is presented, which mimics the biological memorization process by replicating Ebbinghaus&#8217; forgetting curve. To construct the artificial synaptic array, signal&#8208;transmitting access transistors and artificial synaptic memory transistors are designed using indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc&#8208;oxide and poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), respectively. To secure the desired performance of the access transistor in regulating the input signal to the synaptic transistor, the content of gallium in the access transistor is optimized. In addition, the operation voltage of the synaptic transistor is carefully selected to achieve memory&#8208;state efficiency. Repetitive learning characterizing Ebbinghaus&#8217; oblivion curves is realized using an artificial synaptic array with optimized conditions for both transistor components. This successfully demonstrates a biologically plausible memorization process. Furthermore, selective attention for information prioritization in the human brain is mimicked by selectively applying repetitive learning to a synaptic transistor with a high memory state. The demonstrated biologically plausible artificial synaptic array provides great scope for advancement in bioinspired electronics.

         <title>Infrared Metasurface Augmented by Deep Learning for Monitoring Dynamics between All Major Classes of Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metasurfaces have outstanding light manipulation capabilities at the nanoscale, which enable functions beyond what otherwise is seen in nature. In this work, highly sensitive, broadband mid&#8208;IR metasurfaces for spectroscopy are augmented with artificial intelligence to allow the label&#8208;free monitoring of biomolecules from all major classes. This pioneering bioanalytical technology offers unprecedented opportunities for unravelling complex biomolecular processes.








Abstract
Insights into the fascinating molecular world of biological processes are crucial for understanding diseases, developing diagnostics, and effective therapeutics. These processes are complex as they involve interactions between four major classes of biomolecules, i.e., proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids, which makes it important to be able to discriminate between all these different biomolecular species. In this work, a deep learning&#8208;augmented, chemically&#8208;specific nanoplasmonic technique that enables such a feat in a label&#8208;free manner to not disrupt native processes is presented. The method uses a highly sensitive multiresonant plasmonic metasurface in a microfluidic device, which enhances infrared absorption across a broadband mid&#8208;IR spectrum and in water, despite its strongly overlapping absorption bands. The real&#8208;time format of the optofluidic method enables the collection of a vast amount of spectrotemporal data, which allows the construction of a deep neural network to discriminate accurately between all major classes of biomolecules. The capabilities of the new method are demonstrated by monitoring of a multistep bioassay containing sucrose&#8208; and nucleotides&#8208;loaded liposomes interacting with a small, lipid membrane&#8208;perforating peptide. It is envisioned that the presented technology will impact the fields of biology, bioanalytics, and pharmacology from fundamental research and disease diagnostics to drug development.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2006759, Hyung Joon Cha, Joonwon Kim,  and co&#8208;workers develop an optical&#8208;fiber&#8208;integrated microfluidic device that can continuously form hydrogel microfibers via in situ photo&#8208;crosslinking in extreme endovascular environments. The hydrogel microfibers are based on a double&#8208;crosslinked alginate that employs the dityrosine bond. This microfluidic device with hydrogel microfibers is an attractive strategy to fill aneurysms effectively.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2006957, Nomi L. A. N. Sorgenfrei and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that a weak optical excitation creates electrons in the conduction band of p&#8208;doped semiconducting molybdenum disulfide, which travel toward the surface layer. They accumulate in the top layer and concomitantly drive it from the semiconducting toward the metallic phase. The selectivity of synchrotron time&#8208;resolved electron spectroscopy traces this effect. This surface modification influences the properties and functionality of MoS2. Frontispiece Art: Martin K&#252;nsting.

         <title>Solvent Engineering of the Precursor Solution toward Large&#8208;Area Production of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent engineering of precursor solutions toward efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is reviewed comprehensively. The key role of solvent engineering for solution&#8208;processed perovskite film is highlighted, especially for the large&#8208;area production of PSCs. Light is shed on the significance of solvent engineering in PSCs, and critical guidance for future commercialization development of highly efficient PSCs is provided.








Abstract
Solar cells based on emerging organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have reached certified power conversion efficiency as high as 25.5%, showing great potential in the next generation of photovoltaics toward large&#8208;scale industrialization. The most competitive feature of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is that the perovskite light absorber can be fabricated by a low&#8208;cost solution method. For the solution method, the characteristics of the solvent play a key role in determining the crystallization kinetics, growth orientation, and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite film. Although significant progress has been made in the field of solvent engineering in PSCs, it is still challenging for the solution method to sustainably produce industrial&#8208;scale PSCs for future commercialization applications. Herein, the advanced progress of solvent engineering of precursor solution in terms of coordination regulation and toxicity reduction is highlighted. The physical and chemical characteristics of different solvents in reducing the toxicity of the solvent system, regulating the coordination property of the precursor solution, controlling the film&#8208;forming process of the perovskite film, and adjusting the photovoltaic performance of the PSC are systematically discussed. Lastly, important perspectives on solvent engineering of the perovskite precursor solution toward future industrial production of high&#8208;performance PSCs are provided.

         <title>Beyond the Visible: Bioinspired Infrared Adaptive Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Infrared adaptation phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and biological systems. A state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art account on emerging bioinspired infrared adaptive materials and their potential applications is provided. Perspectives for future scope, challenges, and opportunities on such a multidisciplinary topic are outlined.








Abstract
Infrared (IR) adaptation phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and biological systems. Taking inspiration from natural creatures, researchers have devoted extensive efforts for developing advanced IR adaptive materials and exploring their applications in areas of smart camouflage, thermal energy management, biomedical science, and many other IR&#8208;related technological fields. Herein, an up&#8208;to&#8208;date review is provided on the recent advancements of bioinspired IR adaptive materials and their promising applications. First an overview of IR adaptation in nature and advanced artificial IR technologies is presented. Recent endeavors are then introduced toward developing bioinspired adaptive materials for IR camouflage and IR radiative cooling. According to the Stefan&#8208;Boltzmann law, IR camouflage can be realized by either emissivity engineering or thermal cloaks. IR radiative cooling can maximize the thermal radiation of an object through an IR atmospheric transparency window, and thus holds great potential for use in energy&#8208;efficient green buildings and smart personal thermal management systems. Recent advances in bioinspired adaptive materials for emerging near&#8208;IR (NIR) applications are also discussed, including NIR&#8208;triggered biological technologies, NIR light&#8208;fueled soft robotics, and NIR light&#8208;driven supramolecular nanosystems. This review concludes with a perspective on the challenges and opportunities for the future development of bioinspired IR adaptive materials.

         <title>Efficient Electron Transport Layer Free Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells with Superior Device Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells based on a new electron donor reach power conversion efficiencies exceeding 13% with and without the use of electrode interlayers, but differ strongly in stability. Surprisingly, the surface composition and morphology of the interlayers deteriorate with time even under inert conditions, reducing device performance. Without interlayers, the cells give stable high performance.








Abstract
Electron transport layers (ETLs) placed between the electrodes and a photoactive layer can enhance the performance of organic solar cells but also impose limitations. Most ETLs are ultrathin films, and their deposition can disturb the morphology of the photoactive layers, complicate device fabrication, raise cost, and also affect device stability. To fully overcome such drawbacks, efficient organic solar cells that operate without an ETL are preferred. In this study, a new small&#8208;molecule electron donor (H31) based on a thiophene&#8208;substituted benzodithiophene core unit with trialkylsilyl side chains is designed and synthesized. Blending H31 with the electron acceptor Y6 gives solar cells with power conversion efficiencies exceeding 13% with and without 2,9&#8208;bis[3&#8208;(dimethyloxidoamino)propyl]anthra[2,1,9&#8208;def:6,5,10&#8208;d&#8242;e&#8242;f&#8201;&#8242;]diisoquinoline&#8208;1,3,8,10(2H,9H)&#8208;tetrone (PDINO) as the ETL. The ETL&#8208;free cells deliver a superior shelf life compared to devices with an ETL. Small&#8208;molecule donor&#8211;acceptor blends thus provide interesting perspectives for achieving efficient, reproducible, and stable device architectures without electrode interlayers.

         <title>A Polymer Multicellular Nanoengager for Synergistic NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting polymer nanoengager (SPNE) with both tumor&#8208;associated antigens and T cell stimulating factors is designed to elicit potent multicellular engagement among tumor cells and immunocytes, enabling dual vaccination effects on both dendritic cells and T cells. Thus, the SPNE mediates synergistic second&#8208;near&#8208;infrared&#8208;window (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal immunotherapy that efficiently inhibits tumor growth and metastasis.








Abstract
Cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles (CCNPs) that integrate the biophysiological advantages of cell membranes with the multifunctionalities of synthetic materials hold great promise in cancer immunotherapy. However, strategies have yet to be revealed to further improve their immunotherapeutic efficacy. Herein, a polymer multicellular nanoengager (SPNE) for synergistic second&#8208;near&#8208;infrared&#8208;window (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal immunotherapy is reported. The nanoengager consists of an NIR&#8208;II absorbing polymer as the photothermal core, which is camouflaged with fused membranes derived from immunologically engineered tumor cells and dendritic cells (DCs) as the cancer vaccine shell. In association with the high accumulation in lymph nodes and tumors, the multicellular engagement ability of the SPNE enables effective cross&#8208;interactions among tumor cells, DCs, and T cells, leading to augmented T cell activation relative to bare or tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;coated nanoparticles. Upon deep&#8208;tissue penetrating NIR&#8208;II photoirradiation, SPNE eradicates the tumor and induces immunogenic cell death, further eliciting anti&#8208;tumor T cell immunity. Such a synergistic photothermal immunotherapeutic effect eventually inhibits tumor growth, prevents metastasis and procures immunological memory. Thus, this study presents a general cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coating approach to develop photo&#8208;immunotherapeutic agents for cancer therapy.

         <title>A Morphable Ionic Electrode Based on Thermogel for Non&#8208;Invasive Hairy Plant Electrophysiology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex surface topography on biological tissues presents a major challenge in bio&#8208;electronic interfacing. Taking hairy plants as an example, an ionic electrode based on a thermogel is reported, which adapts and adheres to the abrupt hairy surface asperities, establishing a conformal and adhesive interface. It enables non&#8208;invasive plant electrophysiological measurement with a signal fidelity not achievable by conventional gel electrodes.








Abstract
Plant electrophysiology lays the foundation for smart plant interrogation and intervention. However, plant trichomes with hair&#8208;like morphologies present topographical features that challenge stable and high&#8208;fidelity non&#8208;invasive electrophysiology, due to the inadequate dynamic shape adaptability of conventional electrodes. Here, this issue is overcome using a morphable ionic electrode based on a thermogel, which gradually transforms from a viscous liquid to a viscoelastic gel. This transformation enables the morphable electrode to lock into the abrupt hairy surface irregularities and establish a conformal and adhesive interface. It achieves down to one tenth of the impedance and 4&#8211;5 times the adhesive strengths of conventional hydrogel electrodes on hairy leaves. As a result of the improved electrical and mechanical robustness, the morphable electrode can record more than one order of magnitude higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio on hairy plants and maintains high&#8208;fidelity recording despite plant movements, achieving superior performance to conventional hydrogel electrodes. The reported morphable electrode is a promising tool for hairy plant electrophysiology and may be applied to diversely textured plants for advanced sensing and modulation.

         <title>Functional Skeletal Muscle Regeneration with Thermally Drawn Porous Fibers and Reprogrammed Muscle Progenitors for Volumetric Muscle Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioengineered skeletal muscle construct is generated by culturing induced skeletal myogenic progenitor cells in a thermally drawn polycaprolactone porous fiber scaffold modified with decellularized muscle extracellular matrix. The hybrid composite fiber shows favorable mechanical and biochemical signals for muscle reprogramming and maturation. The bioengineered muscle construct repairs volumetric muscle loss injury via de novo muscle regeneration and functional restoration.








Abstract
Skeletal muscle has an inherent capacity for spontaneous regeneration. However, recovery after severe injuries such as volumetric muscle loss (VML) is limited. There is therefore a need to develop interventions to induce functional skeletal muscle restoration. One suggested approach includes tissue&#8208;engineered muscle constructs. Tissue&#8208;engineering treatments have so far been impeded by the lack of reliable cell sources and the challenges in engineering of suitable tissue scaffolds. To address these challenges, muscle extracellular matrix (MEM) and induced skeletal myogenic progenitor cells (iMPCs) are integrated within thermally drawn fiber based microchannel scaffolds. The microchannel fibers decorated with MEM enhance differentiation and maturation of iMPCs. Furthermore, engraftment of these bioengineered hybrid muscle constructs induce de novo muscle regeneration accompanied with microvessel and neuromuscular junction formation in a VML mouse model, ultimately leading to functional recovery of muscle activity.

         <title>Multiresponsive Nonvolatile Memories Based on Optically Switchable Ferroelectric Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiresponsive organic device based on a photochromic&#8211;ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor, which is capable of operating as nonvolatile memory with 11 bit memory storage capacity in a single device, is fabricated. The memory elements can be written and erased independently by light or an electric field, with accurate control over the readout signal, excellent repeatability, fast response, and high retention time.








Abstract
Organic transistors are key elements for flexible, wearable, and biocompatible logic applications. Multiresponsivity is highly sought&#8208;after in organic electronics to enable sophisticated operations and functions. Such a challenge can be pursued by integrating more components in a single device, each one responding to a specific external stimulus. Here, the first multiresponsive organic device based on a photochromic&#8211;ferroelectric organic field&#8208;effect transistor, which is capable of operating as nonvolatile memory with 11 bit memory storage capacity in a single device, is reported. The memory elements can be written and erased independently by means of light or an electric field, with accurate control over the readout signal, excellent repeatability, fast response, and high retention time. Such a proof of concept paves the way toward enhanced functional complexity in optoelectronics via the interfacing of multiple components in a single device, in a fully integrated low&#8208;cost technology compatible with flexible substrates.

Here, the first multiresponsive organic device based on a photochromic&#8211;ferroelectric organic field&#8208;effect transistor, which is capable of operating as nonvolatile memory with 11 bit memory storage capacity in a single device, is reported. The memory elements can be written and erased independently by means of light or an electric field, with accurate control over the readout signal, excellent repeatability, fast response, and high retention time. Such a proof of concept paves the way toward enhanced functional complexity in optoelectronics via the interfacing of multiple components in a single device, in a fully integrated low&#8208;cost technology compatible with flexible substrates.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Sensitive Compression&#8208;Stress Sensor Using Integrated Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weak compression stresses on the order of 100 to 103 Pa, found in a broad range of physical phenomena from the daily life to the laboratory, are not detected by conventional mechanoresponsive materials. Visualization and colorimetric quantification of weak compression stresses are achieved by integrated stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, namely layered polydiacetylene and dry liquid, through response cascades.








Abstract
Measurement of mechanical stresses, such as compression, shear, and tensile stresses, contributes toward achieving a safer and healthier life. In particular, the detection of weak compression stresses is required for healthcare monitoring and biomedical applications. Compression stresses in the order of 106&#8211;1010&#160;Pa have been visualized and/or quantified using mechano&#8208;responsive materials in previous works. However, in general, it is not easy to detect compression stresses weaker than 103&#160;Pa using conventional mechano&#8208;responsive materials because the dynamic motion of the rigid mechano&#8208;responsive molecules is not induced by such a weak stress. In the present work, weak compression stresses in the order of 100&#8211;103&#160;Pa are visualized and measured via the integration of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, such as layered polydiacetylene (PDA) and dry liquid (DL), through response cascades. DLs consisting of liquid droplets covered by solid particles release the interior liquid and collapse with application of a weak compression stress. The color of the layered PDA is changed by the spilled liquid as a chemical stress. A variety of weak compression stresses, such as expiratory pressure, are visualized and colorimetrically measured using the paper&#8208;based device of the integrated stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. Diverse mechano&#8208;sensing devices can be designed via the integration of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Lithium Metal Electrode with Increased Air Stability and Robust Solid Electrolyte Interphase Realized by Silane Coupling Agent Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dense modification layer of a silane coupling agent enables Li metal to be stable in air and during cycling. This layer firmly adheres to the Li metal surface by forming Li&#63743;O&#63743;Si bonds, and it connects with the solid electrolyte interphase layer by chemical bonds and physical intertwining effects.








Abstract
The quality of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer is the decisive factor for the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;metal&#8208;based batteries. Due to the absence of effective bonding, a natural SEI layer may exfoliate from the Li anode during interfacial fluctuations. Here, a silane coupling agent is introduced to serve as an adhesion promoter to bridge these two dissimilar materials via both chemical bonding and physical intertwining effects. Its inorganic reactive groups can combine with the Li substrate by forming Li&#63743;O&#63743;Si bonds, while organic functional groups can take part in the formation of the SEI layer and thereby bond with SEI components. Li metal electrodes with silane coupling agent modification exhibit excellent electrochemical performance, even under extreme testing conditions. This modification layer with dense structure could also protect the Li metal from corrosion by air, evidenced by the comparable electrochemical activity of the modified Li metal electrodes even after being exposed in air for 2 h. This design provides a promising pathway for the development of Li metal electrodes that will be stable both in electrolyte and in air.

         <title>An Electron Acceptor Analogue for Lowering Trap Density in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 14, April 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy of employing an acceptor&#8208;analogue is developed to efficiently reduce trap density to a magnitude of 1015&#160;cm&#8722;3 for organic photovoltaic materials, which is comparable to and even lower than those of some inorganic counterparts, and boosts the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells up to 17.8%.








Abstract
Typical organic semiconductor materials exhibit a high trap density of states, ranging from 1016 to 1018&#160;cm&#8722;3, which is one of the important factors in limiting the improvement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). In order to reduce the trap density within OSCs, a new strategy to design and synthesize an electron acceptor analogue, BTPR, is developed, which is introduced into OSCs as a third component to enhance the molecular packing order of electron acceptor with and without blending a polymer donor. Finally, the as&#8208;cast ternary OSC devices employing BTPR show a notable PCE of 17.8%, with a low trap density (1015&#160;cm&#8722;3) and a low energy loss (0.217&#160;eV) caused by non&#8208;radiative recombination. This PCE is among the highest values for single&#8208;junction OSCs. The trap density of OSCs with the BTPR additives, as low as 1015&#160;cm&#8722;3, is comparable to and even lower than those of several typical high&#8208;performance inorganic/hybrid counterparts, like 1016&#160;cm&#8722;3 for amorphous silicon, 1016&#160;cm&#8722;3 for metal oxides, and 1014 to 1015&#160;cm&#8722;3 for halide perovskite thin film, and makes it promising for OSCs to obtain a PCE of up to 20%.

         <title>Stabilizing Pt&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction: Fundamental Understanding and Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategies to improve the stability of Pt&#8208;based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction are comprehensively reviewed. First, the basic physical chemistry behind the catalyst degradation is highlighted. After a discussion of advanced characterization techniques for the catalyst degradation, the design strategies for improving the stability of Pt&#8208;based catalysts are proposed.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) with high efficiency and nonpollution characteristics have attracted massive attention from both academic and industrial communities due to their irreplaceable roles in building the future sustainable energy system. However, the stability issue of Pt&#8208;based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has become a central constraint to the widespread deployment of the devices relative to the catalytic activity. This review aims to provide comprehensive insights into how to improve the stability of Pt&#8208;based catalysts for ORR. First, the basic physical chemistry behind the catalyst degradation, including the fundamental understandings of carbon corrosion, catalyst dissolution, and particle sintering, is highlighted. After a discussion of advanced characterization techniques for the catalyst degradation, the design strategies for improving the stability of Pt&#8208;based catalysts are summarized. Finally, further insights into the remaining challenges and future research directions are also provided.

A maskless, templateless, and plating&#8208;free fabrication method for high&#8208;performance flexible transparent electrodes with embedded silver mesh is proposed by combining an electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven microscale 3D printing technique and a hybrid hot&#8208;embossing process. The flexible transparent electrode with embedded silver mesh exhibits excellent photoelectric properties, remarkable mechanical stability, and environmental adaptability.








Abstract
Flexible transparent electrodes (FTEs) with an embedded metal mesh are considered a promising alternative to traditional indium tin oxide (ITO) due to their excellent photoelectric performance, surface roughness, and mechanical and environmental stability. However, great challenges remain for achieving simple, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally friendly manufacturing of high&#8208;performance FTEs with embedded metal mesh. Herein, a maskless, templateless, and plating&#8208;free fabrication technique is proposed for FTEs with embedded silver mesh by combining an electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven (EFD) microscale 3D printing technique and a newly developed hybrid hot&#8208;embossing process. The final fabricated FTE exhibits superior optoelectronic properties with a transmittance of 85.79%, a sheet resistance of 0.75 &#937; sq&#8722;1, a smooth surface of silver mesh (Ra&#160;&#8776; 18.8&#160;nm) without any polishing treatment, and remarkable mechanical stability and environmental adaptability with a negligible increase in sheet resistance under diverse cyclic tests and harsh working conditions (1000 bending cycles, 80 adhesion tests, 120 scratch tests, 100&#160;min ultrasonic test, and 72 h chemical attack). The practical viability of this FTE is successfully demonstrated with a flexible transparent heater applied to deicing. The technique proposed offers a promising fabrication strategy with a cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly process for high&#8208;performance FTE.

         <title>Elucidation of Diffusivity of Hydrogen Isotopes in Flexible MOFs by Quasi&#8208;Elastic Neutron Scattering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An experimental observation of hydrogen isotope diffusion in flexible MIL&#8208;53(Al) is demonstrated through quasielastic neutron scattering. Unlike rigid structures, the diffusion difference between the isotopes in the flexible MIL&#8208;53(Al) increases with an increase in temperature. Owing to this unique inverse trend, a new strategy is suggested for achieving higher operating temperatures for efficient isotope separation utilizing a flexible metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) system.








Abstract
Kinetic&#8208;quantum&#8208;sieving&#8208;assisted H2:D2 separation in flexible porous materials is more effective than the currently used energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation and girdle&#8208;sulfide processes for isotope separation. It is believed that material flexibility results in a pore&#8208;breathing phenomenon under the influence of external stimuli, which helps in adjusting the pore size and gives rise to the optimum quantum&#8208;sieving phenomenon at each stage of gas separation. However, only a few studies have investigated kinetic&#8208;quantum&#8208;sieving&#8208;assisted isotope separation using flexible porous materials. In addition, no reports are available on the microscopic observation of isotopic molecular transportation during the separation process under dynamic transition. Here, the experimental observation of a significantly faster diffusion of deuterium than hydrogen in a flexible pore structure, even at high temperatures, through quasi&#8208;elastic neutron scattering, is reported. Unlike rigid structures, the extracted diffusion dynamics of hydrogen isotopes within flexible frameworks show that the diffusion difference between the isotopes increases with an increase in temperature. Owing to this unique inverse trend, a new strategy is suggested for achieving higher operating temperatures for efficient isotope separation utilizing a flexible metal&#8211;organic framework system.

         <title>Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Battery Cathode Design: Tailoring Metal&#8208;Based Nanostructures for Robust Polysulfide Adsorption and Catalytic Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lithium&#8211;sulfur battery is the frontrunner technology for potential large&#8208;scale energy storage stemming from its high specific energy capacity and superior energy density. This review presents myriads of transition metals, metal dichalcogenides, metal phosphides, metal oxides, metal carbides, metal nitrides, and others (e.g., metal phosphosulfides, metal hydroxides, metal&#8208;organic frameworks and hybrids), which can serve as robust cathodes for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have a high specific energy capacity and density of 1675 mAh g&#8722;1 and 2670&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, respectively, rendering them among the most promising successors for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, there are myriads of obstacles in the practical application and commercialization of Li&#8208;S batteries, including the low conductivity of sulfur and its discharge products (Li2S/Li2S2), volume expansion of sulfur electrode, and the polysulfide shuttle effect. Hence, immense attention has been devoted to rectifying these issues, of which the application of metal&#8208;based compounds (i.e., transition metal, metal phosphides, sulfides, oxides, carbides, nitrides, phosphosulfides, MXenes, hydroxides, and metal&#8208;organic frameworks) as sulfur hosts is profiled as a fascinating strategy to hinder the polysulfide shuttle effect stemming from the polar&#8211;polar interactions between the metal compounds and polysulfides. This review encompasses the fundamental electrochemical principles of Li&#8208;S batteries and insights into the interactions between the metal&#8208;based compounds and the polysulfides, with emphasis on the intimate structure&#8211;activity relationship corroborated with theoretical calculations. Additionally, the integration of conductive carbon&#8208;based materials to ameliorate the existing adsorptive abilities of the metal&#8208;based compound is systematically discussed. Lastly, the challenges and prospects toward the smart design of catalysts for the future development of practical Li&#8208;S batteries are presented.

         <title>Plasmonic Core&#8211;Shell Nanomaterials and their Applications in Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly localized and strong electromagnetic fields generated by plasmonic nanomaterials, when excited by incident lasers with suitable wavelengths, can greatly boost the excitation and/or radiation processes of various spectroscopies, including Raman, fluorescence, or nonlinear spectroscopies, giving enhanced signals and improved spectral sensitivity.








Abstract
Plasmonic core&#8211;shell nanostructures have attracted considerable attention in the scientific community recently due to their highly tunable optical properties. Plasmon&#8208;enhanced spectroscopies are one of the main applications of plasmonic nanomaterials. When excited by an incident laser of suitable wavelength, strong and highly localized electromagnetic (EM) fields are generated around plasmonic nanomaterials, which can significantly boost excitation and/or radiation processes that amplify Raman, fluorescence, or nonlinear signals and improve spectroscopic sensitivity. Herein, recent developments in plasmon&#8208;enhanced spectroscopies utilizing core&#8211;shell nanostructures are reviewed, including shell&#8208;isolated nanoparticle&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS), plasmon&#8208;enhanced fluorescence spectroscopy, and plasmon&#8208;enhanced nonlinear spectroscopy.

         <title>Insights on Flexible Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries from Lab Research to Commercialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An insight from lab research to commercialization for flexible zinc&#8208;ion batteries is provided by comprehensively reviewing the development of polymer electrolytes, relevant challenges and strategies, and device configurations. Aiming to quantify the feasibility for commercialization, a ranking index is proposed combining both electrochemical and mechanical properties. Future research directions are also covered to guide research toward commercialization.








Abstract
Owing to the development of aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), flexible ZIBs are deemed as potential candidates to power wearable electronics. ZIBs with solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes can not only maintain additional load&#8208;bearing properties, but exhibit enhanced electrochemical properties by preventing dendrite formation and inhibiting cathode dissolution. Substantial efforts have been applied to polymer electrolytes by developing solid polymer electrolytes, hydrogel polymer electrolytes, and hybrid polymer electrolytes; however, the research of polymer electrolytes for ZIBs is still immature. Herein, the recent progress in polymer electrolytes is summarized by category for flexible ZIBs, especially hydrogel electrolytes, including their synthesis and characterization. Aiming to provide an insight from lab research to commercialization, the relevant challenges, device configurations, and life cycle analysis are consolidated. As flexible batteries, the majority of polymer electrolytes exploited so far only emphasizes the electrochemical performance but the mechanical behavior and interactions with the electrode materials have hardly been considered. Hence, strategies of combining softness and strength and the integration with electrodes are discussed for flexible ZIBs. A ranking index, combining both electrochemical and mechanical properties, is introduced. Future research directions are also covered to guide research toward the commercialization of flexible ZIBs.

         <title>Nanocatalytic Innate Immunity Activation by Mitochondrial DNA Oxidative Damage for Tumor&#8208;Specific Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tumor&#8208;immunotherapeutic modality based on nanocatalytic innate immunity activation by tumor&#8208;specific mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) oxidative damage is demonstrated, in which a nanocatalytic medicine, named MSN&#8208;Ru2+/Fe2+ nanoparticles, is constructed to target mitochondria for causing oxidative damage to mtDNA, initiating the M1 polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophage to suppress the growth of tumor cells.








Abstract
The innate immune system plays a key role in protecting the human body from tumors, which, unfortunately, is largely counteracted by their immune&#8208;suppression function. Such an immune suppression has been reported to be induced by the immunosuppressive microenvironment, including the exhausted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and tumor&#8208;promoting M2&#8208;polarized macrophages. Here, a novel tumor&#8208;immunotherapeutic modality based on the nanocatalytic innate immunity activation by tumor&#8208;specific mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) oxidative damage is proposed. In detail, a nanocatalytic medicine, Fe2+&#8211;Ru2+&#8208;loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticle named as MSN&#8208;Ru2+/Fe2+ (MRF), is constructed to induce oxidative damage in the mtDNA of tumor cells. Such an oxidative mtDNA is able to escape from the tumor cells and acts as an immunogenic damage&#8208;associated&#8198;molecular&#8198;pattern to M1&#8208;polarize tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), resulting in the reactivated immunoresponse of macrophages against cancer cells, and the subsequent inflammatory response of innate immunity. Most importantly, the treatment strategy based on regulating the innate immune response of TAMs not only stops the primary tumor progression, but also almost completely inhibits the growth of distant tumors in the periods of treatments.

         <title>Ultrathin 2D Copper(I) 1,2,4&#8208;Triazolate Coordination Polymer Nanosheets for Efficient and Selective Gene Silencing and Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin 2D nanosheets of Cu(I) 1,2,4&#8208;triazolate coordination polymer, acting as both stimuli&#8208;responsive nanocarriers of DNAzyme for cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting gene silencing and intrinsic photosensitizers for hypoxia&#8208;tolerant type I photodynamic therapy (PDT), are synthesized by a bottom&#8208;up method. After integrating the DNAzyme with chlorin e6, a type II PDT photosensitizer, the obtained nanoplatform achieves superior therapeutic performance.








Abstract
Gene silencing holds promise for cancer therapeutics because of its potential to inhibit genes involved in tumor development. However, gene silencing is still restricted by its limited efficacy and safety. Nanoscale coordination polymers (CPs) emerge as promising nanocarriers for gene delivery, but their responsiveness and potential therapeutic properties have rarely been explored simultaneously. Here, multifunctional ultrathin 2D nanosheets of Cu(I) 1,2,4&#8208;triazolate CP with a thickness of 4.5 &#177; 0.8 nm are synthesized using a bottom&#8208;up method. These CP nanosheets can act as both an effective DNAzyme nanocarrier for gene therapy and an intrinsic photosensitizer for hypoxia&#8208;tolerant type I photodynamic therapy (PDT), which is ascribed to the Fenton&#8208;like reaction. Because of the glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsiveness of the CP nanosheets, DNAzyme&#8208;loaded CP nanosheets exhibit excellent cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting gene silencing of the early growth response factor&#8208;1 (EGR&#8208;1), with messenger RNA inhibited by 84% in MCF&#8208;7 (human breast cancer cells) and only 6% in MCF&#8208;10A (normal human mammary epithelial cells). After tail intravenous injection into MCF&#8208;7&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice, the CP nanosheets loaded with chlorin&#8208;e6&#8208;modified DNAzyme under photoirradiation show a high antitumor efficacy (88.0% tumor regression), demonstrating a promising therapeutic platform with efficient and selective gene silencing and PDT of cancer.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with External Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 22% via Small&#8208;Molecule Passivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing and mitigating non&#8208;radiative recombination defects in perovskite materials are still crucial prerequisites for achieving high performance in light&#8208;emitting applications. Ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate is introduced in antisolvent to passivate surface and bulk defects during the spinning process, and external quantum efficiency of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes as high as 22.49% is demonstrated.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are considered as particularly attractive candidates for high&#8208;quality lighting and displays, due to possessing the features of wide gamut and real color expression. However, most PeLEDs are made from polycrystalline perovskite films that contain a high concentration of defects, including point and extended imperfections. Reducing and mitigating non&#8208;radiative recombination defects in perovskite materials are still crucial prerequisites for achieving high performance in light&#8208;emitting applications. Here, ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) is introduced as a functional additive dissolved in antisolvent to passivate surface and bulk defects during the spinning process. The ETPTA can effectively decrease the charge trapping states by passivation and/or suppression of defects. Eventually, the perovskite films that are sufficiently passivated by ETPTA make the devices achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.49%. To our knowledge, these are the most efficient green PeLEDs up to now. In addition, a threefold increase in the T50 operational time of the devices was observed, compared to control samples. These findings provide a simple and effective strategy to make highly efficient perovskite polycrystalline films and their optoelectronics devices.

         <title>3D Artificial Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Lithium Metal Anodes Enabled by Insulator&#8211;Metal&#8211;Insulator Layered Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) based on a g&#8208;C3N4 layer, which possesses high structural and compositional homogeneity, is proposed to guide conformal Li deposition in the van der Waals gap between graphene and the g&#8208;C3N4. The design of a 3D artificial SEI enables stable cycling of Li metal anodes and provides potential for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Despite considerable efforts to prevent lithium (Li) dendrite growth, stable cycling of Li metal anodes with various structures remains extremely difficult due to the direct contact of the liquid electrolyte with Li. Rational design of solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) for 3D electrodes is a promising but still challenging strategy for preventing Li dendrite growth and avoiding lithium&#8211;electrolyte side reactions in Li&#8208;metal batteries. Here, a 3D architecture is constructed with g&#8208;C3N4/graphene/g&#8208;C3N4 insulator&#8211;metal&#8211;insulator sandwiched nanosheets to guide uniform Li plating/stripping in the van der Waals gap between the graphene and the g&#8208;C3N4, and the function of which can be regarded as a 3D artificial SEI. Li deposition on the surface of g&#8208;C3N4 is suppressed due to its insulating nature. However, its uniform lithiophilic sites and nanopore channels enable homogeneous lithium plating between the graphene and the g&#8208;C3N4, prohibiting the direct contact of the electrolyte with the Li metal. The use of the g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;layer&#8208;modified 3D anode enables long&#8208;term Li deposition with a high Coulombic efficiency and stable cycling of full cells under high cathode loading, limited Li excess, and lean electrolyte conditions.

     alt="3D Artificial Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Lithium Metal Anodes Enabled by Insulator&#8211;Metal&#8211;Insulator Layered Heterostructures"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 3D artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) based on a g&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; layer, which possesses high structural and compositional homogeneity, is proposed to guide conformal Li deposition in the van der Waals gap between graphene and the g&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The design of a 3D artificial SEI enables stable cycling of Li metal anodes and provides potential for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite considerable efforts to prevent lithium (Li) dendrite growth, stable cycling of Li metal anodes with various structures remains extremely difficult due to the direct contact of the liquid electrolyte with Li. Rational design of solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) for 3D electrodes is a promising but still challenging strategy for preventing Li dendrite growth and avoiding lithium&#8211;electrolyte side reactions in Li&#8208;metal batteries. Here, a 3D architecture is constructed with g&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/graphene/g&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; insulator&#8211;metal&#8211;insulator sandwiched nanosheets to guide uniform Li plating/stripping in the van der Waals gap between the graphene and the g&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and the function of which can be regarded as a 3D artificial SEI. Li deposition on the surface of g&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is suppressed due to its insulating nature. However, its uniform lithiophilic sites and nanopore channels enable homogeneous lithium plating between the graphene and the g&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, prohibiting the direct contact of the electrolyte with the Li metal. The use of the g&#8208;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;layer&#8208;modified 3D anode enables long&#8208;term Li deposition with a high Coulombic efficiency and stable cycling of full cells under high cathode loading, limited Li excess, and lean electrolyte conditions. The concept of a 3D artificial SEI will shed light on developing safe and stable Li&#8208;metal anodes.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Surface decoration of living cells by exogenous substances offers a unique tool for understanding and tuning cell behaviors, which plays a critical role in cell&#8208;based therapy. Here, a facile yet versatile approach for decorating individual living cells with multimodal coatings is reported. By simply co&#8208;depositing with dopamine under a cytocompatible condition, various functional small molecules and polymers can be encoded to form a multifunctional coating on a cell's surface. The accessibility and versatility of this method to decorate diverse cells, including bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells is demonstrated. With the ability to tune surface functions, ligand co&#8208;deposited gut microbiota is prepared as oral therapeutics for targeted treatment of colitis. Given the dual cytoprotective and targeting effects of the coating, decorated cells show more than 30&#8208;times higher bioavailability in the gut and fourfold higher accumulation in the inflamed tissue in comparison with those of uncoated bacteria. Multimodal therapeutic cells further validate strikingly increased treatment efficacy over clinical aminosalicylic acid in colitis mice. Decorating with multifunctional coatings proposes a robust platform for developing multimodal cells for enhanced cell&#8208;based therapy.

         <title>Engineering the Optical Emission and Robustness of Metal&#8208;Halide Layered Perovskites through Ligand Accommodation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organic component in 2D layered perovskites can grant access to many possibilities for material design, in view of the rich variety. This work shows how the choice of the structure and chain length of organic cations can effectively guide the precise design of the emission color and efficiency of such versatile nanomaterials.








Abstract
The unique combination of organic and inorganic layers in 2D layered perovskites offers promise for the design of a variety of materials for mechatronics, flexoelectrics, energy conversion, and lighting. However, the potential tailoring of their properties through the organic building blocks is not yet well understood. Here, different classes of organoammonium molecules are exploited to engineer the optical emission and robustness of a new set of Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper metal&#8208;halide layered perovskites. It is shown that the type of molecule regulates the number of hydrogen bonds that it forms with the edge&#8208;sharing [PbBr6]4&#8208; octahedra layers, leading to strong differences in the material emission and tunability of the color coordinates, from deep&#8208;blue to pure&#8208;white. Also, the emission intensity strongly depends on the length of the molecules, thereby providing an additional parameter to optimize their emission efficiency. The combined experimental and computational study provides a detailed understanding of the impact of lattice distortions, compositional defects, and the anisotropic crystal structure on the emission of such layered materials. It is foreseen that this rational design can be extended to other types of organic linkers, providing a yet unexplored path to tailor the optical and mechanical properties of these materials and to unlock new functionalities.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Dioxide&#8208;Coating&#8208;Instructed Plasmonic Modulation of Gold Nanorods for Activatable Duplex&#8208;Imaging&#8208;Guided NIR&#8208;II Photothermal&#8208;Chemodynamic Therapy</title>

A plasmonic modulation strategy of gold nanorods through manganese dioxide coating is explored for activatable photoacoustic/magnetic resonance duplex&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photothermal&#8208;chemodynamic therapy in the second near&#8208;infrared window.








Abstract
Nanotheranostic agents of gold nanomaterials in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window have attracted significant attention in cancer management, owing to the reduced background signal and deeper penetration depth in tissues. However, it is still challenging to modulate the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of gold nanomaterials from the first near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;I) to NIR&#8208;II region. Herein, a plasmonic modulation strategy of gold nanorods (GNRs) through manganese dioxide coating is developed for NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic/magnetic resonance (MR) duplex&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided NIR&#8208;II photothermal chemodynamic therapy. GNRs are coated with silica dioxide (SiO2) and then covered with magnesium dioxide (MnO2) to obtain the final product of GNR@SiO2@MnO2 (denoted as GSM). The LSPR peak of GNRs could be tuned by adjusting the thickness of the MnO2 layer. Theoretical simulations reveal that this plasmonic modulation is mainly due to the change of refraction index around the GNRs after coating with the MnO2 layer. Additionally, the MnO2 layer is demonstrated to degrade into Mn2+ ions in response to peroxide and acidic protons in the tumor microenvironment, which allows for MR imaging and chemodynamic therapy. This plasmonic modulation strategy can be adapted to other metal nanomaterials and the construction of a new class of NIR&#8208;II nanotheranostics.

         <title>Degradable Poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;Based Supramolecular Plastics with High Mechanical Strength in a Watery Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Completely degradable and easily processable poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based supramolecular plastics are fabricated by complexation of vanillin&#8208;grafted PVA, hydrophobic humic acid, and Fe3+ ions. In watery environments, the plastics have a mechanical strength similar to that of polyethylene in its dry state. The PVA&#8208;based plastics can completely degrade into nontoxic species after being placed under soil for approximately 108 d.








Abstract
It is challenging to fabricate degradable poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based plastics that can be used in watery environments because PVA is soluble in water. In this study, PVA&#8208;based supramolecular plastics with excellent degradability in soil and high mechanical strength in watery environments are fabricated by the complexation of vanillin&#8208;grafted PVA (VPVA), hydrophobic humic acid (HA), and Fe3+ ions (hereafter denoted as VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe complexes). Large&#8208;area PVA&#8208;based plastics can be easily prepared from a solution of VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe complexes using a blade&#8208;coating method. The high&#8208;density of hydrogen bonds and coordination interactions, as well as the reinforcement of self&#8208;assembled Fe3+&#8208;chelated HA nanoparticles, facilitate the fabrication of PVA&#8208;based plastics with a breaking strength of &#8776;85.0&#160;MPa. After immersion in water at room temperature for 7 d, the PVA&#8208;based plastics exhibit a breaking strength of &#8776;26.2&#160;MPa, which is similar to that of polyethylene in its dry state. Furthermore, owing to the reversibility of the hydrogen bonds and coordination interactions, the VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe plastics are recyclable and can be conveniently processed into plastic products with desired shapes. After being placed under soil for &#8776;108 d, the PVA&#8208;based plastics are completely degraded into nontoxic species without requiring manual interference.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is challenging to fabricate degradable poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based plastics that can be used in watery environments because PVA is soluble in water. In this study, PVA&#8208;based supramolecular plastics with excellent degradability in soil and high mechanical strength in watery environments are fabricated by the complexation of vanillin&#8208;grafted PVA (VPVA), hydrophobic humic acid (HA), and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions (hereafter denoted as VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe complexes). Large&#8208;area PVA&#8208;based plastics can be easily prepared from a solution of VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe complexes using a blade&#8208;coating method. The high&#8208;density of hydrogen bonds and coordination interactions, as well as the reinforcement of self&#8208;assembled Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;chelated HA nanoparticles, facilitate the fabrication of PVA&#8208;based plastics with a breaking strength of &#8776;85.0&#160;MPa. After immersion in water at room temperature for 7 d, the PVA&#8208;based plastics exhibit a breaking strength of &#8776;26.2&#160;MPa, which is similar to that of polyethylene in its dry state. Furthermore, owing to the reversibility of the hydrogen bonds and coordination interactions, the VPVA&#8211;HA&#8211;Fe plastics are recyclable and can be conveniently processed into plastic products with desired shapes. After being placed under soil for &#8776;108 d, the PVA&#8208;based plastics are completely degraded into nontoxic species without requiring manual interference.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Water&#8211;Salt Oligomers Enable Supersoluble Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8211;salt oligomers break through the physical solubility limits of aqueous electrolytes, enabling high&#8208;capacity rechargeable batteries based on zinc&#8211;halogen chemistry. The polymer&#8208;like characters of such electrolytes are confirmed by relatively large molecular&#8208;ion peaks and low glass&#8208;transition temperatures. In situ electrochemical technologies reveal a stage&#8208;1 intercalation of bromine into the graphene cathode during charging, accounting for the high capacity of the assembled batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable batteries are highly safe, low&#8208;cost, and environmentally friendly, but restricted by low energy density. One of the most efficient solutions is to improve the concentration of the aqueous electrolytes. However, each salt is limited by its physical solubility, generally below 21&#8211;32&#160;mol&#160;kg&#8722;1 (m). Here, a ZnCl2/ZnBr2/Zn(OAc)2 aqueous electrolyte with a record super&#8208;solubility up to 75 m is reported, which breaks through the physical solubility limit. This is attributed to the formation of acetate&#8208;capped water&#8211;salt oligomers bridged by Br&#8722;/Cl&#8722;&#8208;H and Br&#8722;/Cl&#8722;/O&#8208;Zn2+ interactions. Mass spectrometry indicates that acetate anions containing nonpolarized protons prohibit the overgrowth and precipitation of ionic oligomers. The polymer&#8208;like glass transition temperature of such inorganic electrolytes is found at &#8776;&#8722;70 to &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C, without the observation of peaks for salt&#8208;crystallization and water&#8208;freezing from 40 to &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C. This supersoluble electrolyte enables high&#8208;performance aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries that exhibit a reversible capacity of 605.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, corresponding to an energy density of 908.5&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, with a coulombic efficiency of 98.07%. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman technologies reveal that such high ionic concentrations of the supersoluble electrolyte enable a stage&#8208;1 intercalation of bromine into macroscopically assembled graphene cathode.

         <title>Analysis of External and Internal Disorder to Understand Band&#8208;Like Transport in n&#8208;Type Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular vibrations govern the charge transport in organic semiconductors, which is limited by different sources of disorder. Understanding and mastering the disorder in these materials can drive the design of better semiconductors featuring band&#8208;like transport.








Abstract
Charge transport in organic semiconductors is notoriously extremely sensitive to the presence of disorder, both internal and external (i.e., related to interactions with the dielectric layer), especially for n&#8208;type materials. Internal dynamic disorder stems from large thermal fluctuations both in intermolecular transfer integrals and (molecular) site energies in weakly interacting van der Waals solids and sources transient localization of the charge carriers. The molecular vibrations that drive transient localization typically operate at low&#8208;frequency (&lt;a&#8208;few&#8208;hundred cm&#8722;1), which makes it difficult to assess them experimentally. Hitherto, this has prevented the identification of clear molecular design rules to control and reduce dynamic disorder. In addition, the disorder can also be external, being controlled by the gate insulator dielectric properties. Here a comprehensive study of charge transport in two closely related n&#8208;type molecular organic semiconductors using a combination of temperature&#8208;dependent inelastic neutron scattering and photoelectron spectroscopy corroborated by electrical measurements, theory, and simulations is reported. Unambiguous evidence that ad hoc molecular design enables the electron charge carriers to be freed from both internal and external disorder to ultimately reach band&#8208;like electron transport is provided.

         <title>An Organodiselenide Comediator to Facilitate Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organodiselenide, diphenyl diselenide (DPDSe), is proposed to accelerate the sulfur redox kinetics as a redox comediator, which endows Li&#8211;S batteries with superb rate performance, remarkable cycling stability, and high actual energy density of 301&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. This work demonstrates a novel redox comediation strategy to facilitate the sulfur redox kinetics under practical pouch cell conditions.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are considered as promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density, where soluble lithium polysulfides are crucial in the Li&#8211;S electrochemistry as intrinsic redox mediators. However, the poor mediation capability of the intrinsic polysulfide mediators leads to sluggish redox kinetics, further rendering limited rate performances, low discharge capacity, and rapid capacity decay. Here, an organodiselenide, diphenyl diselenide (DPDSe), is proposed to accelerate the sulfur redox kinetics as a redox comediator. DPDSe spontaneously reacts with lithium polysulfides to generate lithium phenylseleno polysulfides (LiPhSePSs) with improved redox mediation capability. The as&#8208;generated LiPhSePSs afford faster sulfur redox kinetics and increase the deposition dimension of lithium sulfide. Consequently, the DPDSe comediator endows Li&#8211;S batteries with superb rate performance of 817&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 2 C and remarkable cycling stability with limited anode excess. Moreover, Li&#8211;S pouch cells with the DPDSe comediator achieve an actual initial energy density of 301&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and 30 stable cycles. This work demonstrates a novel redox comediation strategy with an effective organodiselenide comediator to facilitate the sulfur redox kinetics under pouch cell conditions and inspires further exploration in mediating Li&#8211;S kinetics for practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Co and Pt Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atoms with Oxygen&#8208;Coordinated Co&#8211;O&#8211;Pt Dimer Sites for Ultrahigh Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum (Pt) single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalyst is verified as a very successful route to approach the size limit of Pt catalysts, while how to further improve the catalytic efficiency of Pt is a fundamental scientific question and is challenging. A route of cobalt (Co) and Pt dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms is reported, which improves the Pt mass activity for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution significantly.








Abstract
The platinum single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalyst is verified as a very successful route to approach the size limit of Pt catalysts, while how to further improve the catalytic efficiency of Pt is a fundamental scientific question and is challenging because the size issue of Pt is approached at the ultimate ceiling as single atoms. Here, a new route for further improving Pt catalytic efficiency by cobalt (Co) and Pt dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms on titanium dioxide (TiO2) surfaces, which contains a fraction of nonbonding oxygen&#8208;coordinated Co&#8211;O&#8211;Pt dimers, is reported. These Co&#8211;Pt dimer sites originate from loading high&#8208;density Pt single&#8208;atoms and Co single&#8208;atoms, with them anchoring randomly on the TiO2 substrate. This dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst yields 13.4% dimer sites and exhibits an ultrahigh and stable photocatalytic activity with a rate of 43.467&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and external quantum efficiency of &#8776;83.4% at 365&#160;nm. This activity far exceeds those of equal amounts of Pt single&#8208;atom and typical Pt clustered catalysts by 1.92 and 1.64 times, respectively. The enhancement mechanism relies on the oxygen&#8208;coordinated Co&#8211;O&#8211;Pt dimer coupling, which can mutually optimize the electronic states of both Pt and Co sites to weaken H* binding.

&lt;p&gt;Platinum (Pt) single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalyst is verified as a very successful route to approach the size limit of Pt catalysts, while how to further improve the catalytic efficiency of Pt is a fundamental scientific question and is challenging. A route of cobalt (Co) and Pt dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms is reported, which improves the Pt mass activity for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution significantly.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platinum single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalyst is verified as a very successful route to approach the size limit of Pt catalysts, while how to further improve the catalytic efficiency of Pt is a fundamental scientific question and is challenging because the size issue of Pt is approached at the ultimate ceiling as single atoms. Here, a new route for further improving Pt catalytic efficiency by cobalt (Co) and Pt dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms on titanium dioxide (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) surfaces, which contains a fraction of nonbonding oxygen&#8208;coordinated Co&#8211;O&#8211;Pt dimers, is reported. These Co&#8211;Pt dimer sites originate from loading high&#8208;density Pt single&#8208;atoms and Co single&#8208;atoms, with them anchoring randomly on the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; substrate. This dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst yields 13.4% dimer sites and exhibits an ultrahigh and stable photocatalytic activity with a rate of 43.467&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and external quantum efficiency of &#8776;83.4% at 365&#160;nm. This activity far exceeds those of equal amounts of Pt single&#8208;atom and typical Pt clustered catalysts by 1.92 and 1.64 times, respectively. The enhancement mechanism relies on the oxygen&#8208;coordinated Co&#8211;O&#8211;Pt dimer coupling, which can mutually optimize the electronic states of both Pt and Co sites to weaken H* binding. Namely, the &#8220;mute&#8221; Co single&#8208;atom is activated by Pt single&#8208;atom and the activity of the Pt atom is further enhanced through the dimer interaction. This strategy of nonbonding interactive dimer sites and the oxygen&#8208;mediated catalytic mechanisms provide emerging rich opportunities for greatly improving the catalytic efficiency and developing novel catalysts with creating new electronic states.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stable and Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution from Seawater Enabled by an Unsaturated Nickel Surface Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unsaturated nickel surface nitride exhibits efficient and stable performance for hydrogen evolution from seawater. The origin of the activity and stability of the unique surface nitride is investigated using in situ Raman spectroscopy. By coupling with hydrazine oxidation at the anode, a flow&#8208;electrolyzer is assembled that can deliver a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 with a small cell voltage of 0.7&#160;V.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic production of hydrogen from seawater provides a route to low&#8208;cost and clean energy conversion. However, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using seawater is greatly hindered by the lack of active and stable catalysts. Herein, an unsaturated nickel surface nitride (Ni&#8208;SN@C) catalyst that is active and stable for the HER in alkaline seawater is prepared. It achieves a low overpotential of 23&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater electrolyte, which is superior to Pt/C. Compared to conventional transition metal nitrides or metal/metal nitride heterostructures, the Ni&#8208;SN@C has no detectable bulk nickel nitride phase. Instead, unsaturated Ni&#63743;N bonding on the surface is present. In situ Raman measurements show that the Ni&#8208;SN@C performs like Pt with the ability to generate hydronium ions in a high&#8208;pH electrolyte. The catalyst operation is then demonstrated in a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer system, coupling with hydrazine oxidation at the anode. Using this system, a cell voltage of only 0.7&#160;V is required to achieve a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Scalable Superior Chemical Sensing Performance of Stretchable Ionotronic Skin via a &#960;&#8208;Hole Receptor Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;attachable chemical sensor showing high sensitivity, selectivity, stability, and even scalability is demonstrated, which is termed an ionotronic gas&#8208;sensing sticker. Ultimately, the proposed strategy is expected to provide new guidelines for sensing channels for next&#8208;generation wearable gas&#8208;sensor platforms.








Abstract
Skin&#8208;attachable gas sensors provide a next&#8208;generation wearable platform for real&#8208;time protection of human health by monitoring environmental and physiological chemicals. However, the creation of skin&#8208;like wearable gas sensors, possessing high sensitivity, selectivity, stability, and scalability (4S) simultaneously, has been a big challenge. Here, an ionotronic gas&#8208;sensing sticker (IGS) is demonstrated, implemented with free&#8208;standing polymer electrolyte (ionic thermoplastic polyurethane, i&#8208;TPU) as a sensing channel and inkjet&#8208;printed stretchable carbon nanotube electrodes, which enables the IGS to exhibit high sensitivity, selectivity, stability (against mechanical stress, humidity, and temperature), and scalable fabrication, simultaneously. The IGS demonstrates reliable sensing capability against nitrogen dioxide molecules under not only harsh mechanical stress (cyclic bending with the radius of curvature of 1 mm and cyclic straining at 50%), but also environmental conditions (thermal aging from &#8722;45 to 125 &#176;C for 1000 cycles and humidity aging for 24 h at 85% relative humidity). Further, through systematic experiments and theoretical calculations, a &#960;&#8208;hole receptor mechanism is proposed, which can effectively elucidate the origin of the high sensitivity (up to parts per billion level) and selectivity of the ionotronic sensing system. Consequently, this work provides a guideline for the design of ionotronic materials for the achievement of high&#8208;performance and skin&#8208;attachable gas&#8208;sensor platforms.

         <title>Efficient Low&#8208;Grade Heat Harvesting Enabled by Tuning the Hydration Entropy in an Electrochemical System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The temperature coefficient is optimized by tuning the hydration entropy during cation intercalation with Prussian blue analogues. A high thermal energy conversion efficiency of 50% Carnot efficiency is obtained in the thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle in the very low temperature range of 10&#8211;50&#160;&#176;C. This demonstrated efficient system paves the way for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting.








Abstract
Harvesting of low&#8208;grade heat (&lt;100&#160;&#176;C) is promising, but its application is hampered by a lack of efficient and low&#8208;cost systems. The thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle (TREC) is a potential alternative system with high energy&#8208;conversion efficiency. Here, the temperature coefficient (&#945;), which is a key factor in a TREC, is studied by tuning the hydration entropy of the electrochemical reaction. The change of &#945; in copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCFe) with intercalation of different monovalent cations (Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) and a larger &#945; value of &#8722;1.004&#160;mV K&#8722;1 being found in the Rb+ system are observed. With a view to practical application, a full cell is constructed for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting. The resultant &#951;e is 4.34% when TREC operates between 10 and 50&#160;&#176;C, which further reaches 6.21% when 50% heat recuperation is considered. This efficiency equals to 50% of the Carnot efficiency, which is thought to be the highest &#951;e reported for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting systems. This study provides a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms governing the TREC, and the demonstrated efficient system paves the way for low&#8208;grade heat harvesting.

         <title>Layered Heterostructure Ionogel Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionogel electrolytes with a layered heterostructure are developed using hexagonal boron nitride nanoplatelets and two imidazolium ionic liquids with different electrochemical stability windows. Compared to ionogels using the individual ionic liquids, the layered heterostructure ionogels provide broadened electrochemical stability windows while maintaining desirable ionic conductivity, suggesting a promising electrolyte strategy for high operating voltages and rate performance in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Ionogel electrolytes based on ionic liquids and gelling matrices offer several advantages for solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries, including nonflammability, wide processing compatibility, and favorable electrochemical and thermal properties. However, the absence of ionic liquids that are concurrently stable at low and high potentials constrains the electrochemical windows of ionogel electrolytes and thus their high&#8208;energy&#8208;density applications.

&lt;p&gt;Ionogel electrolytes with a layered heterostructure are developed using hexagonal boron nitride nanoplatelets and two imidazolium ionic liquids with different electrochemical stability windows. Compared to ionogels using the individual ionic liquids, the layered heterostructure ionogels provide broadened electrochemical stability windows while maintaining desirable ionic conductivity, suggesting a promising electrolyte strategy for high operating voltages and rate performance in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ionogel electrolytes based on ionic liquids and gelling matrices offer several advantages for solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries, including nonflammability, wide processing compatibility, and favorable electrochemical and thermal properties. However, the absence of ionic liquids that are concurrently stable at low and high potentials constrains the electrochemical windows of ionogel electrolytes and thus their high&#8208;energy&#8208;density applications. Here, ionogel electrolytes with a layered heterostructure are introduced, combining high&#8208;potential (anodic stability: &amp;gt;5&#160;V vs Li/Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and low&#8208;potential (cathodic stability: &amp;lt;0&#160;V vs Li/Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) imidazolium ionic liquids in a hexagonal boron nitride nanoplatelet matrix. These layered heterostructure ionogel electrolytes lead to extended electrochemical windows, while preserving high ionic conductivity (&amp;gt;1&#160;mS&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature). Using the layered heterostructure ionogel electrolytes, full&#8208;cell solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries with a nickel manganese cobalt oxide cathode and a graphite anode are demonstrated, exhibiting voltages that are unachievable with either the high&#8208;potential or low&#8208;potential ionic liquid alone. Compared to ionogel electrolytes based on mixed ionic liquids, the layered heterostructure ionogel electrolytes enable higher stability operation of full&#8208;cell lithium&#8208;ion batteries, resulting in significantly enhanced cycling performance.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Nanoformulation&#8208;Mediated Multifunctional Stem Cell Therapy with Improved Beta&#8208;Amyloid Clearance and Neural Regeneration for Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoformulation&#8208;mediated multifunctional stem cell therapy is developed for Alzheimer's disease treatment with improved beta&#8208;amyloid clearance and neural regeneration. With the synergy of neprilysin (NEP) gene&#8208;based beta&#8208;amyloid degradation, nanoformulation&#8208;based neuronal differentiation promotion, and neural stem cells, a single administration of this therapy achieves long&#8208;term efficacy (6&#160;months) with respect to memory reversal and improvement of learning deficits.








Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common dementia that is currently incurable. The existing treatments can only moderately relieve the symptoms of AD&#160;to slow down its progress. How to achieve effective neural regeneration to ameliorate cognitive impairments is a major challenge for current AD&#160;treatment. Here, the therapeutic potential of a nanoformulation&#8208;mediated neural stem cell (NSC) therapy capable of simultaneous A&#946; clearance and neural regeneration is investigated in a murine model. Genetically engineered NSCs capable of stably and continuously expressing neprilysin (NEP) are developed to enhance A&#946;&#160;degradation and NSC survival in the brain. A PBAE&#8208;PLGA&#8208;Ag2S&#8208;RA&#8208;siSOX9 (PPAR&#8208;siSOX9) nanoformulation with high gene/drug deliverability is synthesized to overcome AD microenvironment&#8208;associated adverse effects and to promote neuronal differentiation of the NEP&#8208;expressing NSCs. For achieving accurate stereotactic transplantation, Ag2S quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;based fluorescence imaging is used to guide NSC transplantation in real time. This strategy shows numerous benefits, including efficient and long&#8208;lasting A&#946; degradation, improved neural regeneration, and accurate cell transplantation. It is shown that a single administration of this therapy achieves long&#8208;term efficacy (6&#160;months) with respect to memory reversal and improvement of learning deficits.

         <title>Reducing Energy Disorder of Hole Transport Layer by Charge Transfer Complex for High Performance p&#8211;i&#8211;n Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208;transfer complex strategy to reduce the energy disorder of organic semiconductor (OS) charge transport layers (CTLs) by doping a well&#8208;designed OS (BDT&#8208;Si) with electron&#8208;acceptor features in a commercial hole&#8208;transport material (PTAA) is proposed. As a result, the p&#8211;i&#8211;n planar perovskite solar cells with the optimized hole&#8208;transport layer exhibit the best power conversion efficiency of 21.87%, and good operating stability at maximum power point under continuous illumination.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed organic semiconductor charge&#8208;transport layers (OS&#8208;CTLs) with high mobility, low trap density, and energy level alignment have dominated the important progress in p&#8211;i&#8211;n planar perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs). Unfortunately, their inevitable long chains result in weak molecular stacking, which is likely to generate high energy disorder and deteriorate the charge&#8208;transport ability of OS&#8208;CTLs. Here, a charge&#8208;transfer complex (CTC) strategy to reduce the energy disorder in the OS&#8208;CTLs by doping an organic semiconductor, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(4,8&#8208;bis(5&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl)bis(N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)aniline) (BDT&#8208;Si), in a commercial hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL), poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl) (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA), is proposed. The formation of the CTC makes the PTAA conjugated backbone electron&#8208;deficient, resulting in a quinoidal and stiffer character, which is likely to planarize the PTAA backbone and enhance the ordering of the film in nanoscale. The resultant HTL exhibits a reduced energy disorder, which simultaneously promotes hole transport in the HTL, hole extraction at the interface, energy level alignment, and quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting in the device. As a result, the p&#8211;i&#8211;n planar pero&#8208;SCs with optimized HTL exhibit the best power conversion efficiency of 21.87% with good operating stability. This finding demonstrates that the CTC strategy is an effective way to reduce the energy disorder in HTLs and to improve the performance of planar pero&#8208;SCs.

         <title>Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Growth of Wafer&#8208;Scale 2D Semiconducting MOF Films on Dielectric Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the capillary phenomenon, a face&#8208;to&#8208;face confinement growth method is developed to grow high&#8208;quality wafer&#8208;sacle Cu2(TCPP) (TCPP = meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphine) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) film on dielectric substrates. The film exhibits p&#8208;type semiconducting property and excellent photoelectric response. Meanwhile, this growth strategy can also be used to prepare other wafer&#8208;sacle conductive MOF films.








Abstract
The preparation of large&#8208;area 2D conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films remains highly desirable but challenging. Here, inspired by the capillary phenomenon, a face&#8208;to&#8208;face confinement growth method to grow conductive 2D Cu2(TCPP) (TCPP = meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphine) MOF films on dielectric substrates is developed. Trace amounts of solutions containing low&#8208;concentration Cu2+ and TCPP are pumped cyclically into a micropore interface to produce this growth. The crystal structures are confirmed with various characterization techniques, which include high&#8208;resolution atomic force microscopy and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;TEM). The Cu2(TCPP) MOF film exhibit an electrical conductivity of &#8776;0.007 S cm&#8722;1, which is approximately four orders of magnitude higher than other carboxylic&#8208;acid&#8208;based MOF materials (10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1). Other wafer&#8208;scale conductive MOF films such as M3(HHTP)2 (M = Cu, Co, and Ni; HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;triphenylenehexol) can be produced utilizing this strategy and suggests this method has widescale applicability potential.

         <title>Texture Formation in Polycrystalline Thin Films of All&#8208;Inorganic Lead Halide Perovskite</title>

Polycrystalline all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx perovskite exhibits pervasive texture expressions when solution processed into thin&#8208;film optical devices. Synchrotron&#8208;based large&#8208;area X&#8208;ray scattering techniques provide insights, which connect the final texture formation to the crystal symmetry of the halide perovskite, which can be tuned via halide mixing. Both I&#8208;rich and Br&#8208;rich materials each exhibit two different, energetically favored texture directions.








Abstract
Controlling grain orientations within polycrystalline all&#8208;inorganic halide perovskite solar cells can help increase conversion efficiencies toward their thermodynamic limits; however, the forces governing texture formation are ambiguous. Using synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, mesostructure formation within polycrystalline CsPbI2.85Br0.15 powders as they cool from a high&#8208;temperature cubic perovskite (&#945;&#8208;phase) is reported. Tetragonal distortions (&#946;&#8208;phase) trigger preferential crystallographic alignment within polycrystalline ensembles, a feature that is suggested here to be coordinated across multiple neighboring grains via interfacial forces that select for certain lattice distortions over others. External anisotropy is then imposed on polycrystalline thin films of orthorhombic (&#947;&#8208;phase) CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx perovskite via substrate clamping, revealing two fundamental uniaxial texture formations; i)&#160;I&#8208;rich films possess orthorhombic&#8208;like texture (&lt;100&gt; out&#8208;of&#8208;plane; &lt;010&gt; and &lt;001&gt; in&#8208;plane), while ii) Br&#8208;rich films form tetragonal&#8208;like texture (&lt;110&gt; out&#8208;of&#8208;plane; &lt;110&gt; and &lt;001&gt; in&#8208;plane). In contrast to relatively uninfluential factors like the choice of substrate, film thickness, and annealing temperature, Br incorporation modifies the &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx crystal structure by reducing the orthorhombic lattice distortion (making it more tetragonal&#8208;like) and governs the formation of the different, energetically favored textures within polycrystalline thin films.

         <title>Designing Adaptive Binders for Microenvironment Settings of Silicon Anode Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
For achieving high capacity in the silicon anode of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, an &#8220;adaptive binder&#8221; is reported. The polymeric binder containing plant&#8208;inspired adhesive phenolic moieties&#8212;gallols&#8212;shows initial adaptive properties via reversible hydrogen bonds for setting of silicon microenvironments and further stabilization of SEI layers through irreversible covalent crosslinking of gallols, implementing great electrochemical performance at a rapid charge/discharge rate.








Abstract
This study reports the concept of an &#8220;adaptive binder&#8221; to address the silicon anode challenge in Li&#8208;ion batteries. Binders exhibit adaptable capabilities upon gradual changes in the microenvironments surrounding silicon particles during anodic expansion&#8211;shrinkage cycles. Long, flexible binder chains are repositioned and reoriented upon the gradual formation of Si&#8208;micro&#8208;environments (Si&#8208;&#956;&#8208;env) during the early battery cycles. At this stage, the chemical interactions between the polymeric binders are reversible hydrogen bonds. As the Si&#8208;&#956;&#8208;env become stably set by repeated battery cycles, the chemical interactions exhibit reversible&#8208;to&#8208;irreversible transitions by the formation of covalent linkages between the binder polymers at the later stage of cycles. The binder polymer showing the aforementioned adaptive properties is hyaluronic acid, which has never been explored as a silicon&#8208;anode binder material, onto which the plant&#8208;inspired adhesive phenolic moiety, gallol (1,2,3&#8208;trihydroxybenzene), is conjugated (HA&#8211;GA) for stable adhesion to the surfaces of silicon particles. It is confirmed that the HA&#8211;GA binder can maintain a charge capacity that is approximately 3.3 times higher (1153 mAh g&#8722;1) than that of the nonconjugated HA binder (347 mAh g&#8722;1) after 600 cycles even at a rapid charge/discharge rate of 1 C (3500&#160;mA g&#8722;1), indicating that adaptive properties are an important factor to consider in designing silicon&#8208;anode binders.

         <title>Whole&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Range Oxygen Redox in P2&#8208;Layered Cathode Materials for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>

Na0.7Mg0.2[Fe0.2Mn0.6&#9633;0.2]O2 with native transitional metal (TM) vacancies is designed as a novel cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The TM vacancies lead to nonbonding O 2p orbitals in this material, pointing toward these vacancies triggering reversible whole&#8208;voltage&#8208;range oxygen redox during charge and discharge processes. This work provides new ideals for design of cathode materials in anionic redox chemistry.








Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;redox of layer&#8208;structured metal&#8208;oxide cathodes has drawn great attention as an effective approach to break through the bottleneck of their capacity limit. However, reversible oxygen&#8208;redox can only be obtained in the high&#8208;voltage region (usually over 3.5 V) in current metal&#8208;oxide cathodes. Here, we realize reversible oxygen&#8208;redox in a wide voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V in a P2&#8208;layered Na0.7Mg0.2[Fe0.2Mn0.6&#9633;0.2]O2 cathode material, where intrinsic vacancies are located in transition&#8208;metal (TM) sites and Mg&#8208;ions are located in Na sites. Mg&#8208;ions in the Na layer serve as &#8220;pillars&#8221; to stabilize the layered structure during electrochemical cycling, especially in the high&#8208;voltage region. Intrinsic vacancies in the TM layer create the local configurations of &#8220;&#9633;&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221;, &#8220;Na&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221; and &#8220;Mg&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;&#8221; to trigger oxygen&#8208;redox in the whole voltage range of charge&#8211;discharge. Time&#8208;resolved techniques demonstrate that the P2 phase is well maintained in a wide potential window range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V even at 10 C. It is revealed that charge compensation from Mn&#8208; and O&#8208;ions contributes to the whole voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5 V, while the redox of Fe&#8208;ions only contributes to the high&#8208;voltage region of 3.0&#8211;4.5 V. The orphaned electrons in the nonbonding 2p orbitals of O that point toward TM&#8208;vacancy sites are responsible for reversible oxygen&#8208;redox, and Mg&#8208;ions in Na sites suppress oxygen release effectively.

         <title>Programmable Phototaxis of Metal&#8211;Phenolic Particle Microswimmers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic microswimmers with precise light&#8208;driven velocities are engineered with promise for robotics, drug delivery, and environmental applications. Various cargos with distinct spectral absorption profiles can be loaded into the microswimmers to tune the specific wavelengths of light that lead to motion under ultraviolet, blue, green, and orange light.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven directional motion is common in nature but remains a challenge for synthetic microparticles, particularly regarding collective motion on a macroscopic scale. Successfully engineering microparticles with light&#8208;driven collective motion could lead to breakthroughs in drug delivery, contaminant sensing, environmental remediation, and artificial life. Herein, metal&#8211;phenolic particle microswimmers capable of autonomously sensing and swimming toward an external light source are reported, with the speed regulated by the wavelength and intensity of illumination. These microswimmers can travel macroscopic distances (centimeters) and can remain illuminated for hours without degradation of motility. Experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that motion is generated through chemical transformations of the organic component of the metal&#8211;phenolic complex. Furthermore, cargos with specific spectral absorption profiles can be loaded into the particles and endow the particle microswimmers with activated motion corresponding to these spectral characteristics.

&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic microswimmers with precise light&#8208;driven velocities are engineered with promise for robotics, drug delivery, and environmental applications. Various cargos with distinct spectral absorption profiles can be loaded into the microswimmers to tune the specific wavelengths of light that lead to motion under ultraviolet, blue, green, and orange light.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light&#8208;driven directional motion is common in nature but remains a challenge for synthetic microparticles, particularly regarding collective motion on a macroscopic scale. Successfully engineering microparticles with light&#8208;driven collective motion could lead to breakthroughs in drug delivery, contaminant sensing, environmental remediation, and artificial life. Herein, metal&#8211;phenolic particle microswimmers capable of autonomously sensing and swimming toward an external light source are reported, with the speed regulated by the wavelength and intensity of illumination. These microswimmers can travel macroscopic distances (centimeters) and can remain illuminated for hours without degradation of motility. Experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that motion is generated through chemical transformations of the organic component of the metal&#8211;phenolic complex. Furthermore, cargos with specific spectral absorption profiles can be loaded into the particles and endow the particle microswimmers with activated motion corresponding to these spectral characteristics. The programmable nature of the light navigation, tunable size of the particles, and versatility of cargo loading demonstrate the versatility of these metal&#8211;phenolic particle microswimmers.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Flash&#8208;Induced Robust Cu Electrode on Glass Substrates and Its Application for Thin&#8208;Film &#956;LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flash&#8208;induced robust Cu on a glass substrate for inorganic&#8208;based micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes (&#956;LEDs) is developed by chemical/physical interlocking. The Cu2O layer at Cu/glass interface and Cu nano&#8208;interlocking resolve the inherent lattice mismatch for strong electrode adhesion, resulting in high optical power (41&#160;mW mm&#8211;2) of an AlGaInP vertical thin&#8208;film &#956;LED and robust &#956;LED operation under severe environmental stresses.








Abstract
A robust Cu conductor on a glass substrate for thin&#8208;film &#956;LEDs using the flash&#8208;induced chemical/physical interlocking between Cu and glass is reported. During millisecond light irradiation, CuO nanoparticles (NPs) on the display substrate are transformed into a conductive Cu film by reduction and sintering. At the same time, intensive heating at the boundary of CuO NPs and glass chemically induces the formation of an ultrathin Cu2O interlayer within the Cu/glass interface for strong adhesion. Cu nanointerlocking occurs by transient glass softening and interface fluctuation to increase the contact area. Owing to these flash&#8208;induced interfacial interactions, the flash&#8208;activated Cu electrode exhibits an adhesion energy of 10&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2, which is five times higher than that of vacuum&#8208;deposited Cu. An AlGaInP thin&#8208;film vertical &#956;LED (VLED) forms an electrical interconnection with the flash&#8208;induced Cu electrode via an ACF bonding process, resulting in a high optical power density of 41&#160;mW&#160;mm&#8722;2. The Cu conductor enables reliable VLED operation regardless of harsh thermal stress and moisture infiltration under a high&#8208;temperature storage test, temperature humidity test, and thermal shock test. 50 &#215; 50 VLED arrays transferred onto the flash&#8208;induced robust Cu electrode show high illumination yield and uniform distribution of forward voltage, peak wavelength, and device temperature.

         <title>Growing Living Composites with Ordered Microstructures and Exceptional Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A paradigm is presented to guide living bacteria to grow bionic mineralized composites. The strategy demonstrates a class of living composites with ordered microstructures and exceptional mechanical properties. This research progress highlights an exciting opportunity for future bionic composite materials by tailoring the interaction or communication between living organisms and 3D&#8208;printed synthetic materials.








Abstract
Living creatures are continuous sources of inspiration for designing synthetic materials. However, living creatures are typically different from synthetic materials because the former consist of living cells to support their growth and regeneration. Although natural systems can grow materials with sophisticated microstructures, how to harness living cells to grow materials with predesigned microstructures in engineering systems remains largely elusive. Here, an attempt to exploit living bacteria and 3D&#8208;printed materials to grow bionic mineralized composites with ordered microstructures is reported. The bionic composites exhibit outstanding specific strength and fracture toughness, which are comparable to natural composites, and exceptional energy absorption capability superior to both natural and artificial counterparts. This report opens the door for 3D&#8208;architectured hybrid synthetic&#8211;living materials with living ordered microstructures and exceptional properties.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionogel electrolytes with a layered heterostructure are developed by Mark C. Hersam and co&#8208;workers in article number 2007864, using hexagonal boron nitride nanoplatelets and two imidazolium ionic liquids with different electrochemical stability windows. Compared with ionogels using the individual ionic liquids, the layered heterostructure ionogels provide broadened electrochemical stability windows while maintaining desirable ionic conductivity, suggesting a promising electrolyte strategy for high operating voltages and rate performance in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

Redox co&#8208;mediation provides an effective approach to promote the reaction kinetics of polysulfides in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. In article number 2007298, Jia&#8208;Qi Huang and co&#8208;workers propose an organodiselenide as a redox co&#8208;mediator to accelerate the sulfur redox kinetics. The organodiselenide co&#8208;mediator endows lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with superb electrochemical performance with high actual energy density of 301 Wh kg&#8722;1. This work inspires further exploration in mediating Li&#8211;S kinetics for practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <dc:description>
2D metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films are recognized as a promising candidate for applications in electronics. In article number 2007741, Jianyi Chen, Yunqi Liu, and co&#8208;workers develop a face&#8208;to&#8208;face confinement growth method to obtain high&#8208;quality, conductive Cu2(TCPP) MOF films directly on various dielectric substrates. The strategy is achieved by pumping Cu2+ and TCPP cyclically into a micropore interface to produce this growth.

         <title>Review on Recent Developments in 2D Ferroelectrics: Theories and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D ferroelectrics are expected to play a dominant role in the upcoming nano era as important functional materials. Relevant theories, as well as intrinsic and extrinsic 2D ferroelectrics, are outlined. Further, the existing challenges and prospects of the exploration in 2D ferroelectrics are also discussed, which should provide unprecedented opportunities in the fields of electronics, spintronics, optoelectronics, and valleytronics.








Abstract
Although only a few 2D materials have been predicted to possess ferroelectricity, 2D ferroelectrics are expected to play a dominant role in the upcoming nano era as important functional materials. The ferroelectric properties of 2D ferroelectrics are significantly different than those of traditional bulk ferroelectrics owing to their intrinsic size and surface effects. To date, 2D&#160;ferroelectrics have been reported to exhibit diverse properties ranging from bulk photovoltaic and piezoelectric/pyroelectric effects to the spontaneous valley and spin polarization. These properties are either dependent on ferroelectric polarization or coupled with it for easy electric control, thus making 2D ferroelectrics applicable to multifunctional nanodevices. At present, cumulative efforts are being made to explore 2D ferroelectrics in theories, experiments, and applications. Herein, such theories and methods are briefly introduced. Subsequently, intrinsic and extrinsic origins of 2D&#160;ferroelectricity are separately summarized. In addition, invented or laboratory&#8208;validated 2D ferroelectric&#8208;based applications are listed. Finally, the existing challenges and prospects of 2D ferroelectrics are discussed.

         <title>Surface and Interface Engineering of Nanoarrays toward Advanced Electrodes and Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical overview of surface and interface engineering of 3D nanoarray (3D&#8208;NA) electrodes is provided. The concepts and principles for utilizing 3D&#8208;NAs in purposely designed electrode architectures, charge storage mechanism analysis, and integrated device architecture design are outlined. Future perspectives and solutions to achieve electrode charge balance, multiphase solid&#8208;state interface optimization, and 3D solid electrolyte infiltration are also presented.








Abstract
The overall performance of electrochemical energy storage devices (EESDs) is intrinsically correlated with surfaces and interfaces. As a promising electrode architecture, 3D nanoarrays (3D&#8208;NAs) possess relatively ordered, continuous, and fully exposed active surfaces of individual nanostructures, facilitating mass and electron transport within the electrode and charge transfer across interfaces and providing an ideal platform for engineering. Herein, a critical overview of the surface and interface engineering of 3D&#8208;NAs, from electrode and interface designs to device integration, is presented. The general merits of 3D&#8208;NAs and surface/interface engineering principles of 3D&#8208;NA hybrid electrodes are highlighted. The focus is on the use of 3D&#8208;NAs as a superior platform to regulate the interface nature and unveiling new mechanism/materials without the interference of binders. The engineering and utilization of the surface of 3D&#8208;NAs to develop flexible/solid&#8208;state EESDs with 3D integrated electrode/electrolyte interfaces, or 3D triphase interfaces involving other active species, which are characteristic of (quasi&#8208;)solid&#8208;state electrolyte infiltration into the entire device, are also considered. Finally, the challenges and future directions of surface/interface engineering of 3D&#8208;NAs are outlined. In particular, potential strategies to obtain electrode charge balance, optimize the multiphase solid&#8208;state interface, and attain 3D solid electrolyte infiltration are proposed.

         <title>Fabrication Strategies of Twisted Bilayer Graphenes and Their Unique Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress in fabrication of twisted bilayer graphene by the mainstream methods and the topological physical properties applied in different applications is comprehensively presented. The discovery of killer applications with suitable preparation method for twisted bilayer graphene is systematically discussed by listing the advantages and disadvantages of preparation methods and various applications.








Abstract
Twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) exhibits a host of innovative physical phenomena owing to the formation of moir&#233; superlattice. Especially, the discovery of superconducting behavior has generated new interest in graphene. The growing studies of tBLG mainly focus on its physical properties, while the fabrication of high&#8208;quality tBLG is a prerequisite for achieving the desired properties due to the great dependence on the twist angle and the interfacial contact. Here, the cutting&#8208;edge preparation strategies and challenges of tBLG fabrication are reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of chemical vapor deposition, epitaxial growth on silicon carbide, stacking monolayer graphene, and folding monolayer graphene methods for the fabrication of tBLG are analyzed in detail, providing a reference for further development of preparation methods. Moreover, the characterization methods of twist angle for the tBLG are presented. Then, the unique physicochemical properties and corresponding applications of tBLG, containing correlated insulating and superconducting states, ferromagnetic state, soliton, enhanced optical absorption, tunable bandgap, and lithium intercalation and diffusion, are described. Finally, the opportunities and challenges for fabricating high&#8208;quality and large&#8208;area tBLG are discussed, unique physical properties are displayed, and new applications inferred from its angle&#8208;dependent features are explored, thereby impelling the commercialization of tBLG from laboratory to market.

         <title>In Search of Excellence: Convex versus Concave Noble Metal Nanostructures for Electrocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concave noble metal nanocrystals represent the new class of electrocatalyst materials. In recent decades, extensive works have been employed in the search for excellent catalyst materials for electrocatalysis applications. The surface defects and structural stability are considered responsible for the superiority of concave noble metals compared to their conventional convex counterparts.








Abstract
Controlling the shape of noble metal nanoparticles is a challenging but important task in electrocatalysis. Apart from hollow and nanocage structures, concave noble metal nanoparticles are considered a new class of unconventional electrocatalysts that exhibit superior electrocatalytic properties as compared with those of conventional nanoparticles (including convex and flat ones). Herein, several facile and highly reproducible routes for synthesizing nanostructured concave noble metal materials reported in the literature are discussed, together with their advantages over noble metal nanoparticles with convex shapes. In addition, possible ways of optimizing the synthesis procedure and enhancing the electrocatalytic characteristics of concave metal nanoparticles are suggested. Nanostructured noble metals with concave features are found to show better catalytic activity and stability hence improve their practical applicability in electrocatalysis.

         <title>A Comprehensive Review on Intracellular Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 13, April 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Existing intracellular delivery approaches are differentiated by their impact resolution to macro&#8208; and micro/nanoengineering strategies. Each method is characterized based on whether it employs a carrier&#8208; or membrane&#8208;disruption&#8208;mediated mechanism to load cargo inside the cell of interest. The applications and future perspectives of micro/nanoscale delivery strategies are discussed.








Abstract
Intracellular delivery is considered an indispensable process for various studies, ranging from medical applications (cell&#8208;based therapy) to fundamental (genome&#8208;editing) and industrial (biomanufacture) approaches. Conventional macroscale delivery systems critically suffer from such issues as low cell viability, cytotoxicity, and inconsistent material delivery, which have opened up an interest in the development of more efficient intracellular delivery systems. In line with the advances in microfluidics and nanotechnology, intracellular delivery based on micro&#8208; and nanoengineered platforms has progressed rapidly and held great promises owing to their unique features. These approaches have been advanced to introduce a smorgasbord of diverse cargoes into various cell types with the maximum efficiency and the highest precision. This review differentiates macro&#8208;, micro&#8208;, and nanoengineered approaches for intracellular delivery. The macroengineered delivery platforms are first summarized and then each method is categorized based on whether it employs a carrier&#8208; or membrane&#8208;disruption&#8208;mediated mechanism to load cargoes inside the cells. Second, particular emphasis is placed on the micro&#8208; and nanoengineered advances in the delivery of biomolecules inside the cells. Furthermore, the applications and challenges of the established and emerging delivery approaches are summarized. The topic is concluded by evaluating the future perspective of intracellular delivery toward the micro&#8208; and nanoengineered approaches.
