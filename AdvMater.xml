         <title>Food Nanozymology: Nanozyme Engineering Toward Future Food</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes are rapidly emerging in food research as a next&#8208;generation enzymatic toolkit. By proposing a transdisciplinary paradigm called food nanozymology, this work systematically elucidates its fundamental principles, diverse applications across the food supply chain, and key developmental challenges and future prospects. It establishes a clear theoretical framework to inform and guide future food research in this burgeoning interdisciplinary field.








Abstract
Enzymes have historically served as critical biocatalysts in the food supply chain, yet their industrial applicability remains constrained by intrinsic limitations such as poor stability, low availability, and high production costs. Nanozymes, synthetic nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities, offer a compelling alternative owing to their superior physicochemical properties and tunable functionalities. This review conceptualizes food nanozymology as a new interdisciplinary field that combines enzymological principles with nanotechnology to reimagine catalytic strategies in food systems. It provides a critical overview of current progress across multiple application fronts, including detection, detoxification, preservation, processing, food fortification and nutritional intervention, and resource recovery, etc. By framing food nanozymology as both a conceptual and technological shift, this work highlights its potential to catalyze innovation and improve the sustainability, efficiency, and resilience of the global food supply chain.

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Based Thin Microporous Polymer Films for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution with electropolymerized microporous films enable a direct and scalable process for the production of industrial relevant amounts of hydrogen gas. For developing cost&#8208; and material&#8208;effective devices it is beneficial to increase the accessible outer surface area via microstructuring and stacking of polymeric films instead of using thick polymeric films.








Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is a direct pathway to store solar energy in chemicals. Conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) are porous organic photocatalysts, that are typically applied in powder form in heterogenous catalytic reactions. However, the use of powder photocatalysts in dispersion poses some major challenges when it comes to practical applications in larger scales. In this manuscript, the photocatalytic performance of a carbazole&#8208;based porous organic polymer (C&#8208;POP) film produced by electro polymerizing 1,2,3,5&#8208;Tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;dicyanobenzene (4CzIPN) is investigated, well&#8208;known for its intriguing photocatalytic properties. The thickness of the intrinsic microporous film is tuneable by the amount of cyclic voltammetry cycles but it is shown that the hydrogen production is not dependent on film thickness. It can therefore be concluded that catalysis is mainly occuring on the outer surface of the films, questioning whether high surface areas are always required for efficient photocatalysis. A microstructured film offers the advantage that, with a reduced amount of polymer material, a constant or even increased external surface area of the film can be achieved. The approach presented here is therefore advantageous for achieving high hydrogen production per unit area with minimal amounts of polymer, as very thin layers are already sufficient for high activity.

         <title>Covalent Surface Modification of Hydrophobic Alkoxides on Ti3C2Tx MXene Nanosheets Toward Amphiphilic and Electrically Conductive Inks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically conductive and amphiphilic MXene inks are achieved by surface modification of sodium alkoxides, where surface&#8208;modified MXenes are dispersible both in water and in non&#8208;polar solvents such as toluene. Alkoxide&#8208;functionalized MXenes also show enhanced environmental stability compared to pristine MXene, leading to higher electrical conductivity and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding properties under oxidative conditions.








Abstract
MXenes have garnered significant interest for use in conductive inks, processed either in aqueous solutions or organic solvents following surface modification. However, maintaining their electrical conductivity during dispersion across a broad range of solvents, particularly non&#8208;polar ones, has proven challenging, limiting their potential applications as conductive dispersions. Here, a straightforward method is presented for synthesizing electrically conductive and amphiphilic MXenes via surface modification. Alkoxide groups, such as ethoxide and phenoxide, are covalently attached to Ti3C2Tx MXene surfaces using a nucleophilic substitution mechanism, enabling stable dispersion in both polar and non&#8208;polar solvents. These alkoxide&#8208;functionalized MXenes exhibited an electrical conductivity of up to 2,700 S cm&#8722;1 and dispersibility in non&#8208;polar solvents like toluene, surpassing previous modification approaches. Additionally, they demonstrate enhanced oxidative stability and excellent coating performance on substrates with varied surface energies. The electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding films fabricated with these MXenes exhibited some of the highest performance among surface&#8208;modified MXenes and their composites, achieving shielding efficiency comparable to that of pristine Ti3C2Tx MXene films, while offering significantly improved durability. These findings may contribute to the development of improved processing approaches for MXenes, paving the way for advancements in printable and wearable electronics while addressing key challenges in MXene processing and modification.

         <title>Inhibiting Interfacial Failure in Garnet&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Batteries with High&#8208;Capacity Anodes: Mechanism and Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically examines interfacial failure mechanisms in garnet&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) with high&#8208;capacity anodes (Si, Li). It reveals strain&#8208;induced lithiation limitations at Si/garnet interfaces and grain boundary charge effects on Li dendrite propagation. With the proposal of innovative strategies to suppress interfacial degradation, this work charts a scalable path toward industrial SSBs exceeding 400 Wh kg&#8315;&#185; energy density.








Abstract
Garnet&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with exceptional reductive stability and superior ionic conductivity have emerged as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs). However, critical interface challenges still persist in practical implementations. This review systematically examines interfacial failure mechanisms in garnet SSE systems with high&#8208;capacity anodes (Si, metallic Li) through combined mechanical&#8208;electrochemical perspectives. For Si&#8208;based anodes, a microstructure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationship is established by analyzing strain mismatch&#8208;induced degradation, correlating ionic transport barriers with lithiation kinetics under varying internal microstructures, particle sizes, and external pressures. Multiscale stress&#8208;relief strategies spanning atomic&#8208;level interface engineering to macroscopic pressure optimization are proposed. Regarding Li metal interfaces, breakthrough understandings of grain boundary (GB) charge distribution effects on Li filament propagation are highlighted, along with innovative solutions for kinetic inhibition. Particular emphasis is placed on dry battery electrode (DBE) fabrication techniques as scalable approaches for achieving intimate interfacial contact in industrial&#8208;scale SSB production. By integrating fundamental mechanical&#8208;electrochemical insights with practical engineering considerations, this work quantitatively decouple&#160;the strain&#8208;lithiation interplay at Si/garnet interfaces, the regulation law of GB charge distribution on lithium dendrites and the industrial potential of combining DBE with fluidized bed technology for the first time, charting a viable path toward industrial SSBs with &gt;400&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 energy density.

         <title>Robust and Fast&#8208;Transforming Soft Microrobots Driven by Low Magnetic Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new composite ink is developed by in situ grafting polyacrylamide chains onto magnetizable single&#8208;domain ferromagnetic NdFeB nanostructures for soft microrobots combined with a magnetic field&#8208;assisted 3D printing process. Benefiting from precise control of domain orientation within a single filament, the printed soft microrobots present mechanically robust and fast&#8208;transforming behaviors powered by a low magnetic field.








Abstract
Magnetically driven soft microrobots, characterized by their small size, soft structure, and responsiveness to magnetic fields, offer unique advantages such as high maneuverability, biocompatibility, and remote control, making them suitable for a variety of applications across multiple fields. Achieving low&#8208;power actuation for microrobots is more accessible, safer, and cost&#8208;effective, dependent on the precise quality and arrangement of their magnetic domains. However, traditional approaches integrating multi&#8208;domain magnetic microstructures often introduce trade&#8208;offs between mechanical stability and responsiveness. Here, a magnetic domain assembly method is presented for the fabrication of robust soft microrobots with fast transforming behaviors powered by low magnetic fields (3&#8211;15 mT). By developing a composite ink containing polyacrylamide chains grafted onto magnetizable single&#8208;domain ferromagnetic NdFeB nanostructures, precise control over domain orientation within ultrafine filaments (80&#160;&#181;m) is achieved by magnetic field&#8208;assisted 3D printing process, allowing complex and rapid shape morphing in under 1 s, even with less than 2 wt.% NdFeB. This uniform magnetic alignment results in a tenfold increase in mechanical toughness and impressive stretchability (1600%). With top&#8208;performing actuation performance at low magnetic fields, the microrobots demonstrate multimodal locomotion and robust tasking capabilities, showcasing their transformative potential for next&#8208;generation soft robotics.

         <title>Architected Liquid Crystal Elastomer Lattices with Programmable Energy Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Architected liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) lattices with programmed alignment, stiffness, and enhanced energy absorption are created by direct ink writing. Their energy absorption behavior is measured across strain rates spanning six orders of magnitude (10&#8722;3&#8211;103 s&#8722;1). LCEs exhibit a 18&#8208;fold improvement relative to non&#8208;mesogenic (silicone) lattices at the highest strain rate tested.








Abstract
Architected LCE lattices are fabricated with flow&#8208;induced alignment via direct ink writing and systematically characterized their shape morphing, stiffness, and energy absorption behavior across strain rates spanning six orders of magnitude from 10&#8722;3 to 103 s&#8722;1. It is shown that architected liquid crystal elastomer&#160;(LCE) lattices exhibit superior energy absorption compared to their non&#8208;mesogenic (silicone) counterparts. Importantly, the LCE&#8208;to&#8208;silicone energy absorption ratios are up to 18&#8208;fold higher at the highest strain rate tested. A finite element model that captures their shape&#8208;morphing response is developed, which exhibits excellent agreement with the experimental observations. The work opens new avenues for designing and fabricating LCE lattices with programmable alignment, shape morphing, and mechanics.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Doped IrO2 Enable Pathway Switch to Lattice Oxygen Mechanism with Enhanced Stability for Low Iridium PEM Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
S doping induces lattice expansion, modifies coordination environments, and redistributes charges on Ir sites, introducing non&#8208;bonding oxygen to switch OER from AEM to LOM while ensuring stability, achieving synergistic enhancement of activity/durability, and enabling cost&#8208;effective PEMWE operation.








Abstract
Achieving high activity and stability while minimizing Ir usage poses a significant challenge in the industrialization of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). Herein we report a sulfur&#8208;doping strategy that enables the OER pathway on IrO2 nanoparticles (IrO2/S) to switch from conventional adsorption evolution mechanism (AEM) to lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) while maintaining Ir&#9472;O bond stability, thus achieving a significant enhancement in both intrinsic activity and durability. Advanced spectroscopies and theoretical calculations reveal that the Ir&#9472;S coordination motif within the lattice increases the electron density of the Ir center and enhances Ir&#9472;O covalency, thus triggering the LOM pathway. Importantly, the lattice distortion and unsaturated Ir&#9472;O coordination within the IrO2/S generate the oxygen nonbonding state that acts as an electron sacrificial agent to preserve Ir&#9472;O bonds upon the LOM&#8208;dominated OER process. As a result, PEMWE integrated with such IrO2/S electrocatalyst delivers a low cell voltage (1.769 V at 2.0 A cm&#8722;2) and long&#8208;term stability (16.6 &#181;V h&#8315;&#185; over 1000 h@1.0 A cm&#8315;2) while dramatically reducing Ir usage from 1.0 to 0.3 mg cm&#8722;2. This work establishes S doping as a viable strategy to trigger LOM and stabilize lattice oxygen redox in Ir&#8208;based catalysts, opening a new avenue for low&#8208;Ir PEMWEs.

         <title>A High&#8208;entropy Antiperovskite Nitride Enables Efficient Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conductive and high&#8208;entropy antiperovskite nitride FeZnNNiCoV is developed to present outstanding oxygen evolution performance in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer through eliminating the ohmic loss at high&#8208;current density and triggering efficient lattice oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism. Impressively, the FeZnNNiCoV needs merely 310 mV of overpotential to achieve 1 A cm&#8722;2 and shows ultra&#8208;high stability at 1 A cm&#8722;2 over 1000 h.








Abstract
Despite the availability of many (oxy)hydroxide&#8208;based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with favorable intrinsic activity, few perform well in anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs). Their poor electrical conductivity confines the OER to the boundary between the current collector and electrocatalyst, resulting in poor catalyst utilization. Herein, the use of highly conductive antiperovskite nitride is proposed as a platform to develop robust OER electrodes for AEMWEs with outstanding performance. By growing over nickel foam, high catalyst surface is realized. Under operation conditions, surface reconstruction leads to the formation of a thin layer of metal oxy&#8208;hydroxide, which acts as the real catalyst while protecting the bulk nitride from further corrosion, in turn the conductive antiperovskite effectively improves the catalyst utilization due to efficient current collection. By further rational design of the antiperovskite with a high&#8208;entropy composition capable of selective dissolution of elements, lattice oxygen participation in the OER catalysis is enhanced, resulting in boosted intrinsic activity. Specifically, FeZnNNiCoV shows a 108&#8208;fold increase in OER specific activity compared to low&#8208;entropy ZnNNiCo and ultra&#8208;high stability at 1 A cm&#8722;2 over 1000 h. The corresponding AEMWE requires a potential of only 1.76 V to reach 1 A cm&#8722;2, making it highly promising for practical applications.

Injectable hydrogel (CFe/&#946;CP+Cis), developed by integrating &#946;&#8208;CD&#8208;g&#8208;PEGMA (&#946;CP) molecular brush hydrogel, single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;anchored porous carbon nanozyme (CFe), and cisplatin, combines chemodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, and immunoregulation to synergistically treat tumors, providing a new direction for precise and sustained treatment of tumors.








Abstract
In situ therapies show significant promise for the treatment of unresectable tumors that lack tumor supply vessels. However, it remains a tremendous challenge to achieve precise delivery and sustained release of anti&#8208;tumor agents with synergistic anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. Here, a novel in situ injectable hydrogel (denoted as CFe/&#946;CP+Cis hydrogel) has been designed by integrating &#946;&#8208;CD&#8208;g&#8208;PEGMA (&#946;CP) molecular brush hydrogel with functional carbon nanozyme (CFe) and cisplatin. The reversible gel network of &#946;CP hydrogel and the rigid nanoscale architecture of CFe endow CFe/&#946;CP+Cis hydrogel with properties conducive to injectability and long&#8208;term retention (more than 63 days). CFe and cisplatin mixed in hydrogel are both gradually released into the tumor tissue, facilitating the synergistic anti&#8208;tumor efficacy via ferroptosis and cytotoxicity. In addition, CFe/&#946;CP hydrogel can reduce the M2&#8208;like/M1&#8208;like ratio of macrophages&#160;and promote the infiltration of CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment to enhance anti&#8208;tumor immunity. As a result, the CFe/&#946;CP+Cis hydrogel demonstrates significant potential for precise and sustained tumor treatment through chemodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, immunoregulation, and long&#8208;term retention properties.

         <title>All&#8208;Heat Control of Magnetization Dynamics on Van der Waals Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heat dissipation in nanomagnetic devices mediated by femtosecond laser excitation constitutes one of the pressing challenges toward energy&#8208;efficient information communication technologies. Here it is shown that heat and magnetization play together to determine the ultrafast spin dynamics of van der Waals magnets across any substrates and magnet thickness.








Abstract
Heat dissipation in nanomagnetic devices mediated by femtosecond laser excitation constitutes one of the pressing challenges toward energy&#8208;efficient applications yet to be solved. Of particular interest are heterostructures based on 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnets, which benefit from superior interfacial controllability, mechanical flexibility for smart storage platforms, and open&#8208;source for large&#8208;scale production. However, how heat affects the ultrafast magnetization dynamics in such systems, and/or how the spin dynamics can provide alternative pathways for effective heat dissipation have so far been elusive. Here it is shown that the missing link between magnetization dynamics and heat transport is mediated by the thermal conductivity mismatch between the underneath substrate and the vdW magnet. By modeling the laser&#8208;induced ultrafast spin dynamics of three popular vdW materials (CrI3, CrGeTe3, Fe3GeTe2) of different electronic characteristics across sixteen substrates of distinct chemical composition, it is found that both the demagnetization and remagnetization timescales are very sensitive to the phonon temperature dynamics through the supporting materials, which defines the heating dissipation efficiency at the interface. The process can be further tuned with the thickness of the vdW magnets, where thin (thick) systems result in faster (slower) magnetization dynamics. It is unveiled that the non&#8208;thermal nature of spin dynamics in vdW heterostructures creates interfacial spin accumulation that generates spin&#8208;polarized currents with dominant frequencies ranging from 0.18 to 1.0 GHz accordingly to the layer thickness and substrate. The findings demonstrate that substrate engineering liaised with the choice of magnetic compounds open venues for efficient spin&#8208;heat control, which ultimately determines the optically excited magnetic characteristics of the vdW&#160;layers.

         <title>Surface Fluorination Shielding of Sulfide Solid Electrolytes for Enhanced Electrochemical Stability in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile surface fluorination using XeF2 significantly enhances the electrochemical stability of Li6PS5Cl while preserving 82.8% of its initial Li+ conductivity, which is attributed to the formation of a uniform and ultrathin (&#8776;37.3&#160;nm) fluorinated layer. The underlying fluorination mechanisms are also elucidated. The effectiveness of this strategy is further demonstrated by the outstanding performance of both the LiNi0.90Co0.05Mn0.05O2||(Li&#8208;In) half&#8208;cells and pouch&#8208;type LiNi0.90Co0.05Mn0.05O2||Li full cells.








Abstract
Despite their high Li+ conductivity and deformability, sulfide solid electrolytes suffer from limited electrochemical stability, which prevents all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) from reaching their full performance potential. Herein, a facile surface fluorination strategy is presented for Li6PS5Cl using XeF2 as a solid&#8208;state fluorinating agent, enabling a scalable dry process at moderate temperatures. An &#8776;37.3 nm&#8208;thick uniform fluorinated layer is coated on an Li6PS5Cl surface, preserving 82.8% of the initial Li+ conductivity (from 2.9 &#215; 10&#8315;3 only to 2.4 &#215; 10&#8315;3 S cm&#8315;&#185; at 30 &#176;C). The underlying fluorination mechanism, deduced through systematic investigations using X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray Rietveld refinement, nuclear magnetic resonance, and density functional theory calculations, involves the formation of surface oxidative byproducts and F substitution within the lattice. When applied to LiNi0.90Co0.05Mn0.05O2 electrodes in LiNi0.90Co0.05Mn0.05O2||(Li&#8208;In) half cells at 30 &#176;C, the fluorinated Li6PS5Cl substantially improves the electrochemical performance, delivering superior discharge capacities (e.g., 186.9 vs 173.6&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.33C), capacity retention, and safety characteristics compared to unmodified Li6PS5Cl. This enhancement is attributed to the formation of a robust fluorinated cathode electrolyte interphase that mitigates Li6PS5Cl oxidation. Finally, the stable operation of a pouch&#8208;type LiNi0.90Co0.05Mn0.05O2||Li ASSB is demonstrated, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach.

         <title>AI&#8208;Driven Defect Engineering for Advanced Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents how AI accelerates the design of defect&#8208;tuned thermoelectric materials. By integrating machine learning with high&#8208;throughput data and physics&#8208;informed representations, it enables efficient prediction of thermoelectric performance from complex defect landscapes. It also outlines emerging directions where machine learning may assist inverse design and promote sustainability in next&#8208;generation thermoelectric&#160;materials.








Abstract
Thermoelectric materials offer a promising pathway to directly convert waste heat to electricity. However, achieving high performance remains challenging due to intrinsic trade&#8208;offs between electrical conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity, which are further complicated by the presence of defects. This review explores how artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming thermoelectric materials design. Advanced ML approaches including deep neural networks, graph&#8208;based models, and transformer architectures, integrated with high&#8208;throughput simulations and growing databases, effectively capture structure&#8208;property relationships in a complex multiscale defect space and overcome the &#8220;curse of dimensionality&#8221;. This review discusses AI&#8208;enhanced defect engineering strategies such as composition optimization, entropy and dislocation engineering, and grain boundary design, along with emerging inverse design techniques for generating materials with targeted properties. Finally, it outlines future opportunities in novel physics mechanisms and sustainability, highlighting the critical role of AI in accelerating the discovery of thermoelectric&#160;materials.

The development of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is currently a primary objective in materials science, taking into account the envisioned applications in a variety of fields, including gas and energy storage, sensing, catalysis, and optoelectronics. Recently, the advent of on&#8208;surface covalent synthesis has allowed the design of one&#8208;atom&#8208;thick COFs, although the in situ transformations of such materials at interfaces have remained elusive. In this work, advantage is taken of an ex&#8208;professo synthesized molecular precursor endowed with gem&#8208;dibromide functional groups and a phenanthroline moiety to exploit steric hindrance as a synthetic controlling concept and, by subsequent chemical coupling reactions through thermal activation, afford COF transformations at interfaces in a controlled stepwise manner. In a first step, 1D covalent molecular chains are formed and self&#8208;assembled in a 2D supramolecular network, which, upon annealing, gives rise to a 2D porous organo&#8208;metallic network. Further annealing at higher temperatures affords the formation of a 2D&#8208;COF comprising linear chains based on ethynylene bridges at the cores of the monomers and carbon&#8208;carbon couplings at their peripheries. Such ethynylene linkages are transformed into antiaromatic pentalene moieties upon subsequent annealing, thus exemplifying the conversion of 2D&#8208;COFs at interfaces. These results provide new avenues toward the engineering and in situ chemical transformations of 2D&#8208;COFs in a stepwise manner, anticipating the tailoring of the structure and electronic properties of monolayer 2D&#8208;COFs by thermal stimuli.

         <title>Dielectric&#8208;Free MoS2/VO2 Junction Field&#8208;Effect Transistor with Sensitive and Ultrafast Photoresponse for Light Encrypted Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dielectric&#8208;free MoS2/VO2 junction field&#8208;effect transistor (JFET) that achieves both high sensitivity and rapid photoresponse is presented. By leveraging the built&#8208;in electric field at the van der Waals (vdW) heterojunction modulated by the phase transition of VO2, the JFET demonstrates stable operation over a wide temperature range. Light encoders are successfully developed to realize low&#8208;power encrypted communications.








Abstract
The rise of the Internet of Things and mobile devices has created a pressing demand for advanced on&#8208;chip photodetection platforms. Two&#8208;dimensional materials have emerged as promising photodetector candidates owing to their exceptional optoelectronic properties. However, simultaneously achieving high responsivity, low noise, and quick photoresponse remains challenging for 2D material phototransistors. This study introduces a hybrid MoS2/VO2 junction field&#8208;effect transistor (JFET) designed to address this sensitivity&#8208;speed tradeoff. By leveraging the van der Waals (vdW) interface and adjustable depletion region via the VO2 gate, the JFET achieves a minimal subthreshold swing (80 mVdec&#8722;1) and little gate hysteresis (10 mV). Furthermore, the promoted carrier transport enables a sensitive photoresponse (responsivity: 103 AW&#8722;1, specific detectivity: 1012 Jones) and fast response speed (rise/decay time: 8/10 &#181;s). The device exhibits self&#8208;powered photodetection at elevated temperature, a rare occurrence for phototransistors with ohmic contact, attributed to enhanced built&#8208;in electric field at asymmetric vdW heterojunction. The JFET's effective gate controllability and sensitive photoresponse make it suitable as a low&#8208;power light encoder for encrypted communication. This work provides the foundation for integrated optoelectronic devices based on 2D materials and heterostructures.

         <title>A Biomimetic Copper Silicate&#8208;MOF Hybrid for Highly Stable Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the drosera rotundifolia, a hierarchical hollow CuSiO3&#8208;MOF hybrid is constructed for highly stable Zn metal anode, featuring good structural stability, abundant zincophilic sites, strong desolvation capability, and fast ion migration simultaneously. Thus, the Zn@CuSiO3&#8208;MOF anode displays long&#8208;term cycling lifespans of 1200 and 400 h even under high DODZn of 45% and 90%, outperforming most reported MOF&#8208;modified anodes.








Abstract
To promote the electrochemical performance of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, various artificial interlayers are developed to mitigate dendrite growth and H2O&#8208;induced side reactions of Zn anode. Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) interlayers show much potential in solving these problems, yet their practical usage is inhibited by their inferior structural stability during cycles. Herein, inspired by the biological mechanism and symbiotic architecture of drosera rotundifolia, this challenge is tackled by constructing a hierarchical hollow CuSiO3&#8208;MOF hybrid through in situ MOF conversion. For protecting Zn anode, this biomimetic hybrid offers good structural stability, abundant zincophilic sites, strong desolvation capability, and fast ion migration, which collectively enable highly stable dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping processes and suppress H2O&#8208;related side reactions. Consequently, the Zn@CuSiO3&#8208;MOF symmetric battery achieves an ultralong lifespan exceeding 3500 h with low voltage hysteresis. Remarkably, it maintains stable cycling behaviors of 1200 and 400 h even under high depths of discharge of 45% and 90%, outperforming the most reported MOF&#8208;modified anodes. Moreover, full cells with MnO2 and C@V2O3 cathodes exhibit exceptional cycling performance and rate capability, highlighting the practical applications of Zn@CuSiO3&#8208;MOF anode for grid storage and wearable electronics. This bioinspired strategy provides a feasible approach to constructing stable MOF&#8208;based hybrid for high&#8208;performance Zn anode.

         <title>Minimizing Solvent&#8208;Coordination in Ether Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries under Extreme Operating Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes using modified electrolyte exhibit excellent electrochemical performance under extreme operating conditions, and the stable operation of a high&#8208;capacity Li metal pouch cell of 30 Ah and a high&#8208;energy density Li metal pouch cell of 502.7&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, respectively. The accelerated rate calorimetry results suggest that the modified electrolyte can significantly enhance the safety of lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Ether&#8208;based electrolytes are considered to be one of the most promising systems for high&#8208;performing lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, the poor oxidation stability (&lt;4.5&#160;V) of ether solvents seriously limit their practical applications. Herein, high&#8208;voltage LMBs with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode operated under extreme conditions by minimizing solvent&#8208;coordination in ether electrolytes with fluoroethers, nitrile ethers, and highly fluorinated additives, are demonstrated. It is revealed that ethylene glycol bis(propionitrile) ether (DENE) inhibits the lone&#8208;pair electrons loss on ether oxygen through strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano groups to increase the electrochemical window to &#8805;5&#160;V. Heptafluorobutyric anhydride (HFAA) triggers the formation of solid electrolyte interphase rich&#8208;in LiF&#8208;species, ensuring uniform deposition/stripping and high reversibility of Li+. Especially, DENE and HFAA synergistically minimizes the coordination number of ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DME) and hexafluorophosphate (PF6&#8208;), thereby promoting the desolvation process of Li+ and inhibiting the interfacial side reactions. Therefore, the NCM811 cathodes using modified electrolytes exhibit excellent electrochemical performance at ultrahigh voltage (4.7&#160;V), ultrahigh rate (20 C), and ultrawide temperature range (&#8722;30 to 120&#160;&#176;C), and achieve stable operation in a high&#8208;capacity Li metal pouch cell of 30 Ah and a high&#8208;energy density Li metal pouch cell of 502.7&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, respectively.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough Single&#8208;Network Hydrogels via the Synergy of Defect Elimination and Dual Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of tough hydrogel in single&#8208;network is developed by leveraging nanostructures as crosslinkers and initiators within free radical reactions to optimize the network imperfections, including spatial inhomogeneities and dangling&#8208;chain defects. The integration of dangling chains and dual crosslinking into the network offers substantial enhancements in the fracture toughness and fatigue resistance without compromising its low hysteresis.









Abstract
Network imperfections, such as multi&#8208;dispersed junctions and dangling chains, significantly impair the mechanical performance of hydrogels and elastomers synthesized via free radical reactions (FRRs).

&lt;p&gt;A new class of tough hydrogel in single-network is developed by leveraging nanostructures as crosslinkers and initiators within free radical reactions to optimize the network imperfections, including spatial inhomogeneities and dangling-chain defects. The integration of dangling chains and dual crosslinking into the network offers substantial enhancements in the fracture toughness and fatigue resistance without compromising its low hysteresis.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network imperfections, such as multi-dispersed junctions and dangling chains, significantly impair the mechanical performance of hydrogels and elastomers synthesized via free radical reactions (FRRs). Great efforts have been made to introduce sacrificial structures to enhance toughness but cause pronounced hysteresis, leaving a comprehensive solution elusive. Herein, a class of robust single-network hydrogels with minimal imperfections is reported by employing nano-crosslinkers and nano-initiators to produce monodispersed crosslinking points and eliminate dangling-chain defects, in the formation of dual crosslinking of thiolate-Au bond and chemically covalent bond in the network.

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Green&#8208;Synthesis of High Purity Pinacols and Amides by Continuous Tandem Photocatalysis via a Negative Carbon Emission Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem catalytic system consisting of two continuous&#8208;flow reactors (A and B) is developed to integrate CO2 photoreduction with photo&#8208;oxidative C&#8211;C coupling and photocatalytic carbonylation. In reactor A, immobilized CdS@PCN&#8208;Co enables gram&#8208;scale pinacol production with concurrent CO generation. The evolved CO is directly transferred to reactor B, where Pd/PCN&#8208;Zn catalyzed its selective (98%) conversion to DEET, a commercial pesticide.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction for practical applications confronts significant challenges, including the waste of oxidation power and the difficulty in isolating reduction products. Herein, a pre&#8208;coordination restriction strategy is presented to hierarchically assemble CdS quantum dots (QDs), cobalt sites and Zr6 clusters in one metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), resulting in the CdS@PCN&#8208;Co composite for simultaneous CO2 photoreduction and C&#8211;C coupling. Impressively, the yields of CO and pinacols with CdS@PCN&#8208;Co can reach 59.5 mmol&#183;g&#8315;&#185; (99.4% selectivity) and 56.2 mmol&#183;g&#8315;&#185; (95.3% selectivity), respectively, over six and seven times higher than those with the CdS/PCN&#8208;Co mixture (9.8 mmol&#8226;g&#8315;&#185; CO, 29.4% selectivity; 7.8 mmol&#8226;g&#8315;&#185; pinacols, 22.7% selectivity). The superior catalytic performance of CdS@PCN&#8208;Co can be ascribed to the synergy among encapsulated CdS QDs, Zr6 clusters and PCN&#8208;Co, where photogenerated electrons can efficiently transfer from CdS QDs to Co sites for selective CO generation while the remaining holes can oxidize the adsorbed 1&#8208;phenylethanol over Zr6 surface to facilitate C&#8211;C coupling. More impressively, the released CO can be immediately used for carbonylation photosynthesis by immobilizing CdS@PCN&#8208;Co and Pd/PCN&#8208;Zn in a continuous&#8208;flow system with two reactors, which simultaneously achieves gram&#8208;scale photosynthesis of high&#8208;purity pinacols and amides by continuous tandem photocatalysis.

         <title>Nickel Hydroxide Catalyzed Bias&#8208;free Photoelectrochemical NH3 Production via Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bias&#8208;free photoelectrochemical nitrate reduction reaction with high efficiency and production rate is achieved using a crystalline silicon photocathode with nickel as the catalyst. Performing the PEC NO3RR under alkaline conditions can be self&#8208;activated of the Ni surface by forming Ni(OH)2. This Ni(OH)2 layer can suppress the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and promote NO3RR, significantly enhancing NH3 production efficiency.








Abstract
The photoelectrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (PEC NO3RR) potentially converts nitrate, a major water pollutant, into NH3, which is an eco&#8208;friendly, next&#8208;generation energy source. However, achieving high efficiency in the PEC NO3RR has been challenging because of the need for high applied voltage and competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this study, a PEC NO3RR is successfully implemented that demonstrated a high NH3 production rate of 2468&#160;&#181;g cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 (at &#8722;0.1&#160;V vs RHE) using a c&#8208;Si photocathode with Ni foil as the catalyst. Conducting the PEC NO3RR under alkaline conditions can lead to the self&#8208;activation of the Ni surface with Ni(OH)2. Ni(OH)2 can suppress the competitive HER and facilitate NO3RR, enhancing NH3 production efficiency. Furthermore, a PEC NO3RR system is developed that operates without external voltage and achieved bias&#8208;free record&#8208;high solar to NH3 conversion efficiency of 3.8% and an NH3 production rate of 554&#160;&#181;g cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1.

         <title>Deep Eutectic Solvents Formed by Complex Hydrides: A New Class of Hydrogen&#8208;Rich Liquid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work discovers a new type of deep eutectic solvent composed of ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) and tetrabutylammonium borohydride (TBABH). The new liquids possess a hydrogen content higher than 5 wt%, thus representing promising high&#8208;energy liquid hydrogen carriers. The strong hydrogen bonding between AB and TBABH explains the depletion of the melting point, with the eutectic point sitting at a molar ratio of 1&#8211;2 TBABH&#8208;AB.








Abstract
Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are novel mixtures that exhibit a significant depression in melting points compared to their individual components. This work finds that combining tetrabutylammonium borohydride (TBABH) with ammonia borane (AB) yields new, stable, hydrogen&#8208;rich liquids under ambient conditions, with a glass transition as low as &#8722;50 &#176;C. Liquid mixtures containing up to 6.9 wt% hydrogen can be easily obtained through physical grinding. The strong interaction between the BH4&#8722; anion of TBABH and AB coupled with the vibration dynamics of the alkyl chains accounts for the sharp decrease in melting point. The eutectic point is identified at a TBABH&#8208;AB molar ratio of 1&#8211;2. Increasing the AB ratio further reduces the glass transition temperature but also induces a cold crystallization phenomenon. These mixtures can release hydrogen at temperatures as low as 60 &#176;C, making them promising candidates for hydrogen storage. This represents the first example of a hydride&#8208;based DES, advancing research on complex hydrides and opening the door to the discovery of new hydrogen&#8208;rich liquids for various applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based biohybrid immunomodulator to alleviate intestinal inflammation. The biohybrid immunomodulator is engineered by conjugating resolvin E1&#8208;loaded liposomes with Fas ligand (FasL)&#8208;transfected DCs. The immunomodulator effectively reduces inflammation by selectively eliminating Fas+CD8+ T cells and neutrophils, showing efficient therapeutic potential in both mouse and rabbit models of IBD. This study presents a feasible and customizable strategy for mitigating intestinal inflammation, offering a promising advancement in the treatment of IBD.








Abstract
Inflammation is a key driver of intestinal inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While biologics have demonstrated notable success in treating some patients, there remains a critical need for alternative therapeutic strategies to address primary and secondary non&#8208;responders. In this study, a dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based biohybrid immunomodulator is developed to alleviate intestinal inflammation, demonstrating remarkable efficacy in combating IBD. This biohybrid immunomodulator is engineered by conjugating resolvin E1&#8208;loaded liposomes with Fas ligand (FasL)&#8208;transfected DCs. Elevated Fas expression is observed in intestinal tissue samples from IBD patients, and the immunomodulator effectively reduced inflammation by selectively eliminating Fas+CD8+ T cells and neutrophils. The therapeutic potential of this approach is validated in both mouse and rabbit models of IBD, where it exhibites significant anti&#8208;inflammatory effects. Furthermore, the immunomodulator can be manufactured using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bone marrow&#8208;derived DCs, demonstrating a robust capacity to induce T cell apoptosis. This study presents a feasible and customizable strategy for mitigating intestinal inflammation, offering a promising advancement in the treatment of IBD.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is a key driver of intestinal inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While biologics have demonstrated notable success in treating some patients, there remains a critical need for alternative therapeutic strategies to address primary and secondary non-responders. In this study, a dendritic cell (DC)-based biohybrid immunomodulator is developed to alleviate intestinal inflammation, demonstrating remarkable efficacy in combating IBD. This biohybrid immunomodulator is engineered by conjugating resolvin E1-loaded liposomes with Fas ligand (FasL)-transfected DCs. Elevated Fas expression is observed in intestinal tissue samples from IBD patients, and the immunomodulator effectively reduced inflammation by selectively eliminating Fas&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and neutrophils. The therapeutic potential of this approach is validated in both mouse and rabbit models of IBD, where it exhibites significant anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, the immunomodulator can be manufactured using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bone marrow-derived DCs, demonstrating a robust capacity to induce T cell apoptosis. This study presents a feasible and customizable strategy for mitigating intestinal inflammation, offering a promising advancement in the treatment of IBD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>All&#8208;Polymer Polyethylene&#8208;Hydrogel Felt for Efficient Evaporative Cooling and Ecological Restoration in Photovoltaic Power Plants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an all&#8208;polymer polyethylene&#8208;hydrogel felt formed by fibers with highly oriented polyethylene micro&#8208;fiber cores and polyacrylamide shells. The felt demonstrates a passive heat transfer coefficient as high as 1100 W m&#8722;2 K&#8722;1 for evaporative cooling of photovoltaic cells and shows an ability to reduce ambient temperature and increase humidity for ecological restoration.








Abstract
With the explosive growth of photovoltaic (PV) power station, the energy efficiency and ecological impact of which have emerged as two important points of great concern. In this work, an approach is proposed to cool solar panels and facilitate ecological restoration by engineering moisture cycle in PV plants with an all&#8208;polymer hydroscopic felt. Formed by fibers with highly oriented polyethylene (PE) micro&#8208;fiber cores and polyacrylamide (PAAm) shells of a few microns in thickness, the felt is ultra&#8208;light, anti&#8208;corrosive, and demonstrates a high passive heat transfer coefficient of 1100&#160;W m&#8722;2 K&#8722;1. Under the solar light of one sun, the felt reduces the temperature of solar cells by 28&#160;&#176;C, and increases the output power by 20.4%. Moreover, the felt regenerates to the original state in only 1.3 times the evaporation time. In addition, due to the high evaporation and moisture absorption rate, the PE/hydrogel felt exhibits the ability to raise the ambient humidity in photovoltaic plants by 24% and lower the ambient temperature by 2.6&#160;&#176;C, which significantly promotes the survival rate of surrounding flora. These results show the ability of the all&#8208;polymer hydroscopic felt in promoting energy efficiency of PV conversion and offers the potential to augment ecological restoration using PV plants.

Abstract
To advance the development of an electrochromic (EC) smart glass, a &#960;&#8208;extended viologen&#8208;based lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal (&#960;V&#8208;LCLC) reactive mesogen (RM) is newly designed and successfully synthesized in this study. By extending the &#960;&#8208;conjugation length of viologen, the &#960;V&#8208;LCLC RM forms a stable LCLC phase at room temperature and retains its chemical integrity during the EC reactions, exhibiting reversible transitions across three redox states: dication (D), cation&#8208;radical (C), and neutral (N). A uniaxially oriented nanostructure is constructed on the macroscopic scale through shear&#8208;coating and molecular self&#8208;assembly. Subsequent photopolymerization of the uniaxially oriented &#960;V&#8208;LCLC film significantly enhances its mechanical and chemical stability while enabling polarization&#8208;dependent transmittance and distinct color transitions. This newly developed &#960;V&#8208;LCLC RM facilitates the fabrication of energy&#8208;efficient EC optical devices with tunable transmittance and multicolor modulation, and it is operable at a low voltage of 2.5 V.

         <title>Hierarchical MoS2/Poly(ionic liquid) Metamaterials for Electrically Tunable Terahertz Stealth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ToC figure illustrates a terahertz stealth metamaterial with hierarchical ionotronic architecture, where large&#8208;area MoS2 assemblies conformally integrated with poly(ionic liquid) microarrays. It highlights wave&#8208;electron&#8208;ion interactions, enabling high electrical tunability and dynamic absorption modulation within terahertz atmospheric windows. This advanced material holds significant potential for enhancing the survivability and active countermeasure capabilities of military equipment against terahertz radar detections.








Abstract
Active absorption modulation is critical for advanced stealth technologies, especially given the emerging detection threat from terahertz atmospheric windows. However, due to the difficulty in balancing high absorption and tunability, the actual manufacturing of most terahertz absorbers usually neglects the integration of electrical tuning, which limits their development of dynamic wave trapping for electronic countermeasure systems. Here, a terahertz stealth metamaterial (TSM) with hierarchical ionotronic architecture is proposed to overcome the tradeoff. Large&#8208;area continuous MoS2 assemblies tightly attached poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) microarrays provide enough conditions for surface electron conduction and plasmon mode excitation. By establishing wave&#8208;electron&#8208;ion interaction pathways, the directional migration of free anions inside the PIL and the accumulation of excess charge carriers up to 100.4% at the MoS2 interfaces are promoted, thereby stimulating changes in the plasma frequency of the absorption system. Consequently, this micro&#8208;nano structural design enhances the absorption tunability and combines multiple dissipative behaviors. TSM exhibit high specific attenuation (&#8722;275&#160;dB&#160;mm&#8722;1), frequency agility (21.4%), and phase switching (153.1&#160;deg.) within terahertz atmospheric windows. Moreover, the template&#8208;assisted assembly strategy adopted has the potential to be used for the building of universal blocks operating within other frequency ranges.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Fabrication of Robust Physical Hydrogels via Bulk Copolymerization for Underwater Acoustics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent&#8208;free bulk copolymerization results in hydrophobically associated hydrogels exhibiting markedly different network structures and mechanical properties compared to those prepared via solution or micellar copolymerization. The synergistic effects of dense chain entanglements and pronounced phase separation lead to exceptional mechanical robustness and emergent viscoelasticity, enabling potential applications in underwater acoustic absorption.








Abstract
Conventional hydrogel preparation typically involves the use of solvents (mostly water), which increases the free volume between polymer chains and weakens their interactions, resulting in mechanically weak hydrogels with limited viscoelasticity. Here, a solvent&#8208;free synthesis strategy is presented to produce tough, swelling&#8208;resistant physical hydrogels with ultra&#8208;wide frequency viscoelasticity (loss factor tan&#948; &gt; 0.3 at 10&#8722;10&#8211;105&#160;Hz). This is achieved through the bulk copolymerization of highly miscible hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers, forming water&#8208;free copolymers that develop into phase&#8208;separated hydrogels with dense chain entanglements upon equilibration in water. The resulting hydrogel exhibits significant mechanical enhancements over counterparts prepared through classical micellar copolymerization, with stiffness, strength, and fracture toughness increased by up to 81, 46, and 41 times, respectively. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, the tough hydrogel with excellent swelling resistance is applied as a sound&#8208;absorbing coating for underwater vehicles, minimizing acoustic interference during marine research through its strong viscoelasticity and near&#8208;perfect acoustic impedance matching with water. Unlike conventional solvent&#8208;assisted polymerization methods used for hydrogel preparation, bulk copolymerization offers advantages such as ultra&#8208;high monomer concentration, pure products, and straightforward process, providing new insights for developing simple yet tough hydrogels that are not only promising for underwater applications but also conducive to theoretical studies.

     alt="Solvent-Free Fabrication of Robust Physical Hydrogels via Bulk Copolymerization for Underwater Acoustics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solvent-free bulk copolymerization results in hydrophobically associated hydrogels exhibiting markedly different network structures and mechanical properties compared to those prepared via solution or micellar copolymerization. The synergistic effects of dense chain entanglements and pronounced phase separation lead to exceptional mechanical robustness and emergent viscoelasticity, enabling potential applications in underwater acoustic absorption.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional hydrogel preparation typically involves the use of solvents (mostly water), which increases the free volume between polymer chains and weakens their interactions, resulting in mechanically weak hydrogels with limited viscoelasticity. Here, a solvent-free synthesis strategy is presented to produce tough, swelling-resistant physical hydrogels with ultra-wide frequency viscoelasticity (loss factor tan&lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.3 at 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;10&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;Hz). This is achieved through the bulk copolymerization of highly miscible hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers, forming water-free copolymers that develop into phase-separated hydrogels with dense chain entanglements upon equilibration in water. The resulting hydrogel exhibits significant mechanical enhancements over counterparts prepared through classical micellar copolymerization, with stiffness, strength, and fracture toughness increased by up to 81, 46, and 41 times, respectively. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, the tough hydrogel with excellent swelling resistance is applied as a sound-absorbing coating for underwater vehicles, minimizing acoustic interference during marine research through its strong viscoelasticity and near-perfect acoustic impedance matching with water. Unlike conventional solvent-assisted polymerization methods used for hydrogel preparation, bulk copolymerization offers advantages such as ultra-high monomer concentration, pure products, and straightforward process, providing new insights for developing simple yet tough hydrogels that are not only promising for underwater applications but also conducive to theoretical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cuproptosis to Cuproptosis&#8208;Like: Therapeutic Strategies for Bacterial Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review reflects on the similarities and differences between cuproptosis and cuproptosis&#8208;like death. Therapeutic strategies using cuproptosis&#8208;like death are highlighted, including multi&#8208;modal combination approaches integrating nanozyme&#8208;based chemodynamic therapy, phototherapy, gas therapy and immunomodulation against bacterial infectious diseases. Thus, understanding the mechanism of cuproptosis&#8208;like death and developing therapeutic strategies based on this process could contribute to progress in antibacterial treatment.








Abstract
Bacterial infections have become a serious public health concern worldwide, and the irrational use of antibiotics has led to the proliferation of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria, undermining the effectiveness of traditional antibacterial therapies. Cuproptosis is a copper&#8208;dependent cell death pathway that has recently been identified as a promising target for drug development and treating bacterial infections. Although bacteria differ from eukaryotes, as they lack mitochondria in their cells, they can still be affected by copper&#8208;mediated lethality by binding to lipoylated proteins and leading to abnormal protein aggregation and loss of iron&#8210;sulfur cluster proteins. This review reflects on the similarities and differences between cuproptosis and cuproptosis&#8208;like death. In addition, we highlight therapeutic strategies using cuproptosis&#8208;like death, including multi&#8208;modal combination approaches integrating nanozyme&#8208;based chemodynamic therapy, phototherapy, gas therapy and immunomodulation against bacterial infectious diseases. Thus, understanding the mechanism of cuproptosis&#8208;like death and developing therapeutic strategies based on this process could contribute to progress in antibacterial treatment.

         <title>Scalable Low&#8208;Carbon Ambient&#8208;Dried Foam&#8208;Like Aerogels for Radiative Cooling with Extreme Environmental Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable low&#8208;carbon ambient&#8208;dried foam&#8208;like aerogel with integrated radiative cooling and fire/harsh&#8208;conditions resistance is fabricated via green ambient&#8208;drying process without complex freezing and hazardous solvent exchange, which overcomes critical scalable green fabrication and durability challenges in cooling aerogels, providing new insights to maximize the efficiency in striving against global warming.









Abstract
Aerogels have emerged as promising passive radiant cooling materials, offering a sustainable solution to mitigate global warming. However, the energy&#8208; and resource&#8208;intensive fabrication processes and insufficient environmental durability of current aerogels pose significant challenges for industrial scalability and long&#8208;term energy&#8208;saving applications. Here, a scalable low&#8208;carbon ambient&#8208;dried foam&#8208;like aerogel (GMSx) with integrated radiative cooling and fire/harsh&#8208;conditions resistance is reported. Thermoresponsive physicochemical interactions among gellan gum, melamine&#8208;formaldehyde resin, and fumed silica facilitate the transformation of scalable emulsion&#8208;templated hydrogels into structurally ordered GMSx via a green ambient&#8208;drying process without complex freezing and solvent exchange. The foam&#8208;like aerogel exhibits high porosity (96.2%) and record specific modulus (323 m2/s2). Optimized optical properties with 93% solar reflectance and 94% infrared emissivity yield subambient cooling of 4.8 &#176;C. Crucially, the robust crosslinked networks impart remarkable durability under extreme conditions, including exposure to hot water, strong acids/alkalis (pH 1&#8211;13), various chemicals, and 1300 &#176;C flame. Furthermore, GMSx can be customized into various shapes via extrusion or spraying techniques and applied as protective coatings using scalable brushing or dipping methods, accommodating diverse substrate geometries. This work overcomes critical scalable green fabrication and durability challenges in passive cooling aerogels, demonstrating practical potential for energy&#8208;efficient thermal management in harsh environments.

         <title>Chemical Exchange Between Silica Networks and Liquid Metals for All&#8208;Inorganic, Sintering&#8208;Free and Highly Conductive Inks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the unique chemical exchange between silica hydroxyl groups and liquid metal (LM) surfaces, this work reports a whole&#8208;inorganic LM&#8208;silica gel ink (LMSG) with high electrical conductivity, excellent thermal stability, high&#160;flexibility, and surface compatibility. Highly flexible and complicated integrated circuits are successfully fabricated by the LMSG inks. 








Abstract
Electrically conductive inks with noble metals (e.g. silver particles) and inorganic carriers (e.g. glass powder) are broadly applied in the electronics&#160;industry. However, such inorganic inks are generally not compatible with highly flexible electronics due to the inherent rigidity and poor surface compatibility. Based on the unique chemical exchange between silica hydroxyl groups and liquid metal surfaces, this work reports a wholeinorganic LM&#8211;silica gel ink (LMSG) with high electrical conductivity, excellent thermal stability, high flexibility, and surface compatibility. The conductive percolation threshold of the LMSG inks is only 43 wt.%, which is the lowest among reported LM composites so far. Interestingly, inorganic LMSG inks do not require any sintering procedure for conductive paths, removing serious constraints over traditional LM inks. In addition, LMSG inks can be prepared in bulk as powders for long&#8208;term storage (&gt;1 year) by simple dehydration, and more importantly, the dehydrated powders can conveniently regenerate LMSG inks via re&#8208;dissolution. The circuits fabricated from LMSG inks show much improved thermal stability (&gt;300&#160;&#176;C) compared with conventional LM inks (&lt;100&#160;&#176;C). LMSG ink exhibits wide surface compatibility with plastics, wood, skin, etc. Highly flexible and complicated integrated circuits with microcontroller units (MCUs) can be successfully fabricated.

         <title>Achieving Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Power Output in Triboelectric Energy Harvesters by Torrent&#8208;Like Charge Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a torrent&#8208;like charge regulation (TCR) strategy that simultaneously enhances charge transport rate and the total amount of charges by combining transistor&#8208;inspired switching architecture and bio&#8208;inspired vascular system. Compared to traditional energy harvesters, the TCR&#8208;based energy harvester increases the energy density by 100 times, achieving a volumetric peak power density over 10 MW&#160;m&#8722;3.








Abstract
The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy harvesters that harness environmental kinetic energy toward realizing battery&#8208;free Internet of Things (IoT) applications are susceptible to low power density owing to low charge density and high output impedance. Here, a new charge regulation strategy is introduced that simultaneously enhances charge transport rate and the total amount of charges, allowing for achieving a volumetric peak power density exceeding 10 MW&#160;m&#8722;3. It is demonstrated that such an enhanced performance results from the synergistic cooperation between a transistor&#8208;inspired switching architecture that accelerates charge transfer rate whereas minimizing internal impedance and a bio&#8208;inspired charge vascular system that enhances the amount of generated charge, together contributing to a torrent&#8208;like charge regulation (TCR). The unique TCR strategy as well as the induced high power output endows a fully battery&#8208;free wireless sensing and communication platform, highlighting its potential to enable sustainable, distributed battery&#8208;free IoT networks in real&#8208;world applications.

Photomagnetic nanoactuators with &#8776;90% scattering efficiency in the second near&#8208;infrared window are demonstrated to exhibit magnetic field&#8208;controlled modulation of optical scattering and optical coherence tomography signals. These nanoactuators are reversibly assembled and disassembled under the external magnetic field modulation, enabling enhanced particle&#8208;associated signal detection with suppressed background signal both in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high&#8208;resolution imaging modality that detects scattered optical signals from light&#8211;tissue interaction. However, the ability of OCT to visualize specific molecular and cellular events is hindered by the lack of effective exogenous contrast agents capable of producing noticeable imaging contrast. Here, photomagnetic nanoactuators with &#8776;90% scattering efficiency in the second near&#8208;infrared window, capable of reversible magnetic field&#8208;mediated modulation of optical scattering and, therefore, OCT signal, are proposed. These nanoactuators consist of a magnetite core and gold shell, functioning as a reversible magnetic actuator and an optical scatterer, respectively. When exposed to the external magnetic field, photomagnetic nanoactuators are assembled into chain structures via magnetostatic interactions between nearby nanoactuators, reducing their optical scattering and, consequently, the OCT signal. Upon removal of the magnetic field, the nanoactuators are disassembled, restoring their scattering property and OCT signal. It is demonstrated that this magnetically controlled OCT response allows enhanced particle&#8208;associated signal detection with suppressed background signal via image subtraction before and after magnetic field treatment, both in vitro and in vivo. The developed nanoactuator platform offers a strategy for dynamic enhancement of OCT contrast, potentially broadening the utility of OCT for noninvasive cell tracking and molecular diagnostic imaging.

         <title>Response to Comment on &#8220;Non&#8208;Polaritonic Effects in Cavity&#8208;Modified Photochemistry&#8221;: On the Importance of Experimental Details</title>

Abstract
This note responds to Schwartz and Hutchison's Comment. Differences appear to have arisen not in the experimental results themselves but in their interpretation: more extensive experiments allow one to distinguish between &#8220;true positive&#8221; and &#8220;false positive&#8221; results. Potential evidence of non&#8208;polaritonic effects in Schwartz and Hutchison's own work is identified. It is hoped that this work will encourage others to produce more systematic investigations of strong coupling.

A recent article by Barnes and co&#8208;workers reported an experimental re&#8208;evaluation of earlier work on photoisomerization reactions inside optical cavities under conditions of strong light&#8208;matter coupling. They correctly highlight the importance of controlling irradiation conditions from sample to sample where optical cavities are involved. This comment aims to emphasize the great lengths the original study went to ensure exactly this.








Abstract
Recently, an article by Barnes and co&#8208;workers reported an in&#8208;depth experimental re&#8208;evaluation of the earlier work on photoisomerization reactions inside optical cavities under conditions of strong light&#8208;matter coupling. That earlier work, which constituted the first demonstration of &#8216;polaritonic chemistry&#8217;, associated cavity&#8208;induced modifications of photoisomerization rates with the emergence of strong light&#8208;matter coupling (and the formation of polaritonic states). Barnes and co&#8208;workers instead found that cavity&#8208;induced changes in light absorption can account for changes in the photochemical reaction rates. While Barnes and co&#8208;workers correctly highlight the importance of controlling irradiation conditions from sample to sample where optical cavities are involved, this comment aims to emphasize the great length the original study went to ensure exactly this. The original experimental methods are summarized to point out the significant differences between them and those conducted by Barnes and co&#8208;workers. Furthermore, the importance of monochromatic photoexcitation at an isosbestic point rather than using broadband (UV through to IR) irradiation, as well as the careful control for photon flux reaching the molecular layer in all samples, as per the original work, is discussed. Further examination of important issues facing this new and developing domain of Physical Chemistry, is&#160;anticipated.

Direct Observation of Unidirectional Exciton Polaritons
In article number 2501669, Guangwei Hu, Qing Zhang, Yuanjie Yang, and co&#8208;workers report direct nano&#8208;imaging of spin&#8208;orbital coupling induced unidirectional exciton&#8208;polaritons in van der Waals semiconductors. Via shining spin photons into the tip of a scattering&#8208;type SNOM, the exciton&#8208;polaritons can be transported to one preferred spin&#8208;controlled direction and mapped, promising optical switching, nanoscale light manipulation, polaritonic circuits, and other nanotechnologies.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202501669"&gt;2501669&lt;/a&gt;, Guangwei Hu, Qing Zhang, Yuanjie Yang, and co-workers report direct nano-imaging of spin-orbital coupling induced unidirectional exciton-polaritons in van der Waals semiconductors. Via shining spin photons into the tip of a scattering-type SNOM, the exciton-polaritons can be transported to one preferred spin-controlled direction and mapped, promising optical switching, nanoscale light manipulation, polaritonic circuits, and other nanotechnologies.

Glycated ECM Derived Carbon Dots
The Glycated ECM, once fertile soil for the tumor &#8220;tree&#8221;, becomes tumor&#8208;suppressing carbon dots, causing the tree to wither and the ecosystem to collapse. This transformation mirrors the impermanence in Buddhist &#8220;Four Signs of Decay and Growth,&#8221; where decay births healing. In this pathological microenvironment, destruction can be restructured into healing, where science and philosophy converge.

         <title>Micro&#8208; and Nano&#8208;Bots for Infection Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a strategic vision for integrating micro&#8208; and nanobots in the pipeline for infection diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. To develop these robots as a practical solution for infection management, their design principles are clarified based on their propulsion mechanisms and then categorized infection management domains based on usage scenarios.








Abstract
Medical micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;bots (MMBs and MNBs) have attracted a lot of attention owing to their precise motion for accessing difficult&#8208;to&#8208;reach areas in the body. These emerging tools offer the promise of non&#8208;invasive diagnostics and therapeutics for a wide range of ailments. Here, it is highlighted how MMBs and MNBs can revolutionize infection management. The latest applications of MMBs and MNBs are explored for infection prevention, including their use as accurate, minimally invasive surgeons&#160;and diagnosis, where they function as sensitive and rapid biosensors or carriers for contrast agents for real&#8208;time imaging of infected tissue. Further, the&#160;applications are outlined in treatment serving as anti&#8208;biofilm agents and smart carriers for antibiotics and anti&#8208;infective biologics. The current challenges in designing MMBs and MNBs are highlighted for overcoming immune barriers, moving to deep infected tissue, and swimming in low Reynolds numbers and discuss mitigating strategies. Finally, as a future perspective, the potential advantages of multi&#8208;drive propulsion, bioinspired, and artificial&#8208;intelligence&#8208;trained MMBs and MNBs are discussed, with a special focus on challenges and opportunities for their commercialization.

         <title>Multiple Functional Engineering Strategies and Active Site Identification in Ru&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Catalytic Conversion Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive analysis of engineering modification strategies for ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based catalysts, highlighting their critical role in optimizing electronic structures and surface properties to enhance electrocatalytic conversion. Furthermore, it emphasizes the integration of multiple engineering strategies aimed at improving catalytic performance, while also addressing key commercialization challenges.








Abstract
Electrochemical conversion has been regarded as an ideal technology for achieving clean and sustainable energy, showing significant promise in addressing the increasingly serious energy crisis and environmental pollution. Ru&#8208;containing electrocatalysts (RUCE) outperform other precious metals due to elevated intrinsic activity and superior cost&#8208;effectiveness, developing into a promising candidate for electrochemical conversion reactions. A significant challenge in the field of catalyst discovery lies in its heavy reliance on empirical methods, rather than approaches that are rooted in rational design principles. This review first concentrates on the catalytically active sites and critical factors governing catalytic activity and performance durability. Then, a comprehensive summary of multifunctional modification strategies ranging from nanoscale to atomic scale is explored to control the structure and improve the performance. By unveiling the roles of each component in the modified RUCE at the atomic level, their intrinsic active sites are identified and discussed to establish the structure&#8208;performance relationship of the catalysts. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of Ru&#8208;based materials for electrochemical hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen conversion reactions are presented to inspire further efforts toward understanding RUCE to meet the ever&#8208;growing demand in the future.

         <dc:description>
This review charts the transformative potential of next&#8208;generation nano&#8208;flexible embolic agents in redefining TACE for HCC. By dissecting innovations in tunable coagulation dynamics, real&#8208;time imaging integration and hypoxia&#8208;responsive drug delivery, it unveils how to overcome the pitfalls of conventional therapies. The strategies extend to synergies with immunotherapy and energy&#8208;conversion strategies, while confronting scalability and regulatory hurdles critical for clinical adoption.








Abstract
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) remains the gold standard for treating intermediate&#8208;stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), yet faces great challenges in overcoming tumor heterogeneity, hypoxia&#8208;induced angiogenesis, and metastatic progression. The development of advanced flexible embolization materials marks a revolutionary leap in interventional therapy, offering opportunities to revolutionize embolization precision, drug delivery kinetics, and tumor microenvironment modulation. This comprehensive review systematically examines the paradigm shift toward next&#8208;generation TACE technology, emphasizing the limitations of conventional approaches and innovations in flexible embolic agents. A detailed discussion of next&#8208;generation nano&#8208;flexible embolic systems is presented, emphasizing their unique coagulation dynamics, real&#8208;time imaging capabilities, and therapeutic precision. The review delves into groundbreaking TACE strategies integrating hypoxia modulation, energy conversion therapeutics, and sophisticated tumor microenvironment engineering. Clinical translation aspects are thoroughly explored, including large&#8208;scale trial outcomes, vascular recanalization dynamics, and patient&#8208;specific treatment optimization. Looking forward, key frontiers in the field is identified: intelligent nanocomposite systems, synergistic combination therapies, and precision medicine approaches tailored to individual tumor biology. This work not only objectively evaluates current progress but also charts future research priorities, aiming to transform TACE from a palliative intervention to a precision medicine platform and ultimately reshaping the landscape of HCC treatment and patient care.

         <title>Solid Polymer Electrolytes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Different Designs Dependent on Their Interaction with Sulfur Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different designs between the strategies used for solid polymer electrolyte (SPE)&#8208;based lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) and those from SPE based Li batteries and liquid electrolyte (LE)&#8208;based LSBs caused by the unique interactions of SPEs with S cathodes are successively reviewed. Subsequently, several challenges that need to be urgently addressed and the future prospects of SPE&#8208;containing LSBs are discussed.









Abstract
Nonflammable and flexible solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are widely studied to improve the safety of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Studies on SPE&#8208;based LSBs primarily focus on addressing issues stemming from poor SPE properties, Li dendrites, and &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of polysulfides. Currently, strategies from SPE&#8208;based lithium batteries (without sulfur cathodes) and liquid electrolyte (LE)&#8208;based LSBs (without SPEs) are the most commonly employed approaches to tackle above issues. These strategies are designed without taking into account the problems caused by the coexistence of SPEs and sulfur cathodes, resulting in SPE&#8208;based LSBs exhibiting significantly inferior performance than liquid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based LSBs. Therefore, the strategies for SPE&#8208;based LSBs necessitate different designs. However, no reviews have focused on the aforementioned differences and analyzing their corresponding causes thus far, which is unfavorable for the development of this field. Herein, the emerging advances in SPE&#8208;based LSBs are comprehensively reviewed. In particular, for the first time, the different designs and their corresponding causes are comprehensively discussed. These causes include the high adsorption strength of SPEs with polysulfides, corrosion of polysulfides to barrier layers, deterioration of the ionic conductivity of SPEs, and defective interfaces between cathodes and SPEs. Finally, several pressing challenges and future prospects for the field are discussed.

Currently, strategies from SPE-based lithium batteries (without sulfur cathodes) and liquid electrolyte (LE)-based LSBs (without SPEs) are the most commonly employed approaches to tackle above issues. These strategies are designed without taking into account the problems caused by the coexistence of SPEs and sulfur cathodes, resulting in SPE-based LSBs exhibiting significantly inferior performance than liquid-electrolyte-based LSBs. Therefore, the strategies for SPE-based LSBs necessitate different designs. However, no reviews have focused on the aforementioned differences and analyzing their corresponding causes thus far, which is unfavorable for the development of this field. Herein, the emerging advances in SPE-based LSBs are comprehensively reviewed. In particular, for the first time, the different designs and their corresponding causes are comprehensively discussed. These causes include the high adsorption strength of SPEs with polysulfides, corrosion of polysulfides to barrier layers, deterioration of the ionic conductivity of SPEs, and defective interfaces between cathodes and SPEs. Finally, several pressing challenges and future prospects for the field are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking the Sodium Storage Potential in Fluorophosphate Cathodes: Electrostatic Interaction Lowering Versus Structural Disordering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na+&#8208;density and degree of order in Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cathode are regulated via divalent cation doping to compare the importance of electrostatic interaction and Na+&#8208;ordering on the Na+ diffusivity and storage property. A higher Mg2+&#8208;doping concentration at both Na&#8208; and V&#8208;site, though incorporating extra Na+ and higher repulsive forces, contributes to a higher structural disorder, which reveals a higher throughout Na+ diffusivity with a superior energy/power density.








Abstract
Electrostatic interaction and Na+&#8208;ordering are identified as two possible kinetic constraints in determining the Na+ diffusivity in Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF), a representative polyanionic&#8208;based cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. As both factors are compositionally related and intertwined, isolating individual factors to pinpoint the dominant one is essential yet challenging for achieving the full electrochemical potential of NVPOF. Herein, NVPOF doped with Zn2+ or Mg2+ is developed to study the relative influence of the electrostatic interaction and structural disordering on the Na+ diffusivity and thus Na+ storage performance. The crystal structural analysis and theoretical modeling reveal that a limited amount (0.6 at% of Na) of Zn2+ doped at the Na&#8208;site with Na&#8208;vacancies created, while a ten&#8208;fold higher Mg2+ doped at both the Na&#8208; and V&#8208;site, which introduces additional Na+ for charge compensation. As a result, compared to the Zn2+ doped counterpart, the Mg2+ doped NVPOF cathode shows a Na+ diffusivity up to 3 times higher even encountering larger repulsive forces, and a much enhanced Na+ storage property. This work demonstrates the superiority of regulating the degree of order in the framework to address the defect formation energy of NVPOF, which is realized via doping and can be extendable to other polyanionic&#8208;based cathode materials.

         <title>Achieving &gt;23% Efficiency Perovskite Solar Minimodules with Surface Conductive Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study addresses a critical challenge in the commercialization of perovskite solar modules by reducing photovoltage loss through the in situ formation of a surface conductive coordination polymer at the surface/interface of the perovskite film.








Abstract
Despite the reported high efficiencies of small&#8208;area perovskite photovoltaic cells, the deficiency in large&#8208;area modules has impeded the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics. Enhancing the surface/interface conductivity and carrier&#8208;transport in polycrystalline perovskite films presents significant potential for boosting the efficiency of perovskite solar modules (PSMs) by mitigating voltage losses. This is particularly critical for multi&#8208;series connected sub&#8208;cell modules, where device resistance significantly impacts performance compared to small&#8208;area cells. Here, an effective approach is reported for decreasing photovoltage loss through surface/interface modulation of perovskite film with a surface conductive coordination polymer. With post&#8208;treatment of meso&#8208;tetra pyridine porphyrin on perovskite film, PbI2 on perovskite film reacts with pyridine units in porphyrins to generate an iso&#8208;structural 2D coordination polymer with a layered surface conductivity as high as 1.14 &#215; 102 S&#160;m&#8722;1, due to the effect of surface structure reconstruction. Modified perovskite film exhibits greatly increased surface/interface conductivity. The champion PSM obtains a record efficiency up to 23.39% (certified 22.63% with an aperture area of 11.42 cm2) featuring only 0.33&#8208;volt voltage loss. Such a modification also leads to substantially improved operational device stability.

         <title>A Salidroside&#8208;Based Radiosensitizer Regulates the Nrf2/ROS Pathway for X&#8208;Ray Activated Synergistic Cancer Precise Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel radiosensitizer integrating traditional Chinese medicine compound salidroside, Cu2+, and &#8226;OH activated FL molecules is developed, which achieves enhanced radiosensitization effect and promotes CDT efficacy monitored by NIR&#8208;II FL imaging. Salidroside blocks cells in the G2/M phase with the highest radiosensitivity and amplifies ROS levels, which provides sufficient chemical fuel for Cu+&#8208;mediated CDT to generate more &#8226;OH.








Abstract
The hypoxic microenvironment and radioresistance of tumor cells, as well as the delay in efficacy evaluation, significantly limit the effect of clinical radiotherapy. Therefore, developing effective radiosensitizers with monitoring of tumor response is of great significance for precise radiotherapy. Herein, a novel radiosensitizer (term as: SCuFs) is developed, consisting of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) compounds salidroside, Cu2+, and hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) activated second near&#8208;infrared window fluorescence (NIR&#8208;II FL) molecules, which make the radiosensitization effect and boosted chemodynamic therapy (CDT) efficacy. The overexpressed glutathione in the tumor induces the SCuFs dissociation, allowing deep penetration of the drug to the whole tumor region. After X&#8208;ray irradiation, salidroside inhibits the Nuclear factor erythroid 2&#8208;like 2 (Nrf2)protein expression and blocks cells in the G2/M phase with the highest radiosensitivity, which amplifies the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation to exacerbate DNA damage, thus achieving radiosensitization. Meanwhile, the upregulated ROS provides sufficient chemical fuel for Cu+&#8208;mediated CDT to produce more &#8226;OH. NIR&#8208;II FL imaging can monitor the &#8226;OH changes during the therapy process, confirming the radiosensitization effect and CDT process related to &#8226;OH. This study not only achieves effective radiosensitization and cascaded ROS&#8208;mediated CDT efficacy, but also provides a useful tool for monitoring therapeutic efficacy, showing great prospects for clinical application.

         <title>2D Indium&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Rich ZnIn2S4 Nanocatalysts for Sonocatalytic Cancer Suppression by Boosting Cancer&#8208;Cell Pyroptosis</title>

This work reports on the engineering of distinctive 2D ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets with interlayer indium vacancies for highly efficient sonocatalytic lung cancer treatment.








Abstract
Sonocatalytic therapy is gaining interest for its non&#8208;invasive nature, precise control, and excellent tissue penetration, making it a promising approach for treating malignant tumors. While defect engineering enhances electron and hole separation to boost reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, challenges in constructing effective hole traps compared to electron traps severely limit ROS production. In this study, 2D ZnIn2S4&#8208;VIn nanosheets enriched are rationally designed with In vacancies for the efficient capture of electrons and holes, which has achieved substantial sonocatalytic performance in suppressing tumor growth. Compared to pristine ZnIn2S4 nanosheets, which possess a periodic electrostatic potential inherent in their structure, In vacancies effectively disrupt this potential field, promote the simultaneous separation and migration of charge carriers, and inhibit their recombination, thereby boosting ROS production and inducing tumor cell pyroptosis via the ROS&#8208;NLRP3&#8208;caspase&#8208;1&#8208;GSDMD pathway under ultrasound (US) irradiation. Furthermore, both pristine ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4&#8208;VIn nanosheets exhibited remarkable biocompatibility. In vitro and in vivo antineoplastic experiments demonstrate that this sonocatalytic approach effectively promotes tumor elimination, underscoring the critical importance of defect&#8208;engineered optimization in sonocatalytic tumor therapy.

         <title>A Charge&#8208;Coupled Phototransistor Enabling Synchronous Dynamic and Static Image Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208;coupled phototransistor is presented that uses dual photosensitive capacitors to provide gate voltage to a single transistor channel, enabling simultaneous capture of dynamic and static information, surpassing existing DAVIS technology. This charge&#8208;coupled phototransistor paves the way for the development of high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;power, and highly integrated machine vision technology.








Abstract
Emerging machine vision applications require efficient detection of both dynamic events and static grayscale information within visual scenes. Current dynamic vision and active pixel sensors (DAVIS) technology integrates event&#8208;driven vision sensors and active pixel sensors within single pixels. However, the complex multi&#8208;component pixel architecture, typically requiring 15&#8211;50 transistors, limits integration density, increases power consumption, and complicates clock synchronization. Here, a charge&#8208;coupled phototransistor is presented that uses dual photosensitive capacitors to provide gate voltage to a single transistor channel, enabling simultaneous capture of dynamic and static information, surpassing existing DAVIS technology. Under illumination, both top and bottom gates generate photogenerated electrons through a charge&#8208;coupling effect; electrons in the top gate are blocked by a thick dielectric layer, producing a stable current change for static grayscale detection, while electrons in the bottom gate tunnel through a thin dielectric layer, creating transient current spikes for dynamic event detection. This device demonstrates a dynamic range of 120&#160;dB and a response time of 15 &#181;s, comparable to traditional DAVIS pixels, while significantly reducing power consumption to 10&#160;pW and overcoming clock synchronization issues. This charge&#8208;coupled phototransistor paves the way for the development of high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;power, and highly integrated machine vision technology.

         <title>Accurate Thermal Resection of Atomically Precise Copper Clusters to Achieve Near&#8208;IR Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel copper&#8208;sulfur&#8208;nitrogen cluster Cu8SN is synthesized by using a strong anchoring ability protective ligand (2&#8208;mercaptopyrimidine) and a relatively weak monodentate tert&#8208;butyl mercaptan ligand. Then, a precise thermal&#8208;resection strategy is applied to only peel the targeted weak ligands off, which induces a structural transformation of the initial Cu8SN cluster into a new and more stable Cu&#8211;S&#8211;N cluster (Cu8SN&#8211;T). Cu8SN&#8211;T exhibits greatly enhanced light&#8208;harvesting abilities and full&#8208;spectrum responsive overall CO2 photoreduction with &#8776;100% CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO selectivity.









Abstract
Atomically precise copper clusters are desirable as catalysts for elaborating the structure&#8211;activity relationships. The challenge, however, lies in their tendency to sinter when protective ligands are removed, resulting in the destruction of the structural integrity of the model system. Herein, a copper&#8208;sulfur&#8208;nitrogen cluster [Cu8(StBu)4(PymS)4] (denoted as Cu8SN) is synthesized by using a mixed ligand approach with strong chelating 2&#8208;mercaptopyrimidine (PymSH) ligands and relatively weak monodentate tert&#8208;butyl mercaptan ligands. A precise thermal&#8208;resection strategy is applied to selectively peel only the targeted weak ligands off, which induces a structural transformation of the initial Cu8 cluster into a new and more stable Cu&#8211;S&#8211;N cluster [Cu8(S)2(PymS)4] (denoted as Cu8SN&#8208;T). The residual bridging S2&#8722; within the metal core forms asymmetric Cu&#8208;S species with a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) response, which endows Cu8SN&#8208;T with the capability for full&#8208;spectrum responsive CO2 photoreduction, achieving a &#8776;100% CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO selectivity. Especially for NIR&#8208;driven CO2 reduction, it has a CO evolution of 42.5 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 under &#955; &gt; 780 nm. Importantly, this work represents the first NIR light&#8208;responsive copper cluster for efficient CO2 photoreduction and opens an avenue for the precise manipulation of metal cluster structures via a novel thermolysis strategy to develop unprecedented functionalized metal cluster materials.

         <title>Charge Density Wave and Ferromagnetism in Intercalated CrSBr</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft chemical intercalation of the van der Waals magnetic semiconductor CrSBr induces a quasi&#8208;1D charge density wave (CDW) phase. The combination of this CDW with ferromagnetism from a spin&#8208;polarized band generates an unusual coupling of the charge and spin modulations in the intercalated material.








Abstract
In materials with 1D electronic bands, electron&#8211;electron interactions can produce intriguing quantum phenomena, including spin&#8208;charge separation and charge density waves (CDW). Most of these systems, however, are non&#8208;magnetic, motivating a search for anisotropic materials where the coupling of charge and spin may affect emergent quantum states. Here, chemical intercalation of the van der Waals magnetic semiconductor CrSBr yields Li0.17(2)(tetrahydrofuran)0.26(3)CrSBr, which possesses an electronically driven quasi&#8208;1D CDW with an onset temperature above room temperature. Concurrently, electron doping increases the magnetic ordering temperature from 132 to 200 K and switches its interlayer magnetic coupling from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic. The spin&#8208;polarized nature of the anisotropic bands that give rise to this CDW enforces an intrinsic coupling of charge and spin. The coexistence and interplay of ferromagnetism and charge modulation in this exfoliatable material provide a promising platform for studying tunable quantum phenomena across a range of temperatures and thicknesses.

         <title>Flexible Tunable&#8208;Plasticity Synaptic Transistors for Mimicking Dynamic Cognition and Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible tunable&#8208;plasticity synaptic transistor (TST) is developed using indium gallium zinc oxide as a channel and a hybrid polyimide and Al2O3 layer as dielectric. The TST exhibits a transition from short&#8208;term plasticity to long&#8208;term plasticity by adjusting stimulus amplitude. It also enables neural networks with 94.1% recognition and 4&#8208;bit reservoir computing, laying the foundation for intelligent and efficient computing systems.








Abstract
Inspired by biological systems, neuromorphic computing can process extensive data and complex tasks more efficiently than traditional architectures. Artificial synaptic devices, serving as fundamental components in neuromorphic computing, needto closely mimic synaptic characteristics and construct neural network computing systems. However, most existing multifunctional synapse devices are structurally complex and lack tunability, making them unsuitable for building smarter computing systems. In this work, a flexible tunable&#8208;plasticity synaptic transistor (TST) is realized with memory modulation and neuromorphic computing capabilities by using indium gallium zinc oxide as channel and a hybrid layer of polyimide and Al2O3 as dielectric. The TST exhibits a novel transition from short&#8208;term plasticity to long&#8208;term one by adjusting stimulus amplitude, mirroring dynamic human memory and forgetting behaviors across various scenarios. A neural network system with low non&#8208;linearity and a wide range of conductance variations is constructed, and it demonstrates a 94.1% recognition rate on classical datasets. A reservoir computing system for 4&#8208;bit coding is also developed, which significantly reduces computational complexity and network size without sacrificing recognition accuracy. The devices and the system work as the foundation of more intelligent and more efficient computing systems.

         <title>Flexible 3D Kirigami Probes for In Vitro and In Vivo Neural Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A customizable and scalable approach to fabricate flexible 3D kirigami microelectrode arrays (MEAs) featuring up to 128 shanks, including surface and penetrating electrodes designed to interact with the 3D space of neural tissue, is presented. The 3D kirigami MEAs are successfully deployed in several neural applications, both in vitro and in vivo, and identified spatially dependent electrophysiological activity patterns.








Abstract
3D microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are gaining popularity as brain&#8211;machine interfaces and platforms for studying electrophysiological activity. Interactions with neural tissue depend on the electrochemical, mechanical, and spatial features of the recording platform. While planar or protruding 2D MEAs are limited in their ability to capture neural activity across layers, existing 3D platforms still require advancements in manufacturing scalability, spatial resolution, and tissue integration. In this work, a customizable, scalable, and straightforward approach to fabricate flexible 3D kirigami MEAs containing both surface and penetrating electrodes, designed to interact with the 3D space of neural tissue, is presented. These novel probes feature up to 512 electrodes distributed across 128 shanks in a single flexible device, with shank heights reaching up to 1&#160;mm. The 3D kirigami MEAs are successfully deployed in several neural applications, both in vitro and in vivo, and identified spatially dependent electrophysiological activity patterns. Flexible 3D kirigami MEAs are therefore a powerful tool for large&#8208;scale electrical sampling of complex neural tissues while improving tissue integration and offering enhanced capabilities for analyzing neural disorders and disease models where high spatial resolution is required.

         <title>Green Fabrication of Sulfonium&#8208;Containing Bismuth Materials for High&#8208;Sensitivity X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
[(CH3CH2)3S]6Bi8I30 and [[(CH3CH2)3S]AgBiI5 are introduced as novel X&#8208;ray detector materials with exceptional sensitivity and low detection limits. Produced via scalable, green synthesis, they remain highly durable after 9 months of storage and continuous X&#8208;ray use, setting a new benchmark for medical imaging and outperforming many existing and emerging technologies.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials based on lead and bismuth have recently been proposed as novel X&#8208; and gamma&#8208;ray detectors for medical imaging, non&#8208;destructive testing, and security, due to their high atomic numbers and facile preparation compared to traditional materials like amorphous selenium and Cd(Zn)Te. However, challenges related to device operation, excessively high dark currents, and long&#8208;term stability have delayed commercialization. Here, two novel semiconductors incorporating stable sulfonium cations are presented, [(CH3CH2)3S]6Bi8I30 and [(CH3CH2)3S]AgBiI5, synthesized via solvent&#8208;free ball milling and fabricated into dense polycrystalline pellets using cold isostatic compression, two techniques that can easily be upscaled, for X&#8208;ray detection application. The fabricated detectors exhibit exceptional sensitivities (14&#160;100&#8211;15&#160;190&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2) and low detection limits (90&#160;nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1 for [(CH3CH2)3S]6Bi8I30 and 78&#160;nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1 for [(CH3CH2)3S]AgBiI5), far surpassing current commercial detectors. Notably, they maintain performance after 9 months of ambient storage. The findings highlight [(CH3CH2)3S]6Bi8I30 and [(CH3CH2)3S]AgBiI5 as scalable, cost&#8208;effective and highly stable alternatives to traditional semiconductor materials, offering great potential as X&#8208;ray detectors in medical and security applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells via Nucleation and Crystallization Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pumping rate&#8208;controllable strategy regulates nucleation and crystallization in Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites during vacuum&#8208;flash&#8208;assisted solution processing. This approach enables additive&#8208;free, antisolvent&#8208;free fabrication of high&#8208;quality films, achieving &gt;21% and &gt;19% efficiency for 0.08 and 1 cm2 devices, respectively, with uniformity over 6 &#215; 6 cm2. It also delivers 27.5% efficiency for all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells, ensuring scalability and reliability.








Abstract
The rapid crystallization of mixed tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites and their dependence on antisolvent processes limit the development of large&#8208;area Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Vacuum&#8208;flash&#8208;assisted solution processing (VASP) has emerged as a promising technique for large&#8208;scale fabrication. However, achieving consistent control over crystallization parameters remains a limitation. To address this, a pumping rate&#8208;controllable strategy is introduced, fitted from cavity pressure and time, to control nucleation and crystallization in Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films. By tuning the pressure rate, the solvent volatilization rate of the perovskite wet film is optimized, enabling controlled nucleation and crystallization dynamics. This allows for the scalable fabrication of high&#8208;quality FA0.7MA0.3Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 films without additives to aid crystallization, achieving power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 21% and 19% for Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs at 0.08 cm2 and 1 cm2, respectively, the additives&#8208;free and antisolvent&#8208;free highest records. This further demonstrates that the uniformity and reproducibility of pumping rate control on a large 6 &#215; 6 cm2 substrate. The approach is also applicable to wide bandgap PSCs, normal bandgap PSCs, and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells, delivering a PCE &gt;27% for the antisolvent&#8208;free and additive&#8208;free tandem device. This work establishes a scalable and versatile approach for developing large&#8208;area Sn&#8208;Pb and all&#8208;perovskite tandem&#160;devices, advancing the field toward practical applications.

To address this, a pumping rate-controllable strategy is introduced, fitted from cavity pressure and time, to control nucleation and crystallization in Sn-Pb perovskite films. By tuning the pressure rate, the solvent volatilization rate of the perovskite wet film is optimized, enabling controlled nucleation and crystallization dynamics. This allows for the scalable fabrication of high-quality FA&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films without additives to aid crystallization, achieving power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 21% and 19% for Sn-Pb PSCs at 0.08 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, the additives-free and antisolvent-free highest records. This further demonstrates that the uniformity and reproducibility of pumping rate control on a large 6 &#215; 6 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; substrate. The approach is also applicable to wide bandgap PSCs, normal bandgap PSCs, and all-perovskite tandem solar cells, delivering a PCE &amp;gt;27% for the antisolvent-free and additive-free tandem device. This work establishes a scalable and versatile approach for developing large-area Sn-Pb and all-perovskite tandem&#160;devices, advancing the field toward practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Neuransistor with Excitatory and Inhibitory Neuronal Behaviors for Liquid State Machine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The neuransistor integrates hybrid excitatory and inhibitory dynamics, enabling liquid state machine implementation. It operates via charge trapping in a two&#8208;dimensional electron electron gas (2DEG)/TiO2&#8722;x structure and features a three&#8208;terminal design for efficient masking functionality. Simulations demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting temporal signals, emphasizing its role as a robust reservoir for neuromorphic computing and advancing biologically inspired applications.








Abstract
A liquid state machine (LSM) is a spiking neural network model inspired by biological neural network dynamics designed to process time&#8208;varying inputs. In the LSM, maintaining a proper excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance among neurons is essential for ensuring network stability and generating rich temporal dynamics for accurate data processing. In this study, a &#8220;neuransistor&#8221; is proposed that implements the E/I neurons in a single device, allowing for the hardware implementation of the LSM. The device features a three&#8208;terminal transistor structure embodying TiO2&#8722;x/Al2O3 bi&#8208;layer, providing a two&#8208;dimensional electron electron gas (2DEG) channel at their interface. This device demonstrates hybrid excitatory and inhibitory dynamics with respect to the applied gate bias polarity, originating from the charge trapping/detrapping between the 2DEG and TiO2&#8722;x layers. Additionally, the three&#8208;terminal configuration allows masking capabilities by selecting terminal biases, realizing a reservoir behavior with superior reliability and durability. Its use in an LSM reservoir for time&#8208;series data prediction tasks using the Henon dataset and a chaotic equation solver for the Lorenz attractor is demonstrated. This benchmarking indicates that the LSM exhibits enhanced performance and efficiency compared to the conventional echo state network, underscoring its potential for advanced applications in reservoir computing.

         <title>Enthalpy&#8208;Driven Molecular Engineering Enables High&#8208;Performance Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Long Life Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a co&#8208;polymerization approach using 1,1,1&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2,3&#8208;epoxypropane to integrate lithium nitrate into poly&#8208;DOL&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes. The resulting electrolyte exhibits high ionic conductivity (2.23&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1), exceptional Coulombic efficiency (99.34%) in Li|Cu cell, and long&#8208;term stability (2000 cycles in Li|LFP cells). Scale&#8208;up tests in Li|NCM811 cells show 94.4% capacity retention over 60 cycles, offering a promising path for high&#8208;performance, in situ polymerized batteries.








Abstract
The advancement of lithium metal batteries toward their theoretical energy density potential remains constrained by safety and performance issues inherent to liquid electrolytes. Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (QSSEs) based on poly&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (poly&#8208;DOL) represent a promising development, yet challenges in achieving satisfactory Coulombic efficiency and long&#8208;term stability have impeded their practical implementation. While lithium nitrate addition can enhance efficiency, its incorporation results in prohibitively slow polymerization rates spanning several months. In this work, high&#8208;polymerization&#8208;enthalpy 1,1,1&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2,3&#8208;epoxypropane is introduced as a co&#8208;polymerization promoter, successfully integrating lithium nitrate into poly&#8208;DOL&#8208;based QSSEs. The resulting electrolyte demonstrates exceptional performance with 2.23&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 of ionic conductivity at 25&#160;&#176;C, a Coulombic efficiency of 99.34% in Li|Cu cells, and stable lithium metal interfaces sustained through 1300 h of symmetric cell cycling. This co&#8208;polymerization approach also suppresses poly&#8208;DOL crystallization, enabling Li|LiFePO4 cells to maintain stability beyond 2000 cycles at 1C. Scale&#8208;up validation in a &#8776;1&#160;Ah Li|NCM811 pouch cell achieves 94.4% capacity retention over 60 cycles. This strategy establishes a new pathway for developing high&#8208;performance, in situ polymerized quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries for practical energy storage applications.

&lt;p&gt;The advancement of lithium metal batteries toward their theoretical energy density potential remains constrained by safety and performance issues inherent to liquid electrolytes. Quasi-solid-state electrolytes (QSSEs) based on poly-1,3-dioxolane (poly-DOL) represent a promising development, yet challenges in achieving satisfactory Coulombic efficiency and long-term stability have impeded their practical implementation. While lithium nitrate addition can enhance efficiency, its incorporation results in prohibitively slow polymerization rates spanning several months. In this work, high-polymerization-enthalpy 1,1,1-trifluoro-2,3-epoxypropane is introduced as a co-polymerization promoter, successfully integrating lithium nitrate into poly-DOL-based QSSEs.

         <title>NASICON&#8208;NaV0.25Al0.25Nb1.5(PO4)3/C: A High&#8208;Rate and Robust Anode for Fast Charging and Long&#8208;Life Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

The NaV0.25Al0.25Nb1.5(PO4)3/C (NaVAlNb/C) anode offers a transformative solution for fast&#8208;charging sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Paired with a Na4V2(PO4)3 cathode in a full cell, it achieves 6&#8208;min rechargeability and a long cycle life of over 3000 cycles. This work underscores the significance of local structure modification along with carbon&#8208;coating and particle downsizing to advance NASICON&#8208;based anodes for high&#8208;performance energy storage.









Abstract
Nb&#8208;based NAtrium Super Ionic CONductor (NASICON) frameworks (e.g., Nb2(PO4)3 and Na1.5V0.5Nb1.5(PO4)3) are emerging as the attractive Na&#8208;ion anodes due to their lower intercalation voltage (&#8776;1.4&#8211;1.2&#160;V vs Na+/Na0) and higher storage capacities (&#8776;140&#8211;160 mAh g&#8722;1). However, their practical realization is limited by moderate cycle life and rate performances. In this work, a carbon&#8208;coated NASICON&#8208;NaV0.25Al0.25Nb1.5(PO4)3 (NaVAlNb/C) anode is unveiled for fast charging Na&#8208;ion batteries. The incorporation of Al3+ increases covalency of NASICON and creates disordered Na&#8208;ion sublattice as observed by X&#8208;ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements. Besides, the carbon&#8208;coating and particle downsizing produces facile electron and ion percolation network. Accordingly, the NaVAlNb/C anode renders extraordinary rate performances (80 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20C) with longer cycling stability (95.2% retention after 5000 cycles at 10C). Climbing image nudged elastic band calculations reveal reduced Na&#8208;ion migration barrier (202 meV) for NaVAlNb/C. Most importantly, a full Na&#8208;ion cell based on Na4V2(PO4)3 cathode and NaVAlNb/C anode is demonstrated with a high&#8208;power density (6493&#160;W kg&#8722;1) and long&#8208;cycle life (3000 cycles at 20C), which are far excellent compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NASICON&#8208;based cells. This work demonstrates the significance of carbon coating and chemical tuning to tailor high&#8208;rate NASICON anodes, which can produce fast&#8208;charging Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Glycated ECM Derived Carbon Dots Inhibit Tumor Vasculogenic Mimicry by Disrupting RAGE Nuclear Translocation and Its Interaction With HMGB1</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, AGEs derived is found from glycated ECM significantly promote tumor growth and VM formation through the RAGE&#8208;HMGB1&#8208;SNAI2 axis. However, carbon dots (egCDs) derived from glycated ECM can competitively bind to RAGE, promoting its lysosomal degradation and inhibiting this process. This finding reveals the transformation of pathogenic substances into therapeutic targeting carriers after carbonization, reversing disease&#8208;driving factors.








Abstract
This study investigates the role of advanced glycation end&#8208;products (AGEs) in tumor vasculogenic mimicry (VM). Using high&#8208;sugar diet animal models and glycated extracellular matrix (ECM) ex vivo models, AGEs derived is demonstrated from glycated ECM significantly enhanced tumor growth and VM formation. However, carbon dots (egCDs) derived from glycated ECM effectively inhibit tumor growth and VM formation in this glycated microenvironment. Mechanistic studies show that AGEs from glycated ECM bind to the Receptor of Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE) receptors on tumor cells, promoting RAGE nuclear translocation and binding with high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which increases the transcription of Snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (SNAI2), thereby driving VM formation. However, egCDs competitively bind to RAGE, promoting its lysosomal degradation and blocking VM formation induced by the RAGE&#8208;HMGB1&#8208;SNAI2 axis. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that egCDs can target RAGE and promote its lysosomal degradation to block VM formation induced by glycated ECM. This finding not only reveals the transformation of glycated ECM from a pro&#8208;VM factor to an anti&#8208;VM therapeutic agent after carbonization, but also provides a theoretical basis for the innovative strategy of &#8220;reconstructing pathogenic substances into carbon dots to reverse disease&#8208;driving factors into therapeutic targeting carriers&#8221;.

         <title>Polymer Microarray with Tailored Morphologies through Condensed Droplet Polymerization for High&#8208;Resolution Optical Imaging Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Study introduces condensed droplet polymerization (CDP) technology, enabling the fabrication of polymeric micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;dome arrays (PDAs) with tunable geometric properties. By manipulating polymerization kinetics, CDP allows for the rapid manufacturing of PDAs with specific sizes, radii of curvature, and surface densities. The research explores the optical properties of PDAs as nanolenses, enhancing high&#8208;resolution optical imaging capabilities.








Abstract
Nature&#8208;inspired functional surfaces with micro&#8208; and nanoscale features have garnered interest for potential applications in optics, imaging, and sensing. Traditional fabrication methods, such as lithography and self&#8208;assembly, face limitations in versatility, scalability, and morphology control. This study introduces an innovative technology, condensed droplet polymerization (CDP), for fabricating polymeric micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;dome arrays (PDAs) with readily tunable geometric properties&#8212;a challenging feat for conventional methods. The CDP process leverages free&#8208;radical polymerization in condensed monomer droplets, allowing rapid production of PDAs with targeted sizes, radii of curvature, and surface densities by manipulating a key synthesis parameter: the temperature of a filament array that activates initiators. This work systematically unravels its effects on polymerization kinetics, viscoelastic properties of the polymerizing droplets, and geometric characteristics of the PDAs. Utilizing in situ digital microscope, this work reveals the morphological evolution of the PDAs during the process. The resulting PDAs exhibit distinct optical properties, including magnification that enables high&#8208;resolution imaging beyond the diffraction limit of conventional microscopes. This work demonstrates the ability to magnify and focus light, enhancing imaging of subwavelength structures and biological specimens. This work advances the understanding of polymerization mechanisms in nano&#8208;sized reactors (i.e., droplets) and paves the way for developing compact optical imaging and sensing technologies.

         <title>Asymmetric Self&#8208;Assembly of Colloidal Superstructures in Nested Transient Emulsion Aerosols</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nested transient emulsion aerosol system is presented for the asymmetric self&#8208;assembly of colloidal nanoparticles into superstructures with anisotropic morphologies. These nested transient emulsion aerosols break the spherical symmetry associated with conventional emulsion droplets, enabling the production of anisotropic superstructures with potential applications previously considered unattainable.








Abstract
Emulsions are versatile and robust platforms for colloidal self&#8208;assembly, but their ability to create complex and functional superstructures is hindered by the inherent symmetry of droplets. Here the creation of an aerosol of nested transient emulsion droplets with inherent asymmetry is reported, achieved by converging beams of water and 1&#8208;butanol mists. Self&#8208;assembly of nanoparticles occurs within such emulsion droplets as driven by the rapid two&#8208;phase interface diffusion, producing anisotropic superstructures. A unique hollowing process is observed due to the asymmetric diffusion of solvents, akin to the Kirkendall effect. This novel assembly platform offers several advantages, including asymmetric self&#8208;assembly in air, surfactant&#8208;free operation, and tunable droplet size. It enables the creation of clean, functional nanoparticle superstructures that can be easily disassembled when needed. These advancements pave the way for exploring intricate, anisotropic superstructures with diverse applications that are unavailable in conventional superstructures of spherical symmetry.

         <title>Modulating Coalescence Timing of Liquid Marbles via Wettability Adaptation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of nanoparticles embedded with wettability adaptation allows the modulation of coalescence timing of liquid marbles on solid surfaces with &#8776;1 min resolutions without requiring external interventions. It enables droplet&#8208;based cascade chemical reaction and Janus liquid/gas marble formation. Overall, it opens new possibilities in droplet/bubble science.








Abstract
Droplet coalescence is ubiquitous in nature, and its regulation is significant in industrial processes and biomedical applications. While bare droplets suddenly coalesce in contact, the droplets covered with liquid&#8208;repellent particles to form &#8220;liquid marbles (LMs)&#8221; are not. Previously, the external stimuli&#8208;responsive breakage of the particle layer enables the regulation of the coalescence timing. However, preprogramming the coalescence timing of droplets without stimuli is challenging. In this work, LMs that break the particle layer in preprogrammed time are reported. The particles have a core wettable site and are tethered with a low&#8208;wettability flexible molecular chain, which gradually increases wettability with time. The time&#8208;dependent wettability variation is observed because of the differences in the adaptation of the molecular chain; thus, it is repeatedly available, and its speed is controllable by chain length. The formed LMs expose bare droplet surfaces in preprogrammed timing, which enables the modulation of coalescence timing from 2 to 45 min without relying on external stimuli. Moreover, the additivity of the particles enables the fine&#8208;tuning of the coalescence time with &#8776;1&#160;min resolutions. Further, the contact of several LMs with different adaptation times enables cascade droplet coalescence, opening a new route for droplet manipulation.

         <title>Multifunctional Spinel Structure for Efficient Direct Recycling of Spent Layered Cathodes into Fast&#8208;Charging Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A channel&#8208;assisted regeneration strategy that utilizes waste spinel cathode materials to construct fast lithium&#8208;ion replenishment channels on the surface of spent LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 materials is proposed. This surface reconstruction not only facilitates efficient material regeneration but also effectively mitigates lattice expansion and side reactions under fast&#8208;charging conditions, thereby optimizing the comprehensive electrochemical performance of the regenerated materials.








Abstract
Direct recycling is increasingly recognized as a promising solution to alleviate the burgeoning contradiction between the growing demand for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and amidst resource shortages. A critical challenge in this process is achieving efficient lithium compensation, which is vital for replenishing lost elements and promoting the reconstruction of degraded structures. Herein, inspired by the concept of &#8220;recycle waste with waste,&#8221; a channel&#8208;assisted regeneration strategy is proposed that utilizes waste spinel materials to reconstruct the surface of the spent layered cathode, clearing blocked channels and transforming them into a 3D&#160;structure that facilitates rapid lithium&#8208;ion transmission. This approach enhances the efficient replenishment of exogenous lithium salts into the particle lattice and prevents intrinsic thermal decomposition during heat treatment due to element deficiencies. The presence of the 3D ion channels can also improve the fast&#8208;charging performance of the regenerated cathode material, achieving a capacity retention rate of 87.9% after 500 cycles at 10&#160;C. Additionally, its overall electrochemical performance significantly outperforms that of commercial materials. This work addresses critical challenges in the direct solid&#8208;phase regeneration of cathode materials and offers valuable insights for optimizing next&#8208;generation LIB recycling technologies.

The presence of the 3D ion channels can also improve the fast-charging performance of the regenerated cathode material, achieving a capacity retention rate of 87.9% after 500 cycles at 10&#160;C. Additionally, its overall electrochemical performance significantly outperforms that of commercial materials. This work addresses critical challenges in the direct solid-phase regeneration of cathode materials and offers valuable insights for optimizing next-generation LIB recycling technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>2D Piezo&#8208;Ferro&#8208;Opto&#8208;Electronic Artificial Synapse for Bio&#8208;Inspired Multimodal Sensory Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel PFOE Artificial Synapse integrating multimodal fusion perception in one device with a single functional material is presented, enabled by combined ferroelectricity (for synaptic behaviors), piezoelectricity (for tactile modulation), and optoelectronic responsiveness (for visual detection) of NbOI2. Under the synergistic modulation of strain and light, visual&#8208;tactile fusion perception has been fully demonstrated, advancing multifunctional sensing devices for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Multimodal sensory integration is vital for the evolution of artificial intelligence, yet current approaches often rely on physically connecting distinct sensing units (such as visual and tactile devices) through external circuits, leading to data transmission delays and information loss. Here, a groundbreaking paradigm is demonstrated for integrating visual&#8208;tactile fusion perception in one device with a single functional material. This is achieved by developing an unprecedented 2D Piezo&#8208;Ferro&#8208;Opto&#8208;Electronic (PFOE) Artificial Synapse, which combines the comprehensive ferroelectricity (for synaptic behaviors), piezoelectricity (for tactile modulation), and optoelectronic responsiveness (for visual detection) of strained 2D NbOI2. Under the synergistic influence of light and strain, the device exhibits remarkable persistent photoconductivity (PPC), a notable increase in paired&#8208;pulse facilitation (PPF) index (from 116% to 180%), and a reduction in the power exponent of the sublinear power&#8208;law fitting photocurrent curve (from 0.797 to 0.376). These features enhance the clarity and recognition of fingerprint images that integrate visual and tactile information. The work provides a robust foundation for integrating multisensory capabilities into advanced human&#8208;machine interfaces and artificial intelligence systems, marking a significant leap forward in the development of multifunctional neuromorphic devices.

         <title>Efficient Perovskite/Organic Tandem Photovoltaic Devices and Large&#8208;area Modules Featuring Thick&#8208;Film Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fine&#8208;grained sub&#8208;cell matching model is developed to optimize the series current density of perovskite&#8208;organic tandem solar cells (TSCs). Based on the thick organic films strategy, the TSC achieve a remarkable efficiency of 24.31% (certified as 24.00%). A large&#8208;area module (18.48 cm2) is further fabricated with an impressive efficiency of 18.54%, which is the first demonstration of perovskite&#8208;organic tandem modules.








Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;organic tandem solar cells (TSCs) possess significant potential due to their unique features, such as orthogonal processing solvents, tunable bandgap, and infinite molecular designs. However, their device performance is often hindered by the limited series current density, which is constrained by the absorption of the rear organic solar cell (OSC). Here, a fine&#8208;grained sub&#8208;cell matching model has been developed that enables rapid screening of material combinations based on practical sub&#8208;cell device parameters. The model indicates that increasing the thickness of the OSC layer is an effective approach to boost efficiency, while also reducing manufacturing challenges for large&#8208;scale production. To mitigate the charge collection issues arising from excessive thickness, a contact passivation technique based on a self&#8208;assembled monolayer has been developed, which minimizes non&#8208;radiative recombination and reduces the Schottky barrier at the interface, enabling more balanced hole&#8208;electron transport. As a result, the thick&#8208;film (300&#160;nm) has achieved a record&#8208;high efficiency of 18.08% (certified as 17.80%), enhancing the efficiency of TSCs to 24.31% (certified at 24.00%). Furthermore, a large&#8208;area tandem photovoltaic module with an efficiency exceeding 18.54% (18.48 cm2) has been demonstrated. To the knowledge, this represents the first module demonstration for perovskite&#8208;organic TSCs.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Mediated Topological Interlayer Shift in 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Present work demonstrates an efficient proton&#8208;mediation strategy for precise regulation of interlayer shift of 2D D&#8208;A COFs for facilitated charge transfer and exciton dissociation in photocatalytic water reduction. The structure with eclipsed AA stacking delivers an improved hydrogen evolution rate up to 171.2 mmol&#160;g&#8722;1h&#8722;1, setting a new benchmark in photocatalysis employing 2D COFs. These findings highlight the significance of addressing the topology&#8208;governed charge transfer dynamics in COFs for efficient solar energy conversion.








Abstract
The interlayer carriers dynamics are of significance in optoelectronic applications of 2D donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) covalent organic frameworks (COFs), while are challenged by the delicate control over the inherently variable and sensitive interlayer interaction. Present work demonstrates an efficient proton&#8208;mediation strategy that allows for the precise regulation of interlayer shift of 2D D&#8208;A COFs for facilitated charge transfer and exciton dissociation. Exemplified by three imine&#8208;linked D&#8208;A COFs (IMDA), mild proton&#8208;mediation generates an eclipsed AA stacking (IMDA&#8208;AA) featuring in&#8208;plane D&#8208;A pairs and fully overlapping D&#8208;A &#960;&#8208;conjugations, while excessive proton&#8208;mediation disrupts these conjugations, resulting in a slipped AA stacking (IMDA&#8208;SAA) with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane D&#8208;A pairs. Further analysis reveals that the interlayer topology of eclipsed AA stacking of IMDA favors for the synergistically optimized charge transfer dynamics, including enhanced intralayer charge transport with reduced exciton binding energy, and boosted interlayer exciton dissociation. IMDA&#8208;AA COF delivers an improved hydrogen evolution rate up to 171.2&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1h&#8722;1 under visible light illumination in the presence of 1.5 wt.% Pt co&#8208;catalysts, which is as far as is known the highest value among the reports of 2D COFs based photocatalysis. Present work will provide an important avenue of addressing the topology&#8208;governed charge transfer dynamics within COFs for solar energy conversion.

         <title>Fast Encapsulation of Microbes into Dissolvable Hydrogel Beads Enables High&#8208;Throughput Microbial Single&#8208;Cell RNA Sequencing of Clinical Microbiome Samples</title>

This work develops smGel&#8208;seq, a high&#8208;throughput microbial single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing method characterized by low microbial&#160;input, minimal loss, reduced bias, and high sample compatibility using dissolvable hydrogel beads. smGel&#8208;seq achieves the first microbial single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing in a clinical sputum microbiome sample and found different subpopulations, one of which may be critical for antibiotic resistance and virulence.








Abstract
Microbial single&#8208;cell RNA&#8208;seq (mscRNA&#8208;seq) can achieve resolution at the cellular level, enhancing the understanding of microbial communities. However, current high&#8208;throughput mscRNA&#8208;seq methods are limited by multiple centrifugation steps, which can lead to microbial loss and bias. smGel&#8208;seq is reported, a high&#8208;throughput single&#8208;microbe RNA sequencing method for clinical microbiome samples that employs hydrogel beads to encapsulate individual microbes to reduce microbial loss and input requirements. In this method, a novel microchannel array device is implemented for encapsulating single microbe in dissolvable hydrogel beads (smDHBs), along with an optimized automated microfluidic platform to co&#8208;encapsulate barcoded beads and smDHBs, enabling high&#8208;throughput barcoding of individual microbes. smGel&#8208;seq significantly increases the microbial recovery rate in a gut microbiome sample from 8.8% to 91.8%. Furthermore, this method successfully processes clinical microbiome samples with microbial inputs 20 times lower than those required by previous methods. Notably, smGel&#8208;seq enables the first mscRNA&#8208;seq in a clinical sputum microbiome sample, revealing a specific microbial subpopulation that may play a key role in environmental adaptability, antibiotic resistance, and pathogenicity. These results highlight the compatibility of smGel&#8208;seq with clinical microbiome samples and demonstrate its potential for widespread application in diverse clinical and research settings.

         <title>Artificial Mitochondrial Nanorobots Deliver Energy In Vivo by Oral Administration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oral artificial mitochondrial nanorobots (AMNs) can treat ischemic heart disease by delivering ATP to damaged cardiomyocytes, modulating oxidative stress, and restoring cell viability. It improves energy metabolism and mitochondrial structure and reduces inflammation at the genetic level, providing a universal and innovative approach to repair therapies for mitochondrial damage&#8208;related diseases.








Abstract
Delivering energy in vivo is essential for treating mitochondrial damage&#8208;related diseases. Current methods, including natural mitochondrial transplantation and artificial energy delivery systems, lack non&#8208;destructive, external energy&#8208;free, and clinically viable potential solutions. Here, artificial mitochondrial nanorobots (AMNs) carrying high&#8208;energy phosphate bonds rebuild the in vivo energy supply system to provide energy. Using ischemic heart disease (IHD) as an energy&#8208;deficient disease model and the oral route, which has high patient compliance and facilitates long&#8208;term administration, to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of AMNs. AMNs remain stable in the gastrointestinal tract, cross the intestinal barrier via a barrier&#8208;crossing unit, and target damaged heart tissue and cardiomyocytes using a motion unit chemotactically. Intracellularly, their energy&#8208;generating unit provides high&#8208;energy phosphate bonds for ATP synthesis (duration 12&#160;h), while synergistically reducing inflammation and restoring cell viability. At the same frequency of administration, oral AMNs (50&#160;mg&#160;kg&#8722;1) match intravenous AMNs (10 mg&#160;kg&#8722;1) in therapeutic efficacy, offering a convenient approach to improving cardiac function. Transcriptomics confirm that 200&#160;&#181;g AMNs emulate 5 &#215; 10&#8310; natural mitochondria, restoring energy metabolism and structural function in damaged hearts at the genetic level. This innovative design opens a new pathway for the construction of artificial energy delivery systems in vivo.

         <title>Manipulating the Assembly and Architecture of Fibrillar Silk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, advanced in situ AFM, PiFM, and Cryo&#8208;EM are leveraged to realize in situ observations of nucleation, growth, and degradation of silk nanofibrils. A clear picture of the assembly and structural evolution of regenerated silk nanofibrils is defined and demonstrates a novel strategy for manipulating their structure and properties, which emerges from the understanding of their structure and assembly.








Abstract
Silk is a unique and exceptionally strong biological material. However, no synthetic method has yet come close to replicating the properties of natural silk. This shortfall is attributed to an insufficient understanding of both silk nanofibril structure and the mechanism of formation. Here in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) and photo&#8208;induced force microscopy (PiFM) is utilized to investigate the formation process and define the basic structural paradigm of individual silk nanofibrils. By visualizing the multistage process of silk nanofibril formation, the importance of conformational transformations along the assembly pathway is revealed. Unfolded silk structures initially accumulate into amorphous clusters, which then evolve into crystal nuclei via conformational transformation into &#946;&#8208;crystallites. Nanofibril elongation then occurs through the attachment of silk molecules at a single end of the nanofibril tip; this is facilitated through the formation of a new amorphous cluster that then repeats the aforementioned conformational transformation. However, enzymatic digestion of the amorphous regions leads to direct, rapid elongation of &#946;&#8208;crystalline fibers. These findings imply that the energy landscape is characterized by shallow minima associated with intermediate states, which can be eliminated by introducing &#946;&#8208;crystallites, and motivate research into the directed modification of the silk assembly pathway to select for features beneficial to specific applications.

         <title>Acceptor Crystallinity Engineering Enables &gt;20% Efficiency Binary Organic Solar Cells with 83.0% Fill Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new solvent, trichloroethylene (TCE), is introduced and used as an acceptor processing solvent in layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer processed devices. The active layer exhibits a higher proportion of transport phases and lower trap&#8208;assisted charge recombination. The efficiency of the binary organic solar cell reached 20.05%, with a record&#8208;high fill factor of 83%.








Abstract
For spontaneously crystallized organic photovoltaic materials, morphology optimization remains a challenge due to the disparity in crystallinity between the donor and acceptor components. Imperfections in the crystalline phases result in significant trap&#8208;assisted recombination, which emerges as a critical factor limiting the fill factor (FF) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a method is introduced for precise regulation of the acceptor crystallinity, utilizing a novel upper&#8208;layer acceptor processing solvent, trichloroethylene (TCE), to improve the state and vertical morphology of the active layer. The TCE solvent synergistically optimizes intermolecular interactions among acceptor molecules and balances the film&#8208;forming process, thereby increasing the proportion of transport phases and forming high&#8208;speed channels for electron transport, which subsequently reduces trap&#8208;assisted charge recombination. As a result, the photovoltaic efficiency of binary organic solar cells reaches 20.05%. More importantly, an unprecedented FF of 83.0% is obtained, representing the highest FF value for OSCs. This facile and effective approach offers a promising means for constructing efficient charge transport networks and fabricating high&#8208;efficiency and morphologically stable OSCs.

         <title>Mesoporous Silica Nanotraps for Mitigating Bleeding Risk From &#8216;Irreversible&#8217; Antiplatelet Drugs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;term antiplatelet therapy increases bleeding risk, particularly in emergency surgeries or accidental injuries. The click chemistry&#8208;functionalized mesoporous silica nanotraps are developed to selectively capture the sulfhydryl&#8208;containing active metabolites of clopidogrel and prasugrel, rapidly reversing their antiplatelet activity and restoring hemostasis. Bleeding models in mice, rabbits, and pigs confirmed their efficacy and safety, underscoring their potential as a functional reversal agent for &#8220;irreversible&#8221; antiplatelet drugs.








Abstract
The severe bleeding complications of long&#8208;term antiplatelet therapy limit its broader application in the treatment or prevention of thrombosis&#8208;associated diseases. This risk is particularly serious when facing emergency surgeries where rapid restoration of normal platelet function is required. Timely reversal of the effects of antiplatelet agents becomes crucial in such scenarios. Despite the widespread use of clopidogrel and prasugrel for their potent antiplatelet activity, the absence of specific and effective reversal agents remains a notable challenge. The pharmacological activity of clopidogrel and prasugrel is mediated by sulfhydryl&#8208;containing active metabolites, which form disulfide bonds with P2Y12 receptors on the surface of platelets to inhibit their aggregation. Taking advantage of this action mechanism of these &#8220;irreversible&#8221; antiplatelet drugs, click chemistry&#8208;functionalized mesoporous silica (SiO2&#8208;Mal) nanotraps are fabricated to capture the antiplatelet drugs' active metabolites and restore hemostasis. Subsequently, a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness and safety of the SiO2&#8208;Mal nanotraps is conducted using mouse, rabbit, and pig animal models, highlighting their potential application as a functional reversal agent for clinically relevant thienopyridine antiplatelet drugs, believed until now to be irreversible in their inhibition of platelet activity.

         <title>Molecular Reconstruction for the High&#8208;Performance Recycled Fluororubbers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular reconstruction strategy is proposed to upcycle waste fluororubber into chemically awakenable and high&#8208;performance ATLF&#8208;Boc through three reactions: controlled oxidative degradation, fluorination addition and decarboxylation amination. This strategy solved the problem of difficult recovery of waste fluororubber, realized the upgrading and recycling of waste fluororubber.

To address the challenges associated with the difficult recycling of fluorinated specialty materials and the subpar performance of recycled products, a molecular reconstruction strategy of oxidative degradation, fluorination addition is reported, and end&#8208;group transformation, which upcycled waste fluororubber into high&#8208;performance, chemically awakenable amino&#8208;terminated low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fluoropolymer (ATLF&#8208;Boc). Leveraging the chemical properties of the vinylidene fluoride structure in the waste fluororubber, carboxyl&#8208;terminated low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fluoropolymer (CTLF) with controlled molecular weight and end&#8208;group content are synthesized. Further, the whole chain is structurally strengthened at the molecular scale to achieve higher fluorine content and thermal stability, and saturated carboxyl&#8208;terminated low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fluoropolymer (SCTLF) is synthesized. Subsequently, to balance high reactivity and stable storage, high&#8208;performance ATLF&#8208;Boc is synthesized, realizing the upcycling of waste fluororubber. After upcycling, the awakened ATLF exhibits a high fluorine content (66.95%), and the cured ATLF shows the regulation of surface hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity (between 43&#176; and 114&#176;), a high tensile strength of 13.3&#160;MPa, an excellent thermal stability (T10% = 359&#160;&#176;C). In this study, a novel solution for the upcycling of waste fluororubbers for fabricating functional materials is offered, which is of great significance in the field of fluorinated specialty materials.

     alt="Molecular Reconstruction for the High-Performance Recycled Fluororubbers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A molecular reconstruction strategy is proposed to upcycle waste fluororubber into chemically awakenable and high-performance ATLF-Boc through three reactions: controlled oxidative degradation, fluorination addition and decarboxylation amination. This strategy solved the problem of difficult recovery of waste fluororubber, realized the upgrading and recycling of waste fluororubber. Furthermore, an epoxy curing system is constructed to achieve control of ATLF performance.

         <dc:description>
A versatile assembly method is developed to uniformly assemble 2D single&#8208;crystal copper nanosheets (Cu NS) onto substrates with complex shapes via ultrasonication process. This technique leverages cavitation effects to deposit monolayer Cu NS films with minimal overlap. The assembly is optimized by tuning solvent polarity and substrate surface energy. Demonstrated applications include a resistive heater, highlighting the potential in flexible electronics.








Abstract
Scalable and cost&#8208;effective fabrication of conductive films on substrates with complex geometries is crucial for industrial applications in electronics. Herein, an ultrasonic&#8208;driven omni&#8208;directional and selective assembly technique is introduced for the uniform deposition of 2D single&#8208;crystalline copper nanosheets (Cu NS) onto various substrates. This method leverages cavitation&#8208;induced forces to propel Cu NS onto hydrophilic surfaces, enabling the formation of monolayer films with largely monolayer films with some degree of nanosheet overlap. The assembly process is influenced by solvent polarity, nanosheet concentration, and ultrasonic parameters, with non&#8208;polar solvents significantly enhancing Cu NS adsorption onto hydrophilic substrates. Furthermore, selective assembly is achieved by patterning hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions on the substrate, ensuring precise localization of Cu NS films. The practical potential of this approach is demonstrated by fabricating a Cu NS&#8208;coated capillary tube heater, which exhibits excellent heating performance at low operating voltages. This ultrasonic&#8208;driven and selective assembly method offers a scalable and versatile solution for producing conductive films with tailored geometries, unlocking new possibilities for applications in flexible electronics, energy storage, and wearable devices with complex structural requirements.

         <title>Integrating Ethereal Molecular Backbones into the Ester Solvent with High Solubility of Nitrate for High&#8208;Voltage Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating the ethereal backbones into ester solvents and designing new organic nitrates, the high solubility of nitrate salt into the ester electrolyte is successfully achieved. The electrolyte containing new organic nitrate and designed ester solvent exhibits excellent cycle stability for Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) batteries. Consequently, 1 Ah Li||NCM811 pouch cell showcases excellent cycle stability over 150 times.








Abstract
The high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries require high&#8208;voltage cathode, low negative/positive capacity (N/P) ratio and lean electrolyte. Despite the all&#8208;fluorinated electrolytes with severe corrosion, the development of ester electrolytes is stagnant due to the incompatibility of ester solvent with Li metal anode. Hence, various electrolyte additives have been developed. Among them, LiNO3 is considered as the most effective electrolyte additive for improving the reversibility of Li deposition. Unfortunately, their solubility into the ester solvent is extremely low. This investigation suggests that the strong ionic bonds in LiNO3 and the low solvation energy of ester solvent are the main triggers for the insolubility of LiNO3 in the ester electrolyte. Hence, a new organic nitrate salt (N&#8208;propyl&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyrrolidinium nitrate (Py13NO3)) with large organic cations and a new liner ester solvent (dipropyleneglycol methyl ether acetate (DPGMEA)) is designed, which integrates the ethereal molecular backbones into the ester solvent. Consequently, the electrolyte containing 1.2&#160;m lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI), 0.3&#160;m Py13NO3 and 0.1&#160;m lithium disfluorophosphate (LiPO2F2) in fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC):DPGMEA (2:8) showcases excellent electrochemical performance in high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries. Eventually, the &#8220;1 Ah level&#8221; Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) pouch cell (N/P ratio &#8776;1.2; electrolyte/capacity (E/C) ratio &#8776;2.5&#160;g Ah&#8722;1) exhibits excellent cycle life over 150 times in the designed electrolyte.

         <title>Direct Observation of Unidirectional Exciton Polaritons in Layered van der Waals Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Real&#8208;space nanoimaging of unidirectional hybridized exciton&#8208;polariton (EPs). The resolution to observe near&#8208;field SOC can be very high (down to 10&#160;nm) and the contrast can be clearly distinguished at the real&#8208;space. The work provides an alternative but more direct approach to uncover the underlying physics of optical SOC and EP properties.








Abstract
Unidirectional excitation of highly confined guided modes is essential for nanoscale energy transport, photonic integrated devices, and quantum information processing. Among various feasible approaches, the mechanism based on optical spin&#8211;orbit coupling is investigated for unidirectional routing of surface plasmons and valley exciton&#8208;polaritons, without needing the use of complicated magneto&#8208;optical effects and parity symmetry breaking. So far, the direct near&#8208;field nanoimaging of such exotic polaritonic modes based on optical spin&#8211;orbit coupling has remained elusive. Here, the real&#8208;space nanoimaging of unidirectional polaritons in van der Waals semiconductors are reported. Specifically, photonic spins are coupled into the tip of a scattering&#8208;type scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy for circular dipolar excitations of spin&#8211;orbit interactions, thus enabling the unidirectional waveguide exciton&#8208;polariton propagation with remarkable unidirectionality (ratio of spectrum amplitudes under opposite circularly polarized illumination) R = 0.291 for TM mode. Via switching to the opposite helicities, the reversed opposite directions are observed. The work offers a promising avenue for detecting and processing spin information for future communication technology at the nanoscale.

         <title>Active Organic Salts Enabling Non&#8208;Intrusive Electrolyte Presodiation Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a non&#8208;intrusive electrolyte presodiation strategy is reported. Active organic salt sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) as an electrolyte additive, which is dissolved in the electrolyte and subsequently injected into dry cells. During cell charging, the salt undergoes anodic oxidation, releasing active Na ions to compensate for capacity loss. Meanwhile, the organic ligand (&#8208;SCN) dimerizes to form the electrolyte cosolvent NCS&#8208;SCN.








Abstract
Na&#8208;ion batteries show great promise, but their practical utilization is hindered by irreversible Na&#8208;ion loss during cell formation, resulting in initial coulombic efficiencies typically below 80%. Conventional presodiation methods, which involve solid additives in the cathode, can compromise electrode integrity and leave deteriorated residues, especially with high Na ion compensation (20%). An electrolyte presodiation approach is introduced that utilizes sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) as an electrolyte additive, discovered through cheminformatics and machine learning. This organic salt decomposes at 3.3&#8211;4.0&#160;V, releasing active Na ions and forming a cosolvent without damaging the electrode and the cell, as confirmed by spectroscopic and microscopic analyses. The method improves the initial coulombic efficiency of a hard carbon|P2&#8208;Na2/3Ni1/3Mn1/3Ti1/3O2 pouch cell from 80.8% to 95.2%, with a capacity retention of 84.5% over 400 cycles.

     alt="Active Organic Salts Enabling Non-Intrusive Electrolyte Presodiation Strategy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, a non-intrusive electrolyte presodiation strategy is reported. Active organic salt sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) as an electrolyte additive, which is dissolved in the electrolyte and subsequently injected into dry cells. During cell charging, the salt undergoes anodic oxidation, releasing active Na ions to compensate for capacity loss. Meanwhile, the organic ligand (-SCN) dimerizes to form the electrolyte cosolvent NCS-SCN.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na-ion batteries show great promise, but their practical utilization is hindered by irreversible Na-ion loss during cell formation, resulting in initial coulombic efficiencies typically below 80%. Conventional presodiation methods, which involve solid additives in the cathode, can compromise electrode integrity and leave deteriorated residues, especially with high Na ion compensation (20%). An electrolyte presodiation approach is introduced that utilizes sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) as an electrolyte additive, discovered through cheminformatics and machine learning. This organic salt decomposes at 3.3&#8211;4.0&#160;V, releasing active Na ions and forming a cosolvent without damaging the electrode and the cell, as confirmed by spectroscopic and microscopic analyses. The method improves the initial coulombic efficiency of a hard carbon|P2-Na&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cell from 80.8% to 95.2%, with a capacity retention of 84.5% over 400 cycles. These findings present a practical and non-intrusive way to address Na-ion deficiency challenges in Na-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lead Derivative&#8208;Based Precursor Engineering Enables Halogen&#8208;Uniform Perovskite Solar Cells with Enhanced Stability and Mechanical Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite solar cells achieve high efficiency and stability using lead derivative (nPbI2:1PbXA) to minimize halide segregation. This approach enhances mechanical resistance and yields efficiencies of 21.3% and 20.3% in all&#8208;inorganic and hybrid wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites, retaining &gt;90% efficiency after 1500 h under maximum power point tracking.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with supreme opto&#8208;electrical properties and solution&#8208;processability have attracted tremendous interest. To realize state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiencies in PSCs, delicate control of bandgap (E
g) is required, which generally involves using mixed halogens. This, however, can result in unfavorable phase segregation to negatively influence on the target efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. Herein, a viable precursor method is demonstrated for preparing halide&#8208;uniform perovskites based on lead derivatives of nPbI2:1PbXA. It is found that nPbI2:1PbXA enables tuning the bonding preference and strength between PbI2 and PbBr2 in the precursor, leading to generating stable &#8208;I&#8208;Br&#8208;I&#8208;Br&#8208; fragments, which eventually minimizes halide segregation in the perovskite. The precursor approach have been applied to a series of wide&#8208;bandgap mixed halide perovskites, achieving boosted efficiencies of 21.3% and 20.3% in CsPbI2.8Br0.2 (bandgap of 1.74&#160;eV) and Cs0.2FA0.8I1.9Br1.1 (bandgap of 1.77&#160;eV) based solar cells. Interestingly, the connection between the modified halide homogeneity and mechanical tolerance is found: the better the uniformity in the halide distribution, the higher the mechanical resistance of the perovskite to compressive or bending forces. The solar cells with modified halogen uniformity exhibit impressive long&#8208;term stability, with the retention of &gt;90% of the initial efficiencies after 1500 h of continuous illumination under maximum power point tracking.

         <title>A Robust and Tough Composite Hydrogel Electrolyte with Anion&#8208;Locked Supramolecular Network for Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite hydrogel electrolyte is prepared by constructing a 3D supramolecular network. The hydrogel electrolyte possesses good mechanical properties, superior ionic conductivity, and high zinc ion transference number, which can inhibit dendrite growth, enable uniform zinc deposition, achieve long cycle life, and realize high capacity retention.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes have garnered extensive attention in zinc ion batteries due to their excellent flexibility and good safety. However, their limited mechanical properties, low ionic conductivity, and poor Zn2+ transference number pose significant challenges for developing high&#8208;performance zinc ion batteries. Herein, this work constructs a 3D supramolecular network capable of locking anions and active water molecules through the abundant hydrogen bonding interactions between aramid nanofibers, polyvinyl alcohol, and anions. This network synergistically enhances the mechanical properties (with a mechanical strength of 0.88&#160;MPa and a toughness of 3.28&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), ionic conductivity (4.22 S m&#8722;1), and Zn2+ transference number (0.78). As a result, the supramolecular composite hydrogel electrolyte can effectively inhibit dendrite growth and side reactions, facilitate interface regulation, and enable uniform zinc deposition. The Zn anode exhibits a cycle life of 1500&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 5 mAh cm&#8722;2, with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.1% over 600 cycles. Additionally, the Zn||polyaniline full cell maintains a high capacity retention of 78% after 9100 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. The assembled pouch cells demonstrate good flexibility, deformability, and compression resistance. This work provides valuable insights into the design of high&#8208;performance hydrogel electrolytes for zinc ion batteries.

         <title>Ultrasound Tip&#8208;Assisted Piezotronic Transduction in Monolayer MoS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric transduction in monolayer MoS2 is demonstrated using an ultrasound tip (&#160;100 kHz) from a wire bonder. Transient current measurements reveal sharp peaks with high peak&#8208;to&#8208;base ratios, tunable via gate voltage and ultrasound power. Multiple acoustic wave reflections enhance signal linewidth, validated by microacoustic simulations, establishing a robust platform for ultrasound&#8208;driven piezoelectric sensing.








Abstract
The interaction of ultrasonic waves with piezoelectric materials provides a quantitative route to enhance electrical and mechanical coupling in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. Here, wire&#8208;bonding tip&#8208;assisted ultrasound (&#8776;100 kHz) is presented as an effective approach to achieve piezoelectric transduction in monolayer MoS2 on Si/SiO2 substrates. Transient current measurements show reproducible sharp peaks with a peak&#8208;to&#8208;base ratio (Ipeak/Ibase &#8776; 12) unique to monolayer MoS2, under an impact duration of 10&#8211;100 ms. Electrostatic gate voltage (Vg) and ultrasound power (WP) tunable piezocurrent exhibit 3&#8211;5 times higher sensitivity in the ON&#8208;state (Vg &#10878; 0) compared to the OFF&#8208;state. Multiple reflections of acoustic waves at source&#8208;drain electrodes, with an increment in reflection coefficients, enhance the linewidth of peak currents, validated by microacoustic simulations of surface acoustic wave (SAW) propagation in submicron geometries. The localized strain and Joule heating under ultrasonic excitation may generate a temperature rise of &#8776;20 K, which reduces activation energy barriers, potentially enhancing reaction rates in temperature&#8208;sensitive chemical processes, such as hydrogen peroxide decomposition. This thermal&#8208;damage&#8208;free method integrates with silicon&#8208;based fabrication, establishing a robust platform for on&#8208;chip catalysis and energy harvesting in FET&#8208;based&#160;piezotransducers.

         <title>Rational Design of a Bilayer Interface for Long&#8208;Term Stability of Zn Anodes and MnO2 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bilayer electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface engineering strategy is presented to introduce sodium thioctate into bare ZnSO4 electrolytes. Benefiting from the bilayer electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, optimized solvation structure, and reconstructed inner Helmholtz plane, the resulting Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries exhibit prominent cycling stability. This work provides effective guidance for the rational design of safe and long&#8208;life aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Understanding the composition&#8211;characteristics&#8211;performance relationship of the electrolyte&#8211;electric double layer&#8211;electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface (EEI) is crucial to construct stable EEIs for high&#8208;performance aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO2 batteries (AZMBs). However, the interaction mechanisms in AZMBs remain unclear. This work introduces sodium thioctate (ST) into ZnSO4 electrolyte to construct a stable bilayer EEI on both Zn and MnO2 electrodes. First, zincophilic ST regulates the solvation structure of hydrated Zn2+, suppressing corrosion and the hydrogen evolution reaction. Second, the specific adsorption of ST reconstructs the inner Helmholtz plane, facilitating the desolvation of hydrated Zn2+ and homogenizing charge distribution.

&lt;p&gt;A bilayer electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface engineering strategy is presented to introduce sodium thioctate into bare ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrolytes. Benefiting from the bilayer electrode-electrolyte interface, optimized solvation structure, and reconstructed inner Helmholtz plane, the resulting Zn&#8722;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries exhibit prominent cycling stability. This work provides effective guidance for the rational design of safe and long-life aqueous zinc-ion batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the composition&#8211;characteristics&#8211;performance relationship of the electrolyte&#8211;electric double layer&#8211;electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface (EEI) is crucial to construct stable EEIs for high-performance aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries (AZMBs). However, the interaction mechanisms in AZMBs remain unclear. This work introduces sodium thioctate (ST) into ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte to construct a stable bilayer EEI on both Zn and MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrodes. First, zincophilic ST regulates the solvation structure of hydrated Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, suppressing corrosion and the hydrogen evolution reaction. Second, the specific adsorption of ST reconstructs the inner Helmholtz plane, facilitating the desolvation of hydrated Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and homogenizing charge distribution. Finally, ST molecules undergo reversible polymerization at the interface, forming a stable bilayer EEI with a poly(zinc thioctate) outer layer and a ZnS&#8211;organic amorphous inner layer, which ensures uniform zinc-ion flux and enhances mechanical stability. Additionally, the dynamic disulfide bonds in ST further enable self-regulation and self-healing of the interface, mitigating damage during cycling. As a result, the ST-enhanced Zn symmetric battery achieves 7800 cycles at 60&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, while the AZMB exhibits only 0.0014% capacity decay over 10&#160;000 cycles at 2000&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This bilayer EEI engineering strategy offers effective guidance for the rational design of safe and long-life aqueous zinc-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processable PEDOT for Organic Solar Cells: From One&#8208;Pot Synthesis to Kinetically&#8208;Controlled Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>

It is shown that the synthesis of solution&#8208;processable poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) hole transporting materials (HTMs) follows the principle of oxidative polymerization&#8208;induced electrostatic self&#8208;assembly (OPIESA), with the kinetic behavior strongly correlated to the volume of the polyanion matrix, and propose a kinetically&#8208;controlled polymerization (KCP) approach to synthesize solution&#8208;processable, high&#8208;performance PEDOT HTMs by halting the polymerization at certain stages within a low&#8208;volume polyanion matrix.








Abstract
The updating of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole transporting material (HTM) is crucial for organic solar cells (OSCs). Despite decades of development in PEDOT:PSS and its derivatives, a comprehensive understanding of their supramolecular polymerization mechanisms remains elusive, precluding the attainment of the optimal architectures and functions. Herein, it is shown that the synthesis of PEDOT:PSS follows the principle of oxidative polymerization&#8208;induced electrostatic self&#8208;assembly, with the kinetic behavior strongly correlated to the volume of PSS polyanion matrix. Moreover, a kinetically controlled polymerization approach is proposed to synthesize PEDOT HTMs with exceptional time efficiency by prematurely halting the rapid polymerization process within a low&#8208;volume PSS matrix. The reduced interference from PSS confers unique advantages to the methodology in achieving highly oxidized and interconnected PEDOTs. This leads to comprehensive improvements in the physico&#8208;chemical properties of PEDOT:PSS, significantly enhancing OSC efficiency to 20.04%. Furthermore, the optimized PEDOT maintains exceptional semiconducting characteristics and outstanding OSC efficiency even at an unprecedentedly high PSS insulator content of 94.12%. The substantial increase in loading significantly amplifies the manifestation of polyanion functionalities, such as improving colloidal stability, thereby facilitating the resurgence of previously underutilized naphthalene sulfonate polyanion in the fabrication of high&#8208;quality, solution&#8208;processable PEDOT HTMs.

         <title>Understanding Multi&#8208;Stage Charge Storage on Nanoporous Carbons in Zn&#8208;Ion Hybrid Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous carbons with tunable pore sizes are synthesized to investigate the impact of pore size on charge storage in Zn&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors. An unusual multi&#8208;stage charge storage mechanism is revealed, involving a transition from capacitive Zn2+ ion storage to faradaic Had adsorption on the carbon surface, providing new insights into Zn&#8208;ion electrochemistry.








Abstract
Zn&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (ZIHCs) are promising high&#8208;power energy storage devices. However, the underlying charge storage mechanisms, especially the influence of proton storage, remain poorly understood. Herein, the model porous carbons are synthesized having similar specific surface areas (SSAs) and surface chemistry but different pore sizes. They highlight the role of supermicropores and small mesopores (0.86&#8211;4&#160;nm) enabling a high capacity of 198 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (capacitance of 446 F&#160;g&#8722;1), while larger mesopores (4&#8211;13&#160;nm) significantly enhance cycling stability, exceeding 0.6 million cycles. Electrochemical studies, including EQCM analysis, reveal a 4&#8208;stage charge&#8208;storage process under cathodic polarization, comprising adsorption and desolvation of hydrated Zn2+ ions, followed by water reduction, catalyzed by Zn2+, and formation of Had. The rising pH leads to the formation of insoluble zinc hydroxysulfate hydrates (ZHS). Depending on the pore architecture, the precipitation of ZHS has different effects on the overall stability of cycling. The study overall: (i) presents a simplified method for pore control in carbon synthesis; (ii) discuss the effect of pore size on charge storage and cycling stability in respect of ZHS formation; (iii) sheds light on the charge storage mechanism indicating the important contribution of cation effect known from electrocatalysis on faradaic charge storage mechanism.

         <title>Phototunable Rayleigh 3D Soft Self&#8208;Oscillator Enabling Versatile Biomimetic Tubular Peristaltic Pumping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging biomechanical strategy based on two direction&#8208;and&#8208;dimension&#8208;tubular instabilities: postbuckling and snapping, it has created a phototunable Rayleigh 3D soft self&#8208;oscillator with direction/dimension/symmetry tunable self&#8208;oscillating deformations, which allow for controllable manipulation of spatiotemporal 3D motions of local tubular walls to achieve high&#8208;DOF, multimodal, autonomous biomimetic tubular peristaltic pumping that can adapt to transporting a variety of matter.








Abstract
Living tubular organs can spatiotemporally and cyclically deform their muscular walls to implement adaptable and sustainable peristaltic pumping applicable to broad matter, achieved via asymmetric and non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;oscillating deformations of muscular walls. However, man&#8208;made tubular soft actuators have been limited to pumping a few simple matters, because of their reciprocal and monotonic wall motions that cannot break time&#8208;reversal symmetry and system equilibrium to gain adaptable and sustainable pumping. Here, a phototunable Rayleigh 3D soft self&#8208;oscillator (PR3DSSO) capable of multimodal, nonreciprocal, self&#8208;sustainable wall deformations is presented. PR3DSSO's design leverages two direction&#8208;and&#8208;dimension&#8208;phototunable tubular instabilities: snapping and postbuckling. The post&#8208;buckling instability can generate local&#8208;wall origami which cannot only fold local walls into multimodal shape&#8208;mode waves, but also break wall&#8208;motion symmetry; snapping instabilities help break equilibrium in wall motions to initiate autonomous wall motions. These phototunable&#8208;instabilities&#8208;driven wall deformations unprecedentedly create Rayleigh&#8208;like 3D wall motions, which allow for versatile biomimetic tubular peristaltic pumping adapt to broad matter. Our PR3DSSO would spur creative life&#8208;like active&#8208;material designs and novel pumping functions.

         <title>Robust Homogeneous Segmented Power Generator Driven by Sb2Te3&#8208;Based Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cd&#8211;S co&#8208;alloying&#8208;induced microstructural evolution enables high&#8208;performance Sb2Te3&#8208;based thermoelectrics. Subsequently, an innovative full&#8208;scale Bi&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te segmented power generator is fabricated, extending the operational range of conventional Bi2Te3&#8208;based modules from 500 to 650 K and achieving an exceptional efficiency of 9.3% under a distinct &#916;T = 350 K. Notably, it exhibits remarkable stability after 80&#8208;cycle thermal shock and 160&#8208;h thermal durability, highlighting great potential for low&#8208;grade waste heat recovery.








Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) technology offers a promising solution for waste heat recovery, particularly in applications involving abundant low&#8208;grade heat (&lt;650 K). However, for over half a century, TE power generators have predominantly relied on Bi2Te3 alloys with limited efficiencies below 7%.

&lt;p&gt;The Cd&#8211;S co-alloying-induced microstructural evolution enables high-performance Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based thermoelectrics. Subsequently, an innovative full-scale Bi&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te segmented power generator is fabricated, extending the operational range of conventional Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based modules from 500 to 650 K and achieving an exceptional efficiency of 9.3% under a distinct &#916;&lt;i&gt;T =&lt;/i&gt; 350 K. Notably, it exhibits remarkable stability after 80-cycle thermal shock and 160-h thermal durability, highlighting great potential for low-grade waste heat recovery.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thermoelectric (TE) technology offers a promising solution for waste heat recovery, particularly in applications involving abundant low-grade heat (&amp;lt;650 K). However, for over half a century, TE power generators have predominantly relied on Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; alloys with limited efficiencies below 7%. Herein, Cd and S are doped into Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to promote microstructural regulation characterized by dense twin boundaries and dislocations, resulting in a 45% reduction of lattice thermal conductivity at 300 K. Combined with the optimized density-of-states effective mass and expanded band gap, the Cd&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;1.96&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2.94&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;0.06&lt;/sub&gt; sample attains a peak &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; of 1.1 at 650 K and an average &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; of 1.0 from 500 to 650 K, while exhibiting remarkable compressive and bending strengths of 197 and 56&#160;MPa.

         <title>Optical Synaptic Devices with Multiple Encryption Features Based on SERS&#8208;Revealed Charge&#8208;Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid R6G/InSe structure is designed, and the charge transfer mechanism within this structure is validated using SERS. This structure effectively emulates biological synapses, comprising a presynaptic membrane (R6G photosensitive layer), synaptic cleft (R6G/InSe interface), and postsynaptic membrane (InSe sensing layer). The charge transfer process in this structure closely mirrors the neurotransmitter transfer across the synaptic cleft. Surface treatment techniques are employed to regulate the charge transfer process, enabling multiple on&#8208;chip encryption anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications to be developed.








Abstract
2D optical synaptic devices with atomic&#8208;scale thickness show potential for building highly integrated tunable artificial visual neural networks. However, their atomic&#8208;scale thickness also leads to weak light absorption, limiting device photoresponse. Here, a high&#8208;performance optical synaptic device based on a Rhodamine 6G (R6G)/InSe hybrid structure is proposed, achieving a remarkable 328.9% enhancement in photoresponse compared to InSe devices. Using surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) as a nondestructive probing technique, it is demonstrated that light&#8208;induced charge transfer between R6G and InSe is the key mechanism enabling the device's high performance. Furthermore, introducing a self&#8208;limited oxide layer on the InSe surface provides additional evidence for the charge transfer process. This charge&#8208;transfer&#8208;based device effectively mimics the neurotransmitter transmission process in biological synapses, showing unique potential in applications such as image preprocessing and decoding within artificial neural networks. In addition, through surface treatment techniques, precise control over the charge transfer process is achieved, enabling the design of a multiple encryption&#8208;based anti&#8208;counterfeiting array and highlighting their value in on&#8208;chip anti&#8208;counterfeiting. By employing a spectrally noninvasive method to probe charge transfer, this study elucidates the critical role of charge transfer in optical synaptic devices and opens novel application pathways.

         <title>Interfacial Thermal Transport and Energy Dissipation in Multilayer PdSe2 Field Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the high&#8208;field breakdown and energy dissipation of multilayer PdSe2 FETs, with a focus on the interfacial thermal transport at the PdSe2/SiO2 interface. The research proposes optimization strategies to enhance device performance and improve the thermal management, paving the way for the more efficient next&#8208;generation electronic and optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
The continuous miniaturization of 2D electronic circuits results in increased power density during device operation, leading to heat localization and placing higher demands on their performance thresholds. The risk to thermal breakdown and subsequent damage, due to the energy dissipation in the 2D semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) supported on the bulk substrates, represents a significant challenge in maintaining their optimal performance. Herein, this study investigates energy dissipation behavior in multilayer PdSe2 FETs for the first time. The high&#8208;field breakdown behavior is firstly studied in multilayer PdSe2 FETs on SiO2/Si substrates, where a maximum current density of &#8776;2.74 MA cm&#8722;2 is observed, which is comparable to that of multilayer black phosphorus FET and significantly higher&#8212;by about five times&#8212;than that of multilayer MoS2 FET. Additionally, the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of PdSe2/SiO2 interface is measured at room temperature using Raman thermometry. The TBC is found to be &#8776;12&#8211;13 MW m&#8722;2 K&#8722;1, which is relatively low compared to the other known solid&#8211;solid interfaces, indicating that enhancing the performance of PdSe2 FETs can be possible by optimizing the TBC at the PdSe2/SiO2 interface. These findings provide valuable insights for design of high&#8208;quality and high&#8208;performance PdSe2 electronic and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Enabling High Performance in a Positive Potential of Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis Over Mesoporous Core@Shell Cu2O/Cu@PdCu Nanozyme</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous core@shell Cu2O/Cu@PdCu nanozymes are demonstrated as efficient tandem electrocatalyst for highly selective NH3 electrosynthesis from NO3&#8722; at fairly positive potentials. Meanwhile, this enzyme&#8208;like electrocatalyst performs perfectly in the two&#8208;electrode coupling system for cathode NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 and anode ethanol oxidation in a more energy&#8208;efficient manner.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic tandem nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3) offers a promising pathway for energy and environmental sustainability. Although considerable efforts have been presented to modulate the reaction pathways for enhanced NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 electrocatalysis, these advances often require relatively high overpotentials to balance yield rate and selectivity of NH3, resulting in a remarkable energy inefficiency. Inspired by enzyme catalysis in nature, herein a tandem enzyme&#8208;like electrocatalyst is designed consisting of a core of Cu2O/Cu heterojunction surrounded by mesoporous PdCu shell (Cu2O/Cu@mesoPdCu) that accelerated NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 electrocatalysis in positive potentials. Impressively, Cu2O/Cu@mesoPdCu nanozymes hold superior performance for robust NH3 electrosynthesis in a fairly positive potential of 0.10&#160;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode), having Faraday efficiency of 96.2%, yield rate of 13.3&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1, and half&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 46.0%. Kinetic studies, in situ spectra and density functional theory calculations revealed that Cu2O/Cu core preferentially adsorbed NO3&#8722; and further reduced to *NO2, while active hydrogen radicals enriched on PdCu shell promoted multistep hydrodeoxygenation of *NO2 to NH3 within &#8220;semi&#8208;closed&#8221; mesoporous microenvironment, both of which synergistically enabled tandem electrocatalysis in positive potentials. Moreover, this enzyme&#8208;like electrocatalyst disclosed better NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 performance in a more energy&#8208;efficient manner when coupling with more thermodynamically favorable ethanol oxidation reaction.

         <title>Nanosized Multistate Configurations of Relaxor&#8208;Like Antiferroelectric Revealed by Atomic&#8208;Scale In Situ Electron Microscopy</title>

Atomic&#8208;scale in situ heating scanning transmission electron microscopy of the (Pb,La)(Zr,Sn,Ti)O3 materials reveals the origin of characteristic hysteresis behavior of relaxor&#8208;like antiferroelectric. The nanosized multistate configurations which encompass antiferroelectric, quasi&#8208;paraelectric, and ferroelectric nanoregions are responsible for the slim double hysteresis loops of relaxor&#8208;like antiferroelectric. Such nanosized multistate configurations break the common belief of single&#8208;phase antiferroelectric nanodomains.








Abstract
Antiferroelectric materials have garnered significant attention for their potential applications in high&#8208;power capacitors. Among the four technically important types of ferroelectric states&#8208;classical ferroelectric, relaxor ferroelectric, antiferroelectric, and relaxor antiferroelectric&#8208;the first three have well&#8208;defined physical pictures, while the fourth remains contentious. Here, atomic&#8208;scale in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy is demonstrated to provide a clear resolution to this long&#8208;standing issue. The temperature&#8208;dependent configurational evolution during the transition from room&#8208;temperature classical antiferroelectric to high&#8208;temperature relaxor&#8208;like antiferroelectric in (Pb,La)(Zr,Sn,Ti)O3 materials is directly observed. The nanosized multistate configurations formed during transformation, which encompass antiferroelectric, quasi&#8208;paraelectric, and ferroelectric nanoregions, are responsible for the slim double hysteresis loops characteristic of relaxor&#8208;like antiferroelectric. These findings offer new guidelines for validating the physical models essential for the development of high&#8208;performance relaxor&#8208;like antiferroelectrics.

         <title>Azepination&#8208;Induced Frontier Molecular Orbital Delocalization of Multiple Resonance Emitters: Constructing Highly Efficient Narrowband Electroluminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for azepination&#8208;induced frontier molecular orbital (FMO) delocalization of multiple resonance (MR) emitters is proposed to construct long&#8208;wavelength MR materials. Organic light&#8208;emitting diode based on m&#8208;PAz&#8208;BNCz exhibits excellent electroluminescence performances with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.26, 0.70) and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 36.2%.








Abstract
Developing diversified construction strategies for high&#8208;color&#8208;purity and efficient multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials is a major strategic demand to meet the requirements of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) displays, posing a significant challenge to the design and synthesis of emitters at the molecular level. Herein, a strategy is proposed for azepination&#8208;induced frontier molecular orbital (FMO) delocalization of MR emitters, that is, embedding azepine into the prototype molecule BNCz can effectively improve the &#960;&#8208;conjugation degree and extend the FMO delocalization, thereby constructing a series of long&#8208;wavelength MR&#8208;TADF materials with narrowband emission. Through an intramolecular Scholl reaction, these target molecules with an azepine&#8208;embedded core are afforded by one&#8208;fold heptagonal cyclization of BNCz core and the phenyl ring attached to (aromatic amine&#8208;substituted) aryl precursor. They all exhibit efficient green emission around 520&#160;nm and narrow full&#8208;widths at half&#8208;maximum (FWHMs) of &#8804; 37&#160;nm in toluene. OLEDs employing these emitters show excellent electroluminescence (EL) performances, among which m&#8208;PAz&#8208;BNCz&#8208;based OLED exhibits the optimal EL performances with a peak of 528&#160;nm, a FWHM of 37&#160;nm, Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.26, 0.70), and a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.2%.

         <title>Simultaneously Tailoring Hydrostability and Photoelectroactivity in Heterocluster Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first heterocluster&#8208;based crystalline MOF photocatalysts integrating copper&#8208;sulfur and copper&#8208;halide clusters are obtained through the heterocluster assembly engineering and localized microenvironment regulation, demonstrating an unprecedented synergistic enhancement of hydrostability and photoelectroactivity, facilitating the efficient synthesis of green hydrogen at an exceptionally high rate under visible light.








Abstract
The simultaneous enhancement of structural stability and photoelectroactivity in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) remains a critical challenge for sustainable photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production. Herein, an atomically&#8208;precise heterocluster assembly approach is presented to construct two isostructural 3D MOFs, CuSL&#8208;CuX (X = Cl, Br), featuring a cds net. CuSL&#8208;CuXs integrate hexanuclear copper&#8208;sulfur {Cu6S6} cluster and dinuclear copper&#8208;halogen {Cu2X2} cluster, which not only impart exceptional stability across a broad pH range (1&#8211;14) but also enable wide visible&#8208;light absorption, tailored redox potentials, and efficient charge&#8208;carrier dynamics. Notably, halogen substitution markedly boosts photocatalytic activity: CuSL&#8208;CuBr achieves an efficient H2 evolution rate of 50.28&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 without noble metals, doubling that of CuSL&#8208;CuCl (26.99&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) and surpassing most reported MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Both experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that bromine substitution optimizes electronic structure, refines orbital distribution, and accelerates charge separation, ultimately leading to promoted photocatalytic efficiency. This research provides insights into the structure&#8208;property interplay in heterocluster MOFs and establishes a paradigm for designing robust, high&#8208;performance photocatalysts through precise cluster engineering.

         <title>Suppression of Charge Recombination Induced by Solid Additive Assisting Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency over 20%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work highlights the strong morphological optimization capacity of the solid additive DIDOB and elucidates its impact on molecular packing to suppress both bimolecular and geminate recombination in OSCs. As a result, DIDOB not only demonstrates universality in various non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based OSCs but also achieves an impressive efficiency of 20.11% with a remarkable fill factor of 81.8% in the D18:PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based device.








Abstract
A volatile solid additive strategy, which can effectively optimize the morphology of the photoactive layer with an ideal domain size and purity, has emerged as a promising approach to improve the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the precise role of solid additives in modulating charge and exciton dynamics, especially the recombination process, remains not fully understand. In this study, a solid additive, 1,4&#8208;diiodo&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxybenzene (DIDOB), is developed to improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs and conduct a comprehensive investigation into its effect on the charge recombination process. As a result, the PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X&#8208;based binary OSC processed with DIDOB achieves an excellent efficiency of 19.75% with a remarkable fill factor of 81.9%, owing to the optimal fiber network morphology, tighter and ordered molecular packing, as well as the suppression of both bimolecular and geminate recombination. Notably, the DIDOB exhibits broad universality as an additive in other non&#8208;fullerene acceptor&#8208;based OSCs. Impressively, the D18:PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based ternary device processed with DIDOB yielded an excellent efficiency of 20.11% (certified as 20.03%). This work highlights the effect of the solid additive on the charge recombination process within active layer and provides insights for the further development of OSCs.

         <title>Salt&#8208;Segregated Solid Polymer Electrolytes for High&#8208;Rate Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a salt&#8208;segregation strategy for solid polymer electrolytes, which decouples surface and bulk salt distribution to form an ion&#8208;enriched surface layer. The design dramatically enhances the lithium deposition kinetics and suppresses parasitic reactions, empowering Li||LiFePO4 solid&#8208;state batteries with exceptional cycling over 20&#160;000 cycles at high&#8208;rate of 1.12&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;polymer electrolytes (SPEs) demonstrate great potential for solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs), however, interfacial instability and sluggish ion transport at the interface critically hinder their high&#8208;rate capability and long&#8208;term stability. Here, a novel salt&#8208;segregation methodology with spatial salt grade for SPEs is introduced. This approach leverages the differential solubility of lithium salts and PVDF matrix in a commercially available fluoroethylene carbonate during fabrication, which drives the formation of an ion&#8208;enriched surface layer. The strategy simultaneously enhances interfacial and bulk ionic conductivity while effectively mitigating parasitic reactions. These advancements optimize Li+ flux at the lithium metal interphase, promoting a spherical Li growth with minimized surface area and leading to dense lithium deposition. Consequently, the engineered SPE achieves a remarkable cycling of 500&#160;h in Li||Li cells at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Solid&#8208;state Li||LiFePO4 cells exhibit a record stability for 20&#160;000 cycles at 1.12 A&#160;g&#8722;1 (2&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 LiFePO4 cathode), and a high capacity of 147&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 over 300 cycles at 0.84&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 under a high&#8208;loading 2&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 cathode. The strategy addresses interfacial limitations in SPEs and further introduces a paradigm shift by emphasizing the critical role of spatial salt&#8208;graded engineering at the surface over uniform ion distribution for stabilizing high&#8208;rate SSLBs.

         <title>Enhanced Deformability Through Distributed Buckling in Stiff Quasicrystalline Architected Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasi&#8208;periodic metamaterials combine stiffness and large&#8208;strain deformability, overcoming limitations of traditional stretching&#8208;dominated periodic designs that are prone to global buckling instabilities and catastrophic layer collapses. By leveraging non&#8208;uniform force chains, they achieve high isotropic stiffness, stable deformation, and remarkable failure resistance. Supported by numerical and experimental results, these advances open pathways for low&#8208;density applications in impact resistance and energy absorption.








Abstract
Architected materials achieve unique mechanical properties through precisely engineered microstructures that minimize material usage. However, a key challenge of low&#8208;density materials is balancing high stiffness with stable deformability up to large strains. Current microstructures, which employ slender elements such as thin beams and plates arranged in periodic patterns to optimize stiffness, are largely prone to instabilities, including buckling and brittle collapse at low strains. This challenge is here addressed by introducing a new class of aperiodic architected materials inspired by quasicrystalline lattices. Beam networks derived from canonical quasicrystalline patterns, such as the Penrose tiling in two dimensions and icosahedral quasicrystals (IQCs)&#160;in three dimensions, are shown to create stiff, stretching&#8208;dominated topologies with non&#8208;uniform force chain distributions, effectively mitigating the global instabilities observed in periodic designs through distributed localized buckling instabilities. Numerical and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of these designs in combining stiffness and stable deformability at large strains, representing a significant advancement in the development of low&#8208;density metamaterials for applications requiring high impact resistance and energy absorption. These results demonstrate the potential of deterministic quasi&#8208;periodic topologies to bridge the gap between periodic and random structures, while branching toward uncharted territory in the property space of architected&#160;materials.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Photonic Battery Enabling Dynamic Radiative Thermal Management and Power Supply</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;functional photonic battery is proposed for dynamic radiative cooling, energy storage and recycling. The dynamic thermal regulation properties significantly reduce building energy consumption and CO&#8322; emissions. Meanwhile, its efficient energy storage and recycling capacities can minimize or even eliminate household power outage durations. This innovative approach advances sustainable building practices and contributes to global carbon neutrality and sustainability efforts.








Abstract
Dynamic thermal management materials are pivotal for advancing energy&#8208;efficient buildings and promoting global sustainability. However, existing materials typically offer only a single&#8208;function of temperature regulation, lacking the integrated power supply capability essential for sustaining indoor activities and building sustainability, particularly in the face of frequent power outages. A photonic battery that combines all&#8208;season dynamic radiative thermoregulation with electrical power supply in a single silicon&#8208;based unit is demonstrated. This device delivers dual functionality with high infrared emissivity regulation (0.53 at 8&#8211;13&#160;&#181;m) and superior energy storage performance, featuring a high specific capacity (&#8776;3271 mAh g&#8722;1), areal capacity (&#8776;0.38 mAh cm&#8722;2), and efficient energy recycling (71.6%). A reversible ion&#8208;interaction&#8208;induced phase change mechanism, enabling continuous and non&#8208;volatile electro&#8208;optical&#8208;thermal transformation and significant infrared tunability, is proposed. Our simulations indicate that the implementation of these dynamic materials into buildings could significantly reduce energy consumption by up to 18.4%, equating to 544.8 GJ, and achieve an annual reduction in CO2 emissions of 124.1 tons. This work paves the way for the development of energy&#8208;saving electro&#8208;driven dynamic materials, marking a significant step forward in global sustainability initiatives.

         <title>Reprogrammable Mechanical Metamaterials via Passive and Active Magnetic Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of flexible matrices with embedded hard&#8208;magnetic nodes enables metastructures with reprogrammable mechanical properties, even in the absence of external magnetic fields. The evolving interaction between nodes during structural deformation allows mechanical tunability under quasi&#8208;static and dynamic loading, and bistable transitions. This approach enables engineered structural components with adaptable mechanical responses, reprogrammable via magnetic element redistribution or applied fields.








Abstract
This study experimentally demonstrates the reprogrammability of a rotating&#8208;squares&#8208;based mechanical metamaterial with an embedded array of permanent magnets. How the orientation, residual magnetization, and stiffness of the magnets influence both the static and dynamic responses of the metamaterial is systematically investigated. It is showed that by carefully tuning the magnet orientation within the metamaterial, notable tunability of the metamaterial response can be achieved across static and dynamic regimes. More complex magnetic node configurations can optimize specific structural responses by decoupling the tunability of quasi&#8208;static stress&#8211;strain behavior from energy absorption under impact loading. Additionally, reprogrammability can be further enhanced by an external magnetic field, which modulates magnetic interactions within the structure. This work paves the way for developing engineered structural components with adaptable mechanical responses, reprogrammable through either the redistribution of magnetic elements or the application of an external magnetic&#160;field.

         <title>Mechanically Enhanced, Environmentally Stable, and Bioinspired Charge&#8208;Gradient Hydrogel Membranes for Efficient Ion Gradient Power Generation and Linear Self&#8208;Powered Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the presence of an ion gradient, the constructed charge gradients in the ultrathin ion&#8208;selective hydrogel membranes of hydrogel solid&#8208;state electric organ accelerate ion transport while mitigating ion concentration polarization, achieving high electrical output performance. More interestingly, the prepared device can still be applied as a linear self&#8208;powered pressure sensor after the ion gradient is completely dissipated.








Abstract
The soft hydrogel power source is an interesting example of generating electricity from clean energy. However, ion&#8208;selective hydrogel membranes in the systems are often limited by low ion selectivity, high membrane resistance, insufficient mass transfer, and ion concentration polarization, resulting in a generally low power output. Inspired by the unique structure of the electric ray's electric organ, a vertically stacked hydrogel artificial electric organ is proposed, aiming to increase the output current to a greater extent. By constructing the charge gradient in ultrathin ion&#8208;selective hydrogel membranes, ion transport is accelerated while mitigating the ion concentration polarization.

&lt;p&gt;In the presence of an ion gradient, the constructed charge gradients in the ultrathin ion-selective hydrogel membranes of hydrogel solid-state electric organ accelerate ion transport while mitigating ion concentration polarization, achieving high electrical output performance. More interestingly, the prepared device can still be applied as a linear self-powered pressure sensor after the ion gradient is completely dissipated.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soft hydrogel power source is an interesting example of generating electricity from clean energy. However, ion-selective hydrogel membranes in the systems are often limited by low ion selectivity, high membrane resistance, insufficient mass transfer, and ion concentration polarization, resulting in a generally low power output. Inspired by the unique structure of the electric ray's electric organ, a vertically stacked hydrogel artificial electric organ is proposed, aiming to increase the output current to a greater extent. By constructing the charge gradient in ultrathin ion-selective hydrogel membranes, ion transport is accelerated while mitigating the ion concentration polarization. A single hydrogel artificial electric organ achieves high outputs of &#8776;290&#160;mV and &#8776;1.46&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with rechargeability, surpassing similar devices. Density functional theory further reveals that the energy barrier of ion transport in charge-gradient membranes is lower than that in nongradient membranes. More impressively, the device can still be applied as a linear self-powered pressure sensor for monitoring human activities after the ion gradient is completely dissipated. This study elucidates the key role of the structure and design of ion-selective membranes in the artificial gel power generation system, providing new insights into the further development and multifunctional application of flexible gel power source.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Buried Interface Regulation with a Supramolecular Assembled Template Enables High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells for Minimizing the VOC Deficit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled amphiphilic phosphonate&#8208;based supramolecule functions as a perovskite crystallization&#8208;driven template at SnO2/perovskite buried interface, which induces a highly preferred (100) orientation toward out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction, facilitates carrier extraction and transfer, passivates the intrinsic defects, and achieves a promising efficiency of 25.34%, with a maximum VOC of 1.23 V, corresponding to the lowest reported 0.306 V deficit.








Abstract
Despite the rapid development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in the past decade, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of PSCs still lags behind the theoretical Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit. Energy&#8208;level mismatch and unwanted nonradiative recombination at key interfaces are the main factors detrimental to VOC. Herein, a perovskite crystallization&#8208;driven template is constructed at the SnO2/perovskite buried interface through a self&#8208;assembled amphiphilic phosphonate derivative. The highly oriented supramolecular template grows from an evolutionary selection growth via solid&#8211;solid phase transition. This strategy induces perovskite crystallization into a highly preferred (100) orientation toward out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction and facilitated carrier extraction and transfer due to the elimination of energy barrier. This self&#8208;assembly process positively passivates the intrinsic surface defects at the SnO2/perovskite interface through the functionalized moieties, a marked contrast to the passive effect achieved via incidental contacts in conventional passivation methods. As a result, PSCs with buried interface modification exhibit a promising PCE of 25.34%, with a maximum VOC of 1.23&#160;V, corresponding to a mere 0.306&#160;V deficit (for perovskite bandgap of 1.536&#160;eV), reaching 97.2% of the theoretical VOC limit. This strategy spontaneously improves the long&#8208;term operational stability of PSCs under thermal and moisture stress (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3: MPP, 65 &#176;C, 50% RH, T92 lifetime exceeding 1200&#160;h).

         <title>Ferromagnetic Atomic d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization for Promoting Al&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>

This research investigates the reasons for the different polysulfide conversion abilities of ferromagnetic single&#8208;atom catalysts with varying electronic structures, indicating that spin polarization caused by unpaired electrons in 3d orbitals affects polysulfide conversion. Combined with different characterizations, the PC&#8208;SAFe has a higher number of unpaired electrons, exhibits stronger catalytic activity, promoting the conversion of S and thereby enhancing electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum&#8208;sulfur batteries (Al&#8208;S) are emerging as a promising alternative energy storage system beyond lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their high energy density, abundant material resources, and economic efficiency. However, their practical application remains challenged by sluggish conversion kinetics, polysulfide shuttling, and low sulfur cathode utilization. While extensive studies have focused on enhancing polysulfide adsorption through catalytic strategies, the roles of electronic structure in dictating catalytic performance remain underexplored. Here, this work unveils the critical effect of unpaired electronic structure on the catalytic performance of single atom ferromagnetic transition metals through a systematic evaluation of three typical atomically dispersed ferromagnetic single atoms&#8212;Fe, Co, and Ni&#8212;supported on porous carbon (denoted as PC&#8208;SAFAs). Comprehensive characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the PC&#8208;SAFe catalysts, exhibiting the highest spin polarization arising from unpaired electrons, demonstrate the strongest interactions with polysulfide, thereby facilitating rapid and reversible polysulfide conversion reactions. Consequently, Al&#8208;S batteries incorporating the optimized PC&#8208;SAFe cathode achieve an impressive specific capacity of 508.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1.0 A g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles, along with much improved rate capability. This work provides a deeper understanding of the role of electronic structure in catalytic chemistry, and offers new insights for developing high&#8208;performance Al&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>On&#8208;Chip Active Supercoupled Topological Cavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The on&#8208;chip supercoupled cavity device is demonstrated realizing a record cavity excitation distance exceeding three wavelengths, leveraging the valley&#8208;conserved supercoupling mechanism in the valley Hall topological system. This optothermal tunable design enables new degrees of freedom for supercoupled photonic cavities in mux&#8208;demux, lasers, sensors, spectrometers, and on&#8208;chip communication systems.








Abstract
On&#8208;chip photonic resonant cavity plays a critical role in widespread applications including lasing, sensing, and spectroscopy. However, the excitation of these cavities typically relies on evanescent coupling within sub&#8208;wavelength distances, limiting flexible and precise chip integration. Here, an on&#8208;chip supercoupled topological cavity is demonstrated which is critically coupled at 2.3&#8208;wavelength distance from a bus waveguide and remains excited even at 3.2 wavelengths, based on the supercoupling mechanism enabled by the valley vortex flow. Optothermal heating facilitates tunable quality factors and dynamic control of the supercoupling condition, allowing transitions from overcoupling to undercoupling through the critical point. The discovery extends the waveguide&#8208;cavity excitation distance to multiple wavelengths, unlocking new possibilities for designing and controlling on&#8208;chip resonant devices, including supercoupled lasers, sensors, and modulators.

         <title>Engineering Lattice Distortion in Ruthenium Oxide Enables Robust Acidic Water Oxidation via Direct O&#8211;O Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to significantly enhance both the stability and activity of RuO2 by switching the catalytic mechanism from AEM to OPM, is introduced. This is achieved through lattice distortion engineering using a co&#8208;doping strategy involving large&#8208;radius ions (Na&#8314; and Hf&#8201;4+). The as&#8208;prepared Na/Hf&#8208;RuO2 is stable at 0.5&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 over 85 h in a PEM water electrolyzer.








Abstract
Ruthenium is considered one of the most promising alternatives to iridium as an anode electrocatalyst for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). However, Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts suffer from poor stability, primarily due to structural collapse under the harsh acidic conditions of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, a design strategy is introduced that significantly enhances both the stability and activity of RuO2 by switching the catalytic mechanism from the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to the oxide pathway mechanism (OPM). This is achieved through lattice distortion engineering using a co&#8208;doping strategy involving large&#8208;radius ions (Na&#8314; and Hf&#8201;4+). The incorporation of Na+ and Hf&#8201;4+ into RuO2 induces significant lattice distortion, shortening partial Ru&#9472;Ru bond distance and optimizing the electronic structure. This modification facilitates direct O&#8211;O radical coupling, as confirmed by in situ vibrational measurements and theoretical calculations. It can drive a current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 in a PEMWE device at 60&#160;&#176;C with 1.646&#160;V and operates stably for 85 h at 0.5&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. The present study highlights that optimizing the synergistic interaction between two adjacent Ru sites to promote direct O&#8211;O coupling is an effective strategy for enhancing the acidic OER performance of RuO2.

The as-prepared Na/Hf-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is stable at 0.5&#160;A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over 85 h in a PEM water electrolyzer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruthenium is considered one of the most promising alternatives to iridium as an anode electrocatalyst for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). However, Ru-based electrocatalysts suffer from poor stability, primarily due to structural collapse under the harsh acidic conditions of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, a design strategy is introduced that significantly enhances both the stability and activity of RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by switching the catalytic mechanism from the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to the oxide pathway mechanism (OPM). This is achieved through lattice distortion engineering using a co-doping strategy involving large-radius ions (Na&#8314; and Hf&#8201;&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;). The incorporation of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Hf&#8201;&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; into RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; induces significant lattice distortion, shortening partial Ru&#9472;Ru bond distance and optimizing the electronic structure. This modification facilitates direct O&#8211;O radical coupling, as confirmed by in situ vibrational measurements and theoretical calculations. It can drive a current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a PEMWE device at 60&#160;&#176;C with 1.646&#160;V and operates stably for 85 h at 0.5&#160;A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The present study highlights that optimizing the synergistic interaction between two adjacent Ru sites to promote direct O&#8211;O coupling is an effective strategy for enhancing the acidic OER performance of RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic GelMA/DNA Dual&#8208;Network Hydrogels Promote Woven Bone Organoid Formation and Enhance Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic, dual&#8208;network CGDE hydrogel, combining covalent and noncovalent crosslinking mimics the biochemical and mechanical cues of bone extracellular matrix. This viscoelastic matrix promotes 3D cellular self&#8208;organization and drives the development of functional woven bone organoids (WBOs) through intramembranous ossification, reaching peak bioactivity at 21 days. This approach offers a robust and scalable platform for bone organoid engineering.








Abstract
Bone organoids, in vitro models mimicking native bone structure and function, rely on 3D stem cell culture for self&#8208;organization, differentiation, ECM secretion, and biomineralization, ultimately forming mineralized collagen hierarchies. However, their development is often limited by the lack of suitable matrices with optimal mechanical properties for sustained cell growth and differentiation. To address this, a dynamic DNA/Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel (CGDE) is developed to recapitulate key biochemical and mechanical features of the bone ECM, providing a supportive microenvironment for bone organoid formation. This dual&#8208;network hydrogel is engineered through hydrogen bonding between DNA and GelMA, combined with GelMA network crosslinking, resulting in appropriate mechanical strength and enhanced viscoelasticity. During a 21&#8208;day 3D culture, the CGDE hydrogel facilitates cellular migration and self&#8208;organization, promoting woven bone organoid (WBO) formation via intramembranous ossification. These WBOs exhibit spatiotemporal architectures supporting dynamic mineralization and tissue remodeling. In vivo studies demonstrate that CGDE&#8208;derived WBOs exhibit self&#8208;adaptive properties, enabling rapid osseointegration within 4 weeks. This work highlights the CGDE hydrogel as a robust and scalable platform for bone organoid development, offering new insights into bone biology and innovative strategies for bone tissue regeneration.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive CuInS2/ZnS Quantum Dot&#8208;Embedded Polymer Scaffolds for Photon Upconversion Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CuInS&#8322;/ZnS quantum dots (nCIS QDs) are developed via template&#8208;assisted cation exchange, enabling photon upconversion (UC) with NIR&#8208;I emission, a large Stokes shift (&#8776;650 meV), and high PLQY (&#8776;0.95). The QDs are incorporated into a 3D&#8208;printed polymer matrix, forming a scaffold with strong optical contrast under UC imaging. This system enables high&#8208;contrast NIR imaging for surgical guidance, even under interference layers.








Abstract
A facile synthesis and application of photon upconversion (UC) probes, CuInS&#8322;/ZnS quantum dots (nCIS QDs) is presented, which exhibits&#160;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral emission. The nCIS QDs are synthesized via a template&#8208;assisted cation&#8208;exchange reaction during a heating process, resulting in NIR&#8208;I emission with a large Stokes shift (&#8776;650 meV) and a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY, &#8776;0.95). This behavior is attributed to a template&#8208;assisted cation&#8208;exchange mechanism that produces a wurtzite crystal structure and deep defect states, leading to a relatively long fluorescence lifetime (&#8776;5 &#181;s). The quantum confinement effect allows for the emission of light at different wavelengths by adjusting the size of the nanocrystals. Moreover, their deep defect states facilitate photon UC via a self&#8208;trapping triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation mechanism. The promising potential of the nCIS QDs is explored in UC imaging, demonstrating high&#8208;contrast NIR imaging under IR vision modules, even in the presence of interference layers. It suggests potential applications in surgical guidance and future biomedical imaging.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Switchable Gas&#8208;Humidity Difunctional Flexible Chemosensors Based on Smart Adaptable Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research proposes self&#8208;powered difunctional flexible chemosensors by using a specially designed smart adaptable ion&#8208;introduced hydrogel to address the issue of single perception function in wearable devices, which can be highly sensitive and crosstalk&#8208;free to accurately assess oxygen and humidity levels in different states, and is expected to be widely used in the fields of safety, health and non&#8208;contact human&#8208;machine interaction.








Abstract
The development of self&#8208;powered, flexible, and multi&#8208;function sensors is highly anticipated in wearable electronics, however, it remains a daunting challenge to identify different signals based on a single device with singular sensing material without algorithmic support. Here, a smart adaptable hydrogel is developed by co&#8208;introducing two ions with vastly different hydrophilicity for the construction of an electrochemically self&#8208;powered, flexible, and reversibly switchable difunctional chemosensor with a metal&#8208;air battery structure. The prepared hydrogel can readily switch between water&#8208;rich and water&#8208;deficient states for crosstalk&#8208;free detection of oxygen and humidity respectively, since O2 gas and water molecules can directly participate in the oxygen reduction reaction in the device and act alone as limiting reactants and catalysts to affect the reaction rate under different hydrogel states. The resulting sensor demonstrates breakthrough O2 and humidity sensing performance with sensitivities as high as 4170.5%/% and 380.2%/% RH in water&#8208;rich and water&#8208;deficient states, respectively, and ultrawide detection ranges. Thanks to these, the devices can be applied for real&#8208;time and remote monitoring of ambient oxygen, transcutaneous oxygen pressure changes, respiration, and skin moisture by combining with wireless communication technology, and therefore have important application prospects in the fields of safety, health management, and non&#8208;contact human&#8208;machine interaction.

         <title>Simultaneous Heavy&#8208;Metal Ion Adsorption and Electricity Generation From Wastewater via &#8220;Heavy&#8208;Metal Removal Batteries&#8221;</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heavy&#8208;metal removal battery is designed, which displays the capacity of simultaneous heavy&#8208;metal ion adsorption and electricity generation. In such battery, the heavy&#8208;metal ion adsorption is driven by the potential difference between adsorption electrodes and metal electrodes. Furthermore, a chemical oxidation strategy is developed to desorb heavy&#8208;metal ions from adsorption electrodes, achieving the recycling of the electrodes.








Abstract
The heavy&#8208;metal ion in wastewater is a great threat to the health of both humans and ecosystems. The common heavy&#8208;metal ion removal strategies usually suffer from energy consumption and poor recyclability. Herein, a heavy&#8208;metal removal battery is designed by constructing a two&#8208;chamber configuration. Such battery displays the capacity of simultaneous heavy&#8208;metal ion adsorption and electricity output, where heavy&#8208;metal ion adsorption is driven by the potential difference between adsorption electrodes and metal electrodes, and electricity is generated continuously during the adsorption process. Significantly, various heavy&#8208;metal ions (e.g., Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Cr3+ and Pb2+ ions) can be removed due to the large lattice spacing of active materials in adsorption electrodes, displaying the universality of adsorbing heavy&#8208;metal ions from wastewater. In addition, an environmental&#8208;friendly chemical oxidation strategy is developed to desorb heavy&#8208;metal ions from adsorption electrodes, which not only produces high&#8208;quality metal salts, but also reduces the toxicity of sludge in the case of secondary pollution. Impressively, these heavy&#8208;metal removal batteries can be easily scaled up and integrated to extend the heavy&#8208;metal ion adsorption ability and voltage/current output. This work proves a creative approach for simultaneous heavy&#8208;metal ion removal and electricity generation from wastewater.

In addition, an environmental-friendly chemical oxidation strategy is developed to desorb heavy-metal ions from adsorption electrodes, which not only produces high-quality metal salts, but also reduces the toxicity of sludge in the case of secondary pollution. Impressively, these heavy-metal removal batteries can be easily scaled up and integrated to extend the heavy-metal ion adsorption ability and voltage/current output. This work proves a creative approach for simultaneous heavy-metal ion removal and electricity generation from wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Entropy Alloy Formation Derived from High Entropy Oxide: Unlocking the Active Sites for Green Methanol Production from CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a high&#8208;entropy&#8208;based material for CO2 reduction to methanol, offering scalability and simplicity. Fe facilitates high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) formation, leading to a high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) with enhanced CO2 conversion efficiency. Spectroscopic studies and Theoretical calculations identify active sites, while in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) reveals mechanistic changes. Life&#8208;cycle assessment confirms a carbon&#8208;negative footprint.








Abstract
In pursuit of novel materials for CO2&#160;conversion to value&#8208;added chemicals, previous research has predominantly focused on copper&#8208;based, indium oxide (In2O3)&#8208;based, and alloy or intermetallic materials. However, a groundbreaking approach is presented by introducing a high&#8208;entropy&#8208;based material for CO2&#160;reduction to methanol (CH3OH). This method offers scalability and simplicity, making it feasible for large&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloys (HEAs). The formation of HEA is facilitated by the presence of Fe, leads to the creation of a high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) during calcination. Through X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), comprehensively analyzed the oxidation states and coordination environments of all metals in both HEO and HEA. The formation of Fe3O4&#160;within the HEO structure is evident, with each metal occupying either tetrahedral (Td) or octahedral (Oh) sites. The HEA formed shows exceptional CO2&#160;conversion efficiency and higher CH3OH selectivity. Isolated sites of Co, Ni with Fe, Cu, and Zn, along with CuZn pair, are considered as the active sites for CO2 to CH3OH and further determined by DFT calculations. The altered reaction mechanism upon HEA formation compared to individual metals is investigated using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). Finally, Life&#8208;cycle assessment (LCA) indicates the carbon&#8208;negative footprint.

         <title>Organic AIE Nanoradiosensitizer Potentiates X&#8208;Ray Triggered Continuous Reactive Oxygen Species Generation for Potent Cancer Radioimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a glutathione&#8208;responsive system (named THN) is prepared for X&#8208;ray&#8208;triggered sustained ROS generation for efficient antitumor immunotherapy. The double&#8208;promoting ROS generation of THN induced massive immunogenic cancer cell death and polarized M2 macrophages into the M1 phenotype for enhanced antitumor immunotherapy. Experiments revealed that THN&#8208;sensitized RT inhibited post&#8208;surgery tumor recurrence and increased memory T&#8208;cell proportion for long&#8208;term antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Organic radiosensitizers (ORSs), with structural versatility, hold promise for sensitizing radiotherapy (RT) by interacting with X&#8208;ray photons to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). They often consist of low&#8208;Z elements that have inherently low X&#8208;ray deposition capability. However, current ORSs suffer from short circulation half&#8208;lives and low tumor retention, contradicting their requirements for sustained ROS generation upon RT in tumor sites. Herein, a glutathione&#8208;responsive system is prepared, loaded with aggregation&#8208;induced emission molecules (TPEPy&#8208;I) and Ferriprotoporphyrin IX chloride (Hemin), to act as an ORS (named THN) for X&#8208;ray triggered sustained ROS generation for efficient antitumor immunotherapy. In detail, THN effectively deposited X&#8208;ray photons, which interact with water molecules to generate abundant ROS under external radiation. Subsequently, THN&#8208;mediated radiosensitization stimulated tumor cells to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by upregulating NOX4 protein, promoting the chemodynamic process of Hemin reacting with H2O2 to continuously produce hydroxyl radicals. The double&#8208;promoting ROS generation of THN induced massive immunogenic cancer cell death and polarized M2 macrophages into the M1 phenotype for enhanced antitumor immunotherapy. Experiments revealed that THN&#8208;sensitized RT inhibited tumor recurrence and increased memory T&#8208;cell proportion for long&#8208;term antitumor immunity. The developed ORS has great clinical potential as both a radiosensitizer and a post&#8208;RT immunomodulatory agent.

         <title>In Situ Dual&#8208;Ionic Charge Compensation for CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 Perovskite Quantum Dot Solar Cells with Over 18% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile dual&#8208;ion charge compensation strategy is reported for in situ reinforcement surface lattices of CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 perovskite quantum dot solar cells with a record power conversion efficiency of 18.17%. The formed dual&#8208;ionic ligands can effectively compensate for the surface vacancies of perovskite quantum dots, enhancing crystal morphology and electronic coupling of perovskite quantum dots while eliminating trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination.








Abstract
Cesium&#8208;formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite quantum dots (CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs) receive increasing attention for new&#8208;generation solar cells due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties and solution processibility. However, during the synthesis of CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs, PQDs seriously suffer from the ligand detachment from the PQD surface under the polar antisolvent, leaving numerous surface vacancies that significantly compromise the surface lattice integrity and optoelectronic properties of PQDs. A facile dual&#8208;ionic charge compensation strategy is introduced through the bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) to reinforce the surface lattice of CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs. The dual&#8208;ionic ligands produced during the SN2 reaction could in situ fill the surface vacancies of PQDs in the nonpolar solvent, which significantly improves the surface lattice integrity and thus the optoelectronic properties of PQDs, substantially diminishing trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination. Consequently, the PQDs solar cells show a power conversion efficiency of up to 18.17%, representing the highest efficiency in CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQD solar cells. The remarkable photovoltaic performance is attributed to the reinforced surface lattice of PQDs, suppressing the energy losses induced by the nonradiative recombination. This study provides crucial design principles for optimizing the crystalline structure integrity of PQDs, which also paves a new avenue for developing high&#8208;performance solar cells or other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Concentration Indicator Kit Based on Dandelion Propagation&#8208;Inspired SERS Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concentration indicator kit based on dandelion propagation&#8208;inspired SERS strategy is developed for the semi&#8208;quantitative detection of drug residues in urine, which is a simplified and reliable SERS&#8208;based detection method and offers a promising platform for bedside testing in medical diagnostics.









Abstract
Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technology has been extensively employed for the detection of liquid samples in the biomedical field due to high sensitivity and non&#8208;invasive characteristics. However, quantitative SERS detection is hindered by sophisticated instrumentation and complex calibration procedures, while qualitative analyses often provide insufficient concentration information for clinical diagnosis. Herein, a concentration indicator kit based on dandelion propagation&#8208;inspired SERS strategy is developed for the semi&#8208;quantitative detection of drug residues in urine. This strategy achieves significant signal enhancement through the synergistic effects of optimized hotspot construction and molecular adsorption, resulting in an analytical enhancement factor of 2.503 &#215; 10&#8309;, which is 4143 times greater than that of silver nanoparticles. An innovative phenomenon termed the &#8220;concentration indicator&#8221; is discovered, wherein the SERS signal is dramatically enhanced at specific indicated concentrations while remaining weak at adjacent concentrations. The practical utility of this kit is validated through the detection of 2&#8208;mercaptobenzothiazole in urine samples. The kit exhibits excellent performance in semi&#8208;quantitative detection of standard solutions and simulated samples at high, indicated, and low concentrations. The concentration indicator opens new avenues for the development of simplified and reliable SERS&#8208;based detection, offering a promising platform for bedside testing in medical diagnostics.

         <title>Polyelectrolytes as a Stable and Tunable Platform for Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyelectrolytes (PEs) are introduced as advanced materials for triboelectric nanogenerators, offering precise control over tribopolarity through selective ion fixation. The tunable triboelectric properties and reliable mechanical and thermal stability of PEs enable enhanced output performance and long&#8208;term reliability, establishing a foundation for high&#8208;performance energy harvesting and sensing technologies.








Abstract
Polyelectrolytes (PEs) provide a versatile material system for improving the efficiency and stability of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). Compared to conventional ionic liquids (ILs), which suffer from leakage, environmental instability, and limited durability, PEs feature covalently tethered ionic groups that enable precise tribopolarity control while preventing unwanted ion migration. By systematically varying polymer backbones and ionic compositions, including two polycations and three polyanions, tunable triboelectric behavior is demonstrated using Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy, time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and TENG output measurements. The polymethyl acrylate (PMA)&#8208;based polycation with 20% ion inclusion shows strongly tribopositive behavior, producing 83 V compared to 45 V for PMA. The polystyrene (PS)&#8208;based polyanion&#160;with 10% ion inclusion exhibits strongly tribonegative behavior with 34 V, compared to 8 V for PS. Optimizing ion ratios enhances charge retention by suppressing excessive ionic conduction. The mechanical and thermal stability of PEs is demonstrated by output measurements over time; for example, the short&#8208;circuit current of PMA&#8208;based polycation with 20% ion inclusion remains nearly unchanged after 1 week at 60&#160;&#176;C, in contrast to an &#8776;27% drop observed in a polymer&#8208;IL system (poly(methyl methacrylate) with 10 wt% IL). These findings highlight the suitability of PEs as a robust, stable, and tunable platform for next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;harvesting applications.

         <title>Amidation&#8208;Retarded Synthesis of Perovskite Quantum Dots with Low Defect Density and Enhanced Carrier Transport for Efficient Light Emitting Diodes and Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent metal halides are introduced to react with amide and retard amidation process, thereby releasing free ligands and preventing PbI2 precipitation at 200 &#176;C. The synthesized perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) show lower defect density and better charge transport capacity, realizing highly efficient CsPbI3 PQD LEDs (28.71%) and SCs (16.20%). Such strategy is universal in red/green/blue PQDs.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are promising for both solar cells (SCs) and light emitting diodes (LEDs) for their excellent optoelectronic characteristics and solution&#8208;processable fabrication. One of the general limitations for these two kinds of devices is that high defect density and poor charge transport, resulting from the unavoidable amidation&#8208;induced PbX2 precipitation at high reaction temperature. In this work, an amidation&#8208;retarded synthesis strategy is proposed to prevent the PbX2 precipitation and subsequent defect formation. Covalent metal halides are introduced to interrupt amidation by reacting with deprotonated oleic acid/protonated oleylamine. Then, free acids/amines are released to coordinate with PbX2 and form regular lead&#8208;halide octahedra during nucleation&#8208;growth process. The synthesized CsPbI3 PQDs exhibit lower defect density (5.1 &#215; 1017 cm&#8722;3), higher PLQY (92%) and better charge output capacity (&#8776;8 times improvement). As a result, the LEDs and SCs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 28.71% and power conversion efficiency of 16.20%, respectively, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance. Furthermore, the universality of such strategy has been demonstrated in red/green/blue LEDs, and could be expected in other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Bioinspired Rechargeable Cement&#8208;Based Batteries for Low&#8208;Carbon Self&#8208;Powered Buildings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired conifer&#8208;like rechargeable cement&#8208;based batteries for low&#8208;carbon self&#8208;powered buildings is reported. This direction pore structure enhances ionic conductivity by four times (32.7 mS cm&#8722;1), while maintaining high mechanical strength (41.6 MPa). The cement&#8208;based battery delivers a remarkable capacity of 114 mAh g&#8722;1 and retaining 63.2% of capacity after 300 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Cement&#8208;based batteries (CEMBs) uniquely integrate energy storage and load&#8208;bearing functions, offering transformative potential for self&#8208;powered and sustainable buildings. Unfortunately, their application is greatly hindered by low capacity and limited cycle life. The high tortuosity of ion transport at the centimeter scale, and sluggish kinetics at the electrolyte/electrode interfaces in CEMBs are the two main reasons for the limited energy storage performance. Herein, these issues by designing vertically aligned pore channels in a cement matrix is overcome, mimicking the tracheid structure of conifer. This bioinspired design reduces the ion transport tortuosity from 7.80 to 2.86, resulting in a fourfold increase in ion conductivity (to 32.7 mS cm&#8722;1), while maintaining high mechanical strength (41.6&#160;MPa). The quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state CEMBs demonstrate superior performance, delivering a remarkable capacity of 114 mAh g&#8722;1 and retaining 63.2% of their capacity after 300 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1. In comparison, traditional CEMBs exhibit a lower initial capacity of 62 mAh g&#8722;1 and experience rapid degradation, losing functionality after just 75 cycles. Impressively, the bioinspired CEMBs can simultaneously charge a mobile phone and endure external mechanical loads, showcasing their dual functionality. This innovative bioinspired design presents a promising pathway for scaling up cement&#8208;based energy storage systems to enable low&#8208;carbon, self&#8208;powered buildings.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Polarized Antiferromagnets for Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in anomalous and spin transport phenomena in spin&#8208;polarized antiferromagnets. Key effects&#8212;including the anomalous Hall, Nernst, and magneto&#8208;optical effects&#8212;are discussed across various antiferromagnetic platforms. The roles of spin texture, symmetry, and interlayer interactions are emphasized, offering new opportunities for spintronic applications beyond conventional ferromagnets.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarized antiferromagnets (AFMs), including altermagnets, noncollinear AFMs, and 2D layer&#8208;polarized AFMs, have emerged as transformative materials for next&#8208;generation spintronic and optoelectronic technologies. These systems uniquely combine spin&#8208;polarized electronic states with vanishing net magnetization, enabling ultrafast spin dynamics, high&#8208;density integration, and robustness against stray magnetic fields. Their unconventional symmetry&#8208;breaking mechanisms&#8212;governed by crystal symmetry, chiral spin textures, or interlayer potential control&#8212;give rise to emergent phenomena previously exclusive to ferromagnets: nonrelativistic spin&#8208;momentum locking, spontaneous anomalous transport phenomena, gate&#8208;tunable magneto&#8208;optical responses, nonrelativistic spin&#8208;polarized current, and tunneling magnetoresistance effect. This review systematically examines the fundamental principles linking symmetry, band topology, and transport properties across these material classes, synthesizing recent breakthroughs in both theory and experiment. Critical challenges are further identified in achieving room&#8208;temperature functionality, scalable N&#233;el vector control, and coherent spin&#8208;current manipulation, while outlining pathways to harness these materials for ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power memory, spin&#8208;logic architectures, and quantum information technologies.

         <title>Artificial Intelligence&#8208;Driven Approaches in Semiconductor Research</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review on artificial intelligence and semiconductor materials aims to discuss the impact of artificial intelligence on accelerating semiconductor materials discovery, synthesis, characterization, and device optimization, addressing critical scaling and power limitations. Moreover, challenges regarding data size and quality, artificial intelligence model generalization, and autonomous experimentation are discussed to inspire more research.








Abstract
To address the persistent challenges of scaling and power consumption in integrated circuits and chips, recent research has focused on exploring novel semiconductor materials beyond silicon and designing new device architectures.

         <title>Localized Spin Textures Stabilized by Geometry&#8208;Induced Strain in 2D Magnet Fe3GeTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain engineering in 2D van der Waals ferromagnet Fe&#8323;GeTe&#8322; is studied using scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy. Spatially varying strain from micropillar arrays induced local 10 K Curie temperature increases, stabilizing magnetic domains including skyrmions and skyrmion bags near pillar corners. This strain&#8208;control of topological spin textures offers new avenues for spintronic technologies.








Abstract
Strain engineering promises to enable manipulation and control of the properties of exfoliated flakes of 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets for spintronic applications. However, while previous studies of strain effects have focused on global properties, the impact on local magnetic spin textures remains unexplored. Here, manipulation of magnetism in the 2D ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) is demonstrated using geometry&#8208;induced strain. Employing scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (STXM), the effects of spatially varying strain profiles on the magnetic order of FGT sheets stamped onto micropillar arrays are directly visualized. It is found that the in&#8208;plane strain components, with magnitudes &lt;0.5%, locally elevate the Curie temperature of FGT by 10 K, stabilizing magnetic domains near the pillar corners. These domains include skyrmions and higher&#8208;order topological spin textures such as skyrmioniums and skyrmion bags. The possibility to locally seed and control topological spin textures via strain opens new avenues for future spin&#8208;based information technologies.

         <title>Biomimetic Engineering of Hybrid Radiosensitizers to Boost Radiotherapy against Cancer Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic hybrid radiosensitizer is engineered by integrating the hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrug banoxantrone and CeO2 nanozymes into mesoporous silica&#8208;coated Bi2O3 nanoparticles, followed by camouflage coating with cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;derived membranes. The biomimetic radiosensitizer substantially improves the radiosensitization efficacy of both normoxic and hypoxic cancer cells and markedly suppresses lung metastasis through reactive oxygen species&#8208;mediated remodeling of the extracellular matrix.








Abstract
Over the past 120&#160;years, significant efforts are dedicated to delivering maximum radiation doses to tumor sites while sparing adjacent normal tissues as much as possible. Despite encouraging progress in the development of heavy metal&#8208;based nanoscale radiosensitizers, radiotherapy often fails to fully eradicate hypoxic tumors, leading to local recurrence or even progression to distant metastasis. In this study, a versatile biomimetic hybrid radiosensitizer is engineered by integrating the hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrug banoxantrone and CeO2 nanozymes into mesoporous silica&#8208;coated Bi2O3 nanoparticles (NPs), followed by camouflage coating with cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;derived membranes. Compared to naked Bi2O3 NPs and free banoxantrone alone, the radiosensitization efficacy of the biomimetic NPs is substantially enhanced toward both normoxic and hypoxic cancer cells. Moreover, lung metastasis is markedly inhibited by reactive oxygen species&#8208;mediated remodeling of the extracellular matrix through the activity of CeO2 nanozymes. As confirmed by in vitro and in vivo results, the biomimetic hybrid radiosensitizer enhances radiotherapy against lung metastasis with fewer side effects. This study provides compelling evidence for the development of next&#8208;generation radiosensitizers with optimized functionalities using biomimetic hybrid engineering to finely balance the benefits and risks of radiotherapy.

         <title>Multitarget Generate Electrolyte Additive for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a deep learning&#8208;assisted generative model for electrolyte additives in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). The approach overcomes data scarcity by proposing the molecular categorization method and achieves 100% generative efficiency. The model led to the discovery of 2,4&#8208;bis(2&#8208;fluoroethoxy) tetrafluorocyclotriphosphazene, a flame&#8208;resistant additive that significantly improves capacity retention, offering a promising solution for safe and high&#8208;performance LMBs.








Abstract
Electrolyte additives are crucial for accelerating the commercialization of lithium metal batteries (LMBs), yet designing effective additives is challenging due to the need to balance conflicting properties, such as eectrochemical performance and nonflammability. To address this challenge, a deep learning&#8208;assisted generative model is developed for multiobjective optimization of electrolyte additives. Overcoming data scarcity, the dataset is expanded using a molecular categorization derivation method, increasing single&#8208;property data points to 70&#8201;095 multiproperty data points. Coupled with an asynchronous limited decoder and adversarial regulation strategy for latent distribution, this approach achieved 100% generative efficiency for structurally complex and diverse molecules in vast chemical space. The method is validated by discovering 2,4&#8208;bis(2&#8208;fluoroethoxy) tetrafluorocyclotriphosphazene (DFEPN), a novel additive with excellent flame resistance and stable dual electrode/electrolyte interphases. In a Li||LiFePO4 full cell with a commercial electrolyte, DFEPN enables an order of magnitude increase in capacity retention, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art flame&#8208;retardant additive ethoxy(pentafluoro)cyclotriphosphazene by 33%. This study offers a pathway for developing safe and reliable lithium battery electrolytes, particularly under severe data constraints, and has broader implications for advanced battery design.

         <title>Liquid Bridges Mediate Crack Initiation, Propagation, and Coalescence to Suppress Film Failure within Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold films deposited on capillary&#8208;stabilized fluidic cushion of ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;infused nanopillar arrays show enhanced stability under large strains (&#8764; 180%) by effective control, mediated through liquid bridges, of film cracking progress, combined with exceptional strain&#8208;responsive sensitivity of resistance change by the cracking mechanism, this strategy offers a fluid&#8208;mechanics&#8208;based approach for robust wearable devices and soft robotic systems operating under extreme mechanical deformation.








Abstract
Recent flexible electronics with conformal interfaces between devices and human bodies are prone to receive circuit failure caused by uncontrollable cracking during physiological movements. A structural engineering strategy is reported that utilizes capillary&#8208;stabilized liquid bridges to spontaneously mediate crack initiation, propagation, and coalescence for film reinforcement. Specifically, rigid nanowire array are decorated onto flexible polydimethylsiloxane substrates and the nanoscale gaps between the nanowires are filled with non&#8208;volatile ionic liquids to form well&#8208;regulated meniscus. Using metal films as a model, it is found that stretchability of an Au film deposited on this meniscus exceeds that of its flat counterpart (180 vs 30%). In&#8208;situ optical observations and fluid dynamics analyses show that liquid bridge forces mechanically hinder the propagating of crack fronts and simultaneously initiate new cracks in different locations, leading to dispersed small cracks at strains below 80%. This scattering of cracks prevents the concentrated propagation and merging of cracks into penetrating fractures, with effective electrical percolation of Au films even under a high strain of 160%, which contrasts sharply with the counterparts without liquids where penetrating cracks occur at a small strain of &#8776;10%. Results indicate fluid mechanics as a versatile approach to reprogram film cracking for high&#8208;performance electronics.

         <title>Unprecedented Superelasticity in Mo17O47/MoS2 Core&#8211;Shell Nanowires</title>

         <dc:description>
[001]&#8208;oriented Mo17O47/MoS2 core&#8211;shell nanowires exhibit remarkable superelasticity. Three&#8208;point bending tests confirm Young's modulus (103 GPa) matching DFT predictions. In situ scanning electron microscopy bending reveals 35% recoverable strain, unprecedented in inorganic nanowires. First&#8208;principles calculations attribute this superelasticity to reversible transitions between chemical bonding and van der Waals interactions, showing potential for flexible electronics.








Abstract
Inorganic materials are usually known with high modulus and brittleness. Here the finding of a [001]&#8208;oriented Mo17O47 nanowires (NWs) material is reported with a thin MoS2 shell that exhibits superelastic deformability superior to the reported inorganic NWs. Three&#8208;point bending tests reveal that the elastic modulus of Mo17O47 crystals in the [001] direction is 103&#160;GPa, consistent with the density functional theory (DFT)&#8208;predicted results. Furthermore, in situ bending tests via scanning electron microscopy, accomplished with finite element simulations, demonstrate that the NWs can sustain bending strains up to 35% repeatedly without showing appreciable residual deformation. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that this extraordinary superelasticity results from the smooth transformation between the chemical bonding and physical binding (van der Waals) in the [001] direction of Mo17O47 crystal. The remarkable superelasticity of Mo17O47 NWs may offer enormous potential in flexible electronics and photonic devices.

         <title>Toward Stable, High&#8208;Energy, Partially Disordered Mn&#8208;Rich Spinel Cathodes by Revealing and Mitigating Surface Degradation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechano&#8208;activated partially disordered spinel LiMn2O4 is demonstrated with high Mn utilization and a specific energy over 800 Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 at the cathode active material (CAM) level. Surface degradation, caused by the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect in baseline commercial carbonate electrolyte (Gen 2), intensifies Mn2+ dissolution and crosstalk at high potentials. Advanced electrolytes effectively mitigate these issues, thus minimizing Li&#8208;ion inventory loss.








Abstract
Mn&#8208;rich cathodes balance performance and sustainability but suffer from limited cyclability due to Mn dissolution and cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode crosstalk. The Jahn&#8208;Teller (J&#8208;T) effect of Mn3+ is often linked to the above phenomena, such as in spinel LiMn2O4. However, in typical voltage ranges, significant Mn3+ only appears near the end of discharge, highlighting the need to reassess its role in driving Mn dissolution, structural degradation, and battery performance. Here, the spinel cathode's degree of disorder is tailored to expand the Mn redox range, enabling segmentation into J&#8208;T active and less active voltage ranges. Cycling at segmented voltage windows reveals surface degradation mechanisms with and without the major J&#8208;T effect. Despite a stronger J&#8208;T effect below 3.6 V vs. Li/Li+, Mn dissolution is less significant than above 3.6 V. Expanding the cycling window to 2.0&#8211;4.3 V causes severe degradation as the J&#8208;T active range induces a tetragonal phase and Mn2+&#8208;rich surface, driving Mn dissolution and consuming Li&#8208;ion inventory in full cells. Reducing electrolyte acidity minimizes Mn3+ disproportionation, enabling a stable dopant&#8208;free Mn&#8208;only cathode with a 250 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 specific capacity. These findings demonstrate that full cells using Mn&#8208;rich cathodes have the potential to avoid the notorious crosstalk problem through electrolyte engineering.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nano&#8208;Islands: Unlocking New Horizons in Catalytic Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom nano&#8208;islands (SANIs) are innovative confined&#8208;space single&#8208;atom systems composed of single atoms, nano&#8208;islands, and support. Due to their confined space, multiple active sites, interfacial interactions, and tunable coordination structure, SANIs catalysts exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity, stability, and selectivity. This review comprehensively analyzes recent advancements in SANIs catalysts, and the challenges and opportunities for their development in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, and accelerating their transformation to industrial applications are discussed.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), renowned for their maximized atomic utilization, tunable coordination environments, and unique electronic structures, are critical to energy conversion and storage. However, obstacles to their practical performance include atomic agglomeration (caused by high surface free energy) and active site passivation (due to overly strong metal&#8211;support chemical bonds). Single&#8208;atom nano&#8208;islands (SANIs) catalysts, characterized by confined spaces and innovative structural designs, have better electrocatalytic activity and stability. This review comprehensively analyzes recent advancements in SANIs catalysts, highlighting their contributions to catalytic activity, stability, structural optimization, and selectivity. We systematically summarize the design principles and strategies for SANIs electrocatalysts by focusing on material selection, metal&#8211;support interactions, and coordination structures. Finally, the challenges and opportunities associated with SANIs catalysts to promote their development in heterogeneous catalysis and accelerate their transition into industrial applications are discussed.

         <title>Increasing the Stability of Deep Blue Phosphor&#8208;Sensitized OLEDs Using the Polariton&#8208;Enhanced Purcell Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polariton&#8208;enhanced Purcell (PEP) effect is demonstrated to enhance the stability of the deep blue phosphor&#8208;sensitized fluorescent (PSF) OLEDs by 3.1 X compared to PSF diodes lacking this effect. In addition, PSF&#8208;OLEDs exhibit reduced EQE roll&#8208;off and deep blue color emission. The PEP effect maximally extends PSF&#8208;OLED lifetimes in devices with the highest triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet energy transfer rates. This work suggests that the benefits of PEPs apply to all triplet&#8208;based OLEDs.









Abstract
The stability of efficient, deep blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) remains a major challenge in the field of organic electronics. Poor device stability originates from the high probability for destructive non&#8208;radiative triplet exciton annihilation events. Phosphor&#8208;sensitized fluorescence (PSF) is proposed to achieve an efficient, deep blue color by energy transfer from phosphors to fluorophores. Recently, the polariton&#8208;enhanced Purcell (PEP) effect is introduced to decrease the triplet radiative lifetime and density, resulting in an increase in blue phosphorescent OLED lifetime. Here, the PEP effect is introduced to enhance the stability of the PSF&#8208;OLEDs. It is shown that the PEP effect increases all radiative decay rates of the phosphors and fluorophores, leading to a reduction in the triplet annihilation events. Using a Pt&#8208;complex phosphor sensitizer and a so&#8208;called multi&#8208;resonance fluorescent emitter in a PEP cavity, a 3.1&#8208;fold lifetime increase is observed at a current density of J = 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, reduced EQE roll&#8208;off and deep blue color with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates of (0.13, 0.09). The PEP effect maximally extends PSF&#8208;OLED lifetimes in devices with the highest triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet energy transfer rates. Moreover, this work suggests that the benefits of PEPs apply to all triplet&#8208;based OLEDs.

         <title>Evaluation and Rehabilitation System for Ulnar&#8208;Innervated Muscles Facilitated by Rare Earth Oxide&#8208;Enhanced Triboelectric Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a muscle atrophy evaluation and rehabilitation system utilizing rare earth oxide&#8208;enhanced triboelectric sensors integrated with a multi&#8208;channel signal collector and machine learning algorithms, enabling precise assessment of ulnar nerve injury recovery. The system demonstrates high sensitivity, accuracy, and visualization capability, offering significant advances in grip strength rehabilitation monitoring and biomedical sensing applications.








Abstract
Ulnar nerve injuries often lead to muscle atrophy and reduced hand function, necessitating precise monitoring and effective rehabilitation strategies. Current grip strength measurement tools rely on rigid mechanical equipment, which is inconvenient and requires frequent calibration. To address this, a muscle atrophy evaluation and rehabilitation system (MUERS) is presented, featuring a highly sensitive rare earth oxide&#8208;enhanced triboelectric sensor (RETS). Utilizing the unique electrochemical properties of rare earth oxides, RETS demonstrates a linear voltage&#8208;force response in the range of 8&#8211;80 kPa, with a maximum linear error of 1.5%. Integrated with a multi&#8208;channel STM32 signal collector, RETS enables real&#8208;time grip strength monitoring across all five fingers. Combining sensor output with an SVM algorithm, the system achieves 98.61% accuracy in identifying finger grip strength injuries and classifies damage into three levels with an average accuracy of 96.67%. MUERS evaluates rehabilitation progress by scoring grip strength and providing feedback to clinicians. Over a four&#8208;week cycle, it consistently captures improvements in muscle recovery, aiding individualized rehabilitation plans. This system offers fine&#8208;grained assessment capabilities for diagnosing and monitoring nerve injury&#8208;induced muscle atrophy, paving the way for advanced biomedical sensing and personalized rehabilitation.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ulnar nerve injuries often lead to muscle atrophy and reduced hand function, necessitating precise monitoring and effective rehabilitation strategies. Current grip strength measurement tools rely on rigid mechanical equipment, which is inconvenient and requires frequent calibration. To address this, a muscle atrophy evaluation and rehabilitation system (MUERS) is presented, featuring a highly sensitive rare earth oxide-enhanced triboelectric sensor (RETS). Utilizing the unique electrochemical properties of rare earth oxides, RETS demonstrates a linear voltage-force response in the range of 8&#8211;80 kPa, with a maximum linear error of 1.5%. Integrated with a multi-channel STM32 signal collector, RETS enables real-time grip strength monitoring across all five fingers. Combining sensor output with an SVM algorithm, the system achieves 98.61% accuracy in identifying finger grip strength injuries and classifies damage into three levels with an average accuracy of 96.67%. MUERS evaluates rehabilitation progress by scoring grip strength and providing feedback to clinicians. Over a four-week cycle, it consistently captures improvements in muscle recovery, aiding individualized rehabilitation plans. This system offers fine-grained assessment capabilities for diagnosing and monitoring nerve injury-induced muscle atrophy, paving the way for advanced biomedical sensing and personalized rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microscopic&#8208;Level Anion &amp; Diluent Chemistry in Electrolyte for Aqueous Supercapacitors Operating at High Voltage and Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscopic&#8208;level anion &amp; diluent chemistry strategy is proposed to develop an advanced Ca(ClO4)2/H2O&#8208;acetonitrile (AN) electrolyte that can operate at high voltage and low temperature. The weak interaction of H2O with ClO4&#8722; guarantees strong intramolecular O&#9472;H bonds and resulting electrolyte stability. The AN serves as a solvation diluent capable of weakening electrostatic Ca2+&#8208;ClO4&#8722; attraction, preventing salt precipitation, and finally yielding a high&#8208;performance supercapacitor.








Abstract
Aqueous supercapacitors, serving as safe and green high&#8208;power energy storage devices, hold significant potential in various applications. Exploring advanced electrolytes beyond traditional electrolytes is essential for achieving stable high&#8208;voltage and low&#8208;temperature operations. Herein, a hybrid electrolyte with a high electrochemical stability window (3.29&#160;V) and sufficient ionic conductivity (1.5 mS cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C) is developed via hybridizing 8 m Ca(ClO4)2/H2O with acetonitrile (AN) diluent. The charged Ca2+ cations anchor the oxygen atoms in H2O molecules, preventing them from being hydrogen acceptors. Meanwhile, the ClO4&#8722; anions weakly interact with hydrogen atoms, which ensures strong intramolecular O&#9472;H bonds in 8 m Ca(ClO4)2/H2O. The used AN can contribute to decreased salt dosage, without any compromise to electrochemical stability and safety. Furthermore, the AN with a higher donor number than ClO4&#8722; can replace the ClO4&#8722; in Ca2+ solvation sheaths, which reduces Ca2+&#8722;ClO4&#8722; clusters, accordingly suppressing salt precipitation even at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C. Resultantly, a symmetric supercapacitor assembled with 4.2 m Ca(ClO4)2/H2O&#8208;AN electrolyte presents high&#8208;voltage and temperature&#8208;adaptability features, with excellent rate capability and high long&#8208;term cycling stability from 25 to &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C at 2.3&#160;V.

         <title>An Ultrathin Membrane with Bubble&#8208;Raft&#8208;Inspired Single&#8208;Layer Nanofibrous Networks for Efficient and Low&#8208;Resistance Air Filtration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bubble&#8208;raft&#8208;inspired nanofibrous network membrane for efficient and low&#8208;resistance air filtration is fabricated via electrospinning and phase separation. Benefiting from the single&#8208;layer polysulfone nanofibrous network (&#8776;40 nm fiber diameter), the obtained membrane exhibits integrated structural features of small pore size, high porosity, and ultrathin thickness, which endows it with high filtration efficiency, low pressure drop, and high transparency.








Abstract
Airborne particulate matter (PM) is a major global safety concern, significantly straining the ecological environment, human health, and economy. Filtration membranes, essential for PM removal, are challenging in achieving both high efficiency and low air resistance, resulting in a high pressure drop during efficient filtration. Herein, inspired by bubble rafts, an ultrathinnanofibrous network membrane is fabricated by transforming a liquid film of polysulfonesolution on electrospun fibrous scaffold into a single&#8208;layer network via nonsolvent&#8208;induced phase separation. Tailoring of the polysulfone concentration in the liquid film supported by the scaffold and of the phase separation process induced by flowing nonsolvent allows the construction of the single&#8208;layer network with interconnected nanofibers (diameter of &#8776;40&#160;nm). Benefiting from the single&#8208;layer network, the membrane exhibits a small pore size (&#8776;270&#160;nm) at a high porosity of 90.3% and ultrathin thickness of &#8776;800&#160;nm. Consequently, the membrane shows high efficiency (99.8% removal of PM0.3) at an ultralow pressure drop (&lt;40&#160;Pa). Moreover, the membrane exhibits high transparency (&gt;83%) and allows the light breeze (wind speed of 3.2 m s&#8722;1) to pass through easily, enabling energy&#8208;efficient applications, such as window screens. This work provides new insights into designing membranes for efficient and low&#8208;resistance filtration and separation.

         <title>Reward Driven Workflows for Unsupervised Explainable Analysis of Phases and Ferroic Variants From Atomically Resolved Imaging Data</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reward&#8208;driven workflows enable fully unsupervised segmentation of atomically resolved STEM images, revealing phases and ferroic variants without any labels. By encoding domain&#8208;wall straightness and length as explicit rewards, the method automatically tunes clustering and variational&#8208;autoencoder hyperparameters. This physics&#8208;guided optimization yields robust, real&#8208;time mappings of polarization and structural domains for next&#8208;generation autonomous microscopy.








Abstract
Rapid progress in aberration corrected electron microscopy necessitates development of robust methods for the identification of phases, ferroic variants, and other pertinent aspects of materials structure from imaging data. While unsupervised methods for clustering and classification are widely used for these tasks, their performance can be sensitive to hyperparameter selection in the analysis workflow. In this study, the effects of descriptors and hyperparameters are explored on the capability of unsupervised ML methods to distill local structural information, exemplified by the discovery of polarization and lattice distortion in Sm &#8722; dopped&#8197;BiFeO3 (BFO) thin films. It is demonstrated that a reward&#8208;driven approach can be used to optimize these key hyperparameters across the full workflow, where rewards are designed to reflect domain wall continuity and straightness, ensuring that the analysis aligns with the material's physical behavior. This approach allows the discovery of local descriptors that are best aligned with the specific physical behavior, providing insight into the fundamental physics of materials. The reward driven workflow is further extended to disentangle structural factors of variation via an optimized variational autoencoder (VAE). Finally, the importance of well&#8208;defined rewards is explored as a quantifiable measure of the success of the workflow.

         <title>Artesunate Nanoplatform Targets the Serine&#8211;MAPK Axis in Cancer&#8208;Associated Fibroblasts to Reverse Photothermal Resistance in Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The artesunate nanoplatform selectively targets ECM CAF, functioning as a GTPase inhibitor through disruption of intracellular serine homeostasis. This metabolic intervention effectively suppresses MAPK cascade activity, which consequently inhibits PTT&#8208;induced CAF to ECM CAF differentiation. By attenuating this phenotypic transition, the nanoplatform significantly reduces the formation of TRB structure, ultimately enhancing tumor sensitivity to PTT.








Abstract
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a pivotal role in inducing photothermal therapy (PTT) resistance of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC), but with unclear mechanism. Herein, aminoethyl anisamide&#8208;modified nano&#8208;biomimetic low&#8208;density lipoprotein (A&#8208;aLDL) is used to target deliver the PTT agent and artesunate (ARS) to both CAFs and cancer cells. Though CAFs are sensitive to PTT and notably transition to heat&#8208;resistant phenotype, the formed protective barrier is destroyed by ARS. Subsequently, the outstanding anti&#8208;tumor effects are achieved through PTT in multiple models with such kind of combination therapy. Interestingly, the mechanism is discovered that serine metabolism plays a major role in CAF resistance through spatially omics. ARS disrupts serine homeostasis, thereby attenuating the cascade activity of GTPases in MAPK pathway. Meanwhile, MAP2K7 is the most potential target for sensitizing PTT. By integrating ARS with PTT agents, the serine&#8208;MAPK axis in CAFs is successfully modulated, thereby overcoming PTT resistance in TNBC therapy.

         <title>Spin Engineering of Dual&#8208;Atom Site Catalysts for Efficient Electrochemical Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent progress in spin engineering of dual&#8208;atom site catalysts (DASCs), emphasizing how spin&#8208;related properties enhance electrocatalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. It summarizes cutting&#8208;edge developments in dual&#8208;atom catalysis, discusses the underlying spin&#8208;catalysis mechanisms and structure&#8211;performance relationships, and proposes high&#8208;throughput screening strategies to guide the rational design of spin&#8208;optimized DASCs for small&#8208;molecule conversion reactions.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom site catalysts (DASCs) provide more advantages than single&#8208;atom systems in improving energy conversions, owing to their unique features. For example, the coupling effect may align the spin of two adjacent dual&#8208;atom active centers in parallel or antiparallel via electron exchange interactions, thereby altering reaction mechanisms and overall efficiency. While numerous reviews have explored spin&#8208;dependent electrocatalysis, there remains a lack of a comprehensive, spin&#8208;focused framework for understanding the catalytic behavior of DASCs. This review emphasizes the role of spin in dual&#8208;atom site centers for electrocatalysis research. First, spin fundamentals in electrocatalysts, including spin&#8208;selective orbital occupation, spin ordering, and spin coupling, are comprehensively summarized to provide a solid foundation for subsequent discussions. Then, spin engineering strategies of DASCs are reviewed, including manipulating the spin configuration of the central atoms, modulating coordination environments, and tuning metal&#8211;support interactions. Next, recent developments in spin engineering of DASCs are reviewed, with a focus on structure&#8211;performance relationships. Furthermore, high&#8208;throughput screening techniques integrated with machine learning are discussed for developing highly efficient DASCs based on spin engineering. The challenges and opportunities of DASCs and spin engineering are thoroughly discussed to promote the advancement of new energy applications.

         <title>Active Fabric Origami Enabled by Digital Embroidery of Magnetic Yarns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a scalable textile manufacturing process that fabricates active origami fabrics (AFO) via digital embroidery of magnetic yarns. The programmable AFO exhibits reversible 2D and 3D transformations under magnetic fields, enabling functionalities such as altering surface roughness and linear actuation. These reversible deformation fabrics show promising potential for diverse applications in smart textiles and wearable devices.








Abstract
Active fabrics can perform deformations such as contraction, expansion, and bending when exposed to external stimuli. Origami, the ancient art of paper folding, transforms a 2D sheet into a complex 3D structure. However, integrating origami&#8208;inspired designs into active fabrics presents significant challenges, including the large&#8208;scale production of stimuli&#8208;responsive yarns that can be processed using standard textile techniques to achieve intricate origami patterns with high precision and versatility. In this work, the large&#8208;scale fabrication of magnetic yarns featuring high magnetic susceptibility, mechanical strength, and flexibility is reported, which is enabled by processing magnetic polymer composites with a series of textile engineering processes. Utilizing digital embroidery, these magnetic yarns are programmed into origami patterns with predefined yarn alignments on flexible fabrics to create various active fabric origami structures that are mechanical durable and functional consistent. These structures can reversibly transform among shapes in response to specific magnetic fields, enabling a range of functionalities such as altering surface roughness, delivering linear actuation, mimicking flower blooming, and providing switchable thermal insulation. The novel active fabric origami provides promising smart platforms across areas as diverse as smart textiles, soft robotics, wearable devices, and fashion.

         <title>Bioinspired Design of Heterogenous Single&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Site Catalysts for Electrocatalysis and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review gives a summary on the representative bioinspired single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SACs) and their applications in heterogeneous electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. The fundamentals of bioinspired design strategies are systematically discussed in the context of the first shell coordination, the second/long&#8208;range coordination, and the outer microenvironment. The applications of SACs in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis as inspired by natural enzymes are discussed.








Abstract
The emergence of single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SACs) provides a specific model to bridge the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. An interesting aspect in SACs is how to apply the bioinspired strategies in homogeneous biocatalysis to the design of heterogeneous SACs. The effectiveness of this approach relies on systematic insights in structural characteristics and catalytic mechanisms of both the biocatalysts and the heterogeneous SACs. This review will give a summary on the representative bioinspired single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts and their applications in heterogeneous electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. The fundamentals of bioinspired design strategies will be systematically discussed in the first shell coordination (quasi&#8208;homogeneous metal centers and coordination numbers/species) and the second/long&#8208;range coordination (heteroatoms doping, dual&#8208;metallic sites, nano&#8208;single&#8208;atom&#8208;site, and metal&#8208;support interaction). Also, the unique non&#8208;covalent interactions and oriented mass/proton/electron transfer channels in heterogenous SACs are highlighted as inspired by the outer microenvironment of biological systems. The practical electrocatalytic and photocatalytic applications of bioinspired SACs are further discussed by drawing inspiration from hydrogenase, nitrogenase, oxidase, and dehydrogenase to produce hydrogen&#8208;, carbon&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, and oxygen&#8208;based value&#8208;added chemicals. The current challenges and future opportunities for the development of bioinspired heterogenous SACs will also be discussed.

         <title>Manganese&#8211;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Coordination for Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Ion Batteries With Varying Mechanical Adaptability and Machine Learning&#8211;Assisted Performance Decoding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rationally designing &#960;&#8722;conjugated anthraquinone&#8722;based redox&#8722;active ligands (DHAQ/DAAQ), a series of layered, flower&#8211;like MnMOC structures are synthesized. Comprehensive characterization techniques are employed to systematically investigate the reaction mechanisms of these MnMOCs in AZIBs. Importantly, a machine learning&#8722;based model is developed to predict specific capacity. Notably, the MnMOCs demonstrates excellent performance in practical applications, offering strong support for the advancement of MOC materials in the field of energy storage.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;ion batteries (AZIBs) have garnered significant attention owing to their high safety and low cost; however, their development is hindered by the poor cycling stability and low capacity of traditional inorganic cathode materials. This study innovatively utilizes dihydroxy/diamino anthraquinone (DHAQ/DAAQ) ligands featuring &#960;&#8211;conjugated systems and quinone&#8211;based redox activity. By precisely regulating the substitution sites (1,2&#8211;/1,4&#8211;/1,5&#8211;) and coordinating them with Mn2+, layered flower&#8722;cluster Manganese&#8211;based metal&#8211;organic coordination is successfully constructed. The experimental results indicated that in the Mn&#8722;1,4&#8722;DHAQ cathode, the symmetric structure of the 1,4&#8211;dihydroxy substitution promoted electron delocalization and formed stable coordination bonds with Mn2+, thereby providing excellent electrochemical performance. Furthermore, both in situ and ex situ characterizations elucidated the Zn2+ storage mechanism during charge&#8211;discharge processes. Notably, this work incorporated machine learning techniques to develop a specific capacity prediction model, laying a methodological foundation for future research in the field of energy storage. Theoretical calculations are employed to gain deeper insight into the underlying reasons for the outstanding performance of Mn&#8722;1,4&#8722;DHAQ. In addition, Mn&#8722;1,4&#8722;DHAQ is successfully applied as a cathode material in soft&#8722;pack batteries, gel electrolyte devices, and screen&#8722;printed devices, demonstrating excellent mechanical adaptability and practical application potential. Novel strategy for high&#8722;performance MOC&#8211;based AZIBs boosts practical energy storage applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Nanopatterning of Binary Nanoparticles in Nonpolar Solvent via Combined Dielectrophoretic and Coulombic Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing net charges of NPs in nonpolar solvent, dielectrophoretic attraction and Coulombic modulation are combined to achieve distinct particle densities at oppositely charged surfaces. This selective assembly enables efficient submicron&#8208;scale separation of NP mixtures and forms complex binary NP patterns in one step, offering a powerful and direct route for assembling and integrating multiple NPs into advanced multifunctional nanodevices.








Abstract
Precise nanofabrication of diverse nanoparticles (NPs) with high spatial resolution is crucial for developing advanced nanodevices. While various bottom&#8208;up approaches have been developed, limitations such as complex overlay steps, contamination risks, and low spatial resolution still exist. Here, an approach is presented for sub&#8208;micron spatial resolution nanopatterning of binary NPs. By utilizing net charges of NPs dispersed in nonpolar solvent, dielectrophoretic attraction and sign&#8208;dependent Coulombic modulation are combined to achieve distinct particle densities at oppositely charged surfaces. This selective assembly enables efficient separation of NP mixtures at submicron scales, facilitating the formation of complex binary NP patterns in a single step. The technique offers a powerful and direct route for assembling and integrating multiple NPs, providing a new way for advanced multifunctional nanodevices.

This selective assembly enables efficient submicron-scale separation of NP mixtures and forms complex binary NP patterns in one step, offering a powerful and direct route for assembling and integrating multiple NPs into advanced multifunctional nanodevices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precise nanofabrication of diverse nanoparticles (NPs) with high spatial resolution is crucial for developing advanced nanodevices. While various bottom-up approaches have been developed, limitations such as complex overlay steps, contamination risks, and low spatial resolution still exist. Here, an approach is presented for sub-micron spatial resolution nanopatterning of binary NPs. By utilizing net charges of NPs dispersed in nonpolar solvent, dielectrophoretic attraction and sign-dependent Coulombic modulation are combined to achieve distinct particle densities at oppositely charged surfaces. This selective assembly enables efficient separation of NP mixtures at submicron scales, facilitating the formation of complex binary NP patterns in a single step. The technique offers a powerful and direct route for assembling and integrating multiple NPs, providing a new way for advanced multifunctional nanodevices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanosecond Laser Synthesis of MXene&#8208;Derived TiO2/High&#8208;Entropy Alloys for Photo&#8208;Assisted Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy photoelectrocatalyst is rapidly synthesized by pulsed laser heating MXene nanosheets loading metal ions. The MXene derived&#8208;TiO2 and high&#8208;entropy alloy heterojunction can effectively enhance the oxygen evolution reaction kinetics with solar energy assistance, reducing the charging potential of zinc&#8211;air batteries and improving the charge&#8211;discharge efficiency.









Abstract
Photo&#8208;assisted zinc&#8211;air batteries have garnered significant attention for applying solar energy to decrease the charge voltage and improve energy efficiency. However, the uniform and rapid synthesis of highly active, stable, and low&#8208;cost photoelectrocatalysts for zinc&#8211;air batteries remains a significant challenge. Herein, a pulsed laser method is reported for the rapid preparation of MXene&#8208;derived TiO2/high&#8208;entropy alloy heterojunctions (M&#8208;TiO2/HEAs) as photoelectrocatalysts. Benefiting from the exceptional photo&#8208;thermal conversion capability of MXene, the local temperature reaches up to 2800&#160;K under laser irradiation, along with ultra&#8208;fast heating and cooling rates (&#8776;106&#160;K&#160;s&#8722;1), enabling the successful synthesis of M&#8208;TiO2/HEAs. Zinc&#8211;air batteries incorporating&#160;M&#8208;TiO2/HEAs exhibit a low charge voltage of 1.87&#160;V at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 under light irradiation. In addition, it exhibits exceptional cycle stability, maintaining stable cycling for 1000&#160;h at a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that M&#8208;TiO2/HEAs heterojunctions exhibit strong electronic interactions. These interactions effectively promote the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and the conversion of electrochemical intermediates, thereby enhancing oxygen evolution reaction activity under light irradiation. This work offers valuable insights into the rapid fabrication of photoelectrocatalysts, providing new perspectives for developing light&#8208;enhanced energy storage systems.

         <title>Breaking Apoptosis&#8208;Induced Immune Silence: Ultrasound&#8208;Activated Nano&#8208;Oncolytic Therapy Reinvigorates Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasound (US)&#8211;activated nano&#8208;oncolytic system, cRGD&#8208;Lip@PFP is introduced, which induces necroptosis&#8208;like oncolytic cell death. This method triggers the explosive release of DAMPs and activates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, resulting in a more potent antitumor immune response than conventional apoptosis&#8208;based therapies. This innovative strategy markedly enhances tumor immunogenicity and remodels immunosuppression to effectively improve the efficacy of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Conventional tumor therapies typically depend on the apoptotic pathway, which often leads to inadequate immunogenicity. This limitation underscores the urgent need for innovative treatments that enhance immunogenicity. In this study, an ultrasound (US)&#8208;activated nano&#8208;oncolytic system (designated as cRGD&#8208;Lip@PFP), is presented and consists of nanoliposomes (Lip) modified with the cRGD peptide for targeted tumor delivery. This system features a perfluoropentane (PFP) core that undergoes US&#8208;triggered acoustomechanical effects, enabling controlled expansion from nanoscale to microscale, ultimately leading to rupture and the generation of cavitation effects. Intracellular cavitation further induces necroptosis&#8208;like oncolytic cell death. The efficacy of various treatments in stimulating immune responses is systematically compared and it is demonstrated that the nano&#8208;oncolytic system effectively enhances the release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Additionally, the release of DNA fragments activates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, resulting in an amplified immune response. Furthermore, this nano&#8208;oncolytic system alleviates the hypoxic tumor microenvironment and counteracts immunosuppression. Compared to traditional apoptosis, the necroptosis&#8208;like oncolytic cell death induced by this strategy exhibits enhanced immunogenicity. This approach presents an innovative paradigm for tumor immunotherapy based on acoustomechanical effects, offering a promising alternative to tackle the issue of insufficient immunogenicity often associated with conventional apoptosis therapies.

         <title>Promotion of C&#9472;C Coupling in the CO2 Electrochemical Reduction to Valuable C2+ Products: From Micro&#8208;Foundation to Macro&#8208;Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promotion of C&#9472;C Coupling in electrochemical reduction of CO2 to valuable C2+ products is reviewed from microcosmic to macroscopic. The discussed advances and outstanding challenges in the strategies of efficient catalyst design, the influence of local environment in electrolyte, and the design of potential industrial flow cells provided the guidelines for future research in promoted C&#9472;C coupling from foundation to application.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to valuable C2+ products emerges as a promising strategy for converting intermittent renewable energy into high&#8208;energy&#8208;density fuels and feedstock. Leveraging its substantial commercial potential and compatibility with existing energy infrastructure, the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into multicarbon hydrocarbons and oxygenates (C2+) holds great industrial promise. However, the process is hampered by complex multielectron&#8208;proton transfer reactions and difficulties in reactant activation, posing significant thermodynamic and kinetic barriers to the commercialization of C2+ production. Addressing these barriers necessitates a comprehensive approach encompassing multiple facets, including the effective control of C&#9472;C coupling in industrial electrolyzers using efficient catalysts in optimized local environments. This review delves into the advancements and outstanding challenges spanning from the microcosmic to macroscopic scales, including the design of nanocatalysts, optimization of the microenvironment, and the development of macroscopic electrolyzers. By elucidating the influence of the local electrolyte environment, and exploring the design of potential industrial flow cells, guidelines are provided for future research aimed at promoting C&#9472;C coupling, thereby bridging microscopic insights and macroscopic applications in the field of CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Quantum Wires and Nanorods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on low&#8208;dimensional perovskite materials and discusses their applications in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Special attention is given to the introduction of perovskite quantum wires and nanorods, two unique types of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) materials, and their interesting optoelectronic properties. Moreover, the applications of low&#8208;dimensional perovskite materials can extend beyond LEDs to others, such as photodetectors and memristors.








Abstract
Perovskite materials, celebrated for their exceptional optoelectronic properties, have seen extensive application in the field of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), where research is as abundant as the proverbial &#8220;carloads of books.&#8221; In this review, the research of perovskite materials is delved into from a dimensional perspective, with a focus on the exemplary performance of low&#8208;dimensional perovskite materials in LEDs. This discussion predominantly revolves around perovskite quantum wires and perovskite nanorods. Perovskite quantum wires are versatile in their growth, compatible with both solution&#8208;based and vapor&#8208;phase growth, and can be deposited over large areas&#8212;even on spherical substrates&#8212;to achieve commendable electroluminescence (EL). Perovskite nanorods, on the other hand, boast a suite of superior characteristics, such as polarization properties and tunability of the transition dipole moment, endowing them with the great potential to enhance light extraction efficiency. Furthermore, zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) perovskite materials like nanocrystals (NCs) are also the subject of widespread research and application. This review reflects on and synthesizes the unique qualities of the aforementioned materials while exploring their vital roles in the development of high&#8208;efficiency perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs).

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Implantable devices significantly enhance healthcare but are limited by battery life. Ultrasound power transfer technology offers a promising solution for sustainable operation. This review addresses gaps in current research, particularly in sound field analysis and energy efficiency optimization. It proposes an energy flow diagram, discusses development stages, and explores the potential advancements in ultrasound&#8208;based healthcare solutions.








Abstract
Implantable medical devices (IMDs), like pacemakers regulating heart rhythm or deep brain stimulators treating neurological disorders, revolutionize healthcare. However, limited battery life necessitates frequent surgeries for replacements. Ultrasound power transfer (UPT) emerges as a promising solution for sustainable IMD operation. Current research prioritizes implantable materials, with less emphasis on sound field analysis and maximizing energy transfer during wireless power delivery. This review addresses this gap. A comprehensive analysis of UPT technology, examining cutting&#8208;edge system designs, particularly in power supply and efficiency is provided. The review critically examines existing efficiency models, summarizing the key parameters influencing energy transmission in UPT systems. For the first time, an energy flow diagram of a general UPT system is proposed to offer insights into the overall functioning. Additionally, the review explores the development stages of UPT technology, showcasing representative designs and applications. The remaining challenges, future directions, and exciting opportunities associated with UPT are discussed. By highlighting the importance of sustainable IMDs with advanced functions like biosensing and closed&#8208;loop drug delivery, as well as UPT's potential, this review aims to inspire further research and advancements in this promising field.

Abstract
Bacteria share a longstanding and complex relationship with humans, playing a role in protecting gut health and sustaining the ecosystem to cause infectious diseases and antibiotic resistance. Luminogenic materials that share aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics have emerged as a versatile toolbox for bacterial studies through fluorescence visualization. Numerous research efforts highlight the superiority of AIE materials in this field. Recent advances in AIE materials in bacterial studies are categorized into four areas: understanding bacterial interactions, antibacterial strategies, diverse applications, and synergistic applications with bacteria. Initial research focuses on visualizing the unseen bacteria and progresses into developing strategies involving electrostatic interactions, amphiphilic AIE luminogens (AIEgens), and various AIE materials to enhance bacterial affinity. Recent progress in antibacterial strategies includes using photodynamic and photothermal therapies, bacterial toxicity studies, and combined therapies. Diverse applications from environmental disinfection to disease treatment, utilizing AIE materials in antibacterial coatings, bacterial sensors, wound healing materials, etc., are also provided. Finally, synergistic applications combining AIE materials with bacteria to achieve enhanced outcomes are explored. This review summarizes the developmental trend of AIE materials in bacterial studies and is expected to provide future research directions in advancing bacterial methodologies.

         <dc:description>
The development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries offers higher specific energies and lower costs compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, a lack of mechanistic understanding hinders advancement. This review analyzes key electrode parameters, evaluates progress in enhancing ion/electron percolation, and addresses electrochemical&#8208;mechanical degradation, offering future research directions.








Abstract
The development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) toward large&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage is driven by the higher specific energies and lower cost in comparison with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ion batteries. Yet, insufficient mechanistic understanding and quantitative parameters of the key components in sulfur&#8208;based cathode hinders the advancement of the ASSLSB technologies. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of electrode parameters, including specific capacity, voltage, S mass loading and S content toward establishing the specific energy (Wh kg&#8722;1) and energy density (Wh L&#8722;1) of the ASSLSBs. Additionally, this work critically evaluates the progress in enhancing lithium ion and electron percolation and mitigating electrochemical&#8208;mechanical degradation in sulfur&#8208;based cathodes. Last, a critical outlook on potential future research directions is provided to guide the rational design of high&#8208;performance sulfur&#8208;based cathodes toward practical ASSLSBs.

         <title>Materials, Structure, and Interface of Stretchable Interconnects for Wearable Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretchable interconnects are one of the fundamental components in achieving robust wearable devices, but their importance is often overlooked. This review highlights their importance and provides insightful information on various materials, configurations, and manufacturing approaches being studied for interconnects. Their practical potentials for wearable bioelectronics are also discussed for future research opportunities.








Abstract
Since wearable technologies for telemedicine have emerged to tackle global health concerns, the demand for well&#8208;attested wearable healthcare devices with high user comfort also arises. Skin&#8208;wearables for health monitoring require mechanical flexibility and stretchability for not only high compatibility with the skin's dynamic nature but also a robust collection of fine health signals from within. Stretchable electrical interconnects, which determine the device's overall integrity, are one of the fundamental units being understated in wearable bioelectronics. In this review, a broad class of materials and engineering methodologies recently researched and developed are presented, and their respective attributes, limitations, and opportunities in designing stretchable interconnects for wearable bioelectronics are offered. Specifically, the electrical and mechanical characteristics of various materials (metals, polymers, carbons, and their composites) are highlighted, along with their compatibility with diverse geometric configurations. Detailed insights into fabrication techniques that are compatible with soft substrates are also provided. Importantly, successful examples of establishing reliable interfacial connections between soft and rigid elements using novel interconnects are reviewed. Lastly, some perspectives and prospects of remaining research challenges and potential pathways for practical utilization of interconnects in wearables are laid out.

         <title>Rational Modulation of Interface Microenvironment and Design of the Flow Electrolyzer for COx Electroreduction to Alcohol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the current status of microenvironment regulation of catalytic reaction interface, flow electrolyzers design, and the flow electrolyzers derived stepwise approaches for COxRR to alcohol, aiming to provide new insights into the production of alcohols via COxRR.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction of COx (including CO2 and CO) into value&#8208;added fuels and chemicals, particularly multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) alcohols, presents a significant opportunity to close the manmade carbon cycle and support sustainable energy systems. The catalytic performance of electrochemical reduction reactions of CO2 and CO (COxRR)&#160;is strongly correlated with the local microenvironments, the flow electrolyzer, and the catalysis approaches with flow electrolyzers, which contribute to the kinetic and thermodynamic landscape of the reaction, ultimately determining the efficiency and selectivity of the COxRR toward desired reduction products. However, controllable microenvironment construction, rationally designed flow electrolyzers, and matchable flow electrolyzers derived catalysis approaches chosen for improving COxRR&#8208;to&#8208;alcohol performance still face challenges. Building upon the foundation laid by previous research, this review article will provide an in&#8208;depth summary of the regulation of the catalytic reaction interface microenvironment, the design of flow electrolyzers, and the development of derived stepwise catalysis approaches with the flow electrolyzers, which provide a comprehensive and strategic approach to enhancing the COxRR process for alcohol production, offering valuable insights and innovative solutions that can significantly impact the field of COxRR conversion to alcohol and contribute to the development of more sustainable chemical production methods.

This review comprehensively explores recent advancements in these polymeric materials, while also delving into the remaining challenges and proposing practical design strategies for their future optimization.








Abstract
Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) hold exceptional promise as next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technology, where both perovskite absorbers and charge&#8208;transporting materials (CTMs) play critical roles in cell performance. In recent years, polymeric CTMs have played an important role in developing efficient, stable, and large&#8208;area inverted PSCs due to their unique properties of high conductivity, tunable structures, and mechanical flexibility. This review provides a comprehensive overview of polymeric CTMs used in inverted PSCs, encompassing polymeric hole transport materials (HTMs) and electron transport materials (ETMs). the relationship between their molecular structures, modification strategies are systematically summarized and analyzed for adjusting energy levels, and improving charge extraction, enabling a deep understanding of these widely used materials. The review also explores effective strategies for designing even more efficient polymeric CTMs. Finally, an outlook is proposed on the exciting research of novel polymeric CTMs, paving the way for their commercialized applications in PSCs.

         <title>Engineering CAR&#8208;T Therapeutics for Enhanced Solid Tumor Targeting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CART cell therapy has proven effective for blood cancers but struggles with solid tumors due to diverse antigens and complex environments. Recent efforts focus on improving CAR design and validation platforms. Advances in protein engineering, machine learning, and organoid systems aim to enhance CAR&#8208;T therapy against solid tumors. Some solid tumors, like neuroblastoma, have responded well in trials.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy, specifically Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)&#8208;T cell therapy, represents a significant breakthrough in treating cancers. Despite its success in hematological cancers, CAR&#8208;T exhibits limited efficacy in solid tumors, which account for more than 90% of all cancers. Solid tumors commonly present unique challenges, including antigen heterogeneity and complex tumor microenvironment (TME). To address these, efforts are being made through improvements in CAR design and the development of advanced validation platforms. While efficacy is limited, some solid tumor types, such as neuroblastoma and gastrointestinal cancers, have shown responsiveness to CAR&#8208;T therapy in recent clinical trials. In this review, it is first examined both experimental and computational strategies, such as protein engineering coupled with machine learning, developed to enhance T cell specificity. The challenges and methods associated with T cell delivery and in vivo reprogramming in solid tumors is discussed. It is also explored the advancements in engineered organoid systems, which are emerging as high&#8208;fidelity in vitro models that closely mimic the complex human TME and serve as a validation platform for CAR discovery. Collectively, these innovative engineering strategies offer the potential to revolutionize the next generation of CAR&#8208;T therapy, ultimately paving the way for more effective treatments in solid tumors.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Charging Solid&#8208;State Li Batteries: Materials, Strategies, and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review addresses challenges and recent advances in fast&#8208;charging solid&#8208;state batteries, focusing on solid electrolyte and electrode materials, as well as interfacial chemistries. The role of multiscale modeling and simulation in understanding Li+ transport and interfacial phenomena is emphasized, providing insights into materials, strategies, and future prospects for high&#8208;performance, fast&#8208;charging solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
The ability to rapidly charge batteries is crucial for widespread electrification across a number of key sectors, including transportation, grid storage, and portable electronics. Nevertheless, conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries with organic liquid electrolytes face significant technical challenges in achieving rapid charging rates without sacrificing electrochemical efficiency and safety. Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) offer intrinsic stability and safety over their liquid counterparts, which can potentially bring exciting opportunities for fast charging applications. Yet realizing fast&#8208;charging SSBs remains challenging due to several fundamental obstacles, including slow Li+ transport within solid electrolytes, sluggish kinetics with the electrodes, poor electrode/electrolyte interfacial contact, as well as the growth of Li dendrites. This article examines fast&#8208;charging SSB challenges through a comprehensive review of materials and strategies for solid electrolytes (ceramics, polymers, and composites), electrodes, and their composites. In particular, methods to enhance ion transport through crystal structure engineering, compositional control, and microstructure optimization are analyzed. The review also addresses interface/interphase chemistry and Li+ transport mechanisms, providing insights to guide material design and interface optimization for next&#8208;generation fast&#8208;charging SSBs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advanced catalysts applied in thermal catalysis, microwave&#8208;assisted catalysis, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and enzymatic catalysis reaction systems for the chemical recycling of plastic waste into valuable feedstocks.








Abstract
Plastic products bring convenience to various aspects of the daily lives due to their lightweight, durability and versatility, but the massive accumulation of post&#8208;consumer plastic waste is posing significant environmental challenges. Catalytic methods can effectively convert plastic waste into value&#8208;added feedstocks, with catalysts playing an important role in regulating the yield and selectivity of products. This review explores the latest advancements in advanced catalysts applied in thermal catalysis, microwave&#8208;assisted catalysis, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and enzymatic catalysis reaction systems for the chemical recycling of plastic waste into valuable feedstocks. Specifically, the pathways and mechanisms involved in the plastics recycling process are analyzed and presented, and the strengths and weaknesses of various catalysts employed across different reaction systems are described. In addition, the structure&#8208;function relationship of these catalysts is discussed. Herein, it is provided insights into the design of novel catalysts applied for the chemical recycling of plastic waste and outline challenges and future opportunities in terms of developing advanced catalysts to tackle the &#8220;white pollution&#8221; crisis.

Abstract
In this review, the recent development of blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLED) are summarized. On deep&#8208;blue (&#8804;465&#160;nm) perovskite nanomaterials of different structural forms are mainly focused, including nanocrystals (NCs), quantum dots (QDs), nanoplatelets (NPLs), quasi&#8208;2D thin film, 3D bulk thin film, as well as lead&#8208;free perovskite nanomaterials. The current challenges are also examined in producing efficient deep&#8208;blue PeLED, such as material and spectral instability, imbalance charge transport, Joule heat impact, and poor optoelectronic performance. Several strategies are further discussed to overcome these challenges and achieve efficient deep&#8208;blue PeLED for next&#8208;generation display technology.

         <title>Utilizing the Elimination Reaction of Linear Fluorinated Carbonate to Stabilize LiCoO2 Cathode up to 4.6 V</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating tris(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;based additives, this work addresses the elimination reaction of methyl trifluoroethyl carbonate (FEMC) to contrast a homogeneous robust polymer&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. Using the optimized electrolyte, the LiCoO2 cathode can maintain 95% after 500 cycles with a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6 V. This study establishes a foundational framework for employing linear fluorocarbonates in high voltage systems and provides innovative insights into CEI design and construction.








Abstract
Stabilizing LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode at high voltages is still challenging in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Although fluorinated solvents are utilized in high&#8208;voltage systems for their superior oxidation resistance, linear fluorinated carbonates still undergo elimination reactions at high voltages, producing corrosive substances that compromise electrode materials. This study addresses the elimination reaction of methyl trifluoroethyl carbonate (FEMC) by incorporating tris(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;based additives, thereby constructing a homogeneous and robust polymer&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI). With the incorporation of tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphite in the optimized electrolyte, the capacity of the coin cell with LCO as the cathode can maintain 95% after 500 cycles with a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6 V. This study establishes a foundational framework for employing linear fluorocarbonates in high&#8208;voltage systems and provides innovative insights into CEI design and construction.

         <title>Integrated Pristine van der Waals Homojunctions for Self&#8208;Powered Image Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pristine van der Waals homojunctions consisting of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 layers with asymmetric thickness are constructed to eliminate heterogenous interfaces and obtain clean boundaries. The layer&#8208;engineered energy bands of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 layers induce a built&#8208;in electric field at the interface, enabling self&#8208;powered photodetection. Furthermore, a 10 &#215; 10 array based on 2H&#8208;MoTe2 homojunction devices realize zero&#8208;power consumption imaging functions.








Abstract
Van der Waals junctions hold significant potentials for various applications in multifunctional and low&#8208;power electronics and optoelectronics. The multistep device fabrication process usually introduces lattice mismatch and defects at the junction interfaces, which deteriorate device performance. Here the layer engineering synthesis of van der Waals homojunctions consisting of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 with asymmetric thickness to eliminate heterogenous interfaces and thus obtain clean interfaces is reported. Experimental results confirm that the homostructure nature gives rise to the formation of pristine van der Waals junctions, avoiding chemical disorders and defects. The ability to tune the energy bands of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 continuously through layer engineering enables the creation of adjustable built&#8208;in electric field at the homojunction boundaries, which leads to the achievement of self&#8208;powered photodetection based on the obtained 2H&#8208;MoTe2 films. Furthermore, the successful integration of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 homojunctions into an image sensor with 10 &#215; 10 pixels, brings about zero&#8208;power consumption and near&#8208;infrared imaging functions. The pristine van der Waals homojunctions and effective integration strategies shed new insights into the development of large&#8208;scale application for two&#8208;dimensional&#160;materials in advanced electronics and optoelectronics.

A self&#8208;lithiated tin (Sn)&#8208;carbon (C)&#160;composite interlayer (LSCI) capable of enhancing electrochemical/structural stability and homogenizing lithium (Li)&#8208;ion transport across the Li/solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) interfaces enables an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur battery (ASSLSBs) with high cycling stability and rate capability.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) have attracted intense interest due to their high theoretical energy density and intrinsic safety. However, constructing durable lithium (Li) metal anodes with high cycling efficiency in ASSLSBs remains challenging due to poor interface stability. Here, a compositionally stable, self&#8208;lithiated tin (Sn)&#8208;carbon (C) composite interlayer (LSCI) between Li anode and solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE), capable of homogenizing Li&#8208;ion transport across the interlayer, mitigating decomposition of SSE, and enhancing electrochemical/structural stability of interface, is developed for ASSLSBs. The LSCI&#8208;mediated Li metal anode enables stable Li plating/stripping over 7000&#160;h without Li dendrite penetration. The ASSLSBs equipped with LSCI thus exhibit excellent cycling stability of over 300 cycles (capacity retention of &#8776;80%) under low applied pressure (&lt;8&#160;MPa) and demonstrate improved rate capability even at 3C. The enhanced electrochemical performance and corresponding insights of the designed LSCI broaden the spectrum of advanced interlayers for interface manipulation, advancing the practical application of ASSLSBs.

         <title>Heterogeneous NASICON&#8208;Type Cathode With Reversible Multielectron Reaction for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel heterogeneous Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/Na2VTi(PO4)3 material achieves high purity and high crystallization by the mutual promotion of intergrowth structures. Benefiting from the interfacial charge redistribution effect between the heterogeneous phases, the electronic conductivity and ion diffusion are greatly improved. The optimized Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/Na2VTi(PO4)3 cathode, with a reversible three&#8208;electron redox reaction, exhibits high specific capacity and long cycling life.








Abstract
Na superionic conductor (NASICON)&#8208;structured compounds demonstrate great application potential by their robust framework and compositional diversity. However, they are blamed for the mediocre energy density, and achieving both multielectron reaction and good cycling stability simultaneously is challenging. Herein, a novel heterogeneous Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/Na2VTi(PO4)3 (NFPP/NVTP) material with stable multielectron reaction is constructed by spray drying technology. The mutual promotion effect of intergrowth structures effectively improves the purity and the crystallization of NFPP/NVTP during the fabrication process, which is beneficial to the high capacity and cycling stability. As a result, the optimized NFPP/NVTP demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 155.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and outstanding cycling stability with 82.9% capacity retention over 2500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1, which are much superior to those of NFPP and NVTP individually. Even in full cell configuration, the energy density remains high at &#8776;380&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 based on the cathode mass. The high capacity of NFPP/NVTP is also attributed to the successive reduction/oxidation mechanism involving the introduction of Ti3+ and interfacial charge redistribution effect between the heterogeneous phases, which greatly improve the electronic and ionic conductivity. Moreover, high reversible structural evolution during the multisodium storage process further guarantees excellent cycling stability.

Benefiting from the interfacial charge redistribution effect between the heterogeneous phases, the electronic conductivity and ion diffusion are greatly improved. The optimized Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)/Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;VTi(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cathode, with a reversible three-electron redox reaction, exhibits high specific capacity and long cycling life.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na superionic conductor (NASICON)-structured compounds demonstrate great application potential by their robust framework and compositional diversity. However, they are blamed for the mediocre energy density, and achieving both multielectron reaction and good cycling stability simultaneously is challenging. Herein, a novel heterogeneous Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)/Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;VTi(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (NFPP/NVTP) material with stable multielectron reaction is constructed by spray drying technology. The mutual promotion effect of intergrowth structures effectively improves the purity and the crystallization of NFPP/NVTP during the fabrication process, which is beneficial to the high capacity and cycling stability. As a result, the optimized NFPP/NVTP demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 155.3 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and outstanding cycling stability with 82.9% capacity retention over 2500 cycles at 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which are much superior to those of NFPP and NVTP individually. Even in full cell configuration, the energy density remains high at &#8776;380&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; based on the cathode mass. The high capacity of NFPP/NVTP is also attributed to the successive reduction/oxidation mechanism involving the introduction of Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and interfacial charge redistribution effect between the heterogeneous phases, which greatly improve the electronic and ionic conductivity. Moreover, high reversible structural evolution during the multisodium storage process further guarantees excellent cycling stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Control of the Donor/Acceptor Interface Suppresses Charge Recombination Enabling High&#8208;Efficiency Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outstanding double&#8208;cable&#8208;based single&#8208;component material, DCPY2, exhibits a suppressed charge recombination process alongside efficient charge generation. This results in a high fill factor and short&#8208;circuit current, yielding an efficiency to 13.85%. The slow recombination process in DCPY2 compared to binary systems is attributed to the reduced wavefunction overlap between donor and acceptor from inherent alkyl linker and enhanced acceptor aggregation.








Abstract
Single&#8208;component organic solar cells based on double cable polymers have achieved remarkable performance, with DCPY2 reaching a high efficiency of over 13%. In this study, DCPY2 is further optimized with an efficiency of 13.85%, maintaining a high fill factor (FF) without compromising the short circuit current. Despite its intermixed morphology, DCPY2 shows a reduced recombination rate compared to their binary counterpart (PBDB&#8208;T:Y&#8208;O6). This slower recombination in DCPY2 is attributed to the reduced wavefunction overlap of delocalized charges, achieved by spatially separating the donor and acceptor units with an alkyl linker, thereby restricting the recombination pathways. Adding 1,8&#8208;diiodooctane (DIO) into DCPY2 further reduced the recombination rate by facilitating acceptor aggregation, allowing free charges to become more delocalized. The DIO&#8208;assisted aggregation in DCPY2 (5% DIO) is evidenced by an increased pseudo&#8208;pure domain size of Y&#8208;O6. Fine molecular control at the donor/acceptor interface in the double&#8208;cable polymer achieves reduced non&#8208;geminate recombination under efficient charge generation, increased mobility, and charge carrier lifetime, thereby achieving superior performance. Nevertheless, the FF is still limited by relatively low mobility compared to the blend, suggesting the potential for further mobility improvement through enhanced higher&#8208;dimensional packing of the double&#8208;cable material.

         <title>Clickable, Thermally Responsive Hydrogels Enabled by Recombinant Spider Silk Protein and Spy Chemistry for Sustained Neurotrophin Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable hydrogel comprising recombinant spider silk proteins is formed through ultrasound and thermally induced phase transition. Thanks to SpyTag/SpyCatcher chemistry, neurotrophins such as CNTF are covalently immobilized onto the hydrogels, enabling sustained protein delivery, prolonged neuroprotection, and enhanced axon regrowth following optic nerve injury. This system serves as a safe and versatile platform for the delivery of therapeutic proteins.









Abstract
The ability to deliver protein therapeutics in a minimally invasive, safe, and sustained manner, without resorting to viral delivery systems, will be crucial for treating a wide range of chronic injuries and diseases. Among these challenges, achieving axon regeneration and functional recovery post&#8208;injury or disease in the central nervous system remains elusive to most clinical interventions, constantly calling for innovative solutions. Here, a thermally responsive hydrogel system utilizing recombinant spider silk protein (spidroin) is developed. The protein solution undergoes rapid sol&#8208;gel transition at an elevated temperature (37&#160;&#176;C) following brief sonication. This thermally triggered gelation confers injectability to the system. Leveraging SpyTag/SpyCatcher chemistry, the hydrogel, composed of SpyTag&#8208;fusion spidroin, can be functionalized with diverse SpyCatcher&#8208;fusion bioactive motifs, such as neurotrophic factors (e.g., ciliary neurotrophic factor) and cell&#8208;binding ligands (e.g., laminin), rendering it well&#8208;suited for neuronal culturing. More importantly, the intravitreous injection of the protein materials decorated with SpyCatcher&#8208;fusion CNTF into the vitreous body after optic nerve injury leads to prolonged JAK/STAT3 signaling, increased neuronal survival, and enhanced axon regeneration. This study illustrates a generalizable material system for injectable and sustained delivery of protein therapeutics for neuroprotection and regeneration, with the potential for extension to other chronic diseases and injuries.

         <title>Perspectives on Devices for Integrated Phononic Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phononic devices offer unique advantages in RF applications due to their shorter wavelengths compared to photons. This perspective explores functional phononic devices that can enable integrated phononic circuits. These circuits promise to enable miniaturized communication systems with improved SWaP&#8208;C characteristics, while also finding applications in quantum information science, sensing, and biomedical engineering.








Abstract
The phonon wavelength, being much shorter than that of photons at the same frequency, offers phononic devices a unique niche in radio frequency (RF)&#160;applications. However, the current limitations of these devices, particularly their restricted functionality, hinder their broader integration and application. Currently, many functions are achieved using alternative signal forms like electric and photonic signals, requiring bulky converters to transform between phonon signals and other forms. The development of functional phononic devices paves the way for integrated phononic circuits, which aim to minimize the need for signal conversion while accomplishing all necessary functions. In this perspective, a brief overview of several types of functional phononic devices is provided that hold promise for integration, such as phononic modulators, amplifiers, lasers, nonreciprocal devices, and those inspired by topological physics. It is envisioned that through continued developments in materials, fabrication techniques, and designs, it's possible to realize integrated phononic circuits which will be applied in miniaturized communication devices with reduced size, weight, power consumption, and cost (SWaP&#8208;C), as well as in other fields including quantum information science, sensing, biomedical engineering, and beyond.

         <title>Optoelectronic Devices for In&#8208;Sensor Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The raw data obtained directly from sensors in the noisy analogue domain is often unstructured, which lacks a predefined format or organization and does not conform to a specific data model. Optoelectronic devices for in&#8208;sensor visual processing can integrate perception, memory, and processing functions in the same physical units, which can compress and structure vision without extra optoelectronic conversion.








Abstract
The demand for accurate perception of the physical world leads to a dramatic increase in sensory nodes. However, the transmission of massive and unstructured sensory data from sensors to computing units poses great challenges in terms of power&#8208;efficiency, transmission bandwidth, data storage, time latency, and security. To efficiently process massive sensory data, it is crucial to achieve data compression and structuring at the sensory terminals. In&#8208;sensor computing integrates perception, memory, and processing functions within sensors, enabling sensory terminals to perform data compression and data structuring. Here, vision sensors are adopted as an example and discuss the functions of electronic, optical, and optoelectronic hardware for visual processing. Particularly, hardware implementations of optoelectronic devices for in&#8208;sensor visual processing that can compress and structure multidimensional vision information are examined. The underlying resistive switching mechanisms of volatile/nonvolatile optoelectronic devices and their processing operations are explored. Finally, a perspective on the future development of optoelectronic devices for in&#8208;sensor computing is provided.

         <title>Mastering Proton Activities in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced aqueous batteries are promising alternatives for grid energy storage. Understanding and mastering the proton activities in aqueous electrolytes will guide the design of sustainable and long&#8208;lasting aqueous batteries. This Perspective comments on the current understanding of the thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives of proton activities and highlights future research directions for aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Advanced aqueous batteries are promising solutions for grid energy storage. Compared with their organic counterparts, water&#8208;based electrolytes enable fast transport kinetics, high safety, low cost, and enhanced environmental sustainability. However, the presence of protons in the electrolyte, generated by the spontaneous ionization of water, may compete with the main charge&#8208;storage mechanism, trigger unwanted side reactions, and accelerate the deterioration of the cell performance. Therefore, it is of pivotal importance to understand and master the proton activities in aqueous batteries. This Perspective comments&#160;on the following scientific questions: Why are proton activities relevant? What are proton activities? What do&#160;we&#160;know about proton activities in aqueous batteries? How do&#160;we&#160;better understand, control, and utilize proton activities?

         <title>Defect Chemistry in High&#8208;Voltage Cathode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The defect chemistry is focused on governing high&#8208;voltage cathode materials for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The classifications, formation, and evolution mechanisms of defects are emphasized to explore the intricate relationship between defective structures and electrochemical behaviors. The cutting&#8208;edge cross&#8208;scale characterization techniques and defect engineering strategies that mitigate or utilize defects are highlighted.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage cathodes (HVCs) have emerged as a paramount role for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the pursuit of HVCs comes with inherent challenges related to defective structures, which significantly impact the electrochemical performance of LIBs. The current obstacle lies in the lack of a comprehensive understanding of defects and their precise effects. This perspective aims to provide insights into defect chemistry for governing HVCs. The classifications, formation mechanisms, and evolution of defects are outlined to explore the intricate relationship between defects and electrochemical behavior. The pressing need for cutting&#8208;edge characterization techniques that comprehensively investigate defects across various temporal and spatial scales is emphasized. Building on these fundamental understandings, engineering strategies such as composition tailoring, morphology design, interface modification, and structural control to mitigate or utilize defects are thoroughly discussed for enhanced HVCs performance. These insights are expected to provide vital guidelines for developing high&#8208;performance HVCs for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Data Readout Techniques for DNA&#8208;Based Information Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a universal genetic material, DNA can inherently encode and transmit information. Various DNA data storage systems are reported as attractive alternatives to current digital data storage media. This review provides a detailed analysis of the characteristics and evolution of readout techniques of DNA storage systems, and discusses challenges and opportunities in readout techniques of DNA data storage systems.








Abstract
DNA is a natural chemical substrate that carries genetic information, which also serves as a powerful toolkit for storing digital data. Compared to traditional&#160;storage media, DNA molecules offer higher storage density, longer lifespan, and lower maintenance energy consumption. In DNA storage process, data readout is a critical step that bridges the gap between DNA molecular/structures with stored digital information. With the continued development of strategies in DNA data storage technology, the readout techniques have evolved. However, there is a lack of systematic introduction and discussion on the readout techniques for reported DNA data storage systems, especially the correlation between the design of the data storage system and the corresponding selection of readout techniques. This review first introduces two main categories of DNA data storage units (i.e., sequence and structure) and their corresponding readout techniques (i.e., sequencing and nonsequencing methods), and then reviewed representative examples of notable advancements in DNA data storage technology, focusing on data storage unit design, and readout technique selection. It also introduces emerging approaches to assist data readout techniques, such as implementation of microfluidic and fluorescent probes. Finally, the paper discusses the limitations, challenges, and potential of DNA data readout approaches.

This review provides a holistic overview of biopolymers&#8208;derived electronic skins (Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins), highlighting their exceptional attributes, nature&#8208;inspired engineering constructions, promising applications, and remaining fundamental and technical challenges. These insights provide a design framework to provoke the advancement of e&#8208;skins with high adaptivity, mechanical robustness, and sustainability that contribute to the development of high&#8208;performance wearable electronic systems.








Abstract
The past few years have witnessed the rapid exploration of natural and synthetic materials to construct electronic skins (e&#8208;skins) to emulate the multisensory functions of human skins driven by promising applications. Among various materials employed in functional e&#8208;skins, biopolymers are particularly notable for their exceptional biocompatibility and abundant resources. Despite remarkable progress in engineering biopolymeric materials, a timely and holistic review focusing on the design, synthesis, and modification of biopolymers tailored for biopolymers&#8208;derived e&#8208;skins (Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins) is lacking. In this review, the key attributes of biopolymers are introduced&#160;to establish a fundamental understanding fordeveloping functional Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins. Next, the recent progress in harnessing various natural and synthetic biopolymers as building blocks for constructing Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins is systematically discussed, providing insights into maximizing the distinctive attributes of biopolymers. Subsequently, the benefits of nature&#8208;inspired Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins achieved through heterogeneous composite and structural engineering are highlighted, infusing fresh momentum into the advancement of e&#8208;skins. Then, the promising applications of Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins in multisensory functions are summarized, including both local monitoring and remote teleoperation, as well as sustainable energy harvesting that empowers e&#8208;skins. Finally, the remaining fundamental and technical challenges in advancing Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins are presented to provoke future designs that emulate and even go beyond human skins.

         <title>Functional Biomaterials Derived from Protein Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation and Liquid&#8208;to&#8208;Solid Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein can undergo liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition to form liquid condensates and solid aggregates. These phase transitions can be influenced by post&#8208;translational modifications, mutations, and various environmental factors. Effective modulation of protein phase behavior offers promising applications in drug discovery, delivery, and fabrication of multifunctional protein&#8208;based liquid and solid materials.








Abstract
Protein phase transitions play a vital role in both cellular functions and pathogenesis. Dispersed proteins can undergo liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation to form condensates, a process that is reversible and highly regulated within cells. The formation and physicochemical properties of these condensates, such as composition, viscosity, and multiphase miscibility, are precisely modulated to fulfill specific biological functions. However, protein condensates can undergo a further liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid state, forming &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich aggregates that may disrupt cellular function and lead to diseases. While this phenomenon is crucial for biological processes and has significant implications for neurodegenerative diseases, the phase behavior of naturally derived or engineered proteins and polypeptides also presents opportunities for developing high&#8208;performance, multifunctional materials at various scales. Additionally, the unique molecular recruitment capabilities of condensates inspire innovative advancements in biomaterial design for applications in drug discovery, delivery, and biosynthesis. This work highlights recent progress in understanding the mechanisms underlying protein phase behavior, particularly how it responds to internal molecular changes and external physical stimuli. Furthermore, the fabrication of multifunctional materials derived from diverse protein sources through controlled phase transitions is demonstrated.

Additionally, the unique molecular recruitment capabilities of condensates inspire innovative advancements in biomaterial design for applications in drug discovery, delivery, and biosynthesis. This work highlights recent progress in understanding the mechanisms underlying protein phase behavior, particularly how it responds to internal molecular changes and external physical stimuli. Furthermore, the fabrication of multifunctional materials derived from diverse protein sources through controlled phase transitions is demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
This review explores the multiscale architectures and functional mechanisms of biopolymers and bioinspired materials, from hierarchical structures to AI&#8208;powered methodologies. It covers sustainable configurations, multiscale modeling techniques, and AI applications for enhancing functionality, biodegradability, and design. The work concludes with a forward&#8208;looking perspective on biopolymer advancements and potential for broad lifecycle impacts in advanced material manufacturing.








Abstract
Biopolymers and bioinspired materials contribute to the construction of intricate hierarchical structures that exhibit advanced properties. The remarkable toughness and damage tolerance of such multilevel materials are conferred through the hierarchical assembly of their multiscale (i.e., atomistic to macroscale) components and architectures. Here, the functionality and mechanisms of biopolymers and bio&#8208;inspired materials at multilength scales are explored and summarized, focusing on biopolymer nanofibril configurations, biocompatible synthetic biopolymers, and bio&#8208;inspired composites. Their modeling methods with theoretical basis at multiple lengths and time scales are reviewed for biopolymer applications. Additionally, the exploration of artificial intelligence&#8208;powered methodologies is emphasized to realize improvements in these biopolymers from functionality, biodegradability, and sustainability to their characterization, fabrication process, and superior designs. Ultimately, a promising future for these versatile materials in the manufacturing of advanced materials across wider applications and greater lifecycle impacts is foreseen.

         <title>Autonomous Bioelectronic Devices Based on Silk Fibroin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the unique autonomous features of silk fibroin (SF), including self&#8208;healing, shape&#8208;morphing, and biodegradability, which enable its integration into bioelectronics. Key applications such as smart textiles, epidermal sensors, and adaptable implants are explored. The discussion addresses challenges in scalability, reproducibility, and bio&#8208;integration while presenting future directions for sustainable and multifunctional silk&#8208;based technologies.








Abstract
The development of autonomous bioelectronic devices capable of dynamically adapting to changing biological environments represents a significant advancement in healthcare and wearable technologies. Such systems draw inspiration from the precision, adaptability, and self&#8208;regulation of biological processes, requiring materials with intrinsic versatility and seamless bio&#8208;integration to ensure biocompatibility and functionality over time. Silk fibroin (SF) derived from Bombyx mori cocoons, has emerged as an ideal biomaterial with a unique combination of biocompatibility, mechanical flexibility, and tunable biodegradability. Adding autonomous features into SF, including self&#8208;healing, shape&#8208;morphing, and controllable degradation, enables dynamic interactions with living tissues while minimizing immune responses and mechanical mismatches. Additionally, structural tunability and environmental sustainability of SF further reinforce its potential as a platform for adaptive implants, epidermal electronics, and intelligent textiles. This review explores recent progress in understanding the structure&#8211;property relationships of SF, its modification strategies, and its great potential for integration into advanced autonomous bioelectronic systems while addressing challenges related to scalability, reproducibility, and multifunctionality. Future opportunities, such as AI&#8208;assisted material design, scalable fabrication techniques, and the incorporation of wireless and personalized technologies, are also discussed, positioning SF as a key material in bridging the gap between biological systems and artificial technologies.

         <title>Designing for Degradation: Transient Devices Enabled by (Nano)Cellulose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in transient devices enabled by (nano)cellulosic materials is reviewed. Transiency mechanisms, advantages of nanocelluloses, and a suite of applications are discussed. A circular thinking approach coupled with life cycle assessment is applied to critically revisit the potential, advantages, and challenges of nanocellulose&#8208;enabled transient devices for future materials innovation.








Abstract
Transient technology involves materials and devices that undergo controlled degradation after a reliable operation period. This groundbreaking strategy offers significant advantages over conventional devices based on non&#8208;renewable materials by limiting environmental exposure to potentially hazardous components after disposal, and by increasing material circularity. As the most abundant naturally occurring polymer on Earth, cellulose is an attractive material for this purpose. Besides, (nano)celluloses are inherently biodegradable and have competitive mechanical, optical, thermal, and ionic conductivity properties that can be exploited to develop sustainable devices and avoid the end&#8208;of&#8208;life issues associated with conventional systems. Despite its potential, few efforts have been made to review current advances in cellulose&#8208;based transient technology. Therefore, this review catalogs the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in transient devices enabled by cellulosic materials. To provide a wide perspective, the various degradation mechanisms involved in cellulosic transient devices are introduced. The advanced capabilities of transient cellulosic systems in sensing, photonics, energy storage, electronics, and biomedicine are also highlighted. Current bottlenecks toward successful implementation are discussed, with material circularity and environmental impact metrics at the center. It is believed that this review will serve as a valuable resource for the proliferation of cellulose&#8208;based transient technology and its implementation into fully integrated, circular, and environmentally sustainable devices.

Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) play a crucial role in attaining sustainable energy for various wearable devices. Polymer materials are essential components of TENGs. Biopolymers are suitable materials for TENGs because of their degradability, natural sourcing, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, the latest progress in commonly used biopolymers and well&#8208;designed biomimetic techniques for TENG is summarized. The applications of natural rubber, polysaccharides, protein&#8208;based biopolymers, and other common synthetic biopolymers in TENG technology are summarized in detail. Each biopolymer is discussed based on its electrification capability, polarity variations, and specific functionalities as active and functional layers of TENGs. Important biomimetic strategies and related applications of specific biopolymers are also summarized to guide the structural and functional design of TENG. In the future, the study of triboelectric biopolymers may focus on exploring alternative candidates, enhancing charge density, and expanding functionality. Various possible applications of biopolymer&#8208;based TENGs are proposed in this review. By applying biopolymers and related biomimetic methods to TENG devices, the applications of TENG in the fields of healthcare, environmental monitoring, and wearable/implantable electronics can be further promoted.

Abstract
Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a representative biobased and biodegradable aliphatic polyester and a front&#8208;runner among sustainable materials. As a semicrystalline thermoplastic, PLA exhibits excellent mechanical and physical properties, attracting considerable attention in commodity and medical fields. Stereochemistry is a key factor affecting PLA's properties, and to this end, the engineering of PLA's microstructure for tailored material properties has been an active area of research over the decade. This Review first covers the basic structural variety of PLA. A perspective on the current states of stereocontrolled synthesis as well as the relationships between the structures and properties of PLA stereosequences are included, with an emphasis on record regularity and properties. At last, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art examples of high&#8208;performance PLA&#8208;based materials within an array of applications are given, including packaging, fibers, and textiles, healthcare and electronic devices. Among various stereo&#8208;regular sequences of PLA, poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) (PLLA) is the most prominent category and has myriad unique properties and applications. In this regard, cutting&#8208;edge applications of PLLA are mainly overviewed in this review. At the same time, new materials developed based on other PLA stereosequences are highlighted, which holds the potential to a wide variety of PLA&#8208;based sustainable materials.

Abstract
Energy crisis inspires the development of renewable and clean energy sources, along with related applications such as nanogenerators and self&#8208;powered devices. Balancing high performance and environmental sustainability in advanced material innovation is a challenging task. Addressing the global challenges of sustainable development and carbon neutrality lead to increased&#160;interest in biopolymer research. Nanocellulose materials, derived from biopolymers, demonstrate potential as template candidates for advanced materials, due to their unique properties, including high strength, high surface area, controllable pore structures and high&#8208;water retention. In recent years, cellulose&#8208;templated nanomaterials enable delicate nano&#8208;/microscale structural construction, thus promoting developments in the field of nanogenerators and self&#8208;powered sensors. However, there is still a limited number of reviews focused on cellulose&#8208;templated nanomaterials for applications in nanogenerators and self&#8208;powered sensors. This review aims to fill this research gap by introducing various cellulose&#8208;templated nanomaterials and providing a detailed analysis of their fashionable applications in nanogenerators and self&#8208;powered sensors. The goal is to present cellulose&#8208;templated nanomaterials as highly promising template and guest materials for templating technologies, offering sustainable nano&#8208;/microscale control over advanced materials for the foreseeable future. This potential is promising for new applications in the fields of nanogenerators and self&#8208;powered sensors.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically examines biopolymers and their protective mechanisms for Li and Zn metal anodes. It covers key biopolymer types, structures, and properties, and explores their applications as artificial SEIs, electrolyte additives, separators, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes. The review highlights how these biopolymers enhance electrochemical performance and discusses current challenges and future research directions in this evolving field.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) and zinc (Zn) metals are emerging as promising anode materials for next&#8208;generation rechargeable metal batteries due to their excellent electronic conductivity and high theoretical capacities. However, issues such as uneven metal ion deposition and uncontrolled dendrite growth result in poor electrochemical stability, limited cycle life, and rapid capacity decay. Biopolymers, recognized for their abundance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, biodegradability, tunable structures, and adjustable properties, offer a compelling solution to these challenges. This review systematically and comprehensively examines biopolymers and their protective mechanisms for Li and Zn metal anodes. It begins with an overview of biopolymers, detailing key types, their structures, and properties. The review then explores recent advancements in the application of biopolymers as artificial solid electrolyte interphases, electrolyte additives, separators, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes, emphasizing how their structural properties enhance protection mechanisms and improve electrochemical performance. Finally, perspectives on current challenges and future research directions in this evolving field are provided.

         <title>Emerging Sustainable Structural Materials by Assembling Cellulose Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) has unique intrinsic physical properties, showing great potential for constructing sustainable materials. This review introduces emerging CNF&#8208;based structural materials, including challenges in their assembly process and their exceptional mechanical and thermal properties. Based on the structural designability and functionalization characteristics of CNF&#8208;based structural materials, the potential applications and future trends are discussed.








Abstract
Under the guidance of the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, the urgency for green ecological construction and the depletion of nonrenewable resources highlight the importance of the research and development of sustainable new materials. Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) is the most abundant natural nanoscale building block widely existing on Earth. CNF has unique intrinsic physical properties, such as low density, low coefficient of thermal expansion, high strength, and high modulus, which is an ideal candidate with outstanding potential for constructing sustainable materials. In recent years, CNF&#8208;based structural material has emerged as a sustainable lightweight material with properties very different from traditional structural materials. Here, to comprehensively introduce the assembly of structural materials based on CNF, it starts with an overview of different forms of CNF&#8208;based materials, including fibers, films, hydrogels, aerogels, and structural materials. Next, the challenges that need to be overcome in preparing CNF&#8208;based structural materials are discussed, their assembly methods are introduced, and an in&#8208;depth analysis of the advantages of the CNF&#8208;based hydrogel assembly strategy to fabricate structural materials is conducted. Finally, the unique properties of emerging CNF&#8208;based structural materials are summarized and concluded with an outlook on their design and functionalization, potentially paving the way toward new opportunities.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wearable electronics utilizing advanced carbon materials from fossil origins face issues like non&#8208;renewability, high energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions. Biopolymers present a sustainable alternative for carbon&#8208;based wearables. This review highlights the carbonization of key biopolymers&#8212;cellulose, lignin, chitin, and silk fibroin&#8212;discussing mechanisms, techniques, and applications of biopolymer&#8208;derived carbon materials in wearable technology.








Abstract
Advanced carbon materials are widely utilized in wearable electronics. Nevertheless, the production of carbon materials from fossil&#8208;based sources raised concerns regarding their non&#8208;renewability, high energy consumption, and the consequent greenhouse gas emissions. Biopolymers, readily available in nature, offer a promising and eco&#8208;friendly alternative as a carbon source, enabling the sustainable production of carbon materials for wearable electronics. This review aims to discuss the carbonization mechanisms, carbonization techniques, and processes, as well as the diverse applications of biopolymer&#8208;derived carbon materials (BioCMs) in wearable electronics. First, the characteristics of four representative biopolymers, including cellulose, lignin, chitin, and silk fibroin, and their carbonization processes are discussed. Then, typical carbonization techniques, including pyrolysis carbonization, laser&#8208;induced carbonization, Joule heating carbonization, hydrothermal transformation, and salt encapsulation carbonization are discussed. The influence of the processes on the morphology and properties of the resultant BioCMs are summarized. Subsequently, applications of BioCMs in wearable devices, including physical sensors, chemical sensors, energy devices, and display devices are discussed. Finally, the challenges currently facing the field and the future opportunities are discussed.

         <title>Biopolymer&#8208;Based Flame Retardants and Flame&#8208;Retardant Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents recent advancements in producing sustainable flame&#8208;retardant materials using biopolymers as additive agents, functional coatings, and structural matrices. The focus is on advanced applications for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, thermal insulation, and fire warning devices. Most of these applications utilize biopolymers derived from non&#8208;food sources such as cellulose, lignin, chitosan, and alginates obtained from plants and marine organisms.








Abstract
Polymeric materials featuring excellent flame retardancy are essential for applications requiring high levels of fire safety, while those based on biopolymers are highly favored due to their eco&#8208;friendly nature, sustainable characteristics, and abundant availability. This review first outlines the pyrolysis behaviors of biopolymers, with particular emphasis on naturally occurring ones derived from non&#8208;food sources such as cellulose, chitin/chitosan, alginate, and lignin. Then, the strategies for chemical modifications of biopolymers for flame&#8208;retardant purposes through covalent, ionic, and coordination bonds are presented and compared. The emphasis is placed on advanced methods for introducing biopolymer&#8208;based flame retardants into polymeric matrices and fabricating biopolymer&#8208;based flame&#8208;retardant materials. Finally, the challenges for sustaining the current momentum in the utilization of biopolymers for flame&#8208;retardant purposes are further discussed.

         <title>Hierarchical Engineering for Biopolymer&#8208;based Hydrogels with Tailored Property and Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, key strategies for designing biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels from the molecular to the macroscopic scale are summarized. Emphasis is placed on how molecular architecture, processing methods, and fabrication technologies converge to yield materials with tunable mechanical properties, dynamic responsiveness, and enhanced transport behaviors for diverse biomedical and technological applications. The unified approach guides future hydrogel developments.









Abstract
Biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels offer versatility in biomedical engineering due to their abundance, biocompatibility, tailorable properties, and environmental responsiveness. Realizing their full potential requires understanding the molecular&#8208;level design principles that govern their macroscopic behavior. This review analyzes recent advances in the molecular engineering of biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels, emphasizing innovative network design strategies and processing methods for precise control over material properties and functions. How molecular design influences hydrogel behavior across multiple length scales are explored, focusing on: 1) network design strategies: approaches like double networks, interpenetrating networks, and supramolecular assemblies to tailor mechanical and responsive properties; 2) processing techniques: methods such as Hofmeister effect&#8208;induced chain aggregating, cononsolvency&#8208;based porous structure controlling, and directional freezing&#8208;induced network alignment to achieve hierarchical and anisotropic structures. How these design principles and processing methods influence critical hydrogel properties like mechanical strength, inner mass transportation, and degradation are discussed. The review also covers advanced fabrication techniques that leverage these molecular engineering approaches to create complex, functional hydrogels. By elucidating the relationships between molecular architecture, processing methods, and resulting material properties, this work aims to provide a framework for designing next&#8208;generation biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels with enhanced performance and functionality across various applications.

         <title>An Implantable and Degradable Silk Sericin Protein Film Energy Harvester for Next&#8208;Generation Cardiovascular Electronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A piezoelectric film is created using structural engineered silk sericin, presenting satisfactory output performance, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. This piezoelectric film&#8208;based energy&#8208;harvester can illuminate LED or operate a portable electronic device through converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. It holds promise as a power source for delivering effective electrical stimulation to restore cardiac activity in asystole or normalize an AV block.








Abstract
Current cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) face a pressing clinical need for the development of battery&#8208;free, biodegradable, and biocompatible devices to mitigate the risk of adverse in vivo responses. To address this demand, it is proposed utilizing a natural biomaterial, silk sericin (SS), which exhibits valuable biological activities and contains abundant asymmetric amino acids with adjustable structures, to create an implantable self&#8208;powered system based on the piezoelectric principle. The functionalized SS&#8208;based (F&#8208;SS&#8208;based) piezoelectric film demonstrates a high longitudinal piezoelectric tensor (d33) of 12&#160;pC&#160;N&#8722;1. An energy&#8208;generating device (EG device) utilizing this piezoelectric film can generate electric energy under mechanical force both in vitro and in vivo. By manually tapping the EG&#8208;device for a few minutes, the accumulated electricity in a commercial capacitor (1.1&#160;&#181;F) could illuminate LEDs or operate a timer. Furthermore, the instantaneous energy power density (218.5&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;2) achieved by manual pressing the EG device is sufficient to deliver effective pacing to restart a non&#8208;beating heart or normalize an atrioventricular block in a preclinical model. Owing to its high biocompatibility and biodegradability in physiological environments, the F&#8208;SS&#8208;based EG device holds significant promise for the advancement of self&#8208;powered power systems for next&#8208;generation CIEDs and other implantable and degradable electronic devices.

         <title>Biopolymeric Ionotronics Based on Biodegradable Wool Keratin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pH&#8208;responsive wool keratin serves as the sole biopolymer matrix for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance ionotronic devices, without the use of toxic chemicals, complex synthesis, or grafting processes. Furthermore, the innate biodegradability of wool keratin makes it an environmentally friendly option, furthering the advancement of sustainable devices based on natural polymers.








Abstract
The advent of ionotronics has revealed significant potential in flexible transistors, energy harvesting, and unconventional circuits. However, most ionotronic devices, often centered around synthetic polymers, involve complex grafting or synthesis that raise legitimate concerns about their environmental sustainability. Herein, a simple yet versatile approach for developing single&#8208;composition ionotronic devices using wool keratin (WK), a biodegradable and pH&#8208;responsive natural polymer is presented. By employing facile pH regulation processes, WK molecules with opposing polarities are successfully modified, which are combined to form an ionic heterojunction through entropically driven depletion. This ionic heterojunction functions as an ionic diode, enabling efficient rectification of alternating current signals (with a rectification ratio of up to 199). Furthermore, the application of this biopolymeric ionotronic device is extended to mechanical energy harvesting, self&#8208;powered sensing, and ionic logic circuit. The biodegradability and renewability of WK offer a viable alternative to synthetic materials, highlighting its potential for sustainable applications.

         <dc:description>
2,2,6,6&#8208;Tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl radical (TEMPO)&#8208;oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN) is presented as a class of expanded nanofibrous electrode binders for lean&#8208;electrolyte lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Owing to the increased active sites for intermolecular interaction with Li polysulfides (LiPS), the TOCN binder promotes the declustering of LiPS, thereby achieving a high cell&#8208;level energy density of 503 Wh kg&#8722;1 at a low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio of 2.0 &#181;L mgsulfur&#8722;1.

Despite their potential as an alternative to commercial lithium (Li)&#8210;ion batteries, Li&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries face challenges related to energy density limitations caused by the considerable amount of electrolyte required. Lean electrolytes have proven effective in mitigating this issue. However, they tend to exacerbate Li polysulfides (LiPS) clustering, resulting in incomplete S utilization and sluggish conversion kinetics. Here, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl radical (TEMPO)&#8208;oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN) is presented as an expanded nanofibrous electrode binder for lean&#8208;electrolyte Li&#8210;S batteries. Owing to its 1D fibrous structure and expanded inter&#8208;glucose chain distance, the TOCN binder offers more accessible active sites for intermolecular interactions with LiPS. Consequently, LiPS cluster formation is effectively suppressed even at a low TOCN binder content of 1 wt%, while a high S loading of 72 wt% is achieved. The resulting S cathode with the TOCN binder enables Li&#8210;S cells to exhibit a remarkable specific capacity of 1221 mAh gsulfur&#8722;1 under constrained electrolyte conditions (low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio of 2.0&#160;&#181;L mgsulfur&#8722;1 and low density of 0.927&#160;g mL&#8722;1), yielding a high cell&#8208;level energy density of 503&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 that surpasses those of previously reported S cathodes based on conventional synthetic polymer binders.

         <title>The Structure&#8208;Mechanics Relationship of Bamboo&#8208;Epidermis and Inspired Composite Design by Artificial Intelligence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article investigates the micromechanics of bamboo epidermis, focusing on how anisotropic silica particle distributions enhance toughness. By integrating experimental imaging, 3D printing, and generative AI, the study develops bio&#8208;inspired particle&#8208;reinforced composites with mechanical properties akin to bamboo. The findings expand design possibilities for composites, offering innovative solutions for applications demanding high toughness and mechanical reliability.








Abstract
Bamboo culm has been widely used in engineering for its high strength, lightweight, and low cost. Its outermost epidermis is a smooth and dense layer that contains cellulose, silica particles, and stomata and acts as a water and mechanical barrier. Recent experimental studies have shown that the layer has a higher mechanical strength than other inside regions. Still, the mechanism is unclear, especially for how the low silica concentration (&lt;10%) can effectively reinforce the layer and prevent the inner fibers from splitting. Here, theoretical analysis is combined with experimental imaging and 3D printing to investigate the effect of the distribution of silica particles on composite mechanics. The anisotropic partial distribution function of silica particles in bamboo skin yields higher toughness (&gt;10%) than randomly distributed particles. A generative artificial intelligence (AI) model inspired by bamboo epidermis is developed to generate particle&#8208;reinforced composites. Besides the visual similarity, it is found that the samples by the generative model show failure processes and fracture toughness identical to the actual bamboo epidermis. This work reveals the micromechanics of the bamboo epidermis. It illustrates that generative AI can help design bio&#8208;inspired composites of a complex structure that cannot be uniformly represented by a simple building block or optimized around local boundaries. It expands the design space of particle&#8208;reinforced composites for enhanced toughness modulus, offering advantages in industries where mechanical reliability is critical.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Dependent Vibrational Dynamics and Phonon Transport in Nanocellulose Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uptake of water in cellulose play an important role in modulating the structure and phonon transport. This study reports how moisture&#8208;dependent structural modification relates to the vibrational dynamics and phonon transport and scattering of nanocellulose using inelastic neutron scattering and wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering. Phonon transport is controlled by the moisture&#8208;induced increase of the coherence length and swelling of the foam walls.








Abstract
Superinsulating nanofibrillar cellulose foams have the potential to replace fossil&#8208;based insulating materials, but the development is hampered by the moisture&#8208;dependent heat transport and the lack of direct measurements of phonon transport. Here, inelastic neutron scattering is used together with wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering (WAXS) and small angle neutron scattering to relate the moisture&#8208;dependent structural modifications to the vibrational dynamics and phonon transport and scattering of cellulose nanofibrils from wood and tunicate, and wood cellulose nanocrystals (W&#8208;CNC). The moisture interacted primarily with the disordered regions in nanocellulose, and WAXS showed that the crystallinity and coherence length increased as the moisture content increased. The phonon population derived from directional&#8208;dependent phonon density of states (GDOS) increased along the cellulose chains in W&#8208;CNC between 5 and 8 wt% D2O, while the phonon population perpendicular to the chains remained&#160;relatively unaffected, suggesting that the effect of increased crystallinity and coherence length on phonon transport is compensated by the moisture&#8208;induced swelling of the foam walls. Frequency scaling in the low&#8208;energy GDOS showed that materials based on hygroscopic and semicrystalline nanocellulose falls in between the predicted behavior for solids and liquids. Phonon&#8208;engineering of hygroscopic biopolymer&#8208;based insulation materials is promoted by the insights on the moisture&#8208;dependent phonon&#160;transport.

         <title>Biomimetic Intrafibrillar Mineralization of Hierarchically Structured Amyloid&#8208;Like Fibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Hierarchically Structured Amyloid&#8208;like Fibrils (HSAF), prepared through a mechanically directed two&#8208;step transformation of a protein nanofilm, exhibit an ordered, dynamic layered structure with adaptive gaps that facilitate intrafibrillar mineralization. The mineralized HSAF mimics biological hard tissues with ordered protein&#8208;hydroxyapatite organization, and demonstrates exceptional bioactivity in promoting native bone growth and further intrafibrillar mineralization.









Abstract
Intrafibrillar mineralization is essential not only as a fundamental process in forming biological hard tissues but also as a foundation for developing advanced composite fibril&#8208;based materials for innovative applications. Traditionally, only natural collagen fibrils have been shown to enable intrafibrillar mineralization, presenting a challenge in designing ordered hierarchical fibrils from common protein aggregation that exhibit similar high intrafibrillar mineralization activity. In this study, a mechanically directed two&#8208;step transformation method is developed that converts phase&#8208;transitioned protein nanofilms into crystalline, hierarchical amyloid&#8208;like fibrils with multilayer structures, which effectively control the growth and lateral organization of hydroxyapatite within adaptive gaps. The resulting mineralized HSAF achieves a hardness of 0.616 &#177;&#160;0.007&#160;GPa and a modulus of 19.06 &#177;&#160;3.54 GPa&#8212;properties closely resembling native hard tissues&#8212;and exhibits exceptionally high bioactivity in promoting both native bone tissue growth and further intrafibrillar mineralization, achieving 76.9% repair in a mice cranial defect model after 8 weeks and outperforming other regenerative materials. This remarkable performance, stemming from the unique structure and composition of the fibers, positions HSAF as a promising candidate for biomedical and engineering applications. These findings advance the understanding of biomineralization mechanisms and establish a foundation for developing high&#8208;bioactivity materials for hard tissue regeneration.

         <title>Living Fiber Dispersions from Mycelium as a New Sustainable Platform for Advanced Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living fiber dispersions (LFD) from mycelium and their extracellular materials are prepared by a facile three&#8208;roll milling process. These dispersions can be easily converted into a wide array of multifunctional living materials. These living materials display increased emulsion stability, enhanced mechanical properties, superhydrophobicity, and instantaneous proximity sensing as a result of fungal growth.








Abstract
Functional biopolymeric fibers are key building blocks for developing sustainable materials within the growing bioeconomy. However, their flexible use in emerging advanced materials with smart properties typically requires processing methods that may compromise sustainability. Here, a sustainable route to generate living fiber dispersions (LFD) from mycelium that combines the excellent material&#8208;forming properties of biopolymeric fibers, and the highly dynamic properties of living materials is proposed. This is showcased by using industrially available liquid culture and mechanical defibrillation methods to generate well&#8208;dispersed living mycelium fibers. These fibers can form materials where precursors with good dispersibility and network formation properties are paramount and can harness dynamic properties through growth even in the absence of added nutrients. This is demonstrated in unique living emulsions with 3.6x slower phase separation and in living films with 2.5x higher tensile strength upon growth, the latter vastly outperforming the strongest pure mycelium materials to date. Further, humidity can be used to modulate mechanical properties and to trigger the superhydrophobic patterning of substrates, mechanical actuation, and degradation of lignocellulosic consumer goods at their end of life.

     alt="Living Fiber Dispersions from Mycelium as a New Sustainable Platform for Advanced Materials"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living fiber dispersions (LFD) from mycelium and their extracellular materials are prepared by a facile three-roll milling process. These dispersions can be easily converted into a wide array of multifunctional living materials. These living materials display increased emulsion stability, enhanced mechanical properties, superhydrophobicity, and instantaneous proximity sensing as a result of fungal growth.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional biopolymeric fibers are key building blocks for developing sustainable materials within the growing bioeconomy. However, their flexible use in emerging advanced materials with smart properties typically requires processing methods that may compromise sustainability. Here, a sustainable route to generate living fiber dispersions (LFD) from mycelium that combines the excellent material-forming properties of biopolymeric fibers, and the highly dynamic properties of living materials is proposed. This is showcased by using industrially available liquid culture and mechanical defibrillation methods to generate well-dispersed living mycelium fibers. These fibers can form materials where precursors with good dispersibility and network formation properties are paramount and can harness dynamic properties through growth even in the absence of added nutrients. This is demonstrated in unique living emulsions with 3.6x slower phase separation and in living films with 2.5x higher tensile strength upon growth, the latter vastly outperforming the strongest pure mycelium materials to date. Further, humidity can be used to modulate mechanical properties and to trigger the superhydrophobic patterning of substrates, mechanical actuation, and degradation of lignocellulosic consumer goods at their end of life. In the future, combining synthetic biology with this promising platform for smart materials can expand the horizons for sustainable material manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecularly Functionalized Biomass Hydrogels for Sustainable Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalizable molecular engineering methodology is developed to transform diverse biomass feedstocks, such as cellulose, starch, and chitosan, into efficient hydrogel sorbents for atmospheric water harvesting (AWH). Outdoor tests reveal a water production rate of up to 14.19&#160;kg kg&#8315;&#185; day&#8315;&#185;, demonstrating significant potential for sustainable water solutions. This approach advances scalable AWH technologies by leveraging abundant, environmentally friendly resources.








Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) offers a promising pathway to alleviate global water scarcity, highlighting the need for environmentally responsible sorbent materials. In this context, this research introduces a universal strategy for transforming natural polysaccharides into effective hydrogel sorbents, demonstrated with cellulose, starch, and chitosan. The methodology unites alkylation to graft thermoresponsive groups, thereby enhancing water processability and enabling energy&#8208;efficient water release at lower temperatures, with the integration of zwitterionic groups to ensure stable and effective water sorption. The molecularly functionalized cellulose hydrogel, exemplifying our approach, shows favorable water uptake of 0.86&#8211;1.32&#160;g g&#8722;1 at 15&#8211;30% relative humidity (RH), along with efficient desorption, releasing 95% of captured water at 60 &#176;C. Outdoor tests highlight the water production rate of up to 14.19&#160;kg kg&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 by electrical heating. The proposed molecular engineering methodology, which expands the range of raw materials by leveraging abundant biomass feedstock, has the potential to advance sorbent production and scalable AWH technologies, contributing to sustainable solutions.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silk fibroin ionic touchscreen platform with high elasticity, high environmental tolerance, and biodegradability, is introduced for sustainable flexible electronics. This study showcases the platform's environmental stability, reusability, and advanced applications in IoT and AI&#8208;enhanced interfaces, such as real&#8208;time touch sensing, handwriting recognition, and virtual reality, paving the way for greener next&#8208;generation devices.








Abstract
The increasing prevalence of electronic devices has led to a significant rise in electronic waste (e&#8208;waste), necessitating the development of sustainable materials for flexible electronics. In this study, silk fibroin ionic touch screen (SFITS) is introduced, a new platform integrating natural silk fibroin (SF) with ionic conductors to create highly elastic, environmentally stable, and multifunctional touch interfaces. Through a humidity&#8208;induced crystallization strategy, the molecular structure of SF is precisely controlled to achieve a balanced combination of mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and biodegradability. The assembly and operational reliability of SFITS are demonstrated under various environmental conditions, along with their reusability through green recycling methods. Additionally, the intelligent design and application of SFITS are explored by incorporating Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. This integration enables real&#8208;time touch sensing, handwriting recognition, and advanced human&#8208;computer interactions. The versatility of SFITS is further exemplified through applications in remote control systems, molecular model generation, and virtual reality interfaces. The findings highlight the potential of sustainable ionic conductors in next&#8208;generation flexible electronics, offering a path toward greener and more intelligent device designs.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Shearing Chemistry Directed Closed&#8208;Pore Regeneration in Biomass&#8208;Derived Hard Carbons for Ultrafast Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an innovative DES cell&#8208;shearing strategy to tailor the closed&#8208;pore structure in bamboo&#8208;derived hard carbons. The optimized structure with appropriate closed&#8208;pore size (&#8764;2nm) and ultra&#8208;thin (1&#8211;3 layers) walls exhibits abundant active sites and delivers rapid ion diffusion kinetics and high reaction reversibility. This work significantly advances the applications of biomass materials for energy storage.








Abstract
The closed&#8208;pore structure of hard carbons holds the key to high plateau capacity and rapid diffusion kinetics when applied as sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) anodes. However, understanding and establishing the structure&#8208;electrochemistry relationship still remains a significant challenge. This work, for the first time, introduces an innovative deep eutectic solvent (DES) cell&#8208;shearing strategy to precisely tailor the cell structure of natural bamboo and consequently the closed&#8208;pore in its derived hard carbons. The DES shearing force effectively modifies the pore architecture by simultaneously shearing and dissolving amorphous components to form closed pore cores with adjustable sizes, as well as disintegrating crystalline cellulose through generation of competing hydrogen bonds to elaborately tune the pore wall thickness and ordering. The optimized closed&#8208;pore structure featuring appropriate pore size (&#8764;2 nm) and ultra&#8208;thin (1&#8211;3 layers) disordered pore walls, exhibits abundant active sites and delivers rapid ion diffusion kinetics and high reaction reversibility. Consequently, a high reversible capacity of 422 mAh g&#8722;1 at 30 mA g&#8722;1 along with an exceptional rate capability (318.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 6 A g&#8722;1) are achieved, outperforming almost all previous reported hard carbons. The new concept of cell&#8208;shearing chemistry for closed&#8208;pore regeneration significantly advances the applications of biomass materials for energy storage.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reinforcing Ionogel Bioadhesive Interface for Robust Integration and Monitoring of Bioelectronic Devices with Hard Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silk&#8208;based self&#8208;reinforcing ionogel shows good adhesion performance on biological hard tissues, common bioelectrode materials, and hard biomaterials. It can be assembled with the gold resonant circuit to form a wireless sensor to monitor the wound&#8208;healing process of biological hard tissues.








Abstract
Integrating bioelectronic devices with hard tissues, such as bones and teeth, is essential for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. However, stable and durable adhesion in dynamic, moist environments remains challenging. Traditional bioadhesives often fail to maintain strong bonds, especially when interfacing with metal electrodes and hard tissues. This study introduces a self&#8208;reinforcing ionogel bioadhesive interface (IGBI) combining silk fibroin and calcium ions, designed to provide robust and conductive integration of bioelectronic devices with hard tissues. The IGBI exhibits strong adhesion (up to 186&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2) and undergoes mechanical self&#8208;reinforcement through a structural transition in silk fibroin under physiological conditions. In vivo experiments demonstrate the IGBI's effectiveness in repairing bone defects and reimplanting teeth, with the added capability of wireless, real&#8208;time monitoring of bone healing. This approach allows for continuous tracking of tissue regeneration without a second invasive surgery for device removal. The IGBI represents a significant advancement in bioelectronic integration, offering a durable and versatile solution for challenging environments. Such unique self&#8208;reinforcing properties make the IGBI a promising material for biomedical applications where traditional adhesives are insufficient.

         <title>Bioinspired Nanochitin&#8208;Based Porous Constructs for Light&#8208;Driven Whole&#8208;Cell Biotransformations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetically cross&#8208;linked nanochitin cryogels are used for immobilization matrix for a solid&#8208;state cell factory. The resulting cryogels with hierarchical porosity manage to overcome the conventional limitations of mass transfer and light transmittance, as demonstrated by a number of light&#8208;driven biotransformation reactions.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state photosynthetic cell factories (SSPCFs) are a new production concept that leverages the innate photosynthetic abilities of microbes to drive the production of valuable chemicals. It addresses practical challenges such as high energy and water demand and improper light distribution associated with suspension&#8208;based culturing; however, these systems often face significant challenges related to mass transfer. The approach focuses on overcoming these limitations by carefully engineering the microstructure of the immobilization matrix through freeze&#8208;induced assembly of nanochitin building blocks. The use of nanochitins with optimized size distribution enabled the formation of macropores with lamellar spatial organization, which significantly improves light transmittance and distribution, crucial for maximizing the efficiency of photosynthetic reactions. The biomimetic crosslinking strategy, leveraging specific interactions between polyphosphate anions and primary amine groups featured on chitin fibers, produced mechanically robust and wet&#8208;resilient cryogels that maintained their functionality under operational conditions. Various model biotransformation reactions leading to value&#8208;added chemicals are performed in chitin&#8208;based matrix. It demonstrates superior or comparable performance to existing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art matrices and suspension&#8208;based systems. The findings suggest that chitin&#8208;based cryogel approach holds significant promise for advancing the development of solid&#8208;state photosynthetic cell factories, offering a scalable solution to improve the efficiency and productivity of light&#8208;driven biotransformation.

         <title>SciAgents: Automating Scientific Discovery Through Bioinspired Multi&#8208;Agent Intelligent Graph Reasoning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SciAgents AI model drives hypothesis generation by harnessing multi&#8208;agent graph reasoning, extracting insights from knowledge graphs constructed from scientific papers. Each agent plays a specific role: the Ontologist defines concepts, the Scientists draft and refine proposals, and the Critic reviews. Together, these agents create data&#8208;driven, innovative research ideas, advancing beyond traditional, human&#8208;led approaches.








Abstract
A key challenge in artificial intelligence (AI) is the creation of systems capable of autonomously advancing scientific understanding by exploring novel domains, identifying complex patterns, and uncovering previously unseen connections in vast scientific data. In this work, SciAgents, an approach that leverages three core concepts is presented: (1) large&#8208;scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi&#8208;agent systems with in&#8208;situ learning capabilities. Applied to biologically inspired materials, SciAgents reveals hidden interdisciplinary relationships that were&#160;previously considered unrelated, achieving a scale, precision, and exploratory power that surpasses human research methods. The framework autonomously generates and refines research hypotheses, elucidating underlying mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material properties. By integrating these capabilities in a modular fashion, the system yields material discoveries, critiques and improves existing hypotheses, retrieves up&#8208;to&#8208;date data about existing research, and highlights strengths and limitations. This is achieved by harnessing a &#8220;swarm of intelligence&#8221; similar to biological systems, providing new avenues for discovery. How this model accelerates the development of advanced materials by unlocking Nature's design principles, resulting in a new biocomposite with enhanced mechanical properties and improved sustainability through energy&#8208;efficient production is shown.

         <title>Sustainable Smart Packaging from Protein Nanofibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart packaging can extend shelf life and improve food quality monitoring. This study introduces a novel smart packaging solution using amyloid fibrils and red radish anthocyanins to monitor seafood spoilage. These findings show that these films effectively indicate shrimp freshness and possess high antibacterial and antioxidant properties, offering a sustainable approach to food packaging.








Abstract
Smart packaging technologies are revolutionizing the food industry by extending shelf life and enhancing quality monitoring through environmental responsiveness. Here, a novel smart packaging concept is presented, based on amyloid fibrils (AM) and red radish anthocyanins (RRA), to effectively monitor food spoilage by color change. A protein nanofibrils biofilm is developed from whey protein, which is functionalized with RRA to endow the resulting films with advanced monitoring capabilities. A comprehensive characterization, including pH responsiveness, water vapor permeability, thermal and mechanical testing, and colorimetric responses, demonstrates the superiority of AM/RRA films compared to control films based on whey monomer building blocks. The findings indicate that the AM/RRA films can effectively monitor, for example, shrimp freshness, showing visible changes within one day at room temperature and significant alterations in color after two days. Furthermore, these films exhibit high antibacterial and antioxidant activities, reinforcing their suitability for efficient food packaging. By integrating bio&#8208;based materials from whey and natural anthocyanins, this research presents a biodegradable, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective smart packaging solution, contributing to eco&#8208;friendly innovations in food preservation.

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost Hyperelastic Fuller&#8208;Dome&#8208;Structured Nanocellulose Aerogels by Dual Templates for Personal Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost mechanically ultra&#8208;resilient cellulose&#8208;based aerogel with Fuller&#8208;dome&#8208;like structure is developed by a dual&#8208;template strategy. The aerogel shows a desired cost&#8208;performance combination of low density, hypereslaticity, superhydrophobicity, ultralow thermal conductivity, and low cost, making it hold great promise as a thermal retention material for personal thermal management.








Abstract
It is critically important to maintain the body's thermal comfort for human beings in extremely cold environments. Cellulose nanofibers (CNF)&#8208;based aerogels represent a promising sustainable material for body's heat retention because of their renewability and low thermal conductivity. However, CNF&#8208;based aerogels often suffer high production costs due to expensive CNF, poor elasticity and/or unsatisfactory thermal insulation owing to improper microstructure design. Here, a facile dual&#8208;template strategy is reported to prepare a low&#8208;cost, hyperelastic, superhydrophobic Fuller&#8208;dome&#8208;structured CNF aerogel (CNF@PU) with low thermal conductivity. The combination of air template by foaming process and ice template enables the formation of a dome&#8208;like microstructure of CNF@PU aerogel, in which CNF serves as rope bars while inexpensive polyurethane (PU) acts as joints. The aerogel combines ultra&#8208;elasticity, low thermal conductivity (24&#160;mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), and low costs. The as&#8208;prepared CNF@PU aerogel demonstrates much better heat retention than commercial thermal retention fillers (e.g., Flannelette and goose down), promising its great commercial potential for massively producing warming garments. This work provides a facile approach for creating high&#8208;performance aerogels with tailored microstructure for effective personal thermal management.

         <title>Spray&#8208;Assisted Fabrication of Cellulose Photonic Pigments on Superhydrophobic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to directly produce structurally colored microparticles by drying cholesteric cellulose nanocrystal microdroplets on a superhydrophobic surface is reported. This approach has several key advantages that can unlock large&#8208;scale fabrication of sustainable photonic pigments, including exploiting existing industrial techniques (e.g. aerosolization), reduction in chemicals required (e.g. surfactants), rapid production times (&#8776;40 min or less), and size&#8208;independent and robust color.









Abstract
Photonic pigments, especially those based on naturally&#8208;derived building blocks like cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), are emerging as a promising sustainable alternative to absorption&#8208;based colorants. However, the proposed manufacturing methods for CNC pigments, via either grinding films or emulsion&#8208;based production, usually require several processing steps. This limits their commercialization by increasing the costs, timescales, and environmental impacts of production. Toward addressing these challenges, it is reported that photonic pigments can be produced in a single process by drying microdroplets of aqueous CNC suspension on a superhydrophobic surface. Such liquid&#8208;repellent substrate ensures the microdroplets maintain a near&#8208;spherical shape, enabling the radial self&#8208;organization of the cholesteric phase. Upon drying under ambient conditions, the CNC mesophase becomes kinetically arrested, after which the strong capillary forces induced by water evaporation result in extensive buckling of the microparticle. This buckling, coupled with prior tuning of the CNC formulation, enables photonic pigments with adjustable color across the visible spectrum. Importantly, the elimination of an emulsifying oil phase to create microdroplets enables a much faster drying time (&#8776;40 min) and improved color stability (e.g., polar solvents, elevated temperatures), while the reduction in reagents (e.g., oils, surfactants) and post&#8208;processing steps (e.g., solvent, heat) improves the sustainability of the fabrication process.

This approach has several key advantages that can unlock large-scale fabrication of sustainable photonic pigments, including exploiting existing industrial techniques (e.g. aerosolization), reduction in chemicals required (e.g. surfactants), rapid production times (&#8776;40 min or less), and size-independent and robust color.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photonic pigments, especially those based on naturally-derived building blocks like cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), are emerging as a promising sustainable alternative to absorption-based colorants. However, the proposed manufacturing methods for CNC pigments, via either grinding films or emulsion-based production, usually require several processing steps. This limits their commercialization by increasing the costs, timescales, and environmental impacts of production. Toward addressing these challenges, it is reported that photonic pigments can be produced in a single process by drying microdroplets of aqueous CNC suspension on a superhydrophobic surface. Such liquid-repellent substrate ensures the microdroplets maintain a near-spherical shape, enabling the radial self-organization of the cholesteric phase. Upon drying under ambient conditions, the CNC mesophase becomes kinetically arrested, after which the strong capillary forces induced by water evaporation result in extensive buckling of the microparticle. This buckling, coupled with prior tuning of the CNC formulation, enables photonic pigments with adjustable color across the visible spectrum. Importantly, the elimination of an emulsifying oil phase to create microdroplets enables a much faster drying time (&#8776;40 min) and improved color stability (e.g., polar solvents, elevated temperatures), while the reduction in reagents (e.g., oils, surfactants) and post-processing steps (e.g., solvent, heat) improves the sustainability of the fabrication process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Triboelectric Paper for Energy Harvesting and Smart Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering nano&#8208;graphite coated paper (NG@P) is produced to serve as triboelectric layers and electrodes for TENGs. Ultra&#8208;high power density above 14 kW&#160;m&#8722;2 is achieved due to the electrostatic discharge on the surface. Moreover, smart home sensors are fabricated using the NG@P for motion sensing and sleep monitoring, which could be used for security and healthcare applications.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) represent a promising technology for energy harvesting and self&#8208;powered sensing with a wide range of applications. Despite their potential, challenges such as the need for cost&#8208;effective, large&#8208;area electrodes and engineering sustainable triboelectric materials remain, especially given the impending restrictions on single&#8208;use engineering plastics in Europe. To address these challenges, engineering nano&#8208;graphite&#8208;coated paper is presented as a sustainable and high&#8208;performance alternative for triboelectric layers. Moreover, this material, which can be produced on an industrial scale, offers a viable replacement for metal electrodes. The combination of nano&#8208;graphite and paper, with its large contact area and inherent surface roughness, enables ultra&#8208;high power densities exceeding 14 kW&#160;m&#8722;2, driven by electrostatic discharge at the surface. Beyond energy harvesting, smart sensors are developed for floors and walls that detect movements for security purposes and smart sheets that monitor body movements and physiological activities during sleep. The findings highlight the potential of this engineering paper to serve as an eco&#8208;friendly alternative to engineering plastics in TENGs and electrodes, opening new avenues for future applications.

         <title>Environmental Sustainability of Natural Biopolymer&#8208;Based Electrolytes for Lithium Ion Battery Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twenty&#8208;one biopolymer electrolytes including membrane&#8208;liquid electrolytes, gel electrolytes, and solid electrolytes are synthesized to analyze their electrochemical properties and environmental impacts through life cycle assessment. This consistent and comparable study demonstrates the significant functional and environmental benefits of biopolymer electrolytes for batteries, guiding academia and industry in fundamental studies and applied implementation of sustainable bio&#8208;based polymers and biopolymer electrolytes.








Abstract
Biopolymer based electrolytes can overcome current performance limitations of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Biopolymers enable electrolytes with high ionic conductivities and wide electrochemical stability windows. While the biobased character of natural materials is claimed as an inherent advantage in meeting current environmental sustainability challenges, further research is required to quantify and compare their environmental impacts as electrolytes. The challenge is addressed by identifying the most promising biopolymer electrolytes for LIBs, measuring ionic conductivities and electrochemical stability windows, and quantifying environmental impacts using life cycle assessment. The environmental impacts of the cost to isolate cellulose derivatives, nanocelluloses, chitin/nanochitin, chitosan, lignin, agar, and silk are reported for climate change, acidification, freshwater ecotoxicity, marine eutrophication, human toxicity, and water use. Material criticality, circularity index, and material circularity indicator, emerging impact categories are prioritized to help integrate biopolymers into circular and sustainable materials. The electrochemical properties and environmental impacts of natural biopolymer membrane&#8208;liquid electrolyte pairs, gel electrolytes, and solid electrolytes are quantified and benchmarked against conventional fossil&#8208;based electrolytes, providing consistent and comparable electrochemical properties of the most relevant biopolymer electrolytes fabricated so far. This study highlights the significant functional and environmental benefits of biopolymer electrolytes and identifies the most electrochemically competitive biopolymer electrolytes in LIBs.

         <title>Nanocellulose&#8208;Derived Hierarchical Carbon Framework&#8208;Supported P&#8208;Doped MoO2 Nanoparticles for Optimizing Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using nanocellulose as a building block, P&#8208;doped MoO2&#8722;x nanoparticles anchored on N, P co&#8208;doped porous carbon are constructed by in situ polymerization and hydrothermal treatment combined with phosphorylation. When being used for modifying the commercial separator of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, the composite provides abundant catalytic active sites and rapid ion accessibility. The assembled cell achieves an initial specific capacity of 11.3 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a sulfur loading of 8.1 mg cm&#8722;2 under lean electrolyte conditions.








Abstract
The integration of nanocatalysts into the separators of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) boosts the polysulfide conversion efficiency. However, the aggregation of catalyst nanoparticles diminishes the active surface area. Moreover, densely packed catalyst&#8208;modified layers often hinder ion transport rates and impede access to the catalytic sites. To overcome these challenges, a strategy is reported for modifying commercial separators, using wood nanocellulose as a building block to construct hierarchical P&#8208;doped MoO2&#8722;x nanoparticles anchored on N, P co&#8208;doped porous carbon (P&#8208;MoO2&#8722;x/NPC). The web&#8208;like entangled nanocellulose forms a framework for the in situ polymerization of polyaniline, providing abundant anchoring sites for MoO2 nanoparticles. The addition of P atoms optimizes the d&#8208;band center of MoO2 and enhances the catalytic activity of polysulfide conversion. The LSBs assembled using a P&#8208;MoO2&#8722;x/NPC coated polypropylene separator display an initial discharge capacity of 1621 mAh g&#8722;1 and rate performance of 774 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 C. Even with a sulfur loading of 8.1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and lean electrolyte conditions, the cell achieves an initial areal capacity of 11.3 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.1 C. This work provides a biopolymer nanofiber solution for constructing LSB separators with advanced electrochemical reactivity.

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Perspective on Materials Sustainability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective discusses natural materials as inspiration for sustainable engineering designs and the processing of materials. First, circularity, longevity, parsimony, and activity are presented as essential material paradigms. The perspective then uses many examples of natural and technical materials to introduce principles such as oligo&#8208;materiality, multifunctionality, modularity, defect tolerance, remodeling, healing, adaptivity, as well as controlled disintegration.








Abstract
The article explores materials sustainability through a bio&#8208;inspired lens and discusses paradigms that can reshape the understanding of material synthesis, processing, and usage. It addresses various technological fields, from structural engineering to healthcare, and emphasizes natural material cycles as a blueprint for efficient recycling and reuse. The study shows that material functionality depends on both chemical composition and structural modifications, which emphasizes the role of material processing. The article identifies strategies such as mono&#8208;materiality and multifunctionality, and explores how responsivity, adaptivity, modularity, and cellularity can simplify material assembly and disassembly. Bioinspired strategies for reusing materials, defect tolerance, maintenance, remodeling, and healing may extend product lifespans. The principles of circularity, longevity, and parsimony are reconsidered in the context of &#8220;active materiality&#8221;, a dynamic bio&#8208;inspired paradigm. This concept expands the traditional focus of material science from structure&#8208;function relationships to include the development of materials capable of responding or adapting to external stimuli. Concrete examples demonstrate how bio&#8208;inspired strategies are being applied in engineering and technology to enhance the sustainability of materials. The article concludes by emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration as a key factor for developing a sustainable and resilient materials economy in harmony with nature's material cycles.

         <title>Wood and Cellulose: the Most Sustainable Advanced Materials for Past, Present, and Future Civilizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wood and cellulose are the most abundant and important sustainable materials on the planet at the disposal to solve major societal challenges. This perspective, written for all materials scientists, highlights how breakthroughs in cellulose nanotechnology combined with functional nanomaterials can revolutionize important areas like construction, electronics, recycling, and intelligent materials at scale, toward a sustainable future.








Abstract
Wood, with its constituent building block cellulose, is by far the most common biomaterial on the planet and has been the most important material used by humans to establish civilization. If there is one single biomaterial that should be studied and used by materials scientists across disciplines to achieve a sustainable future, it is cellulose. This perspective provides insights for the general materials science community about the unique properties of wood and cellulose and how they may be used in advanced sustainable materials to make a substantial societal impact. The focus is on sawn wood or cellulose fibers produced at scale by industry and the more recent cellulosic nanomaterials, highlighting the areas where these cellulose&#8208;based materials can be valorized into higher&#8208;order functions. Numerous articles have comprehensively reviewed different areas where cellulose is currently used in advanced materials science. The objective here is to provide general insight for all material scientists and to provide the opinions about the areas in which cellulose and wood have the largest potential to make a significant societal impact, especially to realize next&#8208;generation sustainable materials for construction, food, water, energy, and information. Discussing key areas where future research is needed to open avenues toward a more sustainable future is ended.
