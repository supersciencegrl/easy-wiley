         <title>In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Grown Cu Dendrites Plasmonically Enhance Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution on Facet&#8208;Engineered Cu2O</title>

Facet&#8208;engineered&#160;Cu2O nanostructures are synthesized by wet&#8208;chemical methods for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).&#160;Operando&#160;Raman spectroscopy and&#160;ex situ&#160;characterization techniques show that Cu2O is reduced during HER.&#160;Incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency measurements combined with ab&#160;initio&#160;nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the hot&#8208;electron injection from Cu dendrites to Cu2O facilitates the plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic HER activity.








Abstract
Herein, facet&#8208;engineered Cu2O nanostructures are synthesized by wet chemical methods for electrocatalytic HER, and it is found that the octahedral Cu2O nanostructures with exposed crystal planes of (111) (O&#8208;Cu2O) has the best hydrogen evolution performance. Operando Raman spectroscopy and ex&#8208;situ characterization techniques showed that Cu2O is reduced during HER, in which Cu dendrites are grown on the surface of the Cu2O nanostructures, resulting in the better HER performance of O&#8208;Cu2O after HER (O&#8208;Cu2O&#8208;A) compared with that of the as&#8208;prepared O&#8208;Cu2O. Under illumination, the onset potential of O&#8208;Cu2O&#8208;A is ca. 52 mV positive than that of O&#8208;Cu2O, which is induced by the plasmon&#8208;activated electrochemical system consisting of Cu2O and the in&#8208;situ generated Cu dendrites. Incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (IPCE) measurements and the simulated UV&#8211;Vis spectrum demonstrate the hot electron injection (HEI) from Cu dendrites to Cu2O. Ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations revealed the transfer of photogenerated electrons (27 fs) from Cu dendrites to Cu2O nanostructures is faster than electron relaxation (170 fs), enhancing its surface plasmons activity, and the HEI of Cu dendrites increases the charge density of Cu2O. These make the energy level of the catalyst be closer to that of H+/H2, evidenced by the plasmon&#8208;enhanced HER electrocatalytic activity.

         <title>Lattice Strain Engineering of Ni2P Enables Efficient Catalytic Hydrazine Oxidation&#8208;Assisted Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile yet robust strategy is developed for strain engineering of Ni2P via double&#8208;cation co&#8208;doping. Both experimental and theoretic results reveal that the compressive strain can effectively reduce the reaction energy barrier of HzOR and HER, thereby significantly enhance the performance of hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted hydrogen production.








Abstract
Hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolysis provides new opportunities to enable energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production while solving the issue of hydrazine pollution. Here, the synthesis of compressively strained Ni2P as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for boosting both the anodic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is reported. Different from a multistep synthetic method that induces lattice strain by creating core&#8211;shell structures, a facile strategy is developed to tune the strain of&#160;Ni2P via dual&#8208;cation co&#8208;doping. The obtained Ni2P with a compressive strain of &#8722;3.62% exhibits significantly enhanced activity for both the HzOR and HER than counterparts with tensile strain and without strain. Consequently, the optimized Ni2P delivers current densities of 10 and 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at small cell voltages of 0.16 and 0.39&#160;V for hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolysis, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the compressive strain promotes water dissociation and concurrently tunes the adsorption strength of hydrogen intermediates, thereby facilitating the HER process on Ni2P. As for the HzOR, the compressive strain reduces the energy barrier of the potential&#8208;determining step for the dehydrogenation of *N2H4 to *N2H3. Clearly, this work paves a facile pathway to the synthesis of lattice&#8208;strained electrocatalysts via the dual&#8208;cation co&#8208;doping.

         <title>Immunogenic PANoptosis&#8208;initiated Cancer Sono&#8208;Immune Reediting Nanotherapy by Iteratively Boosting Cancer Immunity Cycle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The cancer&#8208;immune cycle conceptualized the mechanisms of driving T cell responses to tumors, but was limited by immunological ignorance elicited by tumor inherent immunoediting, which failed to initiate and maintain adaptive immunity. Targeting specific vulnerabilities of cell death patterns may provide unique opportunities to boost T cell anti&#8208;tumor immunological effects. Here we report an ultrasound nanomedicine&#8208;triggered tumor immuno&#8208;reediting therapeutic strategy using nano/genetically engineered extracellular vesicles, which can induce tumor highly immunogenic PANoptosis and iteratively start&#8208;up the energization of cancer innate immunity cycle by repeatedly liberating damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, thereby priming sufficient antigen&#8208;specific T cells and shaping protective immune response through activating cGAS&#8208;STING signaling pathways. Aided by immune checkpoint blockade, the reprogramming of immune microenvironment further facilitated a prompt bridging of innate and adaptive immunity, and remarkably suppressed metastatic and rechallenged tumor growth. Thus, targeting PANoptotic cell death provides a catcher against immune escape and a positive&#8208;feedback immune activation gateway for overcoming immune resistance to intractable cancers.

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Supramolecular Self&#8208;assembled Carbon Nitride Nanostructures for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Fast production of hydrogen and oxygen in large amounts at an economic rate is the need of the hour to cater to the needs of the most awaited hydrogen energy, a futuristic renewable energy solution. Production of hydrogen through a simple water splitting through visible light photocatalytic approach using sunlight is considered as one of the most promising and sustainable approaches for generating clean fuels. For this purpose, a variety of catalytic techniques and novel catalysts are being investigated. Among these catalysts, carbon nitride is presently deemed as one of the best candidates for the visible light photocatalysis due to its unique molecular structure and adequate visible&#8208;range band gap. Its band gap can further be engineered by structural and morphological manipulation or by, doping/hybridization. Among numerous synthetic approaches for carbon nitrides, supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is one of the recently developed elegant bottom&#8208;up strategies as it is bio&#8208;inspired and provides a facile and eco&#8208;friendly route to synthesise high surface area carbon nitride with superior morphological features and other semiconducting and catalytic properties. The current review article broadly covers supramolecular self&#8208;assembly synthesis of carbon nitride nanostructures and their photocatalytic water splitting application and provides a comprehensive outlook on the future directions.

         <title>Atomic Zincophilic Sites Regulating Microspace Electric Fields for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their intrinsic advantages. However, Zn tends to deposit irregularly and forms dendrites driven by the uneven space electric field distribution near the Zn&#8208;electrolyte interphase. Herein we demonstrate that trace addition of Co single atom anchored carbon (denoted as CoSA/C) in the electrolyte regulates the microspace electric field at the Zn&#8208;electrolyte interphase and unifies Zn deposition. Through preferential adsorption of CoSA/C on the Zn surface, the atomically dispersed Co&#8208;N3 with strong charge polarization effect can redistribute the local space electric field and regulate ion flux. Moreover, the dynamic adsorption/desorption of CoSA/C upon plating/stripping offers sustainable long&#8208;term regulation. Therefore, Zn||Zn symmetric cells with CoSA/C electrolyte additive deliver stable cycling up to 1600&#160;h (corresponding to a cumulative plated capacity of 8 Ah cm&#8722;2) at a high current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating the sustainable feature of microspace electric fields regulation at high current density and capacity.

&lt;p&gt;Aqueous Zn metal batteries are promising candidates for large-scale energy storage due to their intrinsic advantages. However, Zn tends to deposit irregularly and forms dendrites driven by the uneven space electric field distribution near the Zn-electrolyte interphase. Herein we demonstrate that trace addition of Co single atom anchored carbon (denoted as CoSA/C) in the electrolyte regulates the microspace electric field at the Zn-electrolyte interphase and unifies Zn deposition. Through preferential adsorption of CoSA/C on the Zn surface, the atomically dispersed Co-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with strong charge polarization effect can redistribute the local space electric field and regulate ion flux. Moreover, the dynamic adsorption/desorption of CoSA/C upon plating/stripping offers sustainable long-term regulation. Therefore, Zn||Zn symmetric cells with CoSA/C electrolyte additive deliver stable cycling up to 1600&#160;h (corresponding to a cumulative plated capacity of 8 Ah cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) at a high current density of 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, demonstrating the sustainable feature of microspace electric fields regulation at high current density and capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hydrogen Ion Capturing Hydrogel Microspheres for Reversing Inflammaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inflammaging is deeply involved in aging&#8208;related diseases and can be destructive during aging. The maintenance of pH balance in the extracellular microenvironment can alleviate inflammaging and repair aging&#8208;related tissue damage. In this study, the hydrogen ion capturing hydrogel microsphere (GMNP) composed of minerailized transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; (TGF&#8208;&#946;) and catalase (CAT) nanoparticles was developed via biomimetic mineralization and microfluidic technology for blocking the NLRP3 cascade axis in inflammaging. This GMNP could neutralize the acidic microenvironment by capturing excess hydrogen ions through the calcium carbonate mineralization layer. Then, the subsequent release of encapsulated TGF&#8208;&#946; and CAT can eliminate both endogenous and exogenous stimulus of NLRP3, thus suppressing the excessive activation of inflammaging. In vitro, GMNP can suppress the excessive activation of the TXNIP/NLRP3/IL&#8208;1&#946; cascade axis and enhance ECM synthesis in nucleus pulposus cells. In vivo, GMNP became a sustainable and stable niche with microspheres as the core to inhibit inflammaging and promote the regeneration of degenerated intervertebral discs. Therefore, this hydrogen ion&#8208;capturing hydrogel microsphere effectively reverse inflammaging via interfering with excessive activation of NLRP3 in the degenerated tissues.

         <title>Engineering of Local Coordination Microenvironment in Single&#8208;atom Catalysts Enabling Sustainable Conversion of Biomass into A Broad Range of Amines</title>

Abstract
Utilizing renewable biomass as a substitute for fossil resources to produce high&#8208;value chemicals with a low carbon footprint is an effective strategy for achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral society. Production of chemicals via single&#8208;atom catalysis is an attractive proposition due to its remarkable selectivity and high atomic efficiency. In this work, we employ a supramolecular controlled pyrolysis strategy to fabricate a palladium single&#8208;atom (Pd1/BNC) catalyst with B&#8208;doped Pd&#8208;Nx atomic configuration. Owing to the meticulously tailored local coordination microenvironment, the as&#8208;synthesized Pd1/BNC catalyst exhibits remarkable conversion capability for a wide range of biomass derived aldehydes/ketones. Thorough characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal that the highly polar metal&#8208;N&#8208;B site, formed between the central Pd single atom and its adjacent N and B atoms, promotes hydrogen activation from the donor (reductants) and hydrogen transfer to the acceptor (C = O group), consequently leading to exceptional selectivity. This system can be further extended to directly synthesize various aromatic and furonic amines from renewable lignocellulosic biomass, with their greenhouse gas emission potentials being negative in comparison to those of fossil&#8208;fuel resource&#8208;based amines. This research presents a highly effective and sustainable methodology for constructing C&#8208;N bonds, enabling the production of a diverse array of amines from carbon&#8208;neutral biomass resources.

         <title>Engineering and Characterization of an Artificial Drug&#8208;Carrying Vesicles Nanoplatform for Enhanced Specifically Targeted Therapy of Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs, which are constructed via a liposome extruder from HEK293T cells expressing ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1 peptides, can carry Doxorubicin (DOX) to penetrate blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and target inflamed brain tumors. It can improve the anticancer efficacy of DOX, significantly reducing side effects. Meanwhile, this work indicates that the nanoplatform may offer great promise for targeted glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) chemotherapy.








Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment is hindered by complex pathologies and the need to cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) during drug delivery. Although exosomes have great potential for GBM treatment, these alone cannot fully meet the therapeutic requirements, owing to their limitations in targeting and delivery. Herein, engineered artificial vesicles (EAVs), ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs, which are&#160;constructed using a liposome extruder from HEK293T cells expressing ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1 peptides, is developed. ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1 is a fusion peptide of Angiopep&#8208;2 fused to the N&#8208;terminus of TRP&#8208;PK1, to present Angiopep&#8208;2 on the EAVs. ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs have similar characteristics to the secreted exosomes, but a much higher yield. ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs have efficient BBB&#8208;penetration and GBM&#8208;targeting abilities in a mock BBB model in in vitro and orthotopic GBM mouse models in vivo. Doxorubicin loading EAVs (ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@DOX) do not alter the characteristics of the EAVs, which can cross the BBB, reach the GBM, and kill tumor cells in orthotopic GBM mouse models. These engineered drug&#8208;loaded artificial vesicles show better therapeutic effects on GBM than temozolomide in mice, with very few side effects. In conclusion, EAVs can be inserted into different targeting ligands and packed into different drugs, and they may serve as unique and efficient nanoplatforms for drug delivery and tumor promise therapy.

         <title>A Nano&#8208;Biohybrid&#8208;Based Bio&#8208;Solar Cell to Regulate the Electrical Signal Transmission to Living Cells for Biomedical Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nano&#8208;biohybrid&#8208;based bio&#8208;solar cell capable of absorbing a broad range of visible wavelengths and generating an amplified photocurrent density is developed to verify the possibility of its biomedical application. The electrophysiological signals of muscle cells at the neuromuscular junction are regulated precisely by motor neurons excited by the photocurrent of the bio&#8208;solar cell upon light irradiation.








Abstract
Bio&#8208;solar cells are studied as sustainable and biocompatible energy sources with significant potential for biomedical applications. However, they are composed of light&#8208;harvesting biomolecules with narrow absorption wavelengths and weak transient photocurrent generation. In this study, a nano&#8208;biohybrid&#8208;based bio&#8208;solar cell composed of bacteriorhodopsin, chlorophyllin, and Ni/TiO2 nanoparticles is developed to overcome the current limitations and verify the possibility of biomedical applications. Bacteriorhodopsin and chlorophyllin are introduced as light&#8208;harvesting biomolecules to broaden the absorption wavelength. As a photocatalyst, Ni/TiO2 nanoparticles are introduced to generate a photocurrent and amplify the photocurrent generated by the biomolecules. The developed bio&#8208;solar cell absorbs a broad range of visible wavelengths and generates an amplified stationary photocurrent density (152.6&#160;nA&#160;cm&#8722;2) with a long lifetime (up to 1&#160;month). Besides, the electrophysiological signals of muscle cells at neuromuscular junctions are precisely regulated by motor neurons excited by the photocurrent of the bio&#8208;solar cell, indicating that the bio&#8208;solar cell can control living cells by signal transmission through other types of living cells. The proposed nano&#8208;biohybrid&#8208;based bio&#8208;solar cell can be used as a sustainable and biocompatible energy source for the development of wearable and implantable biodevices and bioelectronic medicines for humans.

         <title>Titania&#8208;Supported Cu&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Electrochemical Reduction of Acetylene to Ethylene at Low&#8208;Concentrations with Suppressed Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TiO2&#8208;supported Cu&#8208;single&#8208;atom electrocatalyst is synthesized for the electrochemical reduction of acetylene at low concentrations. The electrocatalysts promote acetylene activation whilst suppressing hydrogen evolution and ethylene hydrogenation, achieving a 99.8% acetylene conversion with a space velocity of 3.12&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;mL&#160;gCu&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and a turnover frequency of 8.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2&#160;s&#8722;1 in an ethylene&#8208;rich feed gas mixture.








Abstract
Electrochemical acetylene reduction (EAR) is a promising strategy for removing acetylene from ethylene&#8208;rich gas streams. However, suppressing the undesirable hydrogen evolution is vital for practical applications in acetylene&#8208;insufficient conditions. Herein, Cu single atoms are immobilized on anatase TiO2 nanoplates (Cu&#8208;SA/TiO2) for electrochemical acetylene reduction, achieving an ethylene selectivity of &#8776;97% with a 5&#160;vol% acetylene gas feed (Ar balance). At the optimal Cu&#8208;single&#8208;atom loading, Cu&#8208;SA/TiO2 is&#160;able to effectively suppress HER and ethylene over&#8208;hydrogenation even when using dilute acetylene (0.5&#160;vol%) or ethylene&#8208;rich gas feeds, delivering a 99.8% acetylene conversion, providing a turnover frequency of 8.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2&#160;s&#8722;1, which is superior to other EAR catalysts reported to date. Theoretical calculations show that the Cu single atoms and the TiO2 support acted cooperatively to promote charge transfer to adsorbed acetylene molecules, whilst also inhibiting hydrogen generation in alkali environments, thus allowing selective ethylene production with negligible hydrogen evolution at low acetylene concentrations.

     alt="Titania-Supported Cu-Single-Atom Catalyst for Electrochemical Reduction of Acetylene to Ethylene at Low-Concentrations with Suppressed Hydrogen Evolution"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-supported Cu-single-atom electrocatalyst is synthesized for the electrochemical reduction of acetylene at low concentrations. The electrocatalysts promote acetylene activation whilst suppressing hydrogen evolution and ethylene hydrogenation, achieving a 99.8% acetylene conversion with a space velocity of 3.12&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;mL&#160;g&lt;sub&gt;Cu&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a turnover frequency of 8.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in an ethylene-rich feed gas mixture.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical acetylene reduction (EAR) is a promising strategy for removing acetylene from ethylene-rich gas streams. However, suppressing the undesirable hydrogen evolution is vital for practical applications in acetylene-insufficient conditions. Herein, Cu single atoms are immobilized on anatase TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoplates (Cu-SA/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for electrochemical acetylene reduction, achieving an ethylene selectivity of &#8776;97% with a 5&#160;vol% acetylene gas feed (Ar balance). At the optimal Cu-single-atom loading, Cu-SA/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is&#160;able to effectively suppress HER and ethylene over-hydrogenation even when using dilute acetylene (0.5&#160;vol%) or ethylene-rich gas feeds, delivering a 99.8% acetylene conversion, providing a turnover frequency of 8.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is superior to other EAR catalysts reported to date. Theoretical calculations show that the Cu single atoms and the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; support acted cooperatively to promote charge transfer to adsorbed acetylene molecules, whilst also inhibiting hydrogen generation in alkali environments, thus allowing selective ethylene production with negligible hydrogen evolution at low acetylene concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>B&#8208;N Covalent Bond Embedded Double Hetero&#8208;[n]helicenes for Pure Red Narrowband Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence with High Efficiency and Stability</title>

Abstract
Chiral B/N embedded multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters&#160;open a new paradigm of circularly polarized (CP) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) owing to their unique narrowband spectra. However, pure&#8208;red CP&#8208;MR emitters and devices remain exclusive in literature. Herein, by introducing a B&#8208;N covalent bond to lower the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the para&#8208;positioned B&#8208;&#960;&#8208;B motif, we developed the first&#160;pair of pure&#8208;red double hetero&#8208;[n]helicenes (n = 6 and 7) CP&#8208;MR emitter peaking 617&#160;nm with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 38&#160;nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of &#8764;100% in toluene. The intense mirror&#8208;image CP light produced by the enantiomers is characterized by high photoluminescence dissymmetry factors (gPL) of +1.40/&#8722;1.41 &#215; 10&#8722;3 from their stable helicenes configuration. The corresponding devices using these enantiomers afford impressive CP electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gEL) of +1.91/&#8722;1.77 &#215; 10&#8722;3, maximum external quantum efficiencies of 36.6%/34.4% and Commission Internationale de I&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.67, 0.33), exactly satisfying the red&#8208;color requirement specified by National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) standard. Notably a remarkable long LT95 (operational time to 95% of the initial luminance) of approximately 400 hours at an initial brightness of 10,000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 is also observed for the same device, representing the most stable CP&#8208;OLED up to date.

         <title>Polarization Reversal of Group Iv&#8211;Vi Semiconductors with Pucker&#8208;Like Structure: Mechanism Dissecting And Function Demonstration</title>

Abstract
Polarization imaging presents advantages in capturing spatial, spectral, and polarization information from target objects across various spectral bands. It can improve the perceptual ability of image sensors and has garnered more applications. Despite its potential, challenges persist in identifying band information from imaged objects and implementing image enhancement using polarization imaging. These challenges often necessitate integrating spectrometers or other components, resulting in increased complexities within image processing systems and hindering device miniaturization trends. Here, we systematically elucidate the characteristics of anisotropic absorption reversal in pucker&#8208;like group IV&#8208;VI semiconductors MX (M = Ge, Sn; X = S, Se) through theoretical predictions and experimental validations. Additionally, the fundamental mechanisms behind anisotropy reversal in different bands are also explored. The polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetector is constructed by utilizing MX as light&#8208;absorbing layer, harnessing polarization&#8208;sensitive photoresponse for virtual imaging. The results indicate that the utilization of polarization reversal photodetectors, without excessively emphasizing anisotropy photocurrent ratios, holds advantages in achieving further multifunctional integration within the device structure while simplifying its configuration, including band information identification and image enhancement. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of polarization reversal mechanisms and presents a promising and reliable approach for achieving dual&#8208;band image band identification and image enhancement without additional auxiliary components.

         <title>Alternating Current Electroluminescence for Human&#8208;Interactive Sensing Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of stimuli&#8208;interactive displays based on alternating current (AC)&#8208;driven electroluminescence (EL) is of great interest, owing to their simple device architectures suitable for wearable applications requiring resilient mechanical flexibility and stretchability. AC&#8208;EL displays can serve as emerging platforms for various human&#8208;interactive sensing displays (HISDs) where human information is electrically detected and directly visualized using EL, promoting the development of the interaction of human&#8211;machine technologies. This review provides a holistic overview of latest developments in AC&#8208;EL displays with an emphasis on their applications for HISDs. AC&#8208;EL displays based on exciton recombination or impact excitations of hot electrons are classified into four representative groups depending upon their device architecture: (1) displays without insulating layers, (2) displays with single insulating layers, (3) displays with double insulating layers, and (4) displays with EL materials embedded in an insulating matrix. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art AC HISDs are discussed. Furthermore, emerging stimuli&#8208;interactive AC&#8208;EL displays are described, followed by a discussion of scientific and engineering challenges and perspectives for future stimuli&#8208;interactive AC&#8208;EL displays serving as photo&#8208;electronic human&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>3D Printed Cellulose Nanofiber Aerogel Scaffold with Hierarchical Porous Structures for Fast Solar&#8208;driven Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Hygroscopic salt&#8208;based composite sorbents are considered ideal candidates for solar&#8208;driven atmospheric water harvesting (AWH). The primary obstacle for the sorbents lies in exposing more hygroscopic active sites to the surrounding air while preventing salt leakage. Herein, we construct a hierarchical structured scaffold by integrating cellulose nanofiber (CNF) and lithium chloride (LiCl) as building blocks through 3D printing combined with freeze&#8208;drying. The milli/micron multiscale pores can effectively confine LiCl and simultaneously provide more exposed active area for water sorption and release, accelerating both water sorption and evaporation kinetics of the 3D printed structure. Compared to the conventional freeze&#8208;dried aerogel, the 3D printed scaffold exhibits a water sorption rate that is greater than 1.6 times, along with a water release rate that exceeds 2.4 times. An array of bilayer scaffolds is demonstrated, which can produce 0.63&#160;g g&#8211;1 day&#8211;1 of water outdoors under natural sunlight. Our work provides a sustainable strategy for collecting freshwater from atmosphere.

         <title>Chiral Van Der Waals Superlattices for Enhanced Spin&#8208;Selective Transport And Spin&#8208;Dependent Electrocatalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The emergence of chiral&#8208;induced spin&#8208;selectivity (CISS) effect offers a new avenue for chiral organic molecules to autonomously manipulate spin configurations, thereby opening up possibilities in spintronics and spin&#8208;dependent electrochemical applications. Despite extensive exploration of various chiral systems as spin filters, one often encounters challenges in achieving simultaneously high conductivity and high spin polarization (SP). In this study, a promising chiral van der Waals superlattice, specifically the chiral TiS2 crystal, was synthesized via electrochemical intercalation of chiral molecules into a metallic TiS2 single crystal. Multiple tunneling processes within the highly ordered chiral layered structure of chiral TiS2 superlattices results in an exceptionally high SP exceeding 90%. This remarkable observation of significantly high SP within the linear transport regime is unprecedented. Furthermore, the chiral TiS2 electrode exhibited enhanced catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its remarkable spin&#8208;selectivity for triplet oxygen evolution. The OER performance of chiral TiS2 superlattice crystals presented here exhibits superior characteristics to previously reported chiral MoS2 catalysts, with an approximately 10&#8208;fold increase in current density. The combination of metallic conductivity and high SP sets the stage for the development of a new generation of CISS materials, enabling a wide range of electron spin&#8208;based applications.

The OER performance of chiral TiS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; superlattice crystals presented here exhibits superior characteristics to previously reported chiral MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts, with an approximately 10-fold increase in current density. The combination of metallic conductivity and high &lt;i&gt;SP&lt;/i&gt; sets the stage for the development of a new generation of CISS materials, enabling a wide range of electron spin-based applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Programmable Oxygenation Device Facilitates Oxygen Generation and Replenishment to Promote Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inadequate oxygenation is one of the chief culprits for delayed wound healing. However, current oxygen therapies, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy and topical oxygen therapy, face hurdles in providing sustained and long&#8208;term oxygenation to reverse wound hypoxia. Furthermore, their efficacy in rejuvenating wound injury is restricted by limited penetration of oxygen in the wound bed. Herein, this study proposes a programmable and portable oxygenation device (named GUFO oxydevice) by ingeniously integrating (i) a controllable oxygen generation and unidirectional transmission system (COGT&#8208;UTS), and (ii) a supramolecular assembled perfluorinated hyperbranched polymer/gelatin (GUF) hydrogel in which the perfluorinated hyperbranched polymer (FHBP) acts as an oxygen reservoir to ensure sustained and convenient oxygen replenishment and thus directly regulate the hypoxic wound microenvironment. Accelerating the wound healing process by GUFO oxydevice&#160;was&#160;achieved in both a diabetic rat and an acute porcine wound model without any secondary tissue damages. The present study demonstrates that the GUFO oxydevice holds promise as a practically feasible candidate for wound treatment.

         <title>Regulating Lithium Transfer Pathway to Avoid Capacity Fading of Nano Si Through Sub&#8208;Nano Scale Interfused Siox/C Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Si nanoparticles (NPs) are considered as a promising high&#8208;capacity anode material owing to their ability to prevent mechanical failure from drastic volume change during (de)lithiation. However, upon cycling, a quick capacity fading is still observed for Si NPs, and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this contribution, we demonstrate that the quick capacity fading is mainly caused by the generation of dead (electrochemically inert) Si with blocked electron conductivity in a densely composited Si/SEI (solid electrolyte interface) hybrid. This is due to the combined influence of electrolyte&#8208;related side reactions and the accompanied agglomeration of Si NPs. We construct a compact, sub&#8208;nano scale interfused SiOx/C composite coating onto the Si NPs, and achieve a highly stabilized electrochemistry upon long cycling. The SiOx/C coating with electron/ion dual transport paths and robust mechanical flexibility enables a fast and stable lithium ion/electron dual diffusion pathway towards the encapsulated Si. With fast reaction kinetics, stable SEI, and an anti&#8208;agglomeration feature, the obtained Si@SiOx/C composite demonstrates a stable high capacity. This work unravels new perspectives on the capacity fading of Si NPs and provides an effective encapsulating method to remedy the structure degradation and capacity fading of nano Si.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Cubic K3&#8208;2xBaxSbSe4 Solid Electrolytes for K&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Developing K&#8208;ion conducting solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) plays a critical role in the safe implementation of potassium batteries. In this work, we report a chalcogenide&#8208;based potassium ion SSEs, K3SbSe4, which adopts a trigonal structure at room temperature. Single&#8208;crystal structural analysis reveals a trigonal&#8208;to&#8208;cubic phase transition at the low temperature of 50&#176;C, which is the lowest among similar compounds and thus provides easy access to the cubic phase. The substitution of barium for potassium in K3SbSe4 leads to the creation of potassium vacancies, expansion of lattice parameters, and a transformation from a trigonal phase to a cubic phase. As a result, the maximum conductivity of K3&#8208;2xBaxSbSe4 reaches around 0.1 mS/cm at 40&#176;C for K2.2Ba0.4SbSe4, which is over two orders of magnitude higher than that of undoped K3SbSe4. This novel SSE is successfully employed in a K&#8208;O2 battery operating at room temperature where a polymer&#8208;laminated K2.2Ba0.4SbSe4 pellet serves as a separator between the oxygen cathode and the potassium metal anode. Effective protection of the K metal anode against corrosion caused by O2 has been demonstrated.

         <title>Synthesis of Clean Hydrogen Gas from Waste Plastic at Zero Net Cost</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrogen gas (H2) is the primary storable fuel for pollution&#8208;free energy production, with over 90 million tonnes used globally per year. More than 95% of H2 is synthesized through metal&#8208;catalyzed steam methane reforming that produces 11 tonnes of CO2 per tonne H2. &#8220;Green H2&#8221; from water electrolysis using renewable energy evolves no CO2, but costs 2&#8211;3x more, making it presently economically unviable. Here &#160;we report catalyst&#8208;free conversion of waste plastic into clean H2 along with high purity graphene. The scalable procedure evolves no CO2 when deconstructing polyolefins and produces H2 in purities up to 94% at high mass yields. Sale of graphene byproduct at just 5% of its current value yields H2 production at negative cost. Life&#8208;cycle assessment demonstrates a 39&#8211;84% reduction in emissions compared to other H2 production methods, suggesting the flash H2 process to be an economically viable, clean H2 production route.

         <title>Bioactivable Sting Nanoagonists to Synergize Nir&#8208;Ii Mild Photothermal Therapy Primed Robust and Long&#8208;Term Anticancer Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Pharmacological activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway has become a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy, however, the insufficient tumorous accumulation, rapid clearance, and short duration of drug efficacy in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of small structural STING agonists greatly compromise the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we present a tumorous extracellular matrix (ECM) anchoring STING agonist&#8208;based photoimmunothernostic nanomedicine (SAPTN) that can be activated by mild&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy (mild PTT) induced neutrophilic inflammation. The SAPTN owns second window near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) photonics properties fitting for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided cancer therapy. The aggregates SAPTN targeting to ECM provide slow and continuous release of potent STING agonists diABZIs. The mild PTT and long&#8208;lasting STING agonists release in ECM synergistically prime systematic robust and long&#8208;term anticancer immunity. In tumor model, this approach led to complete tumor eradication in about 100% of mice with orthotopic breast tumors and the mice regained tumor&#8208;free survival of at least 2 months. In addition, immune&#8208;mediated abscopal effect showed inhibition of the distant solid tumor growth by intratumoral administration of SAPTN with laser irradiation. Overall, this approach represents a generalized photoactivable nanomedicine to prime anticancer immunity for improved cancer theranostics.

The absences of effective delivery vectors and suitable multifunctional plasmids limit cancer gene therapy development. The star cationic poly(disulfide)s with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin cores (termed &#946;&#8208;CD&#8208;g&#8208;PSSn) for caveolae&#8208;mediated endocytosis are designed and prepared via mild and controllable disulfide exchange polymerization for high&#8208;efficacy cancer therapy. Then, &#946;&#8208;CD&#8208;g&#8208;PSSn/pDNA complexes are transported to the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum. Disulfides in &#946;&#8208;CD&#8208;g&#8208;PSSn vectors are degraded by glutathione in tumor cells, which not only promote intracellular pDNA release but also reduce in vitro and in vivo toxicity. One bifunctional fusion plasmid pCATKR, which expresses catalase (CAT) fused to KillerRed (KR) (CATKR) in the same target cell, is also proposed for genetically cascade catalytic therapy. When compared with pCAT&#8208;KR (plasmid expressing CAT and KR separately in the same cell), delivered pCATKR decomposes hydrogen peroxide, alleviates tumor hypoxia more effectively, generates stronger reactive oxygen species (ROS) capabilities under moderate irradiation, and leads to robust antitumor cascade photodynamic effects. These impressive results are attributed to fusion protein design, which shorten the distance between CAT and KR catalytic centers, and lead to improved ROS production efficiency. This work provides a promising strategy by delivering a catalytic cascade functional plasmid via a high&#8208;performance vector with biodegradable and caveolae&#8208;mediated endocytosis characteristics.

Abstract
Copper antimony sulphides are regarded as promising catalysts for photoelectrochemical water splitting because of their earth abundance and broad light absorption. The unique photoactivity of copper antimony sulphides is dependent on their various crystalline structures and atomic compositions. Here, we built a closed&#8208;loop workflow that explores Cu&#8208;Sb&#8208;S compositional space to optimise its photoelectrocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water, by integrating a high&#8208;throughput robotic platform, characterization techniques, and machine learning (ML) optimization workflow. The multiple&#8208;objective optimization model discovered optimum experimental conditions after only nine cycles of integrated experiments&#8208;machine learning loop. Photocurrent testing at 0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) confirmed the expected correlation between the materials properties and photocurrent. An optimum photocurrent of &#8208;186&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2 was observed on Cu&#8208;Sb&#8208;S in the ratio of 9:45:46 in the form of single&#8208;layer coating on F&#8208;doped SnO2 (FTO) glass with a corresponding bandgap of 1.85&#160;eV and 63.2% Cu1+/Cu species content. The targeted intelligent search revealed a non&#8208;obvious CuSbS composition that exhibited 2.3 times greater activity than baseline results from random sampling.

         <title>Understanding Microstructural Development of Perovskite Crystallization for High Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solution crystallization in film devices has attracted broad interest from various fields such as perovskite solar cells. However, the detailed perovskite crystallization kinetics remain unclear due to the difficulty of in&#8208;situ observation of grain cluster growth during annealing. Here we present our development of an in&#8208;situ laser scanning confocal polarized microscopy with a temperature&#8208;controlled stage to observe nucleation and growth of perovskite crystal clusters. It is found that enhanced interactions by a liquid crystal with perovskite form a new intermediate complex that induces diffusion&#8208;controlled growth according to Avrami equation. The retarded cluster growth (63&#160;nm&#160;&#8722;1s) originates from enlarged diffusion activation energy 40&#160;kJ/mol compared with 152&#160;nm&#160;&#8722;1s and 37&#160;kJ/mol for the Control film during annealing. Finally, the optimized perovskite films with enhanced crystallographic and optical characteristics are applied in solar cells to achieve a champion efficiency of 24.53% with open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.172&#160;V and fill factor (FF) of 82.78%. The bare device without any protection maintains 89% of its initial efficiency after 6600&#160;h of aging in ambient environment. This work implies that the in&#8208;situ observation using fluorescence microscopy is a critical for understanding of crystallization kinetics in film devices.

         <title>Augmenting Immunotherapy via Bioinspired MOF&#8208;based Ros Homeostasis Disruptor with Nanozyme&#8208;Cascade Reaction</title>

Abstract
Despite its remarkable clinical breakthroughs, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy remains limited by the insufficient immune response in the &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor. Nanozyme&#8208;based antitumor catalysis is associated with precise immune activation in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, a cascade&#8208;augmented nanoimmunomodulator (CMZM) with multienzyme&#8208;like activities, which includes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx), that dissociates under an acidic and abundant GSH TME, is proposed for multimodal imaging&#8208;guided chemodynamic therapy (CDT)/photodynamic therapy (PDT) enhanced immunotherapy. Vigorous multienzyme&#8208;like activities can not only produce O2 to alleviate hypoxia and promote the polarization of M2 to M1 macrophages but also generate ROS (&#8226;OH and 1O2) and deplete GSH in the TME to expose necrotic cell fragments and reverse immunosuppressive TME by eliciting the maturation of dendritic cells and infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes in tumors. Therefore, inhibitory effects on both primary and distant tumors were achieved through synergy with an &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 blocking antibody. This cascade multienzyme&#8208;based nanoplatform provides a smart strategy for highly efficient ICB immunotherapy against &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors by revising immunosuppressive TME.

         <title>Unlocking The Potential of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based Oxides for High&#8208;rate Rechargeable Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based oxides have gained significant attention worldwide as potential cathode materials for the next generation of high&#8208;energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their discharge capacities exceeding 250 mAh g&#8211;1. Nonetheless, the inferior rate capability and voltage decay issues present formidable challenges. Conventional approaches to improving rate performance, like nano&#8208; and porous structural design, increase surface area of cathode and consequently accelerate harmful Mn&#8208;ion migration and oxygen loss. Here, we initially synthesize a Li&#8208;rich material equipped with quasi&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional Li&#8208;ion diffusion channels by introducing twin structures with high Li&#8208;ion diffusion coefficients into the crystal and constructing a &#8220;bridge&#8221; between different Li&#8208;ion diffusion tunnels. The as&#8208;prepared material exhibits monodispersed micron&#8208;sized primary particles, delivering a specific capacity of 303 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1C and an impressive capacity of 253 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1C. More importantly, the twin structure also serves as a &#8220;breakwater&#8221; to inhibit the migration of Mn ions and improve the overall structural stability, leading to long&#8208;term cycling stability with 85% capacity retention at 1C after 200 cycles. Our proposed strategy of constructing quasi&#8208;three&#8208;dimensional channels in the layered Li&#8208;rich cathodes will open up new avenues for the research and development of other layered oxide cathodes, with potential applications in industry.

&lt;p&gt;Lithium-rich Mn-based oxides have gained significant attention worldwide as potential cathode materials for the next generation of high-energy density lithium-ion batteries due to their discharge capacities exceeding 250 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Nonetheless, the inferior rate capability and voltage decay issues present formidable challenges. Conventional approaches to improving rate performance, like nano- and porous structural design, increase surface area of cathode and consequently accelerate harmful Mn-ion migration and oxygen loss.

         <title>Revealing Co&#8208;N4@Co&#8208;Np Bridge&#8208;Enabled Fast Charge Transfer And Active Intracellular Methanogenesis in Bio&#8208;Electrochemical CO2&#8208;conversion with Methanosarcina Barkeri</title>

Abstract
Unfavorable electron transfer at the biotic&#8208;abiotic interface and slow electron utilization by metabolism hinder the fast conversion of CO2 in bio&#8208;electrochemical systems. To significantly advance the bio&#8208;electrochemical CO2&#8208;conversion rate and unfold the correlation between the abiotic electrode and the attached microorganisms, an atomic&#8208;nanoparticle bridge of Co&#8208;N4@Co&#8208;NP crafted in metal&#8208;organic frameworks&#8208;derived nanosheets is integrated with a model methanogen of Methanosarcina barkeri (M.barkeri). The direct bonding of N in Co&#8208;N4 and Fe in member protein of Cytb activates a fast direct electron transfer path while the Co nanoparticles further strengthen this bonding via decreasing the energy gap between the p&#8208;band center of N and the d&#8208;band center of Fe. This multi&#8208;orbital tuning operation of Co nanoparticles also enhances the coenzyme F420&#8208;mediated electron transfer by enabling the electron flow direct to the hydrogenation sites.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfavorable electron transfer at the biotic-abiotic interface and slow electron utilization by metabolism hinder the fast conversion of CO2 in bio-electrochemical systems. To significantly advance the bio-electrochemical CO2-conversion rate and unfold the correlation between the abiotic electrode and the attached microorganisms, an atomic-nanoparticle bridge of Co-N4@Co-NP crafted in metal-organic frameworks-derived nanosheets is integrated with a model methanogen of Methanosarcina barkeri (M.barkeri). The direct bonding of N in Co-N4 and Fe in member protein of Cytb activates a fast direct electron transfer path while the Co nanoparticles further strengthen this bonding via decreasing the energy gap between the p-band center of N and the d-band center of Fe. This multi-orbital tuning operation of Co nanoparticles also enhances the coenzyme F420-mediated electron transfer by enabling the electron flow direct to the hydrogenation sites. Particularly, the increased surface electric field of the Co-N4@Co-NP bridge-based nanosheet electrode facilitates the interfacial Na+ accumulation to expedite ATPase transport for powering intracellular CO2 conversion. Remarkably, the self-assembled M.barkeri-Co-N4@Co-NP biohybrid achieves a high methane production rate of 3860&#160;mmol/m2/day, which greatly outperforms other reported biohybrid systems. This work demonstrates a comprehensive scrutinization of biotic-abiotic energy transfer, which may serve as a guiding principle for efficient bio-electrochemical system design.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enhancing the Carrier Transport in Monolayer MoS2 Through Interlayer Coupling with 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The coupling of different two&#8208;dimensional materials (2DMs) to form van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) is a powerful strategy for adjusting the electronic properties of 2D semiconductors, for applications in opto&#8208;electronics and quantum computing. 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) represents an archetypical semiconducting, monolayer thick versatile platform for the generation of hybrid vdWH with tunable charge transport characteristics through its interfacing with molecules and assemblies thereof. However, the physisorption of (macro)molecules on 2D MoS2 yields hybrids possessing a limited thermal stability, thereby jeopardizing their technological applications. Herein, we report the rational design and optimized synthesis of 2D covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) for the generation of MoS2 / 2D&#8208;COF vdWHs exhibiting strong interlayer coupling effects. The high crystallinity of the 2D&#8208;COF films made it possible to engineer an ultrastable periodic doping effect on MoS2, boosting devices&#8217; field&#8208;effect mobility at room temperature. Such a performance increase can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the efficient interfacial electron transfer process and the pronounced suppression of MoS2&#8217;s lattice vibration. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept work validates an unprecedented approach for the efficient modulation of the electronic properties of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides toward high&#8208;performance (opto)electronics for CMOS digital circuits.

         <title>Purposive Design of Stretchable Composite Electrodes for Strain&#8208;Negative, Strain&#8208;Neutral, and Strain&#8208;Positive Ionic Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Soft ionic sensors have emerged as a promising device form to accommodate various future electronic applications. One of the hurdles in ionic sensors is that the sensing signals by mechanical deformation and other stimuli are mixed up. Although the performance of the ionic sensors is highly dependent on the structure of electrodes, systematic investigation of purposive electrode design has been rarely explored. This study proposes a simple strategy for designing stretchable composite electrodes which make the ionic sensor strain&#8208;negative, strain&#8208;neutral, and strain&#8208;positive. This study reveals that such strain&#8208;responses can be obtained by adjusting the surface coverage of the electrically&#8208;effective conductive fillers. On the basis of the concept, deposition of a Au film on an elastomer composite and crack formation of the Au film are presented for the practical fabrication of a highly reproducible strain&#8208;neutral ionic sensor. A completely strain&#8208;independent temperature sensor is demonstrated by using the Au crack&#8208;based ionic sensor. In addition, this study demonstrates a two&#8208;terminal shear sensor capable of recognizing shear directions by combining the strain&#8208;positive and strain&#8208;negative electrodes.

         <title>GSH/Ph Dual Activatable Crosslinked And Fluorinated Pei for Cancer Gene Therapy Through Endogenous Iron De&#8208;Hijacking And in Situ Ros Amplification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ferroptosis&#8208;related cancer therapy is limited by insufficient Fe2+/Fe3+ redox pair and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for producing lethal hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH). Although exogenous iron or ROS&#8208;producing drugs can enhance ferroptosis, exploiting endogenous iron (labile iron pool, LIP) stored in ferritin and promoting ROS generation may be safer. Herein, a metal/drug&#8208;free nanomedicine was developed for responsive LIP release and H2O2 generation on the mitochondria membranes, amplifying hydroxyl radical production to enhance ferroptosis&#8208;mediated anti&#8208;tumor effects. A GSH/pH dual activatable fluorinated and crosslinked polyethyleneimine with dialdehyde polyethylene glycol layer nanocomplex loaded with MTS&#8208;KR&#8208;SOD (Mitochondria&#8208;targeting&#8208;sequence&#8208;KillerRed&#8208;Superoxide Dismutase) and CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;CA IX (Carbonic anhydrase IX) plasmids (FP@MC) were developed for enhanced ferroptosis through endogenous iron de&#8208;hijacking and in situ ROS amplification. Two plasmids were constructed to knock down carbonic anhydrase IX and translate KillerRed&#8208;SuperOxide Dismutase recombinant protein specifically on mitochondria membranes, respectively. The CA IX knockdown acidified the intracellular environment, leading the release of LIP from ferritin as a &#8220;flare&#8221; to initiate endogenous chemodynamic therapy. Meanwhile, MTS&#8208;KR&#8208;SOD generated H2O2 when irradiated by a 590&#160;nm laser to assist chemodynamic therapy, leading to ROS amplification for mitochondria damage and lipid peroxide accumulation. The combined therapeutic effects aggravated cancer ferroptosis and suppressed tumor growth, providing a new paradigm for amplifying ROS and iron ions to promote ferroptosis&#8208;related cancer therapy.

         <title>Overcoming Barriers Associated with Oral Delivery of Differently Sized Fluorescent Core&#8208;Shell Silica Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Oral delivery, while a highly desirable form of nanoparticle&#8208;drug administration, is limited by challenges associated with overcoming several biological barriers. Here we study how fluorescent and poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;coated (PEGylated) core&#8208;shell silica nanoparticles with sizes from 5 to 50&#160;nm interact with major barriers including intestinal mucus, intestinal epithelium, and stomach acid. From imaging fluorescence correlation spectroscopy studies on a quasi&#8208;total internal reflection fluorescence microscope setup, diffusion of nanoparticles through highly scattering mucus is progressively hindered above a critical hydrodynamic size around 20&#160;nm. By studying Caco&#8208;2 cell monolayers mimicking the intestinal epithelia, we observe that ultrasmall nanoparticles below 10&#160;nm diameter (C&#8217; dots) show permeabilities correlated with high absorption in humans from primarily enhanced passive passage associated with tight junctions. Particles above 20&#160;nm diameter exclusively show active transport through cells. After establishing C&#8217; dot stability in artificial gastric juice, in vivo oral gavage experiments in mice demonstrate successful passage through the body followed by renal clearance without protein corona formation. Results suggest C&#8217; dots as viable candidates for oral administration to patients with a proven pathway towards clinical translation and may generate renewed interest in examining silica as a food additive and its effects on nutrition and health.

         <title>Recent Advances in Moir&#233; Superlattice Systems by Angle&#8208;Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The last decade has witnessed a flourish in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials including graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as atomic&#8208;scale Legos. Artificial moir&#233; superlattices via stacking 2D materials with a twist angle and/or a lattice mismatch have recently become a fertile playground exhibiting a plethora of emergent properties beyond their building blocks. These rich quantum phenomena stem from their nontrivial electronic structures that have been effectively tuned by the moir&#233; periodicity. Modern angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) can directly visualize electronic structures with decent momentum, energy, and spatial resolution, thus could provide enlightening insights into fundamental physics in moir&#233; superlattice systems and guides for designing novel devices. In this review, firstly a brief introduction is given on advanced ARPES techniques and basic ideas of band structures in a moir&#233; superlattice system. Then ARPES research results of various moir&#233; superlattice systems are highlighted, including graphene on substrates with small lattice mismatches, twisted graphene/TMD moir&#233; systems, and high&#8208;order moir&#233; superlattice systems. Finally, we discuss on important questions that remain open, challenges in current experimental investigations and present an outlook on this field of research.

         <title>Engineering Atomic&#8208;Scale Patterning and Resistive Switching in Two&#8208;Dimensional Crystals and Application in Image Processing</title>

Abstract
The ultrathin thickness of two&#8208;dimensional layered materials affords the control of their properties through defects, surface modification, and electrostatic fields more efficiently compared with bulk architecture. In particular, patterning design, such as moir&#233; superlattice patterns and spatially periodic dielectric structures, has been demonstrated to possess the ability to precisely control the local atomic and electronic environment at large scale, thus providing extra degrees of freedom to realize tailored material properties and device functionality. Here,&#160;we&#160;report the scalable atomic&#8208;scale patterning in superionic cuprous telluride by using the bonding difference at nonequivalent copper sites. Moreover, benefitting from the natural coupling of ordered and disordered sublattices,&#160;we&#160;realize controllable piezoelectricity&#8208;like multi&#8208;level switching and bipolar switching with the designed crystal structure and electrical contact, and demonstrate their application in image enhancement. This work extends the known classes of patternable crystals and atomic switching devices, and ushers in a frontier for image processing with memristors.

Abstract
In vitro biological models are essential to a broad range of biomedical research, including drug development, pathological studies, and personalized medicine. As a potentially transformative paradigm of in vitro 3D biological models, organs&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip (OOC) devices have been extensively developed to recapitulate sophisticated architectures and dynamic microenvironments of organs by applying the principles of life sciences and leveraging micro&#8208; and nanoscale engineering capabilities. A pivotal function of OOC devices is to support multifaceted and timely analysis of living tissues and their microenvironments. However, in&#8208;depth analysis of OOC models typically requires biomedical assay procedures that are labor&#8208;intensive and interruptive. This article examines the latest advances toward intelligent OOC (iOOC) systems where sensors integrated with OOC devices continuously report cellular and microenvironmental information for comprehensive in situ bioanalysis. It is envisioned that the multimodal data in iOOC systems can support closed&#8208;loop control of iOOC models and offer holistic biomedical insights for diverse applications. Essential techniques for establishing iOOC systems are surveyed, encompassing in situ sensing, data processing, and dynamic modulation. Eventually, the future development of iOOC systems featuring cross&#8208;disciplinary strategies is discussed.

         <title>Machine Learning Paves the Way for High Entropy Compounds Exploration: Challenges, Progress, and Outlook</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in the research field of high entropy compounds (HEC), which have gained worldwide attention due to their vast compositional space and abundant regulatability. However, the complex structure space of HEC poses challenges to traditional experimental and computational approaches, necessitating the adoption of machine learning. Microscopically, machine learning can model the Hamiltonian of the HEC system, enabling atomic&#8208;level property investigations, while macroscopically, it can analyze macroscopic material characteristics such as hardness, melting point, and ductility. Various machine learning algorithms, both traditional methods and deep neural networks can be employed in HEC research. Comprehensive and accurate data collection, feature engineering, and model training and selection through cross&#8208;validation are crucial for establishing excellent ML models. ML also holds promise in analyzing phase structures and stability, constructing potentials in simulations, and facilitating the design of functional materials. Although some domains, such as magnetic and device materials, still require further exploration, machine learning's potential in HEC research is substantial. Consequently, machine learning has become an indispensable tool in understanding and exploiting the capabilities of HEC, serving as the foundation for the new paradigm of artificial intelligence&#8208;assisted material exploration.

         <title>An H2O&#8208;Initiated Crosslinking Strategy for Ultrafine&#8208;Nanoclusters&#8208;Reinforced High&#8208;Toughness Polymer&#8208;In&#8208;Plasticizer Solid Electrolyte</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel crosslinking strategy where metal&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;terminated polymers can be crosslinked by precisely controlling the content of H2O as an initiator is proposed. After incorporating a high concentration of plasticizers, the polymer&#8208;in&#8208;plasticizer solid electrolyte still maintains outstanding mechanical properties, thus demonstrating fast lithium&#8208;conduction kinetics and effective inhibition of lithium dendrites simultaneously.








Abstract
Incorporating plasticizers is an effective way to facilitate conduction of ions in solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). However, this conductivity enhancement often comes at the cost of reduced mechanical properties, which can make the electrolyte membrane more difficult to process and increase safety hazards. Here, a novel crosslinking strategy, wherein metal&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;terminated polymers can be crosslinked by precisely controlling the content of H2O as an initiator, is proposed. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, trimethylaluminum (TMA)&#8208;functionalized poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) is used to demonstrate that ultrafine Al&#8211;O nanoclusters can serve as nodes to crosslink PEO chains with a wide range of molecular weights from 10&#160;000 to 8&#160;000&#160;000&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1. The crosslinked polymer network can incorporate a high concentration of plasticizers, with a total weight percentage over 75%, while still maintaining excellent stretchability (4640%) and toughness (3.87&#160;&#215;&#160;104&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3). The resulting electrolyte demonstrates high ionic conductivity (1.41&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1), low interfacial resistance toward Li metal (48.1&#160;&#937;&#160;cm2), and a wide electrochemical window (&gt;4.8&#160;V vs Li+/Li) at 30&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, the LiFePO4/Li battery shows stable cycle performance with a capacity retention of 98.6% (146.3&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) over 1000 cycles at 1C (1C&#160;=&#160;170&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) at 30&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>A Nanoconfined Water&#8211;Ion Coordination Network for Flexible Energy&#8208;Dissipation Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8211;ion interaction in a nanoconfined environment can significantly promote the interaction between ions and water molecules. Such a strong interaction&#160;facilitates the formation of ion clusters and limits particle dynamics. Based on this mechanism, a liquid&#8208;nanopore energy&#8208;dissipation system capable of providing flexible protection to personnel and devices and instrumentations against mechanical impacts and attacks is designed.








Abstract
Water&#8211;ion interaction in a nanoconfined environment that deeply constrains spatial freedoms of local atomistic motion with unconventional coupling mechanisms beyond that in a free, bulk state is essential to spark designs of a broad spectrum of nanofluidic devices with unique properties and functionalities. Here, it is&#160;reported that the interaction between ions and water molecules in a hydrophobic nanopore forms a coordination network with an interaction density that is nearly fourfold that of the bulk counterpart. Such strong interaction facilitates the connectivity of the water&#8211;ion network and is uncovered by corroborating the formation of ion clusters and the reduction of particle dynamics. A liquid&#8208;nanopore energy&#8208;dissipation system is designed and demonstrated in both molecular simulations and experiments that the formed coordination network controls the outflow of confined electrolytes along with a pressure reduction, capable of providing flexible protection for personnel and devices and instrumentations against external mechanical impact and attack.

         <title>Giant Energy Density via Mechanically Tailored Relaxor Ferroelectric Behavior of PZT Thick Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanograin engineering of normal ferroelectrics beyond compositional modification, to simultaneously enhance the dielectric breakdown strength and polarization with slim hysteresis which is typical behavior of relaxor ferroelectrics (RFE), a facile approach, is designed and revealed for high&#8208;energy&#8208;storage devices. The mechanically transformed RFE thick film (&#8776;4&#160;&#181;m) delivers a record&#8208;high energy density of 124&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3.








Abstract
Relaxor ferroelectrics (RFEs) are being actively investigated for energy&#8208;storage applications due to their large electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced polarization with slim hysteresis and fast energy charging&#8211;discharging capability. Here, a novel nanograin engineering approach based upon high kinetic energy deposition is reported, for mechanically inducing the RFE behavior in a normal ferroelectric Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT), which results in simultaneous enhancement in the dielectric breakdown strength (EDBS) and polarization. Mechanically transformed relaxor thick films with 4&#160;&#181;m thickness exhibit an exceptional EDBS of 540&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1 and reduced hysteresis with large unsaturated polarization (103.6&#160;&#181;C&#160;cm&#8722;2), resulting in a record high energy&#8208;storage density of 124.1&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and a power density of 64.5&#160;MW&#160;cm&#8722;3. This fundamental advancement is correlated with the generalized nanostructure design that comprises nanocrystalline phases embedded within the amorphous matrix. Microstructure&#8208;tailored ferroelectric behavior overcomes the limitations imposed by traditional compositional design methods and provides a feasible pathway for realization of high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Yield Synthesis of Sodium Chlorides of Unconventional Stoichiometries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis yield of 2D Na2Cl crystals with unconventional stoichiometries in a graphene membrane can be significantly improved by applying a negative potential. Such high content can substantially improve the physical performance of the abnormal Na2Cl crystals. These findings represent a step toward the potential applications of abnormal 2D crystal materials with unique properties.








Abstract
Abnormal salt crystals with unconventional stoichiometries, such as Na2Cl, Na3Cl, K2Cl, and CaCl crystals that have been explored in reduced graphene oxide membranes (rGOMs) or diamond anvil cells, hold great promise in applications due to their unique electronic, magnetic, and optical properties predicted in theory. However, the low content of these crystals, only &lt;1% in rGOM, limits their research interest and utility in applications. Here, a high&#8208;yield synthesis of 2D abnormal crystals with unconventional stoichiometries is reported, which is achieved by applying negative potential on rGOM. A more than tenfold increase in the abnormal Na2Cl crystals is obtained using a potential of &#8722;0.6&#160;V, resulting in an atomic content of 13.4&#160;&#177;&#160;4.7% for Na on rGOM. Direct observations by transmission electron microscopy and piezoresponse force microscopy demonstrates a unique piezoelectric behavior arising from 2D Na2Cl crystals with square structure. The output voltage increases from 0 to &#8776;180&#160;mV in the broad 0&#8211;150&#176; bending angle regime, which meets the voltage requirement of most nanodevices in realistic applications. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the applied negative potential of the graphene surface can strengthen the effect of the Na+&#8211;&#960; interaction and reduce the electrostatic repulsion between cations, making more Na2Cl crystals formed.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State Modulation on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual defect engineering strategy is developed to simultaneously create tensile strain and unsaturated coordination defects. These defects in a Ni&#8208;2,6&#8208;naphthalenedicarboxylic acid metal&#8211;organic framework (DD&#8208;Ni&#8208;NDA) are created to modulate the spin state of Ni active sites and further optimize the adsorption energy of OH* and OOH* intermediates for accelerating OER kinetics, ensuring fast OER kinetics and enhanced OER activity.








Abstract
Electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics are heavily correlated with hybridization of the transition metal d&#8208;orbital and oxygen intermediate p&#8208;orbital, which dictates the barriers of intermediate adsorption/desorption on the active sites of catalysts. Herein, a strategy is developed involving strain engineering and coordination regulation to enhance the hybridization of Ni 3d and O 2p orbitals, and the as&#8208;synthesized Ni&#8208;2,6&#8208;naphthalenedicarboxylic acid metal&#8211;organic framework (DD&#8208;Ni&#8208;NDA) nanosheets deliver a low OER overpotential of 260&#160;mV to reach 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. By integrating an alkaline anion exchange membrane electrolyzer and Pt/C electrode, 200 and 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current densities are reached with cell voltages of 1.6 and 2.1&#160;V, respectively. When loaded on a BiVO4 photoanode, the nanosheet enables highly active solar&#8208;driven water oxygen. Structural characterizations together with theoretical calculations reveal that the spin state of the centre Ni atoms is regulated by the tensile strain and unsaturated coordination defects in DD&#8208;Ni&#8208;NDA, and such spin regulation facilitates spin&#8208;dependent charge transfer of the OER. Molecular orbital hybridization analysis reveals the mechanism of OH* and OOH* adsorption energy regulation by changes in the DD&#8208;Ni&#8208;NDA spin state, which provides a deeper understanding of the electronic structure design of catalysts for the OER.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Hollow&#8208;Structured Mesoporous Carbons by Enhanced Surface Interaction for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons with ultrahigh surface area, large pore volume and heteroatom doping are synthesized by a versatile and general silanol&#8208;assisted surface&#8208;casting method. The materials display remarkable electrochemical performance for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The studies reveal that strong interactions between the organic molecules and the silanol&#8208;rich surface of the silica template are crucial.








Abstract
Nanoporous carbons are very attractive for various applications including energy storage. Templating methods with assembled amphiphilic molecules or porous inorganic templates are typically used for the synthesis. Amongst the different members of this family, CMK&#8208;5&#8208;like structures that are constructed to consist of sub&#8208;10&#160;nm amorphous carbon nanotubes and ultrahigh specific surface area due to their thin pore walls, have the best properties in various respects. However, the fabrication of such hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons entails elaborately tailoring the surface properties of the template pore walls and selecting specific carbon precursors. Thus, very limited cases are successful. Herein, a versatile and general silanol&#8208;assisted surface&#8208;casting method to create hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons and heteroatom&#8208;doped derivatives with numerous organic molecules (e.g., furfuryl alcohol, resol, 2&#8208;thiophene methanol, dopamine, tyrosine) and different structural templates is reported. These carbon materials exhibit ultrahigh surface area (2400&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1), large pore volume (4.0&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1), as well as satisfactory lithium&#8208;storage capacity (1460&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability (320&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), and very outstanding cycling performance (2000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1).

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermittent, equilibrium dynamics of brownmillerite/perovskite domains in an epitaxial SrCoOx on LSAT substrate are revealed using in situ Bragg X&#8208;ray photon correlation spectroscopy. The dynamics appear to be thermally activated and can be tuned via epitaxial strain, consistent with results from density functional theory and phase field simulations.








Abstract
The heterogeneous nature, local presence, and dynamic evolution of defects typically govern the ionic and electronic properties of a wide variety of functional materials. While the last 50 years have seen considerable efforts into development of new methods to identify the nature of defects in complex materials, such as the perovskite oxides, very little is known about defect dynamics and their influence on the functionality of a material. Here, the discovery of the intermittent behavior of point defects (oxygen vacancies) in oxide heterostructures employing X&#8208;ray photon correlation spectroscopy is reported. Local fluctuations between two ordered phases in strained SrCoOx with different degrees of stability of the oxygen vacancies are observed. Ab&#8208;initio&#8208;informed phase&#8208;field modeling reveals that fluctuations between the competing ordered phases are modulated by the oxygen ion/vacancy interaction energy and epitaxial strain. The results demonstrate how defect dynamics, evidenced by measurement and modeling of their temporal fluctuations, give rise to stochastic properties that now can be fully characterized using coherent X&#8208;rays, coupled for the first time to multiscale modeling in functional complex oxide heterostructures. The study and its findings open new avenues for engineering the dynamical response of functional materials used in neuromorphic and electrochemical&#160;applications.

         <title>Electrochemically And Thermally Stable Inorganics&#8208;rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Robust Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
Severe dendrite growth and high activity of lithium metal anode lead to short lifespan and poor safety, seriously hindering the practical applications of lithium metal batteries. By tri&#8208;salt electrolyte design, we constructed a F&#8208;/N&#8208;containing inorganics&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase upon lithium anode, which is electrochemically and thermally stable during the long&#8208;term cycles and safety abuse conditions. As a result, the Coulombic efficiency can maintain 98.98% during 400 cycles. 85.0% capacity can be retained for coin&#8208;type full cells with 3.14 mAh cm&#8722;2 LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode after 200 cycles and 1.0 Ah pouch&#8208;type full cells with 4.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 cathode after 72 cycles. During the thermal runaway tests of cycled 1.0 Ah pouch cell, the onset and triggering temperatures are increased from 70.8&#160;&#176;C and 117.4&#160;&#176;C to 100.6&#160;&#176;C and 153.1&#160;&#176;C, respectively, indicating the greatly enhanced safety performance. This work affords novel insights for electrolyte and interface design, potentially paving the way for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, long&#8208;lifespan, and thermally&#8208;safe lithium metal batteries.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Powered UV Photodetector with Ultrahigh Responsivity based on Two&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Ferroelectric Films with Mixed Spacer Cations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Self&#8208;powered photodetectors (PDs) have the advantages of no external power requirement, wireless operation, and long life. Spontaneous ferroelectric polarizations can significantly increase the built&#8208;in electric field intensity, showing great potential in self&#8208;powered photodetection. Moreover, ferroelectrics possess pyroelectric and piezoelectric properties, beneficial for enhancing self&#8208;powered PDs. 2D metal halide perovskites (MHPs), which have ferroelectric properties, are suitable for fabricating high&#8208;performance self&#8208;powered PDs. However, the researches on 2D metal halide perovskites ferroelectrics focus on growing bulk crystals. Herein, we demonstrate 2D ferroelectric perovskite films with mixed spacer cations for self&#8208;powered PDs by mixing RP&#8208;type and DJ&#8208;type perovskite. The (BDA0.7(BA2)0.3)(EA)2Pb3Br10 film possesses overall the best film qualities with the best crystalline quality, lowest trap density, good phase purity, and obvious ferroelectricity. Based on the ferro&#8208;pyro&#8208;phototronic effect, the PD at 360&#160;nm exhibits excellent photoelectric properties, with an ultrahigh peak responsivity of more than 93 A W&#8722;1, a detectivity of 2.5 &#215; 1015 Jones, together with excellent reproducibility and stability. The maximum responsivities can be modulated by the piezo&#8208;phototronic effect with an effective enhancement ratio of 480%. Our work will open up a new route of designing MHP ferroelectric films for high&#8208;performance PDs and offers the opportunity to utilize it for various optoelectronics applications.

         <title>Amphibious Polymer Materials with High Strength And Superb Toughness in Various Aquatic And Atmospheric Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Herein, we report the fabrication of amphibious polymer materials with outstanding mechanical performances, both underwater and in the air. A polyvinyl alcohol/poly(2&#8208;methoxyethylacrylate) (PVA/PMEA) composite with multiscale nanostructures was prepared by combining solvent exchange and thermal annealing strategies, which contributed to nanophase separation with rigid PVA&#8208;rich and soft PMEA&#8208;rich phases and high&#8208;density crystalline domains of PVA chains, respectively. Benefiting from the multiscale nanostructure, the PVA/PMEA hydrogel demonstrated excellent stability in harsh (such as acidic, alkaline, and saline) aqueous solutions, as well as superior mechanical behavior with a breaking strength of up to 34.8&#160;MPa and toughness of up to 214.2&#160;MJ m&#8722;3. Dehydrating the PVA/PMEA hydrogel resulted in an extremely robust plastic with a breaking strength of 65.4&#160;MPa and toughness of 430.9&#160;MJ m&#8722;3. This study provides a promising phase&#8211;structure engineering route for constructing high&#8208;performance polymer materials for complex load&#8208;bearing environments.

         <title>A Targeted Exosome Therapeutic Confers Both Cfdna Scavenging and Macrophage Polarization for Ameliorating Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>

Abstract
Only a minority of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients achieve disease remission, so the exploration of additional pathogenic factors and the development of new therapeutics are needed. Here,&#160;we&#160;discovered strong correlations among the cell&#8208;free DNA (cfDNA) level and the inflammatory response in clinical synovial fluid samples and RA disease activity.&#160;We&#160;also demonstrated the important role of cfDNA in disease development in collagen&#8208;induced arthritis (CIA) murine model. Building on these findings,&#160;we&#160;developed a novel therapeutic based on anti&#8208;inflammatory (M2) macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes as chassis that&#160;we&#160;modified with both oligolysine and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)&#8208;cleavable polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the membrane. After intravenous injection, PEG&#8208;enabled prolonged circulation and C&#8208;C motif chemokine ligand (CCL)&#8208;directed accumulation together resulted in enrichment at inflamed joints. Following subsequent MMP cleavage, the positively charged oligolysine&#160;was&#160;exposed for cfDNA scavenging, while exosomes induced M2 polarization. By using a classical CIA murine model and a newly established CIA canine model,&#160;we&#160;demonstrated that&#160;our&#160;rationally designed exosome therapeutic substantially suppressed inflammation in joints and provided strong chondroprotection and osteoprotection, revealing its potential for effective CIA amelioration.

         <title>Photochemically Activated 3D Printing Inks: Current Status, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
3D printing with light is enabled by the photochemistry underpinning it. Without fine control over our ability to photochemically gate covalent bond formation by the light at a certain wavelength and intensity, advanced photoresists with functions spanning from on&#8208;demand degradability, adaptability, rapid printing speeds and tailored functionality are impossible to design. Herein, we critically assess recent advances in photoresist design for light&#8208;driven 3D printing applications and provide an outlook of the outstanding challenges and opportunities. We achieve this by classing the discussed photoresists in chemistries that function photoinitiator&#8208;free and those that require a photoinitiator to proceed. Such a taxonomy is based on the efficiency with which photons are able to generate covalent bonds, with each concept featuring distinct advantages and drawbacks.

Without fine control over our ability to photochemically gate covalent bond formation by the light at a certain wavelength and intensity, advanced photoresists with functions spanning from on-demand degradability, adaptability, rapid printing speeds and tailored functionality are impossible to design. Herein, we critically assess recent advances in photoresist design for light-driven 3D printing applications and provide an outlook of the outstanding challenges and opportunities. We achieve this by classing the discussed photoresists in chemistries that function photoinitiator-free and those that require a photoinitiator to proceed. Such a taxonomy is based on the efficiency with which photons are able to generate covalent bonds, with each concept featuring distinct advantages and drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a global public health issue. The injury of annulus fibrosus (AF) caused by acupuncture or discectomy can trigger IVDD again. However, there is currently no suitable method for treating AF injury. In this study, w e developed the high&#8208;strength smart microneedles (MNs) which can penetrate the AF tissue through a local and minimally invasive method, and achieve remote control of speeded&#8208;up release of the drug and hyperthermia by the Near Infrared. The PDA/GelMA composite MNs loaded with diclofenac sodium w ere designed to extracellularly &#8220;offend&#8221; the inflammatory microenvironment and mitigate damage to cells, and intracellularly increase the level of cytoprotective heat shock proteins to enhance the defense against the hostile microenvironment, achieving &#8220;offensive and defensive&#8221; effects. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the synergistic treatment of photothermal therapy and anti&#8208;inflammation effectively reduced inflammation, inhibited cell apoptosis, and promoted the synthesis of the extracellular matrix (ECM). In vivo experiments showed that the MNs mitigated the inflammatory response, promoted ECM deposition, reduced the level of apoptosis, and restored the biomechanical properties of the intervertebral disc (IVD) in rats. Overall, this high&#8208;strength smart MNs displayed promising &#8220;offensive and defensive&#8221; effects that can provide a new strategy for IVD repair.

         <title>Mechanistic Computational Modeling of Implantable, Bioresorbable Drug Release Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mathematical treatment of polymer solidification, degradation, and diffusivity accurately predicts drug release profiles from a range of size and molecular weight. This mechanistic model offers new insight into the impact of various parameters on polymer degradation and drug release profiles, and is a new tool to accelerate the design process for tailored release systems.








Abstract
Implantable, bioresorbable drug delivery systems offer an alternative to current drug administration techniques; allowing for patient&#8208;tailored drug dosage, while also increasing patient compliance. Mechanistic mathematical modeling allows for the acceleration of the design of the release systems, and for prediction of physical anomalies that are not intuitive and may otherwise elude discovery. This study investigates short&#8208;term drug release as a function of water&#8208;mediated polymer phase inversion into a solid depot within hours to days, as well as long&#8208;term hydrolysis&#8208;mediated degradation and erosion of the implant over the next few weeks. Finite difference methods are used to model spatial and temporal changes in polymer phase inversion, solidification, and hydrolysis. Modeling reveals the impact of non&#8208;uniform drug distribution, production and transport of H+ ions, and localized polymer degradation on the diffusion of water, drug, and hydrolyzed polymer byproducts. Compared to experimental data, the computational model accurately predicts the drug release during the solidification of implants over days and drug release profiles over weeks from microspheres and implants. This work offers new insight into the impact of various parameters on drug release profiles, and is a new tool to accelerate the design process for release systems to meet a patient specific clinical need.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Spectrum&#8211;Polarization Recombinant Optical Encryption with a Dielectric Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous&#8208;spectrum&#8211;polarization recombinant optical encryption with all&#8208;silicon metasurface is reported. The arbitrary and continuous combination of polarization and wavelength channels enables the dramatic increase of information capacity to 210 or more. The high transmittance and large operation bandwidth in mid&#8208;infrared further promise the high&#8208;capability encryption communication application in this indispensable atmosphere window.








Abstract
The Jones matrix, with eight degrees of freedom (DoFs), provides a general mathematical framework for the multifunctional design of metasurfaces. Theoretically, the maximum eight DoFs can be further extended in the spectrum dimension to endow unique encryption capabilities. However, the topology and intrinsic spectral responses of meta&#8208;atoms constrains the continuous engineering of polarization evolution over wavelength dimension. In this work, a forward evolution strategy to quickly establish the mapping relationships between the solutions of the dispersion Jones matrix and the spectral responses of meta&#8208;atoms is reported. Based on the eigenvector transformation method, arbitrary conjugate polarization channels over the continuous&#8208;spectrum dimension are successfully reconstructed. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a silicon metadevice is demonstrated for optical information encryption transmission. Remarkably, the arbitrary combination forms of polarization and wavelength dimension increase the information capacity (210), and the measured polarization contrasts of the conjugate polarization conversion are &gt;94% in the entire wavelength range (3&#8211;4&#160;&#181;m). It is believed that the proposed approach will benefit secure optical and quantum information technologies.

         <title>Microfibrous Scaffolds Guide Stem Cell Lumenogenesis and Brain Organoid Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scaffold&#8208;based platform to increase the throughput, reproducibility, and geometric control of 3D organoids is presented. Melt electrowriting is used to generate fibrous scaffolds that guide the self&#8208;organization of pluripotent stem cells into a large array of suspended interconnected or discrete organoids. Tuning the geometry of the scaffold enables to control the shape and lumen formation of the emerging tissues.








Abstract
3D organoids are widely used as tractable in vitro models capable of elucidating aspects of human development and disease. However, the manual and low&#8208;throughput culture methods, coupled with a low reproducibility and geometric heterogeneity, restrict the scope and application of organoid research. Combining expertise from stem cell biology and bioengineering offers a promising approach to address some of these limitations. Here, melt electrospinning writing is used to generate tuneable grid scaffolds that can guide the self&#8208;organization of pluripotent stem cells into patterned arrays of embryoid bodies. Grid geometry is shown to be a key determinant of stem cell self&#8208;organization, guiding the position and size of emerging lumens via curvature&#8208;controlled tissue growth. Two distinct methods for culturing scaffold&#8208;grown embryoid bodies into either interconnected or spatially discrete cerebral organoids are reported. These scaffolds provide a high&#8208;throughput method to generate, culture, and analyze large numbers of organoids, substantially reducing the time investment and manual labor involved in conventional methods of organoid culture. It is anticipated that this methodological development will open up new opportunities for guiding pluripotent stem cell culture, studying lumenogenesis, and generating large numbers of uniform organoids for high&#8208;throughput screening.

         <title>Reconstructed Hierarchically Structured Keratin Fibers with Shape&#8208;Memory Features Based on Reversible Secondary&#8208;Structure Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The possibility of fabricating regenerated water&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;memory keratin fibers from wool and cellulose via wet&#8208;spinning in a more cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly manner is investigated. The reconfiguration of the keratin secondary structure is proposed as the mechanism of the water&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;memory effect. The smart keratin fibers show the potential to be applied as artificial muscles.








Abstract
Biocompatible and biodegradable shape&#8208;memory polymers have gained popularity as smart materials, offering a wide range of applications and environmental benefits. Herein, the possibility of fabricating regenerated water&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;memory keratin fibers from wool and cellulose in a more effective and environmentally friendly manner is investigated. The regenerated keratin fibers exhibit comparable shape&#8208;memory performance to other hydration&#8208;responsive materials, with a shape&#8208;fixity ratio of 94.8&#160;&#177;&#160;2.15% and a shape&#8208;recovery rate of 81.4&#160;&#177;&#160;3.84%. Owing to their well&#8208;preserved secondary structure and cross&#8208;linking network, keratin fibers exhibit outstanding water&#8208;stability and wet stretchability, with a maximum tensile strain of 362&#160;&#177;&#160;15.9%. In this system, the reconfiguration of the protein secondary structure between &#945;&#8208;helix and &#946;&#8208;sheet is investigated as the fundamental actuation mechanism in response to hydration. This responsiveness is studied under force loading and unloading along the fiber axis. Hydrogen bonds act as the &#8220;switches&#8221; clicked by water molecules to trigger the shape&#8208;memory effect, while disulfide bonds and cellulose nanocrystals play the role of &#8220;net&#8208;points&#8221; to maintain the permanent shape of the material. Water&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;memory keratin fibers are manipulable and exhibit potential in the fabrication of textile actuators, which may be applied in smart apparel and programmable biomedical devices.

Owing to their well-preserved secondary structure and cross-linking network, keratin fibers exhibit outstanding water-stability and wet stretchability, with a maximum tensile strain of 362&#160;&#177;&#160;15.9%. In this system, the reconfiguration of the protein secondary structure between &#945;-helix and &#946;-sheet is investigated as the fundamental actuation mechanism in response to hydration. This responsiveness is studied under force loading and unloading along the fiber axis. Hydrogen bonds act as the &#8220;switches&#8221; clicked by water molecules to trigger the shape-memory effect, while disulfide bonds and cellulose nanocrystals play the role of &#8220;net-points&#8221; to maintain the permanent shape of the material. Water-triggered shape-memory keratin fibers are manipulable and exhibit potential in the fabrication of textile actuators, which may be applied in smart apparel and programmable biomedical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Bifunctional Catalyst for Green Ammonia Synthesis from Ubiquitous Air and Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional catalyst of CuCo2O4/Ni applying to plasma&#8208;electrocatalytic synthesis of NH3 from air and water is proposed, with which a record&#8208;high NH3 yield rate of 145.8&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and excellent FE of 96.8% can be obtained. Moreover, the reaction system is enlarged and the generated NH3 precipitates into MgNH4PO4&#183;6H2O solid to promote the practical application.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is essential for modern agriculture and industry, and, due to its high hydrogen density and no carbon emission, it is also expected to be the next&#8208;generation of &#8220;clean&#8221; energy carrier. Herein, directly from air and water, a plasma&#8208;electrocatalytic reaction system for NH3 production, which combines two steps of plasma&#8208;air&#8208;to&#8208;NOx&#8722; and electrochemical NOx&#8722; reduction reaction (eNOxRR) with a bifunctional catalyst, is successfully established. Especially, the bifunctional catalyst of CuCo2O4/Ni can simultaneously promote plasma&#8208;air&#8208;to&#8208;NOx&#8722; and eNOxRR processes. The easy adsorption and activation of O2 by CuCo2O4/Ni greatly improve the NOx&#8722; production rate at the first step. Further, CuCo2O4/Ni can also resolve the overbonding of the key intermediate of *NO, and thus reduce the energy barrier of the second step of eNOxRR. Finally, the &#8220;green&#8221; NH3 production achieves excellent FENH3 (96.8%) and record&#8208;high NH3 yield rate of 145.8&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 with large partial current density (1384.7&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2). Moreover, an enlarged self&#8208;made H&#8208;type electrolyzer improves the NH3 yield to 3.6&#160;g&#160;h&#8722;1, and the obtained NH3 is then rapidly converted to a solid of magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate, which favors the easy storage and transportation of NH3.

         <title>Generation of Terahertz Radiation via the Transverse Thermoelectric Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intense terahertz radiation generation via the transverse thermoelectric effect in layered conducting transition metal oxides is demonstrated . Ultrafast out&#8208;of&#8208;plane temperature gradients, induced by femtosecond laser pulses on thin films grown on off&#8208;cut substrates, launch in&#8208;plane thermoelectric currents leading to efficient THz emission. This approach offers a simple and promising avenue for versatile THz sources and integrable emitter elements.








Abstract
Terahertz (THz) radiation is a powerful tool with widespread applications ranging from imaging, sensing, and broadband communications to spectroscopy and nonlinear control of materials. Future progress in THz technology depends on the development of efficient, structurally simple THz emitters that can be implemented in advanced miniaturized devices. Here, it is shown how the natural electronic anisotropy of layered conducting transition metal oxides enables the generation of intense terahertz radiation via the transverse thermoelectric effect. In thin films grown on off&#8208;cut substrates, femtosecond laser pulses generate ultrafast out&#8208;of&#8208;plane temperature gradients, which in turn launch in&#8208;plane thermoelectric currents, thus allowing efficient emission of the resulting THz field out of the film structure. This scheme is demonstrated in experiments on thin films of the layered metals PdCoO2 and La1.84Sr0.16CuO4, and model calculations that elucidate the influence of the material parameters on the intensity and spectral characteristics of the emitted THz field are presented. Due to its simplicity, the method opens up a promising avenue for the development of highly versatile THz sources and integrable emitter elements.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Based Selective Emitters for Thermophotovoltaic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superior oxidation resistance of Ir, having a low Gibbs energy of oxide formation, in an Ir/HfO2&#8208;based selective emitter at 1000&#160;&#176;C over 100&#160;h at 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6&#160;mbar is demonstrated in comparison to refractory W, in a W/HfO2 selective emitter. 6 layers of Ir are stable after annealing, whereas W layers vanish due to oxidation and sublimation.








Abstract
The long&#8208;term operation of refractory&#8208;metal&#8208;based metamaterials is crucial for applications such as thermophotovoltaics. The metamaterials based on refractory metals like W, Mo, Ta, Nb, and Re fail primarily by oxidation. Here, the use of the noble metal Ir is proposed, which is stable to oxidation and has optical properties comparable to gold. The thermal endurance of Ir in a 3&#8208;layer&#8208;system, consisting of HfO2/Ir/HfO2, by performing annealing experiments up to 1240&#160;&#176;C in a pressure range from 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6&#160;mbar to 1&#160;bar, is demonstrated. The Ir layer shows no oxidation in a vacuum and inert gas atmosphere. At temperatures above 1100&#160;&#176;C, the Ir layer starts to agglomerate due to the degradation of the confining HfO2 layers. An in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction experimental comparison between 1D multilayered Ir/HfO2 and W/HfO2 selective emitters annealed at 1000&#160;&#176;C, 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6&#160;mbar, over 100&#160;h, confirms oxidation stability of Ir while W multilayers gradually disappear. The results of this work show that W&#8208;based metamaterials are not long&#8208;term stable even at 1000&#160;&#176;C. However, the oxidation resistance of Ir can be leveraged for refractory plasmonic metamaterials, such as selective emitters in thermophotovoltaic systems with strong suppression of long wavelength radiation.

         <title>Enhancing Photocatalytic&#8208;Transfer Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes Over Pd/C3N4 Through Dual Regulation of Nitrogen Defects and the Mott&#8211;Schottky Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Schottky catalyst&#160;of Pd nanoparticles supported on graphite&#8208;like C3N4 with nitrogen defects (Pd/DCN), &#160;containing a large number of cyano groups, is reported. The catalyst exhibits higher reactivity and selectivity in the selective transfer hydrogenation of alkynes under visible light.








Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of alkynes is an important reaction; however, the catalytic activity and selectivity in this reaction are generally conflicting. In this study, ultrafine Pd nanoparticles (NPs) loaded on a graphite&#8208;like C3N4 structure with nitrogen defects (Pd/DCN) are synthesized. The resulting Pd/DCN exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance in the transfer hydrogenation of alkynes with ammonia borane. The reaction rate and selectivity of Pd/DCN are superior to those of Pd/BCN (bulk C3N4 without nitrogen defects) under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The characterization results and density functional theory calculations show that the Mott&#8211;Schottky effect in Pd/DCN can change the electronic density of the Pd NPs, and thus enhances the hydrogenation selectivity toward phenylacetylene. After 1&#160;h, the hydrogenation selectivity of Pd/DCN reaches 95%, surpassing that of Pd/BCN (83%). Meanwhile, nitrogen defects in the supports improve the visible&#8208;light response and accelerate the transfer and separation of photogenerated charges to enhance the catalytic activity of Pd/DCN. Therefore, Pd/DCN exhibits higher efficiency under visible light, with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 2002 min&#8722;1. This TOF is five times that of Pd/DCN under dark conditions and 1.5 times that of Pd/BCN. This study provides new insights into the rational design of high&#8208;performance photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;A Schottky catalyst&#160;of Pd nanoparticles supported on graphite-like C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with nitrogen defects (Pd/DCN), &#160;containing a large number of cyano groups, is reported. The catalyst exhibits higher reactivity and selectivity in the selective transfer hydrogenation of alkynes under visible light.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selective hydrogenation of alkynes is an important reaction; however, the catalytic activity and selectivity in this reaction are generally conflicting. In this study, ultrafine Pd nanoparticles (NPs) loaded on a graphite-like C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; structure with nitrogen defects (Pd/DCN) are synthesized. The resulting Pd/DCN exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance in the transfer hydrogenation of alkynes with ammonia borane. The reaction rate and selectivity of Pd/DCN are superior to those of Pd/BCN (bulk C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; without nitrogen defects) under visible-light irradiation. The characterization results and density functional theory calculations show that the Mott&#8211;Schottky effect in Pd/DCN can change the electronic density of the Pd NPs, and thus enhances the hydrogenation selectivity toward phenylacetylene. After 1&#160;h, the hydrogenation selectivity of Pd/DCN reaches 95%, surpassing that of Pd/BCN (83%). Meanwhile, nitrogen defects in the supports improve the visible-light response and accelerate the transfer and separation of photogenerated charges to enhance the catalytic activity of Pd/DCN. Therefore, Pd/DCN exhibits higher efficiency under visible light, with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 2002 min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This TOF is five times that of Pd/DCN under dark conditions and 1.5 times that of Pd/BCN. This study provides new insights into the rational design of high-performance photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechano&#8208;activated Cell Therapy for Accelerated Diabetic Wound Healing</title>

Abstract
Chronic diabetic wounds are a significant global healthcare challenge. Current strategies, such as biomaterials, cell therapies, and medical devices, however, only target a few pathological features and have limited efficacy. We developed a powerful platform technology combining magneto&#8208;responsive hydrogel, cells, and wireless magneto&#8208;induced dynamic mechanical stimulation (MDMS) to accelerate diabetic wound healing. Our hydrogel encapsulates FDA&#8208;approved fibroblasts and keratinocytes to achieve &#8764;3&#8208;fold better wound closure in a diabetic mouse model. MDMS acts as a non&#8208;genetic mechano&#8208;rheostat to activate fibroblasts, resulting in &#8764;240% better proliferation, &#8764;220% more collagen deposition and improved keratinocyte paracrine profiles via the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway to boost angiogenesis. The magneto&#8208;responsive property also enables on&#8208;demand insulin release for spatiotemporal glucose regulation through increasing network deformation and interstitial flow. By mining scRNAseq data, we identified a mechanosensitive fibroblast subpopulation that can be mechanically tuned for enhanced proliferation and collagen production, maximizing therapeutic impact. Our &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; system addresses major pathological factors associated with diabetic wounds in a single platform, with potential applications for other challenging wound types.

         <title>Efficient and Bright Organic Radical Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Organic radicals have been of interest due to their potential to replace nonradical&#8208;based organic emitters, especially for deep red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) electroluminescence (EL), based on the spin&#8208;allowed doublet fluorescence. However, the performance of the radical&#8208;based EL devices is limited by low carrier mobility that causes a large efficiency roll&#8208;off at high current densities. Here, we report highly efficient and bright doublet EL devices by combining a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) host that supports both electron and hole transport and a tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl&#8208;based radical emitter. Steady&#8208;state and transient photophysical studies reveal the optical signatures of doublet luminescence mechanisms arising from both host and guest photoexcitation. The host system presented here allows balanced hole and electron currents, and we report a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 17.4% at 707&#160;nm peak emission with substantially improved efficiency roll&#8208;off: over 70% of the maximum EQE (12.2%) is recorded at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and even at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, nearly 50% of the maximum EQE (8.4%) is maintained. Charge recombination is primarily at the radical guest sites, but there is evidence from magneto&#8208;EL for host recombination and later energy transfer to the radical guest. We consider this is an important step to the practical application of organic radicals to NIR light&#8208;emitting devices.

         <title>Conducting Polymer Nanoparticles with Intrinsic Aqueous Dispersibility for Conductive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conductive hydrogels are promising materials with mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conduction to interface living tissue (ionic signal transmission) with medical devices (electronic signal transmission). Beyond signal transduction, the hydrogel form factor also uniquely bridges the wet and soft biological environment with the dry and hard environment of electronics. The synthesis of such hydrogels for bioelectronics requires scalable, biocompatible fillers with high electronic conductivity and compatibility with common aqueous hydrogel formulations/resins. Despite significant advances in the processing of carbon nanomaterials (graphene, graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes), fillers that satisfy all these requirements are lacking. Herein, intrinsically dispersible acid&#8208;crystalized PEDOT:PSS nanoparticles (ncrys&#8208;PEDOTX) are reported which are processed through a facile and scalable non&#8208;solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method from commercial PEDOT:PSS without complex instrumentation. The particles feature conductivities of up to 410 S cm&#8722;1, and when compared to other common conductive fillers, display remarkable dispersibility, enabling homogeneous incorporation at relatively high loadings within diverse aqueous biomaterial solutions without additives or surfactants. The aqueous dispersibility of the ncrys&#8208;PEDOTX particles also allows simple incorporation into resins designed for microstereolithography without sonication or surfactant optimization; complex biomedical structures with fine features (&lt; 150 &#956;m)&#160;were&#160;printed with up to 10% loading of conductive particles. The ncrys&#8208;PEDOTX particles overcome the challenges of traditional conductive fillers, providing a scalable, biocompatible, plug&#8208;and&#8208;play platform for soft organic bioelectronic materials.

         <title>Optimizing Crystallization in Wide&#8208;Bandgap Mixed Halide Perovskites for High&#8208;Efficiency Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites have attracted considerable attention due to their adjustable bandgap properties, making them ideal candidates for top subcells in tandem solar cells (TSCs). However, wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites often face challenges such as inhomogeneous crystallization and severe non&#8208;radiative recombination loss, leading to high open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficits and poor stability. To address these issues, we introduce a multifunctional phenylethylammonium acetate (PEAAc) additive that enhances uniform halide phase distribution and reduces defect density in perovskite films by regulating the mixed&#8208;halide crystallization rate. This approach successfully developed efficient WBG perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with reduced VOC loss and enhanced stability. By applying this universal strategy to the FAMACsPb(I1&#8208;xBrx)3 system with a range of bandgaps of 1.72, 1.79, 1.85, and 1.92&#160;eV, we attained power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 21.3%, 19.5%, 18.1%, and 16.2%, respectively. These results represent some of the highest PCEs reported for the corresponding bandgaps. Furthermore, integrating the WBG perovskite with low&#8208;bandgap organic photovoltaics, we achieved an impressive PCE of over 24% for two&#8208;terminal perovskite/organic TSCs, with a record VOC of &#8764; 2.2&#160;V. This work establishes a foundation for addressing phase separation and inhomogeneous crystallization in Br&#8208;rich perovskite components, paving the way for the development of high&#8208;performance WBG PSCs and TSCs.

Abstract
At the intersection of synthetic biology and materials science, engineered living materials (ELMs) exhibit unprecedented potential. Possessing unique &#8220;living&#8221; attributes, ELMs represent a significant paradigm shift in material design, showcasing self&#8208;organization, self&#8208;repair, adaptability, and evolvability, surpassing conventional synthetic materials. This review focuses on reviewing the applications of ELMs derived from bacteria, fungi, and plants in environmental remediation, eco&#8208;friendly architecture, and sustainable energy. The review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest research progress and emerging design strategies for ELMs in various application fields from the perspectives of synthetic biology and materials science. In addition, the review provides valuable references for the design of novel ELMs, extending the potential applications of future ELMs. The investigation into the synergistic application possibilities amongst different species of ELMs offers beneficial reference information for researchers and practitioners in this field. Finally, future trends and development challenges of synthetic biology for ELMs in the coming years are discussed in detail.

         <dc:description>
The up&#8208;to&#8208;date growth strategies for the controlled synthesis of wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconducting TMDCs polycrystalline and single&#8208;crystal films are systematically summarized. The large&#8208;area accurate doping of 2D semiconducting TMDCs and its effect on the device performances are discussed. The challenges regarding the improvement of electronic device performances of 2D semiconducting TMDCs are highlighted, and the further research directions are proposed.








Abstract
2D semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDCs) possess atomically thin thickness, a dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surface, flexible band structure, and silicon&#8208;compatible feature, making them one of the most promising channels for constructing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art field&#8208;effect transistors in the post&#8208;Moore's era. However, the existing 2D semiconducting TMDCs fall short of meeting the industry criteria for practical applications in electronics due to their small domain size and the lack of an effective approach to modulate intrinsic physical properties. Therefore, it is crucial to prepare and dope 2D semiconducting TMDCs single crystals with wafer size. In this review, the up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress regarding the wafer&#8208;scale growth of 2D semiconducting TMDC polycrystalline and single&#8208;crystal films is systematically summarized. The domain orientation control of 2D TMDCs and the seamless stitching of unidirectionally aligned 2D islands by means of substrate design are proposed. In addition, the accurate and uniform doping of 2D semiconducting TMDCs and the effect on electronic device performances are also discussed. Finally, the dominating challenges pertaining to the enhancement of the electronic device performances of TMDCs are emphasized, and further development directions are put forward. This review provides a systematic and in&#8208;depth summary of high&#8208;performance device applications of 2D semiconducting TMDCs.

         <title>Suppressed Concentration Quenching Brightens Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Emitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The well&#8208;known concentration quenching phenomenon is intrinsically suppressed in sensitized luminescent systems by exploiting the competitive relationship between light emitters and quenchers in trapping excitation energies from sensitizers, thereby unlocking the full potential of sensitization strategy in enhancing photoexcitation efficiency of doped luminescent materials and providing a new approach to achieve high&#8208;purity sensitized luminescence.








Abstract
The brightness of doped luminescent materials is usually limited by the ubiquitous concentration quenching phenomenon resulting in an intractable tradeoff between internal quantum efficiency and excitation efficiency. Here, an intrinsic suppression of concentration quenching in sensitized luminescent systems, by exploiting the competitive relationship between light emitters and quenchers in trapping excitation energies from sensitizers, is reported. Although Cr3+ sensitizers and trivalent lanthanide (Ln3+, Ln = Yb, Nd, and Er) emitters themselves are highly susceptible to concentration quenching, the unprecedentedly high&#8208;brightness luminescence of Cr3+&#8211;Ln3+ systems is demonstrated in the short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) range employing high concentrations of Cr3+, whereby a record photoelectric efficiency of 23% is achieved for SWIR phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes, which is about twice as high as those previously reported. The results underscore the beneficial role of emitters in terminating excitation energies, opening up a new dimension for developing efficient sensitized luminescent materials.

         <title>A Bioinspired Bilevel Metamaterial for Multispectral Manipulation toward Visible, Multi&#8208;Wavelength Detection Lasers and Mid&#8208;Infrared Selective Radiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired bilevel metamaterial is proposed for multispectral manipulation with visible, multi&#8208;wavelength detection lasers and mid&#8208;infrared selective absorption for camouflage, motivated by the butterfly scales with broadband reflection splitting effect. This work not only widens the working wavebands compared to the conventional materials but also opens a bioinspired way to improve the multispectral performance of wave&#8208;functional metamaterials.








Abstract
Manipulation of the electromagnetic signature in multiple wavebands is necessary and effective in civil and industrial applications. However, the integration of multispectral requirements, particularly for the bands with comparable wavelengths, challenges the design and fabrication of current compatible metamaterials. Here, a bioinspired bilevel metamaterial is proposed for multispectral manipulation involving visible, multi&#8208;wavelength detection lasers and mid&#8208;infrared (MIR), along with radiative cooling. The metamaterial, consisting of dual&#8208;deck Pt disks and a SiO2 intermediate layer, is inspired by the broadband reflection splitting effect found in butterfly scales and achieves ultralow specular reflectance (average of 0.013) over the entire 0.8&#8211;1.6&#160;&#181;m with large scattering angles. Meanwhile, tunable visible reflection and selective dual absorption peaks in MIR can be simultaneously realized, providing structural color, effective radiative thermal dissipation at 5&#8211;8&#160;&#181;m and 10.6&#160;&#181;m laser absorption. The metamaterial is fabricated by a low&#8208;cost colloidal lithography method combined with two patterning processes. Multispectral manipulation performances are experimentally demonstrated and a significant apparent temperature drop (maximum of 15.7&#160;&#176;C) compared to the reference is observed under a thermal imager. This work achieves optical response in multiple wavebands and provides a valuable way to effectively design multifunctional metamaterials inspired by nature.

         <title>Spotlight on Luminescence Thermometry: Basics, Challenges, and Cutting&#8208;Edge Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest emerging trends of luminescence (nano)thermometry are reviewed from a perspective that has not been considered so far. The theoretical framework covering ratiometric and lifetime&#8208;based luminescent thermometers, recommendable standardization practices, reliability, and reproducibility, as well as the advancing use of algorithms for thermal readout improvement are discussed. These backgrounds are complemented by cutting&#8208;edge applications, current challenges, and future directions.








Abstract
Luminescence (nano)thermometry is a remote sensing technique that relies on the temperature dependency of the luminescence features (e.g., bandshape, peak energy or intensity, and excited state lifetimes and risetimes) of a phosphor to measure temperature. This technique provides precise thermal readouts with superior spatial resolution in short acquisition times. Although luminescence thermometry is just starting to become a more mature subject, it exhibits enormous potential in several areas, e.g., optoelectronics, photonics, micro&#8208; and nanofluidics, and nanomedicine. This work reviews the latest trends in the field, including the establishment of a comprehensive theoretical background and standardized practices. The reliability, repeatability, and reproducibility of the technique are also discussed, along with the use of multiparametric analysis and artificial&#8208;intelligence algorithms to enhance thermal readouts. In addition, examples are provided to underscore the challenges that luminescence thermometry faces, alongside the need for a continuous search and design of new materials, experimental techniques, and analysis procedures to improve the competitiveness, accessibility, and popularity of the technology

         <title>Narrowband Organic Afterglow via Phosphorescence F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer for Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Narrowband organic afterglow materials are achieved via a phosphorescence F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer process by the combination of the long&#8208;lived phosphorescence donor and narrowband emission feature of the fluorescence acceptor. The resulting materials exhibit high color purity and multicolor narrowband afterglow, demonstrating potential in high&#8208;resolution afterglow displays and instant information identification.








Abstract
Achieving multicolor organic afterglow materials with narrowband emission and high color purity is important in various optoelectronic fields but remains a great challenge. Here, an efficient strategy is presented to obtain narrowband organic afterglow materials via F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from long&#8208;lived phosphorescence donors to narrowband fluorescence acceptors in a polyvinyl alcohol matrix. The resulting materials exhibit narrowband emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) as small as 23&#160;nm and the longest lifetime of 721.22&#160;ms. Meanwhile, by pairing the appropriate donors and acceptors, multicolor and high color purity afterglow ranging from green to red with the maximum photoluminescence quantum yield of 67.1% are achieved. Moreover, given their long luminescence lifetime, high color purity, and flexibility, the potential applications are demonstrated in high&#8208;resolution afterglow displays and dynamic and quick information identification in low&#8208;light conditions. This work provides a facile approach for developing multicolor and narrowband afterglow materials as well as expands the features of organic afterglow.

&lt;p&gt;Narrowband organic afterglow materials are achieved via a phosphorescence F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer process by the combination of the long-lived phosphorescence donor and narrowband emission feature of the fluorescence acceptor. The resulting materials exhibit high color purity and multicolor narrowband afterglow, demonstrating potential in high-resolution afterglow displays and instant information identification.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving multicolor organic afterglow materials with narrowband emission and high color purity is important in various optoelectronic fields but remains a great challenge. Here, an efficient strategy is presented to obtain narrowband organic afterglow materials via F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from long-lived phosphorescence donors to narrowband fluorescence acceptors in a polyvinyl alcohol matrix. The resulting materials exhibit narrowband emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) as small as 23&#160;nm and the longest lifetime of 721.22&#160;ms. Meanwhile, by pairing the appropriate donors and acceptors, multicolor and high color purity afterglow ranging from green to red with the maximum photoluminescence quantum yield of 67.1% are achieved. Moreover, given their long luminescence lifetime, high color purity, and flexibility, the potential applications are demonstrated in high-resolution afterglow displays and dynamic and quick information identification in low-light conditions. This work provides a facile approach for developing multicolor and narrowband afterglow materials as well as expands the features of organic afterglow.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Superior Tensile Performance in Individual Metal&#8722;Organic Framework Crystals</title>

The single&#8208;crystal tetraphenylporphyrin&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic framework nanobelts are found to exhibit unprecedented mechanical properties beyond theoretical limits and the origins of these mechanical properties are revealed by simulations.








Abstract
Rapid advances in the engineering application prospects of metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) materials necessitate an urgent in&#8208;depth understanding of their mechanical properties. This work demonstrates unprecedented recoverable elastic deformation of Ni&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrins (Ni&#8208;TCPP) MOF nanobelts with a tensile strain as high as 14%, and a projected yield strength&#8208;to&#8208;Young's modulus ratio exceeding the theoretical limit (&#8776;10%) for crystalline materials. Based on first&#8208;principles simulations, the observed behavior of MOF crystal can be attributed to the mechanical deformation induced conformation transition and the formation of helical configuration of dislocations under high stresses, arising from their organic ligand building blocks in the crystal structures. The investigations of the mechanical properties along with electromechanical properties demonstrate that MOF materials have exciting application potential for biomechanics integrated systems, flexible electronics, and nanoelectromechanical devices.

         <title>Reduced Graphene Oxide Electrolyte&#8208;Gated Transistor Immunosensor with Highly Selective Multiparametric Detection of Anti&#8208;Drug Antibodies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrolyte&#8208;gated transistor immunosensor based on reduced graphene oxide (rGO&#8208;EGT) for the detection of anti&#8208;drug antibodies (ATIs) against the drug Infliximab is reported. The multiparametric analysis of the immunosensor response, with a theoretical limit of detection of 10 am, allows for the discrimination between ATIs and interfering agents.








Abstract
The advent of immunotherapies with biological drugs has revolutionized the treatment of cancers and auto&#8208;immune diseases. However, in some patients, the production of anti&#8208;drug antibodies (ADAs) hampers the drug efficacy. The concentration of ADAs is typically in the range of 1&#8211;10 pm; hence their immunodetection is challenging. ADAs toward Infliximab (IFX), a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other auto&#8208;immune diseases, are focussed. An ambipolar electrolyte&#8208;gated transistor (EGT) immunosensor is reported based on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) channel and IFX bound to the gate electrode as the specific probe. The rGO&#8208;EGTs are easy to fabricate and exhibit low voltage operations (&#8804; 0.3&#160;V), a robust response within 15&#160;min, and ultra&#8208;high sensitivity (10 am limit of detection). A multiparametric analysis of the whole rGO&#8208;EGT transfer curves based on the type&#8208;I generalized extreme value distribution is proposed. It is demonstrated that it allows to selectively quantify ADAs also in the co&#8208;presence of its antagonist tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#8208;&#945;), the natural circulating target of IFX.

         <title>Diatomite&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Cobalt&#8208;Doped MoS2/Carbon Composites to Boost Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diatomite&#8208;templated synthetic strategy to prepare SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C toward high&#8208;performance sodium storage is developed. Because of the hierarchical structure, high conductivity, and abundant active sites, SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C reveals remarkable specific capacity, high rate performance, and outstanding long cyclic stability. The sodium&#8208;ion full cell composed of SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode demonstrates unexpected stability with the cycle number exceeded 1200.








Abstract
2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are promising electrodes for energy conversion/storage because of the layered structure and maximum atom utilization efficiency. However, the integration of such two type materials and the relevant sodium storage applications remain daunting challenges. Here, an ingenious diatomite&#8208;templated synthetic strategy is designed to fabricate single&#8208;atom cobalt&#8208;doped MoS2/carbon (SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C) composites toward the high&#8208;performance sodium storage. Benefiting from the unique hierarchical structure, high electron/sodium&#8208;ion conductivity, and abundant active sites, the obtained SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C reveals remarkable specific capacity (&#8776;604.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1), high rate performance, and outstanding long cyclic stability. Particularly, the sodium&#8208;ion full cell composed of SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode demonstrates unexpected stability with the cycle number exceeded 1200. The internal sodium storage mechanism is clarified with the aid of density functional theory calculations and in situ experimental characterizations. This work not only represents a substantial leap in terms of synthesizing SACs on 2D TMDCs but also provides a crucial step toward the practical sodium&#8208;ion battery applications.

         <title>Precise Engineering of a Se/Te Nanochaperone for Reinvigorating Cancer Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

A facile and universal method for synthesizing nano&#8208;heterojunctions (NHJs) with well&#8208;controlled structure is reported. Dumbbell&#8208;shaped TeSe NHJs effectively facilitate radiotherapy by directly damaging tumor cells and shaping the tumor immuno&#8208;microenvironment, which endows&#160;combination treatment with great abscopal effects to combat distant tumor progression.








Abstract
Facilely synthesized nanoradiosensitizers with well&#8208;controlled structure and multifunctionality are greatly desired to address the challenges of cancer radiotherapy. In this work, a universal method is developed for synthesizing chalcogen&#8208;based TeSe nano&#8208;heterojunctions (NHJs) with rod&#8208;, spindle&#8208;, or dumbbell&#8208;like morphologies by engineering the surfactant and added selenite. Interestingly, dumbbell&#8208;shaped TeSe NHJs (TeSe NDs) as chaperone exhibit better radio&#8208;sensitizing activities than the other two nanostructural shapes. Meanwhile, TeSe NDs can serve as cytotoxic chemodrugs that degrade to highly toxic metabolites in acidic environment and deplete GSH within tumor to facilitate radiotherapy. More importantly, the combination of TeSe NDs with radiotherapy significantly decreases regulatory T cells and M2&#8208;phenotype tumor&#8208;associated macrophage infiltrations within tumors to reshape the immunosuppressive microenvironment and induce robust T lymphocytes&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity, resulting in great abscopal effects on combating distant tumor progression. This study provides a universal method for preparing NHJ with well&#8208;controlled structure and developing nanoradiosensitizers to overcome the clinical challenges of cancer radiotherapy.

         <title>Acid and Hypoxia Tandem&#8208;Activatable Deep Near&#8208;Infrared Nanoprobe for Two&#8208;Step Signal Amplification and Early Detection of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphorescent nanoprobe comprised of oxygen&#8208;sensitive deep near&#8208;infrared (dNIR)&#8208;emitting phosphorescence cores and acid&#8208;cleavable polyethene glycol (PEG) shells, that is ultrasensitive to tumor acidity and hypoxia. This tandem&#8208;activatable probe design specifically amplifies tumor signals and enables early tumor detection, the signal in deep NIR region promoting contrast and resolution of hypoxia imaging as well.








Abstract
The early detection of cancers can significantly change outcomes even with existing treatments. However, ~50% of cancers still cannot be detected until they reach an advanced stage, highlighting the great challenges in the early detection. Here, an ultrasensitive deep near&#8208;infrared (dNIR) nanoprobe that is successively responsive to tumor acidity and hypoxia is reported. It is demonstrated that the new nanoprobe specifically detects tumor hypoxia microenvironment based on deep NIR imaging in ten different types of tumor models using cancer cell lines and patient&#8208;tissue derived xenograft tumors. By combining the acidity and hypoxia specific two&#8208;step signal amplification with a deep NIR detection, the reported nanoprobe enables the ultrasensitive visualization of hundreds of tumor cells or small tumors with a size of 260&#160;&#181;m in whole&#8208;body imaging or 115&#160;&#181;m metastatic lesions in lung imaging. As a result, it reveals that tumor hypoxia can occur as early as the lesions contain only several hundred cancer cells.

         <title>Biomimetic Spun Silk Ionotronic Fibers for Intelligent Discrimination of Motions and Tactile Stimuli</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by liquid crystal spinning of animal silks, the highly stretchable, tough, and resilient spun silk ionotronic fibers are prepared by dry spinning with nematic silk microfibril dope solution. They are further incorporated into core&#8211;shell triboelectric nanogenerator fibers to sort and recognize objects made of different materials.








Abstract
Innovation in the ionotronics field has significantly accelerated the development of ultraflexible devices and machines. However, it is still challenging to develop efficient ionotronic&#8208;based fibers with necessary stretchability, resilience, and conductivity due to inherent conflict in producing spinning dopes with both high polymer and ion concentrations and low viscosities. Inspired by the liquid crystalline spinning of animal silk, this study circumvents the inherent tradeoff in other spinning methods by dry spinning a nematic silk microfibril dope solution. The liquid crystalline texture allows the spinning dope to flow through the spinneret and form free&#8208;standing fibers under minimal external forces. The resultant silk&#8208;sourced ionotronic fibers (SSIFs) are highly stretchable, tough, resilient, and fatigue&#8208;resistant. These mechanical advantages ensure a rapid and recoverable electromechanical response of SSIFs to kinematic deformations. Further, the incorporation of SSIFs into core&#8211;shell triboelectric nanogenerator fibers provides outstanding stable and sensitive triboelectric response to precisely and sensitively perceive small pressures. Moreover, by implementing a combination of machine learning and Internet of Things techniques, the SSIFs can sort objects made of different materials. With these structural, processing, performance, and functional merits, the SSIFs prepared herein are expected to be applied in human&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Fatigue Hydrogel Electrolyte for All&#8208;Flexible Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compressive fatigue&#8208;resistance properties of the hydrogel electrolytes are systematically explored, revealing the critical roles of the salt and copolymer matrix on crack initiation and propagation. The optimal hydrogel electrolytes endow the Zn metal anode with a superior cycling lifespan and demonstrate great potential in wearable electronics with all flexible features.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes are widely explored in Zn metal batteries for application in wearable electronics. While extensive studies have been conducted on optimizing the chemical structure and boosting the tensile elasticity, the mechanical stability of the hydrogel under repeated deformation is largely overlooked, leading to unsatisfactory performance at large cycling capacity. This work systematically analyzes the compressive fatigue&#8208;resistance properties of the hydrogel electrolyte, revealing the critical roles of the salt and copolymer matrix on crack initiation and propagation. It shows that, on the premise of homogeneous Zn deposition, an improved anti&#8208;fatigue property is essential to achieve high&#8208;capacity Zn metal anodes. The optimal Zn(ClO4)2&#8208;polyacrylamide/chitosan hydrogel electrolyte (C&#8208;PAMCS) exhibits an unprecedented lifespan of 1500&#160;h for Zn//Zn cells at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. The potential application of C&#8208;PAMCS is exemplified in all&#8208;flexible Zn&#8208;ion batteries enabled by a flexible current collector consisting of a Ag nanowires embedded elastomer. This study provides the rationale under hydrogel electrolyte engineering toward advanced Zn&#8208;ion battereis and the application in flexible devices.

         <title>A Smart DNA&#8208;Based Nanosystem Containing Ribosome&#8208;Regulating&#160;siRNA for Enhanced mRNA Transfection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart DNA&#8208;based nanosystem with an siRNA&#8208;mediated regulation pathway that upregulates mRNA translation and enhances mRNA transfection is reported. The DNA&#8208;based nanosystem disassembles and releases siRNA and mRNA in response to intracellular stimuli and promotes ribosome biogenesis through intracellular glutathione depletion, which facilitates the mRNA delivery in hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells both in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Messenger RNA (mRNA) transfection is the prerequisite for the application of mRNA&#8208;based therapeutics. In hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells, such as macrophages, the effective transfection of mRNA remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, a smart DNA&#8208;based nanosystem is reported containing ribosome biogenesis&#8208;promoting siRNA, realizing efficient mRNA transfection in macrophages. Four monomers are copolymerized to form a nanoframework (NF), including N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) as the skeleton and acrydite&#8208;DNA as the initiator to trigger the cascade assembly of DNA hairpins (H1&#8208;polyT and H2&#8208;siRNA). By virtue of the phase transition characteristic of polymeric NIPAM, below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST, &#8776;34&#160;&#176;C), the NF swells to expose polyT sequences to hybridize with the polyA tail of mRNA. Above the LCST, the NF deswells to encapsulate mRNA. The disulfide bond in the NF responds to glutathione, triggering the disassembly of the nanosystem; the siRNA and mRNA are released in response to triphosadenine and RNase H. The siRNA down&#8208;regulates the expression of heat shock protein 27, which up&#8208;regulates the expression of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6. The nanosystem shows satisfactory mRNA transfection and translation efficiency in a mouse model. It is envisioned that the DNA&#8208;based nanosystem will provide a promising carrier to deliver mRNA in hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells and promote the development of mRNA&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale Epitaxial Growth of Two&#8208;dimensional Organic Semiconductor Single Crystals toward High&#8208;Performance Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anchored crystal&#8208;seed epitaxial growth method is developed to effectively suppress the multiple nucleation behavior of the molecules and enhance the 2D growth of organic crystals. In consequence, wafer&#8208;scale few&#8208;layer organic single crystals are successfully fabricated on the viscous liquid substrate. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors based on the crystal exhibit high device performance with excellent uniformity.








Abstract
The success of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electronics and optoelectronics relies heavily on the capability to fabricate semiconductor single&#8208;crystal wafers. However, the conventional epitaxial growth strategy for inorganic wafers is invalid for growing organic semiconductor single crystals due to the lack of lattice&#8208;matched epitaxial substrates and intricate nucleation behaviors, severely impeding the advancement of organic single&#8208;crystal electronics. Here, an anchored crystal&#8208;seed epitaxial growth method for wafer&#8208;scale growth of 2D organic semiconductor single crystals is developed for the first time.

&lt;p&gt;An anchored crystal-seed epitaxial growth method is developed to effectively suppress the multiple nucleation behavior of the molecules and enhance the 2D growth of organic crystals. In consequence, wafer-scale few-layer organic single crystals are successfully fabricated on the viscous liquid substrate. Organic field-effect transistors based on the crystal exhibit high device performance with excellent uniformity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of state-of-the-art electronics and optoelectronics relies heavily on the capability to fabricate semiconductor single-crystal wafers. However, the conventional epitaxial growth strategy for inorganic wafers is invalid for growing organic semiconductor single crystals due to the lack of lattice-matched epitaxial substrates and intricate nucleation behaviors, severely impeding the advancement of organic single-crystal electronics. Here, an anchored crystal-seed epitaxial growth method for wafer-scale growth of 2D organic semiconductor single crystals is developed for the first time. The crystal seed is firmly anchored on the viscous liquid surface, ensuring the steady epitaxial growth of organic single crystals from the crystal seed. The atomically flat liquid surface effectively eliminates the disturbance from substrate defects and greatly enhances the 2D growth of organic crystals. Using this approach, a wafer-scale few-layer bis(triethylsilythynyl)-anthradithphene (Dif-TES-ADT) single crystal is formed, yielding a breakthrough for organic field-effect transistors with a high reliable mobility up to 8.6 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an ultralow mobility variable coefficient of 8.9%. This work opens a new avenue to fabricate organic single-crystal wafers for high-performance organic electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting the Performance of Organic Photodetectors with a Solution&#8208;Processed Integration Circuit toward Ubiquitous Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed integration circuit consisting of an organic field&#8208;effect transistor with an ultrahigh signal amplification efficiency, an organic photoconductor, and an organic resistor is proposed to dramatically boost the photoresponse signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, enabling the accurate extraction of physiological information from the photoplethysmographic waveforms, which can promote the development of ubiquitous health monitoring.








Abstract
Organic photodetectors, as an emerging wearable photoplethysmographic (PPG) technology, offer exciting opportunities for next&#8208;generation photonic healthcare electronics. However, the mutual restraints among photoresponse, structure complexity, and fabrication cost have intrinsically limited the development of organic photodetectors for ubiquitous health monitoring in daily activities. Here, an effective route to dramatically boost the performance of organic photodetectors with a solution&#8208;processed integration circuit for health monitoring application is reported. Through creating an ideal metal&#8211;semiconductor junction interface that minimizes the trap states within the device, solution&#8208;printed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) are achieved with an ultrahigh signal amplification efficiency of 37.1 S A&#8722;1, approaching the theoretical thermionic limit. Consequently, monolithic integration of the OFET with an organic photoconductor enables the remarkable amplification of photoresponse signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio by more than four orders of magnitude from 5.5 to 4.6 &#215; 105, which is able to meet the demand for accurately extracting physiological information from the PPG waveforms. This work offers an effective and versatile approach to greatly enhance the photodetector performance, promising to revolutionize health monitoring technologies.

         <title>Spatially&#8208;Encoding Hydrogels With DNA to Control Cell Signaling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the synthesis and photopatterning of hydrogels with multiple, discrete DNA domains, single&#8208;micron resolution spatial control is achieved over chemical composition and function. DNA's sequence specificity is used to reversibly tether DNA and direct protein attachment in patterned domains. Importantly, it is shown that reporter cells preferentially activate in regions of patterned hydrogels containing biomolecular signals.








Abstract
Patterning biomolecules in synthetic hydrogels offers routes to visualize and learn how spatially&#8208;encoded cues modulate cell behavior (e.g., proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis). However, investigating the role of multiple, spatially defined biochemical cues within a single hydrogel matrix remains challenging because of the limited number of orthogonal bioconjugation reactions available for patterning. Herein, a method to pattern multiple oligonucleotide sequences in hydrogels using thiol&#8208;yne photochemistry is introduced. Rapid hydrogel photopatterning of hydrogels with micron resolution DNA features (&#8776;1.5&#160;&#181;m) and control over DNA density are achieved over centimeter&#8208;scale areas using mask&#8208;free digital photolithography. Sequence&#8208;specific DNA interactions are then used to reversibly tether biomolecules to patterned regions, demonstrating chemical control over individual patterned domains. Last, localized cell signaling is shown using patterned protein&#8211;DNA conjugates to selectively activate cells on patterned areas. Overall, this work introduces a synthetic method to achieve multiplexed micron resolution patterns of biomolecules onto hydrogel scaffolds, providing a platform to study complex spatially&#8208;encoded cellular signaling environments.

         <title>Less&#8208;Suture Vascular Anastomosis: Development of Alternative Protocols with Multifunctional Self&#8208;Wrapping, Transparent, Adhesive, and Elastic Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adhesive, hemostatic, transparent, and elastic films are developed in this study to be used in &#8220;less&#8208;suture anastomosis&#8221; for blood vessels. It extensively decreases the number of sutures for vascular anastomosis and overall surgical time to a life&#8208;saving level in both normal and coagulopathy animal models.








Abstract
Blood vessel anastomosis by suture is a life&#8208;saving, yet time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive operation. While suture&#8208;less alternatives utilizing clips or related devices are developed to address these shortcomings, suture anastomosis is still overwhelmingly used in most cases. In this study, practical &#8220;less&#8208;suture&#8221; strategies are proposed, rather than ideal &#8220;suture&#8208;less&#8221; methods, to reflect real&#8208;world clinical situations. In the case of rat artery (d = 0.64&#160;mm) anastomosis, the less&#8208;suture anastomosis involves the application of thin, adhesive, transparent, and self&#8208;wrapping films to the site. This surprisingly reduces the number of stitches required from ten (without films) to four (with films), saving 27&#160;min of operating time per vessel. Furthermore, the decreased number of stitches largely alleviates fibrosis&#8208;mediated wall&#8208;thickening. Thus, a less&#8208;suture strategy is particularly useful for anastomosis of multiple vessels in emergency conditions and small&#8208;diameter vessels.

         <title>In Situ Activation of Snap&#8208;Through Instability in Multi&#8208;Response Metamaterials through Multistable Topological Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contact&#8208;induced topological transformation is leveraged to introduce a highly versatile multistable metamaterial capable of switching its mechanical response post fabrication. The authors demonstrate how the in&#8208;situ activation and deactivation of snap&#8208;through instability enable to generate non&#8208;volatile mechanical logic operations and to reprogram energy dissipation.








Abstract
Snap&#8208;through instability has been widely leveraged in metamaterials to attain non&#8208;monotonic responses for a specific subset of applications where conventional monotonic materials fail to perform. In the remaining more plentiful set of ordinary applications, snap&#8208;through instability is harmful, and current snapping metamaterials become inadequate because their capacity to snap cannot be suppressed post&#8208;fabrication. Here, a class of topology&#8208;transformable metamaterials is introduced to enable in situ activation and deactivation of the snapping capacity, providing a remarkable level of versatility in switching between responses from monotonic to monostable and bistable snap&#8208;through. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experiments are combined to unveil the role played by contact in the topological transformation capable of increasing the geometry incompatibility and confinement stiffness of selected architectural members. The strategy here presented for post&#8208;fabrication reprogrammability of matter and on&#8208;the&#8208;fly response switching paves the way to multifunctionality for application in multiple sectors from mechanical logic gates, and adjustable energy dissipators, to in situ adaptable sport&#160;equipment.

         <title>Targeted Reprogramming of Vitamin B3 Metabolism as a Nanotherapeutic Strategy towards Chemoresistant Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) maintain cancer stem cell stemness and promote immunosuppression, leading to chemoresistance and immune escape. Gemini&#8208;like nanoparticles are designed for two&#8208;pronged CAF reprogramming and cancer cell elimination. CAF&#8208;targeting nanoparticles transform CAFs into quiescent fibroblasts via a cascade of Vitamin B3 metabolic reprogramming and chromatin remodeling and thereby rehabilitate chemosensitivity and immune activation in chemoresistant breast, liver, pancreatic and colorectal cancers.








Abstract
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote cancer stem cell (CSC)&#8208;mediated chemoresistance and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. However, direct depletion of CAFs may increase cancer invasiveness and metastasis. As a generalized strategy against chemoresistant cancers, Gemini&#8208;like homotypic targeting nanoparticles (NPs) are designed for two&#8208;pronged CAF transformation and cancer cell elimination. The CAF&#8208;targeted NPs couple vitamin B3 metabolic reprogramming to epigenetic modulation of secreted pro&#8208;stemness and immunosuppressive factors, thereby diminishing CSC and suppressive immune cell populations to enhance cancer cell drug susceptibility and cytotoxic T cell infiltration. In mouse models of breast, liver, pancreatic and colorectal cancers that are resistant to their respective first&#8208;line chemotherapeutics, a single dose of hydrogel co&#8208;delivering the Gemini&#8208;like NPs can rehabilitate chemosensitivity, induce immune activation, and achieve tumor regression. Moreover, it stimulates robust T cell memory for long&#8208;term protection against tumor rechallenge. This study thus represents an innovative approach with broad applicability for overcoming cancer chemoresistance.

         <title>Tailored Lattice Compressive Strain of Pt&#8208;Skins by the L12&#8208;Pt3M Intermetallic Core for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong confinement effect induced by modulated pores of a&#8208;NPC effectively ensures the ultrasmall size of Pt&#8208;based intermetallics and enhances the durability of the catalyst. The strain of Pt skins imposed by intermetallic cores is tailored to optimize the adsorption properties of the catalyst for intermediates of oxygen reduction reaction, resulting in highly effective and durable oxygen reduction.








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and unsatisfactory durability of Pt&#8208;based catalysts are severely hindering the commercialization of proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this work, the lattice compressive strain of Pt&#8208;skins imposed by Pt&#8208;based intermetallic cores is tailored for highly effective ORR through the confinement effect of the activated nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon (a&#8208;NPC). The modulated pores of a&#8208;NPC not only promote Pt&#8208;based intermetallics with ultrasmall size (average size of &lt;4&#160;nm), but also efficiently stabilizes intermetallic nanoparticles&#160;and sufficient exposure of active sites during the ORR process. The optimized catalyst (L12&#8208;Pt3Co@ML&#8208;Pt/NPC10) achieves excellent mass activity (1.72 A mgPt&#8722;1) and specific activity (3.49&#160;mA cmPt&#8722;2), which are 11&#8208; and 15&#8208;fold that of commercial Pt/C, respectively. Besides, owing to the confinement effect of a&#8208;NPC and protection of Pt&#8208;skins, L12&#8208;Pt3Co@ML&#8208;Pt/NPC10 retains 98.1% mass activity after 30&#160;000 cycles, and even 95% for 100&#160;000 cycles, while Pt/C retains only 51.2% for 30&#160;000 cycles. Rationalized by density functional theory, compared with other metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, and Zn), L12&#8208;Pt3Co closer to the top of &#8220;volcano&#8221; induces a more suitable compressive strain and electronic structure on Pt&#8208;skin, leading to an optimal oxygen adsorption energy and a remarkable ORR performance.

         <title>Induction of Metabolic Reprogramming in Kidney by Singlet Diradical Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocompatible nanoparticles are assembled from a diphenyl&#8208;substituted biolympicenylidene compound with a singlet diradical ground state. It is found that such nanoparticles can induce metabolic reprogramming in kidney organoids by promoting fatty acid degradation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation under redox homeostasis with an increased level of glutathione.








Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic compounds with an open&#8208;shell singlet diradical ground state, namely singlet diradicals, have recently gained attention in the fields of organic electronics, photovoltaics, and spintronics owing to their unique electronic structures and properties. Notably, singlet diradicals exhibit tunable redox amphoterism, which makes them excellent redox&#8208;active materials for biomedical applications. However, the safety and therapeutic efficacy of singlet diradicals in biological systems have not yet been explored. Herein, the study presents a newly designed singlet diradical nanomaterial, diphenyl&#8208;substituted biolympicenylidene (BO&#8208;Ph), exhibiting low cytotoxicity in vitro, non&#8208;significant acute nephrotoxicity in vivo, and the ability to induce metabolic reprogramming in kidney organoids. Integrated transcriptome and metabolome analyses reveal that the metabolism of BO&#8208;Ph stimulates glutathione (GSH) synthesis and fatty acid degradation, increases the levels of intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) and carnitine cycles, and eventually boosts oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) under redox homeostasis. Benefits of BO&#8208;Ph&#8208;induce metabolic reprogramming in kidney organoids include enhancing cellular antioxidant capacity and promoting mitochondrial function. The results of this study can facilitate the application of singlet diradical materials in the treatment of clinical conditions induced by mitochondrial abnormalities in kidney.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Dielectric&#8208;Constant Atomic Layers of Amorphous Carbon Nitride Topologically Derived from MXene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic layers of amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;CN) are produced via topological conversion of MXene&#8208;Ti3CNTx under bromine vapor. The resultant a&#8208;CN layers possess a low density of 0.55 g cm&#8722;3 and a high sp3 C level of 35.7%. As a result, a very low dielectric constant of 1.69 at 100 kHz is achieved for the 310&#8208;nm&#8208;thickness a&#8208;CN film with a breakdown strength of 5.6 MV cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant materials such as silicon dioxide serving as interconnect insulators in current integrated circuit face a great challenge due to their relatively high dielectric constant of &#8776;4, twice that of the recommended value by the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems, causing severe parasitic capacitance and associated response delay. Here, novel atomic layers of amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;CN) are prepared via a topological conversion of MXene&#8208;Ti3CNTx under bromine vapor. Remarkably, the assembled a&#8208;CN film exhibits an ultralow dielectric constant of 1.69 at 100 kHz, much lower than the previously reported dielectric materials such as amorphous carbon (2.2) and fluorinated&#8208;doped SiO2 (3.6), ascribed to the low density of 0.55&#160;g cm&#8722;3 and high sp3 C level of 35.7%. Moreover, the a&#8208;CN film has a breakdown strength of 5.6 MV&#160;cm&#8722;1, showing great potential in integrated circuit application.

         <title>Unique Chirality Selection in Neural Cells for D&#8208;Matrix Enabling Specific Manipulation of Cell Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The D&#8208;matrix chirality enhances cell density, viability, proliferation, and survival of neural cells by attenuating the interaction between cytoskeleton proteins and matrixes, subsequently activating JNK and p38/MAPK signaling pathways, while the proliferation and adhesion of non&#8208;neural cells are promoted on the L&#8208;matrix, which provides a specific method to universally manipulate neural cell behaviors with chiral biomaterial systems.

Manipulating neural cell behaviors is a critical issue to various therapies for neurological diseases and damages, where matrix chirality has long been overlooked despite the proven adhesion and proliferation improvement of multiple non&#8208;neural cells by L&#8208;matrixes. Here, it is reported that the D&#8208;matrix chirality specifically enhances cell density, viability, proliferation, and survival in four different types of neural cells, contrasting its inhibition in non&#8208;neural cells. This universal impact on neural cells is defined as &#8220;chirality selection for D&#8208;matrix&#8221; and is achieved through the activation of JNK and p38/MAPK signaling pathways by the cellular tension relaxation resulting from the weak interaction between D&#8208;matrix and cytoskeleton proteins, particularly actin. Also, D&#8208;matrix promotes sciatic nerve repair effectively, both with or without non&#8208;neural stem cell implantation, by improving the population, function, and myelination of autologous Schwann cells. D&#8208;matrix chirality, as a simple, safe, and effective microenvironment cue to specifically and universally manipulate neural cell behaviors, holds extensive application potential in addressing neurological issues such as nerve regeneration, neurodegenerative disease treatment, neural tumor targeting, and neurodevelopment.

         <title>A Recyclable Standalone Microporous Layer with Interpenetrating Network for Sustainable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nanotubes interpenetrating network is employed to prepare a standalone microporous layer (standalone MPL) with high strength and gas permeability. The high&#8208;performance standalone MPL can greatly extend the service lifetime of gas diffusion layers and reduce the costs of recovering catalyst coated membranes. Therefore, the standalone MPL is promising to significantly improve the sustainability of fuel cells.








Abstract
The commercialization of fuel cells inevitably brings recycling problems. Therefore, achieving high recyclability of fuel cells is particularly important for their sustainable development. In this work, a recyclable standalone microporous layer (standalone MPL) with interpenetrating network that can significantly enhance the recyclability and sustainability of fuel cells is prepared. The interpenetrating network enables the standalone MPL to have high strength (17.7&#160;MPa), gas permeability (1.55&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;13&#160;m2), and fuel&#8208;cell performance (peak power density 1.35&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2), providing the basic guarantee for its application in high&#8208;performance and highly recyclable fuel cells. Additionally, the standalone MPL is highly adaptable to various gas&#8208;diffusion backings (GDBs), providing high possibility to select highly recyclable GDBs. Outstandingly, anode standalone MPLs and GDBs can be easily detached from the spent membrane electrode assembly (MEA). This not only saves &gt;90 vol% solvent in the recovery of the catalyst&#8208;coated membrane (CCM), but also extends the service life of the GDBs and the anode standalone MPL at least 138 times (2 760 000&#160;h assuming 20 000&#160;h of CCM) comparing to CCM. Therefore, the standalone MPL significantly enhances the recyclability and sustainability of fuel cells and is promising to be an indispensable component in the next&#8208;generation fuel cells.

         <title>Fabrication of Single&#8208;Crystalline CoCrFeNi Thin Films by DC Magnetron Sputtering: A Route to Surface Studies of High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The epitaxial growth of the high&#8208;entropy alloy CoCrFeNi on MgO(100) by DC magnetron sputtering is demonstrated. The surface reconstruction and electronic band structure of the CoCrFeNi(100) surface is investigated by low&#8208;energy electron diffraction and angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, demonstrating the potential of epitaxial films for fundamental studies of low&#8208;index HEA surfaces.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) with their almost limitless number of possible compositions have raised widespread attention in material science. Next to wear and corrosion resistive coatings, their application as tunable electrocatalysts has recently moved into the focus. On the other hand, fundamental properties of HEA surfaces like atomic and electronic structure, surface segregation and diffusion as well as adsorption on HEA surfaces are barely explored. The lack of research is caused by the limited availability of single&#8208;crystalline samples. In the present work, the epitaxial growth of face centered cubic (fcc) CoCrFeNi films on MgO(100) is reported. Their characterization by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrates that the layers with a homogeneous and close to equimolar elemental composition are oriented in [100] direction and aligned with the substrate to which they form an abrupt interface. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low&#8208;energy electron diffraction (LEED), and angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy are employed to study chemical composition and atomic and electronic structure of CoCrFeNi(100). It is demonstrated that epitaxially grown HEA films have the potential to fill the sample gap, allowing for fundamental studies of properties of and processes on well&#8208;defined HEA surfaces over the full compositional&#160;space.

         <title>Flowthrough Capture of Microplastics through Polyphenol&#8208;Mediated Interfacial Interactions on Wood Sawdust</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable, cost&#8208;effective, highly efficient, and bio&#8208;based flowthrough capturing materials (bioCap) are developed based on wood sawdust support for the removal of nano&#8208;/microplastics from water. Due to the unique advantage of phenolic&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;molecular interactions, bioCap is capable of capturing a broad spectrum of nano&#8208;/microplastics with various types (six types), surface charges (anionic, cationic, and neutral), and shapes (spherical and irregular).








Abstract
Nano&#8208;/microplastics accumulate in aquatic bodies and raise increasing threats to ecosystems and human health. The limitation of existing water cleanup strategies, especially in the context of nano&#8208;/microplastics, primarily arises from their complexity (morphological, compositional, and dimensional). Here, highly efficient and bio&#8208;based flowthrough capturing materials (bioCap) are reported to remove a broad spectrum of nano&#8208;/microplastics from water: polyethylene terephthalate (anionic, irregular shape), polyethylene (net neutral, irregular shape), polystyrene (anionic and cationic, spherical shape), and other anionic and spherical shaped particles (polymethyl methacrylate, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride). Highly efficient bioCap systems that adsorb the ubiquitous particles released from beverage bags are demonstrated. As evidence of removal from drinking water, the in vivo biodistribution of nano&#8208;/microplastics is profiled, confirming a significant reduction of particle accumulation in main organs. The unique advantage of phenolic&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;molecular interactions is employed in sustainable, cost&#8208;effective, and facile strategies based on wood sawdust support for the removal of challenging nano&#8208;/microplastics pollutions.

         <title>Printable High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable FAPbBr3 Perovskite Solar Cells for Multifunctional Building&#8208;Integrated Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ intermediate phase transition&#8208;controlled blade&#8208;coating method for FAPbBr3 perovskite solar cells is introduced, which obtains a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.86% based on hole transport layer&#8208;free structures of glass/FTO/SnO2/FAPbBr3/carbon. Semitransparent devices are fabricated and obtain high PCE of 8.61% at average visible light transmittance (AVT) =&#160;45% and PCE of 5.55% at AVT&#160;=&#160;53% for small devices and 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#160;cm2 modules, respectively.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) show great promise for next&#8208;generation building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications because of their abundance of raw materials, adjustable transparency, and cost&#8208;effective printable processing. Owing to the complex perovskite nucleation and growth control, the fabrication of large&#8208;area perovskite films for high&#8208;performance printed PSCs is still under active investigation. Herein, the study proposes an intermediate&#8208;phase&#8208;transition&#8208;assisted one&#8208;step blade coating for an intrinsic transparent formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr3) perovskite film. The intermediate complex optimizes the crystal growth path of FAPbBr3, resulting in a large&#8208;area, homogeneous, and dense absorber film. A champion efficiency of 10.86% with high open&#8208;circuit voltage up to 1.57&#160;V is obtained with a simplified device architecture of glass/FTO/SnO2/FAPbBr3/carbon. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices maintain 90% of their initial power conversion efficiency after aging at 75&#160;&#176;C for 1000&#160;h in ambient air, and 96% after maximum power point tracking for 500&#160;h. The printed semitransparent PSCs, with average visible light transmittance over 45%, demonstrate high efficiencies for both small devices (8.6%) and 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#160;cm2 modules (5.55%). Finally, the ability to customize the color, transparency, and thermal insulation properties of FAPbBr3 PSCs makes them high prospects as multifunctional BIPVs.

&lt;p&gt;An in situ intermediate phase transition-controlled blade-coating method for FAPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite solar cells is introduced, which obtains a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.86% based on hole transport layer-free structures of glass/FTO/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/FAPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/carbon. Semitransparent devices are fabricated and obtain high PCE of 8.61% at average visible light transmittance (AVT) =&#160;45% and PCE of 5.55% at AVT&#160;=&#160;53% for small devices and 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; modules, respectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) show great promise for next-generation building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications because of their abundance of raw materials, adjustable transparency, and cost-effective printable processing. Owing to the complex perovskite nucleation and growth control, the fabrication of large-area perovskite films for high-performance printed PSCs is still under active investigation. Herein, the study proposes an intermediate-phase-transition-assisted one-step blade coating for an intrinsic transparent formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) perovskite film. The intermediate complex optimizes the crystal growth path of FAPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in a large-area, homogeneous, and dense absorber film. A champion efficiency of 10.86% with high open-circuit voltage up to 1.57&#160;V is obtained with a simplified device architecture of glass/FTO/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/FAPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/carbon. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices maintain 90% of their initial power conversion efficiency after aging at 75&#160;&#176;C for 1000&#160;h in ambient air, and 96% after maximum power point tracking for 500&#160;h. The printed semitransparent PSCs, with average visible light transmittance over 45%, demonstrate high efficiencies for both small devices (8.6%) and 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; modules (5.55%). Finally, the ability to customize the color, transparency, and thermal insulation properties of FAPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PSCs makes them high prospects as multifunctional BIPVs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Therapy of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) with Highly Specific and Durable Targeted Ta2C Modified with Chondroitin Sulfate (TACS)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
TACS keeps stable in gastrointestinal tract and targets the inflammatory lesions efficiently and accurately. TACS has specific CT imaging for IBD and alleviates the five major pathological features of IBD including alleviating oxidative stress, inhibiting apoptosis, anti&#8208;inflammation, restoring barrier function, and modulating the gut microbiome.








Abstract
Non&#8208;invasive localization of lesions and specific targeted therapy are still the main challenges for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ta, as a medical metal element, has been widely used in the treatment of different diseases because of its excellent physicochemical properties but is still far from being explored in IBD. Here, Ta2C modified with chondroitin sulfate (CS) (TACS) is evaluated as a highly targeted therapy nanomedicine for IBD. Specifically, TACS is modified with dual targeting CS functions due to IBD lesion&#8208;specific positive charges and high expression of CD44 receptors. Thanks to the acid stability, sensitive CT imaging function, and strong reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination ability, oral TACS can accurately locate and delineate IBD lesions through non&#8208;invasive CT imaging, and specifically targeted treat IBD effectively because high levels of ROS are a central factor in the progression of IBD. As expected, TACS has much better imaging and therapeutic effects than clinical CT contrast agent and first&#8208;line drug 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid, respectively. The mechanism of TACS treatment mainly involves protection of mitochondria, elimination of oxidative stress, inhibiting macrophage M1 polarization, protection of intestinal barrier, and restoration of intestinal flora balance. Collectively, this work provides unprecedented opportunities for oral nanomedicines to targeted therapy of IBD.

         <title>Surface Electronic Structure Engineering of Manganese Bismuth Tellurides Guided by Micro&#8208;Focused Angle&#8208;Resolved Photoemission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dramatic modifications of the surface electronic structures of the magnetic topological insulator compounds MnBi2Te4 and MnBi4Te7 are directly visualized using micro&#8208;focused angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy. A general method to achieve a minimal dispersion with topological bands close to the Fermi energy is demonstrated across the compounds.








Abstract
Modification of the electronic structure of quantum matter by ad atom deposition allows for directed fundamental design of electronic and magnetic properties. This concept is utilized in the present study in order to tune the surface electronic structure of magnetic topological insulators based on MnBi2Te4. The topological bands of these systems are typically strongly electron&#8208;doped and hybridized with a manifold of surface states that place the salient topological states out of reach of electron transport and practical applications. In this study, micro&#8208;focused angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (microARPES) provides direct access to the termination&#8208;dependent dispersion of MnBi2Te4 and MnBi4Te7 during in situ deposition of rubidium atoms. The resulting band structure changes are found to be highly complex, encompassing coverage&#8208;dependent ambipolar doping effects, removal of surface state hybridization, and the collapse of a surface state band gap. In addition, doping&#8208;dependent band bending is found to give rise to tunable quantum well states. This wide range of observed electronic structure modifications can provide new ways to exploit the topological states and the rich surface electronic structures of manganese bismuth&#160;tellurides.

         <title>Single&#8208;Ion&#8208;Conducting Hydrogel Electrolytes Based on Slide&#8208;Ring Pseudo&#8208;Polyrotaxane for Ultralong&#8208;Cycling Flexible Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolyte is developed by confining the anions between two ring&#8208;shaped cyclodextrins to allow Zn2+ transfer along the outside of the rings. It delivers a large Zn2+ transference number of 0.923 and exhibits an excellent capacity retention of 90.2% after 3500 cycles in flexible zinc&#8208;ion batteries at 5 A g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Flexible zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) with high capacity and long cycle stability are essential for wearable electronic devices. Hydrogel electrolytes have been developed to provide ion&#8208;transfer channels while maintaining the integrity of ZIBs under mechanical strain. However, hydrogel matrices are typically swollen with aqueous salt solutions to increase ionic conductivity, which can hinder intimate contact with electrodes and reduce mechanical properties. To address this, a single&#8208;Zn&#8208;ion&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolyte (SIHE) is developed by integrating polyacrylamide network and pseudo&#8208;polyrotaxane structure. The SIHE exhibits a high Zn2+ transference number of 0.923 and a high ionic conductivity of 22.4 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. Symmetric batteries with SIHE demonstrate stable Zn plating/stripping performance for over 160 h, with a homogenous and smooth Zn deposition layer. Full cells with La&#8208;V2O5 cathodes exhibit a high capacity of 439 mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 and excellent capacity retention of 90.2% after 3500 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. Moreover, the flexible ZIBs display stable electrochemical performance under harsh conditions, such as bending, cutting, puncturing, and soaking. This work provides a simple design strategy for single&#8208;ion&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolytes, which could pave the way for long&#8208;life aqueous batteries.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Narrow&#8208;Bandwidth Deep&#8208;Red Electroluminescence Based on Green Plant&#8208;Derived Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bright deep&#8208;red fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) with an ultra&#8208;narrow FWHM of 21 nm and a high quantum yield of 52% are prepared by readily available green plants. High color&#8208;purity deep&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on these CDs are demonstrated for the first time with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.692, 0.307) by using an exciplex host.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (DR&#8208;LEDs, &gt;660&#160;nm) with high color&#8208;purity and narrow&#8208;bandwidth emission are promising for full&#8208;color displays and solid&#8208;state lighting applications. Currently, the DR&#8208;LEDs are mainly based on conventional emitters such as organic materials and heavy&#8208;metal based quantum dots (QDs) and perovskites. However, the organic materials always suffer from the complicated synthesis, inferior color purity with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) more than&#8201;40&#8201;nm, and the QDs and perovskites still suffer from serious problems related to toxicity. Herein, this work reports the synthesis of efficient and high color&#8208;purity deep&#8208;red carbon dots (CDs) with a record narrow FWHM of 21&#160;nm and a high quantum yield of more than 50% from readily available green plants.

The deep&#8208;red CD&#8208;LEDs display high color&#8208;purity with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.692, 0.307).

&lt;p&gt;Bright deep-red fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) with an ultra-narrow FWHM of 21 nm and a high quantum yield of 52% are prepared by readily available green plants. High color-purity deep-red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on these CDs are demonstrated for the first time with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.692, 0.307) by using an exciplex host.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep-red light-emitting diodes (DR-LEDs, &amp;gt;660&#160;nm) with high color-purity and narrow-bandwidth emission are promising for full-color displays and solid-state lighting applications. Currently, the DR-LEDs are mainly based on conventional emitters such as organic materials and heavy-metal based quantum dots (QDs) and perovskites. However, the organic materials always suffer from the complicated synthesis, inferior color purity with full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) more than&#8201;40&#8201;nm, and the QDs and perovskites still suffer from serious problems related to toxicity. Herein, this work reports the synthesis of efficient and high color-purity deep-red carbon dots (CDs) with a record narrow FWHM of 21&#160;nm and a high quantum yield of more than 50% from readily available green plants. Moreover, an exciplex host is further established using a polymer and small molecular blend, which has been shown to be an efficient strategy for producing high color-purity monochrome emission from deep-red CDs via F&#246;rster energy transfer (FET). The deep-red CD-LEDs display high color-purity with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.692, 0.307). To the best of the knowledge, this is the first report of high color-purity CD-LEDs in the deep-red region, opening the door for the application of CDs in the development of high-resolution light-emitting display technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultralow Tip&#8208;Force Driven Sizable&#8208;Area Domain Manipulation through Transverse Flexoelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to activate the transverse flexoelectricity with a widely influenced range through the flexural suspended films. Sizable&#8208;area (2500 times larger than the tip&#8208;surface contact area) domain switching is successfully realized in hundreds of nanometer&#8208;thick (up to 550 nm) van der Waals ferroelectric CuInP2S6, driving by a single&#8208;point ultralow tip&#8208;force with the surface intact.








Abstract
Deterministic control of ferroelectric domain is critical in the ferroelectric functional electronics. Ferroelectric polarization can be manipulated mechanically with a nano&#8208;tip through flexoelectricity. However, it usually occurs in a very localized area in ultrathin films, with possible permanent surface damage caused by a large tip&#8208;force. Here it is demonstrated that the deliberate engineering of transverse flexoelectricity offers a powerful tool for improving the mechanical domain switching. Sizable&#8208;area domain switching under an ultralow tip&#8208;force can be realized in suspended van der Waals ferroelectrics with the surface intact, due to the enhanced transverse flexoelectric field. The film thickness range for domain switching in suspended ferroelectrics is significantly improved by an order of magnitude to hundreds of nanometers, being far beyond the limited range of the substrate&#8208;supported ones. The experimental results and phase&#8208;field simulations further reveal the crucial role of the transverse flexoelectricity in the domain manipulation. This large&#8208;scale mechanical manipulation of ferroelectric domain provides opportunities for the flexoelectricity&#8208;based domain controls in emerging low&#8208;dimensional ferroelectrics and related devices.

         <title>Synthesis of High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy Nanoparticles by a Step&#8208;Alloying Strategy as a Superior Multifunctional Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A step&#8208;alloying strategy is developed to prepare a series of high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy nanoparticle (HEA&#8208;NP) systems that contain many strongly immiscible element pairs, including Bi&#8211;W with the highest &#916;Hmix of 45&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1. This strategy further expands the spectrum of possible metal alloys, which is significant for the broad compositional space and future data&#8208;driven material discovery.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy nanoparticles (HEA&#8208;NPs) have attracted great attention because of their unique complex compositions and tailorable properties. Further expanding the compositional space is of great significance for enriching the material library. Here, a step&#8208;alloying strategy is developed to synthesis HEA&#8208;NPs containing a range of strongly repellent elements (e.g., Bi&#8211;W) by using the rich&#8208;Pt cores formed during the first liquid phase reaction as the seed of the second thermal diffusion. Remarkably, the representative HEA&#8208;NPs&#8208;(14) with up to 14 elements exhibits extremely excellent multifunctional electrocatalytic performance for pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Briefly, HEA&#8208;NPs&#8208;(14) only requires the ultralow overpotentials of 11 and 18&#160;mV to deliver 10&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibits ultralong durability for 400 and 264&#160;h under 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4 and 1&#160;m KOH, respectively, which surpasses most advanced pH&#8208;universal HER catalysts. Moreover, HEA&#8208;NPs&#8208;(14) also exhibits an impressive peak current density of 12.6&#8201;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1Pt in 1&#160;m KOH&#160;+&#160;1&#160;m MeOH and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86&#160;V (vs RHE.) in 0.1&#160;m KOH. The work further expands the spectrum of possible metal alloys, which is important for the broad compositional space and future data&#8208;driven material discovery.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Intercalation Dominated Ferromagnetism of van der Waals Fe3GeTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Fe intercalation on the interstitial sites in high Curie temperature (Tc) Fe3GeTe2 may be responsible for the local antiferromagnetic coupling that gives rise to the exchange bias effect, and that the interlayer exchange paths greatly contribute to the enhancement of Tc.








Abstract
Fe3GeTe2 have proven to be of greatly intrigue. However, the underlying mechanism behind the varying Curie temperature (Tc) values remains a puzzle. This study explores the atomic structure of Fe3GeTe2 crystals exhibiting Tc values of 160, 210, and 230 K. The elemental mapping reveals a Fe&#8208;intercalation on the interstitial sites within the van der Waals gap of the high&#8208;Tc (210 and 230 K) samples, which are observed to have an exchange bias effect by electrical transport measurements, while Fe intercalation or the bias effect is absent in the low&#8208;Tc (160 K) samples. First&#8208;principles calculations further suggest that the Fe&#8208;intercalation layer may be responsible for the local antiferromagnetic coupling that gives rise to the exchange bias effect, and that the interlayer exchange paths greatly contribute to the enhancement of Tc. This discovery of the Fe&#8208;intercalation layer elucidates the mechanism behind the hidden antiferromagnetic ordering that underlies the enhancement of Tc in Fe3GeTe2.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators Based on Knitting Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) actuators are additively manufactured from LCE fibers by knitting technology. The obtained knitted LCE actuators with diverse 3D geometry can be rationally designed and perform programmed deformability. The knitted LCE actuators can be fully recycled, and its functionality can be further extended by threading and stitching. This study introduces a new avenue for the fabrication of LCE actuators.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) exhibits large and reversible deformability originating from the alignment of liquid crystal mesogens. Additive manufacturing provides high controllability in the alignment and shaping process of LCE actuators. However, it still remains a challenge to customize LCE actuators with both diverse 3D deformability and recyclability.

     alt="Additive Manufacturing of Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators Based on Knitting Technology"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) actuators are additively manufactured from LCE fibers by knitting technology. The obtained knitted LCE actuators with diverse 3D geometry can be rationally designed and perform programmed deformability. The knitted LCE actuators can be fully recycled, and its functionality can be further extended by threading and stitching. This study introduces a new avenue for the fabrication of LCE actuators.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) exhibits large and reversible deformability originating from the alignment of liquid crystal mesogens. Additive manufacturing provides high controllability in the alignment and shaping process of LCE actuators. However, it still remains a challenge to customize LCE actuators with both diverse 3D deformability and recyclability. In this study, a new strategy is developed to exploit knitting technique to additively manufacture LCE actuators. The obtained LCE actuators are fabric-structured with designed geometry and deformability. By accurately adjusting the parameters of the knitting patterns as modules, diverse geometry is pixel-wise designed, and complex 3D deformations including bending, twisting, and folding are quantitatively controlled. In addition, the fabric-structured LCE actuators can be threaded, stitched, and reknitted to achieve advanced geometry, integrated multi-functions and efficient recyclability. This approach allows the fabrication of versatile LCE actuators with potential applications in smart textiles and soft robots.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Toughening CO2&#8208;Derived Copolymer Elastomers Through Ionomer Networking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation and properties of CO2&#8208;derived block polymer thermoplastic elastomers and ionomers, with Na(I), Mg(II), Ca(II), Zn(II) and Al(III) (&lt;1&#160;wt% metal), are reported. The materials show wide operating temperatures, &gt;50&#8208;fold higher Young's modulus and 21&#8208;times greater tensile strength than unfunctionalized materials, high elastic recovery, and creep&#8208;resistance, and are recyclable.








Abstract
Utilizing carbon dioxide (CO2) to make polycarbonates through the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of CO2 and epoxides valorizes and recycles CO2 and reduces pollution in polymer manufacturing. Recent developments in catalysis provide access to polycarbonates with well&#8208;defined structures and allow for copolymerization with biomass&#8208;derived monomers; however, the resulting material properties are underinvestigated. Here, new types of CO2&#8208;derived thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) are described together with a generally applicable method to augment tensile mechanical strength and Young's modulus without requiring material re&#8208;design. These TPEs combine high glass transition temperature (Tg) amorphous blocks comprising CO2&#8208;derived poly(carbonates) (A&#8208;block), with low Tg poly(&#949;&#8208;decalactone), from castor oil, (B&#8208;block) in ABA structures. The poly(carbonate) blocks are selectively functionalized with metal&#8208;carboxylates where the metals are Na(I), Mg(II), Ca(II), Zn(II) and Al(III). The colorless polymers, featuring &lt;1&#160;wt% metal, show tunable thermal (Tg), and mechanical (elongation at break, elasticity, creep&#8208;resistance) properties. The best elastomers show &gt;50&#8208;fold higher Young's modulus and 21&#8208;times greater tensile strength, without compromise to elastic recovery, compared with the starting block polymers. They have wide operating temperatures (&#8722;20 to 200&#160;&#176;C), high creep&#8208;resistance and yet remain recyclable. In the future, these materials may substitute high&#8208;volume petrochemical elastomers and be utilized in high&#8208;growth fields like medicine, robotics, and electronics.

         <title>Interfacial Passivation Enormously Enhances Electroluminescence of Triphenylphosphine Cu4I4 Cube</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes based on mono&#8208;dentate ligands with high luminance and efficiencies are realized through a non&#8208;doped bilayer structure of [TPP]4Cu4I4|TmPyPB, in which pyridine&#8208;capped TmPyPB effectively passivates surface defects of [TPP]4Cu4I4 layer to prevent interfacial charge trapping and suppressing exciton nonradiation, resulting in &#8776;200 and 23 folds increased luminance and external quantum efficiency, respectively.








Abstract
Defect is one of the key factors limiting optoelectronic performances of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid systems. Although high&#8208;efficiency bidentate ligands based electroluminescent (EL) clusters reported, until present, only few EL clusters based on monodentate ligands are realized since their structural instability induces more surface/interface defects. Herein, this bottleneck is first overcome in virtue of interfacial passivation by electron transporting layers (ETL). Through using TmPyPB with meta&#8208;linked pyridines as ETL, photoluminescent (PL) and EL quantum efficiencies of the simplest monophosphine Cu4I4 cube [TPP]4Cu4I4 are greatly improved by &#8776;2 and 23 folds, respectively, as well as &#8776;200 folds increased luminance, corresponding to a huge leap from nearly unlighted (&lt;20 nits) to highly bright (&gt;3000 nits). The passivation effect of TmPyPB on surface defects of cluster layer is embodied as preventing interfacial charge trapping and suppressing exciton nonradiation.

         <title>4D Visualization of a Nonthermal Coherent Magnon in a Laser Heated Lattice by an X&#8208;ray Free Electron Laser</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Femtosecond time&#8208;resolved resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray diffraction experiment using an X&#8208;ray free electron laser visualizes a light&#8208;induced coherent magnon in a multiferroic. The magnon trajectory in time and 3D space unveils the photomagnetic coupling largely enhanced by above&#8208;bandgap photoexcitation, distinguished from a laser&#8208;heated magnetic behavior. This energy&#8208;efficient photoexcitation process suggests the potential for a novel photomagnetic control of ferroelectricity in multiferroics.








Abstract
Ultrafast optical manipulation of magnetic phenomena is an exciting achievement of mankind, expanding one's horizon of knowledge toward the functional nonequilibrium states. The dynamics acting on an extremely short timescale push the detection limits that reveal fascinating light&#8211;matter interactions for nonthermal creation of effective magnetic fields. While some cases are benchmarked by emergent transient behaviors, otherwise identifying the nonthermal effects remains challenging. Here, a femtosecond time&#8208;resolved resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray diffraction experiment is introduced, which uses an X&#8208;ray free&#8208;electron laser (XFEL) to distinguish between the effective field and the photoinduced thermal effect. It is observed that a multiferroic Y&#8208;type hexaferrite exhibits magnetic Bragg peak intensity oscillations manifesting entangled antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) Fourier components of a coherent AFM magnon. The magnon trajectory constructed in 3D space and time domains is decisive to evince ultrafast field formation preceding the lattice thermalization. A remarkable impact of photoexcitation across the electronic bandgap is directly unraveled, amplifying the photomagnetic coupling that is one of the highest among AFM dielectrics. Leveraging the above&#8208;bandgap photoexcitation, this energy&#8208;efficient optical process further suggests a novel photomagnetic control of ferroelectricity in multiferroics.

         <title>Robust Sub&#8208;5 Nanometer bis(Diarylcarbene)&#8208;Based Thin Film for Molecular Electronics and Plasmonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>

Robust and air&#8208;stable molecular tunnel junctions with a sub&#8208;5 nanometer bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based thin film as the tunneling barrier are accessible, which anchors to the electrode surface via a Au&#63743;C bond and shows promising applications in molecular electronics and plasmonics.








Abstract
In miniaturized electronic and optoelectronic circuits, molecular tunnel junctions have attracted enormous research interest due to their small footprint, low power consumption, and rich molecular functions. However, the most popular building blocks used in contemporary molecular tunnel junctions are thiol molecules, which attach to electrode surfaces via a metal&#8208;thiolate (M&#63743;S) bond, showing low stability and usually quick degradation within several days. To pave the way for more widely applicable and stable molecular tunnel junctions, there is a need to develop new molecular anchoring groups. Here, this work&#160;demonstrates robust and air&#8208;stable molecular tunnel junctions with a sub&#8208;5 nanometer bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based thin film as the tunneling barrier, which anchors to the electrode surface via a Au&#63743;C bond. The bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based molecular tunnel junctions exhibit high thermal stability against heating up to 200 &#176;C and long storage lifetime over 5 months in an ambient environment. Both electrical and optical performance of these bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based molecular junctions are&#160;characterized systematically, showing similar behaviors to thiol&#8208;based junctions as well as largely improved emission stability. This research highlights the excellent performance of bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based molecular tunnel junctions, which could&#160;be useful for applications in molecular electronics and plasmonics.

However, the most popular building blocks used in contemporary molecular tunnel junctions are thiol molecules, which attach to electrode surfaces via a metal-thiolate (M&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;S) bond, showing low stability and usually quick degradation within several days. To pave the way for more widely applicable and stable molecular tunnel junctions, there is a need to develop new molecular anchoring groups. Here, this work&#160;demonstrates robust and air-stable molecular tunnel junctions with a sub-5 nanometer bis(diarylcarbene)-based thin film as the tunneling barrier, which anchors to the electrode surface via a Au&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C bond. The bis(diarylcarbene)-based molecular tunnel junctions exhibit high thermal stability against heating up to 200 &#176;C and long storage lifetime over 5 months in an ambient environment. Both electrical and optical performance of these bis(diarylcarbene)-based molecular junctions are&#160;characterized systematically, showing similar behaviors to thiol-based junctions as well as largely improved emission stability. This research highlights the excellent performance of bis(diarylcarbene)-based molecular tunnel junctions, which could&#160;be useful for applications in molecular electronics and plasmonics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystallinity and Phase Control in Formamidinium&#8208;Based Dion&#8211;Jacobson 2D Perovskite via Seed&#8208;Induced Growth for Efficient Photovoltaics</title>

         <dc:description>
This study presents a seed&#8208;induced growth approach employing MAPbCl3 and BDAPbI4 in the deposition of FA&#8208;based Dion&#8208;Jacobson 2D perovskite films. This method yields high&#8208;quality perovskite films as the seeds serve as templates for the epitaxial growth of FA&#8208;based counterparts, effectively suppressing the &#948; phaseand mitigating random phases. As a result, the optimized device delivers an outstanding efficiency of 20.0%.








Abstract
2D perovskites based on Formamidinium (FA) hold the potential for excellent stability and a broad absorption range, making them attractive materials for solar cells. However, FA&#8208;based 2D perovskites produced via one&#8208;step processing exhibit poor crystallinity and random quasi&#8208;quantum wells (QWs), leading to subpar photovoltaic performance. In this study, a seed&#8208;induced growth approach is introduced employing MAPbCl3 and BDAPbI4 in the deposition of FA&#8208;based Dion&#8208;Jacobson 2D perovskite films. This method yields high&#8208;quality perovskite films as the seeds preferentially precipitate and serve as templates for the epitaxial growth of FA&#8208;based counterparts, effectively suppressing the &#948; phase. Moreover, the epitaxial growth facilitated by uniformly dispersed seeds results in simultaneous crystallization from top to bottom, efficiently mitigating random phases (n = 2, 3, 4&#8230;) induced by the diffusion of organic cations and, in turn, minimizing energy loss. The impact of seed&#8208;induced growth on the crystallization and phase distribution of FA&#8208;based 2D perovskites is systematically investigated. As a result, the optimized FA&#8208;based 2D perovskite solar cell delivers an outstanding efficiency of 20.0%, accompanied by a remarkable fill factor of 0.823. Additionally, the unencapsulated device demonstrates exceptional stability, maintaining 98% of its initial efficiency after 1344 h of storage.

         <title>Planar Spin Glass with Topologically&#160;Protected Mazes in the Liquid Crystal Targeting for Reconfigurable Micro Security Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deterministic and non&#8208;deterministic properties of a topologically&#160;protected maze in the&#160;chiral liquid crystal (LC) resulting from microscopic order and macroscopic disorder accomplish a security system that serves as advanced artificial fingerprints. This system enables facile authentication through deep&#8208;learning technology and can reconstruct information through the phase transition of LCs.








Abstract
The planar spin glass pattern is widely known for its inherent randomness, resulting from the geometrical frustration. As such, developing physical unclonable functions (PUFs)&#8212;which operate with device randomness&#8212;with planar spin glass patterns is a promising candidate for an advanced security systems in the upcoming digitalized society. Despite their inherent randomness, traditional magnetic spin glass patterns pose considerable obstacles in detection, making it challenging to achieve authentication in security systems. This necessitates the development of facilely observable mimetic patterns with similar randomness to overcome these challenges. Here, a straightforward approach is introduced using a topologically&#160;protected maze pattern in the chiral liquid crystals (LCs). This maze exhibits a comparable level of randomness to magnetic spin glass and can be reliably identified through the combination of optical microscopy with machine learning&#8208;based object detection techniques. The &#8220;information&#8221; embedded in the maze can be reconstructed through thermal phase transitions of the LCs in tens of seconds. Furthermore, incorporating various elements can enhance the optical PUF, resulting in a multi&#8208;factor security medium. It is expected that this security medium, based on microscopically controlled and macroscopically uncontrolled topologically&#160;protected structures, may be utilized as a next&#8208;generation security system.

         <title>A Personalized Cancer Vaccine that Induces Synergistic Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An autologous extracellular nanovesicle vaccine derived from alpha&#8208;galactosylceramide&#8208;conjugated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells directly activates both innate immune cells and AML&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells without having to define tumor antigens. It induces strong antitumor immune memory and synergizes with chemotherapy to prevent relapse in hosts with AML. Thus, it can be developed as a platform for personalized vaccines in humans.








Abstract
To demonstrate potent efficacy, a cancer vaccine needs to activate both innate and adaptive immune cells. Personalized cancer vaccine strategies often require the identification of patient&#8208;specific neoantigens; however, the clonal and mutational heterogeneity of cancer cells presents inherent challenges. Here, extracellular nanovesicles derived from alpha&#8208;galactosylceramide&#8208;conjugated autologous acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells (ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC) are presented as a personalized therapeutic vaccine that activates both innate and adaptive immune responses, bypassing the need to identify patient&#8208;specific neoantigens. ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC vaccination directly engages with and activates both invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and leukemia&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells in mice with AML, thereby promoting long&#8208;term anti&#8208;leukemic immune memory. ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC sufficiently serves as an antigen&#8208;presenting platform that can directly activate antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells even in the absence of dendritic cells, thereby demonstrating a multifaceted cellular mechanism of immune activation. Moreover, ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC vaccination results in a significantly lower AML burden and higher percentage of leukemia&#8208;free survivors among cytarabine&#8208;treated hosts with AML. Human AML&#8208;derived ECNV&#8208;&#945;GCs activate iNKT cells in both healthy individuals and patients with AML regardless of responsiveness to conventional therapies. Together, autologous AML&#8208;derived ECNV&#8208;&#945;GCs may be a promising personalized therapeutic vaccine that efficiently establishes AML&#8208;specific long&#8208;term immunity without requiring the identification of neoantigens.

         <title>A Photopatternable Conjugated Polymer with Thermal&#8208;Annealing&#8208;Promoted Interchain Stacking for Highly Stable Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208; and thermostable anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials are designed using a photopatternable conjugated polymer with thermal&#8208;annealing&#8208;promoted interchain stacking. To prepare anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials, the polymer is irradiated with polarized light through a photomask, and thermally annealed under a photonic stamp. This strategy generates a highly secure anti&#8208;counterfeiting material with dual patterns, which is stable to sunlight and heat over 200&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Photoresponsive polymers can be conveniently used to fabricate anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials through photopatterning. However, an unsolved problem is that ambient light and heat can damage anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns on photoresponsive polymers. Herein, photo&#8208; and thermostable anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials are developed by photopatterning and thermal annealing of a photoresponsive conjugated polymer (MC&#8208;Azo). MC&#8208;Azo contains alternating azobenzene and fluorene units in the polymer backbone. To prepare an anti&#8208;counterfeiting material, an MC&#8208;Azo film is irradiated with polarized blue light through a photomask, and then thermally annealed under the pressure of a photonic stamp. This strategy generates a highly secure anti&#8208;counterfeiting material with dual patterns, which is stable to sunlight and heat over 200&#160;&#176;C. A key for the stability is that thermal annealing promotes interchain stacking, which converts photoresponsive MC&#8208;Azo to a photostable material. Another key for the stability is that the conjugated structure endows MC&#8208;Azo with desirable thermal properties. This study shows that the design of photopatternable conjugated polymers with thermal&#8208;annealing&#8208;promoted interchain stacking provides a new strategy for the development of highly stable and secure anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.

To prepare an anti-counterfeiting material, an MC-Azo film is irradiated with polarized blue light through a photomask, and then thermally annealed under the pressure of a photonic stamp. This strategy generates a highly secure anti-counterfeiting material with dual patterns, which is stable to sunlight and heat over 200&#160;&#176;C. A key for the stability is that thermal annealing promotes interchain stacking, which converts photoresponsive MC-Azo to a photostable material. Another key for the stability is that the conjugated structure endows MC-Azo with desirable thermal properties. This study shows that the design of photopatternable conjugated polymers with thermal-annealing-promoted interchain stacking provides a new strategy for the development of highly stable and secure anti-counterfeiting materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Water&#8208;Induced Bandgap Engineering in Nanoribbons of Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective bandgap modulation of water&#8208;adsorbed zigzag&#8208;oriented hexagonal boron nitride nanoribbons (zBNNRs) is reported. A water layer adsorbed at the edges creates a huge transverse potential and then greatly reduces its bandgap. The conductance of &#8776;8 nm&#8208;wide zBNNRs with adsorbates of water can be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via electrical field modulation at room temperature.








Abstract
Different from hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) sheets, the bandgap of hBN nanoribbons (BNNRs) can be changed by spatial/electrostatic confinement. It is predicted that a transverse electric field can narrow the bandgap and even cause an insulator&#8211;metal transition in BNNRs. However, experimentally introducing an overhigh electric field across the BNNR remains challenging. Here, it is&#160;theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that water adsorption greatly reduces the bandgap of zigzag&#8208;oriented BNNRs (zBNNRs). Ab initio calculations show that water molecules can be favorably assembled within the trench between two adjacent BNNRs to form a polar ice layer, which induces a transverse equivalent electric field of over 2&#160;V&#160;nm&#8722;1 accounting for the bandgap reduction. Field&#8208;effect transistors are&#160;successfully fabricated from zBNNRs with different widths. The conductance of water&#8208;adsorbed zBNNRs can&#160;be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via modulation of the equivalent electrical field at room temperature. Furthermore, photocurrent response measurements are&#160;taken to determine the optical bandgaps of zBNNRs with water adsorption. The zBNNR with increased width can exhibit a bandgap down to 1.17&#160;eV. This study offers fundamental insights into new routes toward realizing electronic/optoelectronic devices and circuits based on hexagonal boron nitride.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Derived Bismuth with I&#8722; and Cs+ Dual Modification for High&#8208;Efficiency CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Formate Electrosynthesis and Al&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>

Hexagonal Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite nanocrystals are prepared via a hot&#8208;injection method, and under cathodic potentials, are converted to Bi nanocrystals with the dual modification of I&#8722; and Cs+ on surface. The resultant catalyst exhibits great performances for CO2 reduction reaction to formate in both the H&#8208;cell and flow cell, and when used as the cathode catalyst for Al&#8208;CO2 batteries, enable simultaneous CO2 valorization and power generation.








Abstract
Bi&#8208;based materials are one of the most promising candidates for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate; however, the majority of them still suffer from low current density and stability that essentially constrain their potential applications at the industrial scale. Surface modification represents an effective approach to modulate the electrode microenvironment and the relative binding strength of key intermediates. Herein, it is&#160;demonstrated that the surface comodification with halides and alkali metal ions from the conversion of Bi&#8208;based halide perovskite nanocrystals is a viable strategy to boost the CO2RR performance of Bi for formate electrosynthesis. Cs3Bi2I9 nanocrystals are prepared by a hot&#8208;injection method. The as&#8208;prepared products feature well&#8208;defined hexagonal shape and uniform size distribution. When used as the precatalyst, Cs3Bi2I9 nanocrystals are converted to Cs+ and I&#8722; comodified Bi. The resultant catalyst exhibits high formate Faradaic efficiency close to 100%, and remarkable partial current density up to 44&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in an H&#8208;cell and up to 276&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell. Moreover, Cs3Bi2I9 is used as the cathode catalyst and paired with an Al anode in an Al&#8208;CO2 battery for simultaneous CO2 valorization and power generation.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Phase&#8208;Transition Entropy into Electrochemical Thermopower and the Peltier Effect</title>

A thermoresponsive polymer having a redox&#8208;active moiety, poly(N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;acrylamide ethyl)&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;n&#8208;propylviologen) (PNV), is applied to the electrolyte of thermocell and electrochemical Peltier effect. By undergoing a coil&#8211;globule phase transition, the polymer exhibits a significant entropy change, resulting in a drastic increase in the Seebeck coefficient (Se) of the thermocell.








Abstract
A thermocell generates thermopower from a temperature difference (&#916;T) between two electrodes. The converse process of thermocells is an electrochemical Peltier effect, which creates a &#916;T on the electrodes by applying an external current. The Seebeck coefficient (Se) of the electrochemical system is proportional to the entropy change of the redox reaction; therefore, a redox system having a significant entropy change is expected to increase the Se. In this study, a thermoresponsive polymer having a redox&#8208;active moiety, poly(N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;acrylamide ethyl)&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;n&#8208;propylviologen) (PNV), is used as the redox species of a thermocell. PNV2+ dication undergoes the coil&#8211;globule phase transition upon the reduction to PNV+ cation radical, and a large entropy change is introduced because water molecules are freed from the polymer chains. The Se of PNV thermocell drastically increased to +2.1&#160;mV K&#8722;1 at the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PNV. The entropy change calculated from the increment of Se agrees with the value evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry. Moreover, the electrochemical Peltier effect is observed when the device temperature is increased above the LCST. This study shows that the large entropy change associated with the coil&#8211;globule phase transition can be used in electrochemical thermal management and refrigeration technologies.

         <title>Biofilm Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Self&#8208;Assembly Nanoreactors for All&#8208;Stage Biofilm Associated Infection through Bacterial Cuproptosis&#8208;like Death and Macrophage Re&#8208;Rousing</title>

Biofilm microenvironment responsive self&#8208;assembly copper&#8208;doped polyoxometalate nanoreactors are proposed for all&#8208;stage biofilm&#8208;associated infections through bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death and macrophage re&#8208;rousing.








Abstract
Bacterial biofilm&#8208;associated infections (BAIs) are the leading cause of prosthetic implant failure. The dense biofilm structure prevents antibiotic penetration, while the highly acidic and H2O2&#8208;rich biofilm microenvironment (BME) dampens the immunological response of antimicrobial macrophages. Conventional treatments that fail to consistently suppress escaping planktonic bacteria from biofilm result in refractory recolonization, allowing BAIs to persist. Herein, a BME&#8208;responsive copper&#8208;doped polyoxometalate clusters (Cu&#8208;POM) combination with mild photothermal therapy (PTT) and macrophage immune re&#8208;rousing for BAI eradication at all stages is proposed. The self&#8208;assembly of Cu&#8208;POM in BME converts endogenous H2O2 to toxic &#183;OH through chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and generates a mild PTT effect to induce bacterial metabolic exuberance, resulting in loosening the membrane structure of the bacteria, enhancing copper transporter activity and increasing intracellular Cu&#8208;POM flux.

     alt="Biofilm Microenvironment-Responsive Self-Assembly Nanoreactors for All-Stage Biofilm Associated Infection through Bacterial Cuproptosis-like Death and Macrophage Re-Rousing"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biofilm microenvironment responsive self-assembly copper-doped polyoxometalate nanoreactors are proposed for all-stage biofilm-associated infections through bacterial cuproptosis-like death and macrophage re-rousing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial biofilm-associated infections (BAIs) are the leading cause of prosthetic implant failure. The dense biofilm structure prevents antibiotic penetration, while the highly acidic and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-rich biofilm microenvironment (BME) dampens the immunological response of antimicrobial macrophages. Conventional treatments that fail to consistently suppress escaping planktonic bacteria from biofilm result in refractory recolonization, allowing BAIs to persist. Herein, a BME-responsive copper-doped polyoxometalate clusters (Cu-POM) combination with mild photothermal therapy (PTT) and macrophage immune re-rousing for BAI eradication at all stages is proposed. The self-assembly of Cu-POM in BME converts endogenous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to toxic &#183;OH through chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and generates a mild PTT effect to induce bacterial metabolic exuberance, resulting in loosening the membrane structure of the bacteria, enhancing copper transporter activity and increasing intracellular Cu-POM flux. Metabolomics reveals that intracellular Cu-POM overload restricts the TCA cycle and peroxide accumulation, promoting bacterial cuproptosis-like death. CDT re-rousing macrophages scavenge planktonic bacteria escaping biofilm disintegration through enhanced chemotaxis and phagocytosis. Overall, BME-responsive Cu-POM promotes bacterial cuproptosis-like death via metabolic interference, while also re-rousing macrophage immune response for further planktonic bacteria elimination, resulting in all-stage BAI clearance and providing a new reference for future clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven Negative Resistance Switching of Conductive Fibers with Adjustable Sensitivity for Wearable Healthcare Monitoring Systems with Near&#8208;Zero Standby Power</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A negatively responsive switch&#8208;type (NRS) fiber strain&#8208;sensor with an extremely high negative gauge factor that can significantly increase its conductivity from insulating to conducting properties is developed. This NRS fiber strain&#8208;sensor can be used to implement an ultralow&#8208;power healthcare monitoring system that transmits biological signals by only operating with an abnormally functioning body or when strain is applied.








Abstract
Recently, one of the primary concerns in e&#8208;textile&#8208;based healthcare monitoring systems for chronic illness patients has been reducing wasted power consumption, as the system should be always&#8208;on to capture diverse biochemical and physiological characteristics. However, the general conductive fibers, a major component of the existing wearable monitoring systems, have a positive gauge&#8208;factor (GF) that increases electrical resistance when stretched, so that the systems have no choice but to consume power continuously. Herein, a twisted conductive&#8208;fiber&#8208;based negatively responsive switch&#8208;type (NRS) strain&#8208;sensor with an extremely high negative GF (resistance change ratio &#8776; 3.9&#160;&#215; 108) that can significantly increase its conductivity from insulating to conducting properties is developed. To this end, a precision cracking technology is devised, which could induce a difference in the Young's modulus of the encapsulated layer on the fiber through selective ultraviolet&#8208;irradiation treatment. Owing to this technology, the NRS strain&#8208;sensors can allow for effective regulation of the mutual contact resistance under tensile strain while maintaining superior durability for over 5000 stretching cycles. For further practical demonstrations, three healthcare monitoring systems (E&#8208;fitness pants, smart&#8208;masks, and posture correction T&#8208;shirts) with near&#8208;zero standby power are also developed, which opens up advancements in electronic textiles by expanding the utilization range of fiber strain&#8208;sensors.

         <title>A Programmable Actuator as Synthetic Earthworm</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;responsive actuator with notable deformation, rapid response, and heavy workload is prepared via a swelling&#8208;photopolymerizing method. Its bending deformation under humidity change can be programmed to mimic the burrowing activities of earthworms, opening a new avenue to expand stimuli&#8208;responsive and degradable polymer materials in the areas associated with agricultural considerations.








Abstract
Natural earthworm with the ability to loosen soils that favors sustainable agriculture has inspired worldwide interest in the design of intelligent actuators. Given the inability to carry heavy loads and uncontrolled deformation, the vast majority of actuators can only perform simple tasks by bending, contraction, or elongation. Herein, a degradable actuator with the ability to deform in desired ways is presented, which successfully mimics the burrowing activities of earthworms to loosen soils with increased soil porosity by digging, grabbing, and lifting the soil when it receives rains. Such a scarifying actuator is made of degradable cellulose acetate and uncrosslinked polyacrylamide via the swelling&#8208;photopolymerizing method. The water absorption of polyacrylamide in moisture conditions causes rapid and remarkable bending. Such mechanical bending can be controlled in specific areas of the cellulose acetate film if polyacrylamide is polymerized in a patterned way, so as to generate complicated deformations of the whole cellulose acetate. Patterning polyacrylamide within cellulose acetate is achieved based on reversible surface protection by means of pen writing, rather than the traditional masking techniques. The water&#8208;induced deformation of programmable cellulose&#8208;based actuators is well preserved in soil, which is appropriate for promoting rain diffusion as well as root breath.

         <title>Photocontrollable Elongation Actuation of Liquid Crystal Elastomer Films with Well&#8208;Defined Crease Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocontrollable elongation actuation with large strain can be achieved in flexible polydomain liquid crystal elastomers by programing the crease structures in a well&#8208;defined order to couple the weak actuation forces generated in the creases.








Abstract
Although liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) have demonstrated various applications in artificial muscles and soft robotics, their inherent flexibility and orientation&#8208;dependent forces limit their functions. For instance, LCEs can sustain a high actuation force when they contract but cannot elongate to drive loads with large displacements. In this study, it is demonstrated that photocontrollable elongation actuation with a large strain can be achieved in polydomain LCEs by programming the crease structures in a well&#8208;defined order to couple the actuation forces. Efficient photoactuation without overheating&#8208;induced damage to the materials is favored, based on the well&#8208;designed photosensitive molecular switch crosslinker via the synergy of photochemical and photothermal effects. The LCE actuator can jack up heavy loads, elongate freely, and contract back to manipulate distant objects. Theoretical analysis based on a finite element simulation of the deformation energy during the actuation process reveals a trade&#8208;off between the abilities of jacking&#8208;up and withstanding load. More importantly, this study simplifies the design of a single material with functions inherent only in other soft robotic devices based on the assembly of multiple&#160;modules, thus providing a design strategy for surpassing instinctive properties of conventional soft materials to expand the functions of soft robotics.

         <title>Shaping Synthetic Multicellular and Complex Multimaterial Tissues via Embedded Extrusion&#8208;Volumetric Printing of Microgels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergence of extrusion&#8208;based and volumetric bioprinting, with microgels as platform materials, provides the possibility to create complex structures on a cm3&#8208;scale in a fast and accurate manner. By leveraging the versatility of this platform, it is possible to introduce multi&#8208;material and multi&#8208;cellular features in user defined&#8208;architectures.








Abstract
In living tissues, cells express their functions following complex signals from their surrounding microenvironment. Capturing both hierarchical architectures at the micro&#8208; and macroscale, and anisotropic cell patterning remains a major challenge in bioprinting, and a bottleneck toward creating physiologically&#8208;relevant models. Addressing this limitation, a novel technique is introduced, termed Embedded Extrusion&#8208;Volumetric Printing (EmVP), converging extrusion&#8208;bioprinting and layer&#8208;less, ultra&#8208;fast volumetric bioprinting, allowing spatially pattern multiple inks/cell types. Light&#8208;responsive microgels are developed for the first time as bioresins (&#181;Resins) for light&#8208;based volumetric bioprinting, providing a microporous environment permissive for cell homing and self&#8208;organization. Tuning the mechanical and optical properties of gelatin&#8208;based microparticles enables their use as support bath for suspended extrusion printing, in which features containing high cell densities can be easily introduced. &#181;Resins can be sculpted within seconds with tomographic light projections into centimeter&#8208;scale, granular hydrogel&#8208;based, convoluted constructs. Interstitial microvoids enhanced differentiation of multiple stem/progenitor cells (vascular, mesenchymal, neural), otherwise not possible with conventional bulk hydrogels. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, EmVP is applied to create complex synthetic biology&#8208;inspired intercellular communication models, where adipocyte differentiation is regulated by optogenetic&#8208;engineered pancreatic cells. Overall, EmVP offers new avenues for producing regenerative grafts with biological functionality, and for developing engineered living systems and (metabolic) disease models.

         <title>Enabling Highly Efficient and Thermal&#8208;Stable Polymer Solar Cells through Semi&#8208;Alloy Acceptors Composed of a Hinge&#8208;Like Dimer: A Versatile Doping Protocol</title>

A hinge&#8208;like dimer acceptor DT19 is designed and synthesized as a special third component. This dimer&#8208;doping ternary strategy exhibits excellent generality in synergistically improving device efficiency and thermal stability of relevant host systems.








Abstract
The simultaneous improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and thermal stability is a critical scientific challenge in advancing the commercial applications of polymer solar cells. To address this challenge, a dumbbell&#8208;shaped dimeric acceptor, DT19, is successfully designed and synthesized. It is incorporated as a third component into the PM1:BTP&#8208;eC9 system. This ternary strategy demonstrates a synergistic enhancement of the PCE and thermal stability of the host binary system. In particular, the PM1:BTP&#8208;eC9:DT19 system maintains a PCE of over 90% even after heating at 120&#160;&#176;C for 200&#160;h. Additionally, the dimer&#8208;doping ternary strategy exhibits excellent generality for the other four Y&#8208;series systems and outperforms ternary systems containing alloy&#8208;like acceptors in terms of thermal stability. It is because DT19, with its hinge&#8208;like structure, can form a semi&#8208;alloy acceptor with the host acceptor, leading to strong interchain entanglement with the polymer donor, thus overcoming phase separation and excessive aggregation under thermal stress. This new type of dimeric material, which can synergistically enhance the device efficiency and thermal stability of active layers, presents promising application prospects.

         <title>Tailoring Oxygen Reduction Reaction Kinetics on Perovskite Oxides via Oxygen Vacancies for Low&#8208;Temperature and Knittable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen reduction reaction kinetics of a perovskite oxide is significantly promoted by a facile metal&#8211;vacancy strategy. The newly developed vacancy&#8208;rich porous perovskite nanofibers exhibit comparable activities to the commercial Pt/C and even surpass it under low temperature. The developed catalyst can drive knittable fibrous&#8208;type and sandwich&#8208;type zinc&#8211;air batteries under low temperature of &#8722;40 &#176;C with impressive performance.








Abstract
High kinetics oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts under low temperature are critical and highly desired for temperature&#8208;tolerant energy conversion and storage devices, but remain insufficiently investigated. Herein, oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich porous perovskite oxide (CaMnO3) nanofibers coated with reduced graphene oxide coating (V&#8208;CMO/rGO) are developed as the air electrode catalyst for low&#8208;temperature and knittable Zn&#8211;air batteries. V&#8208;CMO/rGO exhibits top&#8208;level ORR activity among perovskite oxides and shows impressive kinetics under low temperature. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the synergistic effect between metal atoms and oxygen vacancies, as well as the accelerated kinetics and enhanced electric conductivity and mass transfer over the rGO coated nanofiber 3D network contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity. The desorption of ORR intermediate is promoted by the regulated electron filling. The V&#8208;CMO/rGO drives knittable and flexible Zn&#8211;air batteries under a low temperature of &#8722;40 &#176;C with high peak power density of 56 mW cm&#8722;2 and long cycle life of over 80 h. This study provides insight of kinetically active catalyst and facilitates the ZABs application in harsh environment.

         <title>Modulating Zinc Metal Reversibility by Confined Antifluctuator Film for Durable and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefitting from the designed Zn anode antifluctuator that well integrates conductivity, buffering, mechanical strength, and anti&#8208;corrosion characteristics, the symmetric and full cell both deliver super&#8208;high cycling performance and enable the realization of the integration with electrochemical neuromorphic inorganic device as artificial neural networks, and the integrated device achieves excellent linearity and handwritten digit recognition rate.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn ion batteries are promising systems due to their intrinsic safety, low cost, and non&#8208;toxicity, and the Zn corrosion and dendrite growth will cause the poor reversibility of Zn anode. Herein, the porous Zn@C solid, hollow, and yolk&#8211;shell microsphere films are developed as Zn anode antifluctuator (ZAAF). The prepared yolk&#8211;shell microspheres (Zn@C yolk&#8211;shell microsphere [ZCYSM]) film with superior buffering can effectively restrict the deposition of Zn metal in its interior and inhibit the volume expansion during plating/stripping process, thus modulating the Zn2+ flux and enabling stable Zn cycling. As a proof of concept, the ZCYSM@Zn symmetric cells achieve the excellent cyclic stability over 4000&#160;h and cumulative plated capacity of 4&#160;Ah cm&#8722;2&#160;at a high current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Concomitantly, the suppressed corrosion reactions and dendrite&#8208;free ZAAF significantly improve the durability of full cells (coupled to CaV6O16&#183;3H2O). Additionally, durable pouch cell and electrochemical neuromorphic inorganic device (ENIDe) are integrated to simulate neural network, providing a strategy for extreme interconnectivity comparable to the human brain.

         <dc:description>
To investigate the bifunctional performance of hetero&#8208;anionic structure for oxygen electrocatalysis, CuCo2O4&#8208;xSx/NC&#8208;2 catalysts are constructed and afford excellent catalytic performance in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The superior performance of the CuCo2O4&#8208;xSx/NC&#8208;2 catalysts is attributed to the unique S modulation of the main body electronic structure, Co&#63743;S bond provides fast electron transport channel, thus optimizing the adsorption degree of active site Co to the reaction intermediates.








Abstract
The electronic structure of transition metal complexes can be modulated by replacing partial ion of complexes to obtain tuned intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity. However, the anion&#8208;modulated transition metal complexes ORR activity of is still unsatisfactory, and the construction of hetero&#8208;anionic structure remains challenging. Herein, an atomic doping strategy is presented to prepare the CuCo2O4&#8208;xSx/NC&#8208;2 (CCSO/NC&#8208;2) as electrocatalysts, the structrual characterization results favorably demonstrate the partial substitution of S atoms for O in CCSO/NC&#8208;2, which shows excellent catalytic performance and durability for OER and ORR in 0.1&#160;m KOH. In addition, the catalyst assembled Zinc&#8211;air battery with an open circuit potential of 1.43&#160;V maintains performance after 300&#160;h of cyclic stability. Theoretical calculations and differential charges illustrate that S doping optimizes the reaction kinetics and promotes electron redistribution. The superior performance of CCSO/NC&#8208;2 catalysis is mainly due to its unique S modulation of the electronic structure of the main body. The introduction of S promotes Co&#63743;O covalency and constructs a fast electron transport channel, thus optimizing the adsorption degree of active site Co to the reaction intermediates.

Bandgap Modulation
In article number 2303198, Weida Hu, Zhuhua Zhang, Haomin Wang, and co&#8208;workers report effective bandgap modulation in zigzag&#8208;oriented hexagonal boron nitride nanoribbons (zBNNRs) via water adsorption. The water layer adsorbed along the edges is believed to create a huge transverse potential and then greatly reduces the bandgap. The conductance of &#8776;8 nm&#8208;wide zBNNRs can be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via gating at room temperature.

Multifunctional Mechanical Metamaterials
The accordion can deliver a diverse range of melodies contingent upon the sequence of keys and bellows movement activated by the performer. In article number 2301109, Lei Wu and Damiano Pasini introduce a multifunctional mechanical metamaterial whose building block resembles the individual keys and bellows of an accordion. By activating the high&#8208;energy stable state of selected building blocks, the metamaterial can exhibit reprogrammable mechanical instabilities that can be engaged for accomplishing logical operations and tunable mechanical hysteresis in multifunctional devices.

Bioresins
Light&#8208;responsive microgels enable combination of embedded extrusion and volumetric bioprinting. In article number 2301673, Riccardo Levato and co&#8208;workers report the development of granular bioresins as a suspension bath for printing multiple cell types. Within seconds, the bath is shaped into complex 3D constructs with micro&#8208;to&#8208;macro, multiscale porosity, upon tomographic light exposure, building advanced models of cell&#8211;cell communication relevant for pancreatic metabolism.

Oxygen Electrocatalysis
To investigate the bifunctional performance of heterogeneous anionic structures for oxygen electrocatalysis, CuCo2O4&#8722;xSx/NC&#8208;2 catalysts, which exhibit excellent catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR), are designed by Ting Ouyang, Zhao&#8208;Qing Liu, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2303488. The superior catalytic performance of CuCo2O4&#8722;xSx/NC&#8208;2 is attributed to the unique S modulation of the main body electronic structure, Co&#8211;S bonds&#8208;constructed fast electron&#8208;transport channels, thus optimizing the adsorption degree of active&#8208;site Co to the reaction intermediates.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustainability suggests that the resources used for lithium-ion batteries are finite, and should be used conservatively and wisely. In article &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202203218"&gt;2203218&lt;/a&gt;, Zhongwei Chen and co-workers outline and evaluate current direct cathode regeneration methods for industrialized battery recycling, which is anticipated as a flexible guide for closed-loop lithium-ion battery recycling with the aims of high efficiency, high safety, high environmental benefit, high economic return, and high sustainability.

Topologically Protected Structures
In article number 2303077, S. Joon Kwon, Dong Ki Yoon, and co&#8208;workers present a cutting&#8208;edge security system based on liquid crystal structures. These structures exhibit highly unpredictable pathways akin to the randomness observed in planar spin glasses. The cover image suggests that the randomness of cholesteric fingers and the erratic movements of people running freely in a maze are inherently unpredictable.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Materials for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the latest achievements of liquid crystal materials applied in biomedical fields are summarized. The basic concepts and components of liquid crystals and the functional materials derived from them are introduced. After that, their ongoing and foreseeable biomedical applications are discussed. 








Abstract
Liquid crystal is a state of matter being intermediate between solid and liquid. Liquid crystal materials exhibit both orientational order and fluidity. While liquid crystals have long been highly recognized in the display industry, in recent decades, liquid crystals provide new opportunities into the cross&#8208;field of material science and biomedicine due to their biocompatibility, multifunctionality, and responsiveness. In this review, the latest achievements of liquid crystal materials applied in biomedical fields are summarized. The start is made by introducing the basic concepts of liquid crystals, and then shifting to the components of liquid crystals as well as functional materials derived therefrom. After that, the ongoing and foreseeable applications of liquid crystal materials in the biomedical field with emphasis put on several cutting&#8208;edge aspects, including drug delivery, bioimaging, tissue engineering, implantable devices, biosensing, and wearable devices are discussed. It is hoped that this review will stimulate ingenious ideas for the future generation of liquid crystal&#8208;based drug development, artificial implants, disease diagnosis, health status monitoring, and beyond.

         <title>Enabling Future Closed&#8208;Loop Recycling of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Direct Cathode Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct cathode regeneration methods are summarized to highlight the technical challenges, current status, supply chain, carbon footprints, and possible solutions for closed&#8208;loop battery recycling. The environmental, economic, and political benefits of the direct cathode regeneration methods are also considered, and a reference recycling route with available automated recycling technology is proposed and minimizes the costs.








Abstract
The rapid proliferation of electric vehicles equipped with lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) presents serious waste management challenges and environmental hazards for recyclers after scrap. Closed&#8208;loop recycling contributes to the sustainable development of batteries and plays an important role in mitigating raw material shortages and supply chain risks. Herein, current direct cathode regeneration methods for industrialized recycling are outlined and evaluated. Different regeneration methods for spent cathode materials are summarized, which provide a new perspective for realizing closed&#8208;loop recycling of LIBs. A reference recycling route for retrofitting existing cathode production lines is proposed and minimizes the costs. In addition to promoting the industrialization of direct cathode recycling, the environmental, economic, and political benefits of battery recycling are also highlighted.

         <title>Does Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Electrolyte Subdue Issues of Zn Batteries?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to wide electrochemical stability window, water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes (WISEs) are attracting considerable interest. WISEs display distinctive physical and electrochemical properties compared to conventional electrolyte that makes them a promising electrolyte to be used in Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZnBs). This review provides overview about issues in ZnBs, a historical, basic, thermodynamic, and kinetic overview about WISEs and finally discusses their use in ZnBs.









Abstract
Zn&#8208;metal batteries (ZnBs) are safe and sustainable because of their operability in aqueous electrolytes, abundance of Zn, and recyclability. However, the thermodynamic instability of Zn metal in aqueous electrolytes is a major bottleneck for its commercialization. As such, Zn deposition (Zn2+ &#8594; Zn(s)) is continuously accompanied by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (2H+ &#8594; H2) and dendritic growth that further accentuate the HER. Consequently, the local pH around the Zn electrode increases and promotes the formation of inactive and/or poorly conductive Zn passivation species (Zn + 2H2O &#8594; Zn(OH)2 + H2) on the Zn. This aggravates the consumption of Zn and electrolyte and degrades the performance of ZnB. To propel HER beyond its thermodynamic potential (0&#160;V vs standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) at pH 0), the concept of water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8208;electrolyte (WISE) has been employed in ZnBs. Since the publication of the first article on WISE for ZnB in 2016, this research area has progressed continuously. Here, an overview and discussion on this promising research direction for accelerating the maturity of ZnBs is provided. The review briefly describes the current issues with conventional aqueous electrolyte in ZnBs, including a historic overview and basic understanding of WISE. Furthermore, the application scenarios of WISE in ZnBs are detailed, with the description of various key mechanisms (e.g., side reactions, Zn electrodeposition, anions or cations intercalation in metal oxide or graphite, and ion transport at low temperature).

         <title>Material Design Strategies for Recovery of Critical Resources from Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recovering critical resources from surface water, groundwater, and wastewater sources can offer a sustainable path toward securing their supply chains. This work reviews the materials that are developed for membranes, sorbents, catalysts, electrodes, and interfacial solar steam generators that demonstrate promise for applications in critical resource recovery.








Abstract
Population growth, urbanization, and decarbonization efforts are collectively straining the supply of limited resources that are necessary to produce batteries, electronics, chemicals, fertilizers, and other important products. Securing the supply chains of these critical resources via the development of separation technologies for their recovery represents a major global challenge to ensure stability and security. Surface water, groundwater, and wastewater are emerging as potential new sources to bolster these supply chains. Recently, a variety of material&#8208;based technologies have been developed and employed for separations and resource recovery in water. Judicious selection and design of these materials to tune their properties for targeting specific solutes is central to realizing the potential of water as a source for critical resources. Here, the materials that are developed for membranes, sorbents, catalysts, electrodes, and interfacial solar steam generators that demonstrate promise for applications in critical resource recovery are reviewed. In addition, a critical perspective is offered on the grand challenges and key research directions that need to be addressed to improve their practical viability.

         <dc:description>
Screen&#8208;printed flexible humidity sensors based on hexagonal tungsten oxide nanowires exhibit high sensitivity, good repeatability, and fast response in a wide relative humidity range, showing great potential in respiration rate monitoring, medicine packaging state monitoring, and non&#8208;contact measurements. Moreover, the sensitivity of the humidity sensors can be adjusted by altering the manufacturing parameters of the sensing layer and interdigital electrode.








Abstract
The utilization of printing techniques for the development of high&#8208;performance humidity sensors holds immense significance for various applications in the fields of the Internet of Things, agriculture, human healthcare, and storage environments. However, the long response time and low sensitivity of current printed humidity sensors limit their practical applications. Herein, a series of high&#8208;sensing&#8208;performance flexible resistive&#8208;type humidity sensors is fabricated by the screen&#8208;printing method, and hexagonal tungsten oxide (h&#8208;WO3) is employed as the humidity&#8208;sensing material due to its low cost, strong chemical adsorption ability, and excellent humidity&#8208;sensing ability. The as&#8208;prepared printed sensors exhibit high sensitivity, good repeatability, outstanding flexibility, low hysteresis, and fast response (1.5&#160;s) in a wide relative humidity (RH) range (11&#8211;95%&#160;RH). Furthermore, the sensitivity of humidity sensors can be easily adjusted by altering the manufacturing parameters of the sensing layer and interdigital electrode to meet the diverse requirements of specific applications. The printed flexible humidity sensors possess immense potential in various applications, including wearable devices, non&#8208;contact measurements, and packaging opening state monitoring.

         <title>High&#8208;stroke, High&#8208;Output&#8208;Force, Fabric&#8208;Lattice Artificial Muscles for Soft Robots</title>

Abstract
Artificial muscles, providing safe and close interaction between humans and machines, are essential in soft robotics. However, their insufficient deformation, output force, or configurability usually limits their applications. Herein, we present a class of lightweight fabric&#8208;lattice artificial muscles (FAMs) that are pneumatically actuated with large contraction ratios (up to 87.5%) and considerable output forces (up to a load of 20&#160;kg, force&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio of over 250). Our developed FAMs consist of a group of active air chambers that are zigzag connected into a lattice through passive connecting layers. The geometry of these fabric components is programmable to convert the in&#8208;plane lattice of FAMs into out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configurations (e.g., arched and cylindrical) capable of linear/radial contraction. We further demonstrate that our FAMs can be configured for various soft robotic applications, including the powerful robotic elbow with large motion range and high load capability, the well&#8208;fitting assistive shoulder exosuit that can reduce muscle activity during abduction, and the adaptive soft gripper that can grasp irregular objects. These results show the unique features and broad potential of our FAMs for high&#8208;performance soft robots.

         <title>Bacteria&#8208;based Backpacks to Enhance Adoptive Macrophage Transfer against Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Adoptive cell therapy has emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment. However, the transfer of macrophages exhibits limited efficacy against solid tumors due to the dynamic cellular phenotypic shift from anti&#8208;tumor to pro&#8208;tumor states within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, a strategy of attaching bacteria to macrophages (M&#248;@bac) is reported that endows adoptively infused macrophages with durable stimulation by leveraging the intrinsic immunogenicity of bacteria. These attached bacteria, referred to as backpacks, are encapsulated with adhesive nanocoatings and can sustainably control the cellular phenotypes in vivo. Moreover, M&#248;@bac could repolarize endogenous tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), leading to a more robust immune response and thus reducing the tumor progression in a murine 4T1 cancer model without any side effects. This study utilizing bacteria as cellular backpacks opens a new avenue for the development of cell therapies.

         <title>Realizing Unassisted Photo&#8208;charging of Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries by Anisotropic Charge Separation in Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solar rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery is a promising approach for capturing and storing intermittent solar energy through photoelectrochemical reactions. However, unassisted photo&#8208;charging of zinc&#8208;air batteries is challenging due to suboptimal carrier accumulation on photoelectrodes, resulting in sluggish reaction kinetics. Here, we achieved unassisted photo&#8208;charging of a zinc&#8208;air battery by investigating anisotropic photogenerated charge separation on a series of representative semiconductors (ZnIn2S4, TiO2 and In2O3), among which the exceptional anisotropic charge separation on a ZnIn2S4 photoelectrode was revealed based on anisotropic charge diffusion capabilities. The charge separation is facet&#8208;dependent, which was observed using Kelvin probe force microscopy, verifying a cause&#8208;and&#8208;effect relationship between the photo&#8208;charge accumulation on photoelectrodes and their photo&#8208;charging performance in zinc&#8208;air batteries. This work achieves an unassisted photo&#8208;charging current density of 1.9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion efficiency of 1.45%, highlighting the importance of anisotropic semiconductors for unassisted photo&#8208;charging of zinc&#8208;air batteries via efficient photogenerated charge separation.

However, unassisted photo-charging of zinc-air batteries is challenging due to suboptimal carrier accumulation on photoelectrodes, resulting in sluggish reaction kinetics.

         <title>Breaking The Permeance&#8208;Selectivity Tradeoff for Post&#8208;Combustion Carbon Capture: A Bio&#8208;Inspired Strategy to Form Ultrathin Hollow Fiber Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thin film composite (TFC) hollow fiber membranes with ultrathin selective layer are desirable to maximize the gas permeance for practical applications. Herein we propose a bio&#8208;inspired strategy to fabricate sub&#8208;100&#8208;nm membranes via a tree&#8208;mimicking polymer network, term as PDMS&#8208;PEG, with amphipathic components featuring multi&#8208;functionalities. The hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) brushes act as the roots that can strongly cling to the gutter layer, the PDMS crosslinkers function as the xylems to enable fast gas transport, and the hydrophilic ethylene&#8208;oxide moieties (brushes and mobile molecules) resemble tree leaves that selectively attract CO2 molecules. As a result, a &#8764; 27&#160;nm&#8208;thick PDMS&#8208;PEG selective layer can be attached onto the hollow fiber supported PDMS gutter layer through simple dip&#8208;coating method without any modification. Furthermore, a CO2 permeance of &#8764; 2700 GPU and a CO2/N2 selectivity of &#8764; 21 that is beyond the permeance&#8208;selectivity upper bound for hollow fiber membranes is achieved. Our bio&#8208;inspired concept can potentially open the possibility of scalable hollow fiber membranes production for commercial applications in post&#8208;combustion carbon capture and beyond.

         <title>Highly Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes based on Self&#8208;Assembled Colloidal Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nanocrystal&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (Nc&#8208;LEDs) have immense potential for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;definition displays and lighting applications. They offer numerous advantages, such as low cost, high luminous efficiency, narrow emission, and long lifetime. However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of Nc&#8208;LEDs, typically employing isotropic nanocrystals, has been limited by the out&#8208;coupling factor. Here we demonstrate efficient, bright, and long lifetime red Nc&#8208;LEDs based on anisotropic nanocrystals of colloidal quantum wells (CQWs). Through modification of the substrate's surface properties and control of the interactions among CQWs, we successfully spin&#8208;coated a self&#8208;assembled layer with an exceptionally high distribution of in&#8208;plane transitions dipole moment (TDM) of 95%, resulting in an out&#8208;coupling factor of 37%. Our devices exhibit a remarkable peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.9%, accompanied by a maximum brightness of 55,754&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a long operational lifetime (T95@100&#160;cd m&#8722;2) over 15,000&#160;h. These achievements represent a significant advancement compared to previous studies on Nc&#8208;LEDs incorporating anisotropic nanocrystals. We expect our work to provide a general self&#8208;assembly strategy for enhancing the light extraction efficiency of Nc&#8208;LEDs based on anisotropic nanocrystals.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanocrystal-based light-emitting diodes (Nc-LEDs) have immense potential for next-generation high-definition displays and lighting applications. They offer numerous advantages, such as low cost, high luminous efficiency, narrow emission, and long lifetime. However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of Nc-LEDs, typically employing isotropic nanocrystals, has been limited by the out-coupling factor. Here we demonstrate efficient, bright, and long lifetime red Nc-LEDs based on anisotropic nanocrystals of colloidal quantum wells (CQWs). Through modification of the substrate's surface properties and control of the interactions among CQWs, we successfully spin-coated a self-assembled layer with an exceptionally high distribution of in-plane transitions dipole moment (TDM) of 95%, resulting in an out-coupling factor of 37%. Our devices exhibit a remarkable peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.9%, accompanied by a maximum brightness of 55,754&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a long operational lifetime (T&lt;sub&gt;95&lt;/sub&gt;@100&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) over 15,000&#160;h. These achievements represent a significant advancement compared to previous studies on Nc-LEDs incorporating anisotropic nanocrystals. We expect our work to provide a general self-assembly strategy for enhancing the light extraction efficiency of Nc-LEDs based on anisotropic nanocrystals.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is the key to improve the electrochemical performance of lithium metal batteries. However, there are still many puzzles about SEI film that have not been well explained, due to the complexity of electrochemical reactions involving in SEI formation and the absence of direct observation methods for SEI. Here we realize the direct observation of SEI by skillfully designed fluorescent tracers acting as an SEI film&#8208;forming additive for electrolytes. These fluorescent tracers have three important moieties: an olefin group for polymerization on anode surface so as to participate in SEI film formation during charge/discharge cycles, a polar group for Li&#8208;ion conduction, and an AIEgen for fluorescent tracing. Therefore, the tracers participate in SEI film&#8208;forming and result in a shining SEI film. This shining SEI film with intrinsic fluorescence signal allows direct observation and quantification on the distribution, relative abundance, and macro morphology of SEI. These fluorescent tracers can also reveal the SEI formation&#8208;growth&#8208;destruction regularity during charge/discharge cycles. Several summarized typical macro morphologies and evolution stages of SEI would enrich our knowledge and understanding of SEI, and help us to gain insight into the interaction between electrolyte and anode, electrochemical performance and cycle life of batteries.

         <title>Valence Oscillation of Ru Active Sites for Efficient and Robust Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The continuous oxidation and leachability of active sites in Ru&#8208;based catalysts hinder practical application in proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE). Herein, robust inter&#8208;doped tungsten&#8208;ruthenium oxide heterostructures [(Ru&#8208;W)Ox] fabricated by sequential rapid oxidation and metal thermomigration processes are proposed to enhance the activity and stability of acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The introduction of high&#8208;valent W species induces the valence oscillation of the Ru sites during OER, facilitating the cyclic transition of the active metal oxidation states and maintaining the continuous operation of the active sites. The preferential oxidation of W species and electronic gain of Ru sites in the inter&#8208;doped heterostructure significantly stabilize RuOx on WOx substrates beyond the Pourbaix stability limit of bare RuO2. Furthermore, the asymmetric Ru&#8208;O&#8208;W active units are generated around the heterostructure interface to adsorb the oxygen intermediates synergistically, enhancing the intrinsic OER activity. Consequently, the inter&#8208;doped (Ru&#8208;W)Ox heterostructures not only demonstrate an overpotential of 170&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and excellent stability of 300&#160;h in acidic electrolytes but also exhibit the potential for practical applications, as evidenced by the stable operation at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2 for 300&#160;h in PEMWE.

         <title>Dual Functional MXene&#8208;Based Bioanode for Wearable Self&#8208;Charging Biosupercapacitor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
As a reliable energy&#8208;supply platform for wearable electronics, biosupercapacitors combine the characteristics of biofuel cells and supercapacitors to harvest and store the energy from human's sweat. However, the bulky preparation process and deep embedding of enzyme active sites in bioelectrodes usually limit the energy harvesting process, retarding the practical power&#8208;supply sceneries especially during the complicated in&#8208;vivo motion. Herein, we design the MXene/single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube/lactate oxidase hierarchical structure as the dual&#8208;functional bioanode, which can not only provide the superior three&#8208;dimensional catalytic microenvironment for enzyme accommodation to harvest energy from sweat, but also offer the sufficient capacitance to store energy via the electrical double&#8208;layer capacitor. The wearable biosupercapacitor is fabricated to &#8220;island&#8208;bridge&#8221; structure with the composite bioanode, active carbon/Pt cathode, polyacrylamide hydrogel substrate and liquid metal conductor. In vivo test, the device exhibits an open circuit voltage of 0.48&#160;V and the high power density of 220.9 &#956;W cm&#8722;2 at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The compact conformal adhesion with skin is successfully maintained under stretching/bending conditions. After repeatedly stretching the devices, there is no significant power attenuation in pulsed output. The unique bioelectrode structure and attractive energy harvesting/storing properties demonstrate the promising potential of this biosupercapacitor as micro self&#8208;powered platform of wearable electronics.

         <title>MOFs for Ultrahigh Efficiency Pulsed Laser Micropropulsion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conventional propellant materials, such as polymers and single metal elements, have long been investigated for their potential in pulsed laser micropropulsion (LMP) technology. However, achieving superior LMP efficiency through physical mixing of these materials remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a paradigm shift by introducing porous crystalline polymers, known as Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs), as novel propellants in pulsed LMP. MOFs are composed of metal cations and organic ligands that form ordered structures through coordination, eliminating the problem of local hot zones arising from uneven physical mixing encountered in LMP. In direct comparison to conventional polymers and single element targets, MOFs exhibit substantially higher LMP efficiency. By precisely tailoring the metal atom fraction within MOFs, an extraordinary ultrahigh efficiency of 51.15% is achieved in pulsed LMP, surpassing the performance of similar materials previously reported in the literature. This pioneering application of MOFs not only revolutionizes the field of laser micropropulsion but also opens up new frontiers for MOF utilization in various energy applications.

         <title>High&#8208;efficiency Area&#8208;Emissive White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistor for Full&#8208;Color Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The construction of high&#8208;performance white organic light&#8208;emitting transistor (OLET) with uniform area emission is crucial for smart display technologies, but remains great challenging. Herein, we demonstrate high&#8208;efficiency uniform area&#8208;emissive OLETs based on a unique lateral&#8208;integrated device configuration which incorporates efficient energy transfer of phosphorescent and fluorescent guests, enabling color&#8208;tunable and white emission. Through precisely regulating the energy transfer between host and guests, high external quantum efficiency of 13.9% for white&#8208;emission OLETs is achieved due to the improved high exciton utilization and light outcoupling efficiency, and prevented exciton&#8208;charge annihilation and electrode photon losses, which is the highest value reported so far for OLETs. Moreover, good loop stability is also achieved, along with effective gate tunability and ultralow driving voltage of below 5&#160;V. Finally, a 4 &#215; 6 white&#8208;emission OLET array for full&#8208;color display is demonstrated for the first time, suggesting its great potential applications for advanced display technologies.

         <title>Intrafibrillar Crosslinking Enables Decoupling of Mechanical Properties and Structure of a Composite Fibrous Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The fibrous network of an extracellular matrix (ECM) possesses mechanical properties that convey critical biological functions in cell mechanotransduction. Engineered fibrous hydrogels show promise in emulating key aspects of ECM structure and functions, however, varying hydrogel mechanics without changing its architecture remains a challenge. &#160;We developed a composite fibrous hydrogel to vary gel stiffness without affecting structure by controlling intrafibrillar crosslinking. The hydrogel was formed from aldehyde&#8208;modified cellulose nanocrystals and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) that provided the capability of intrafibrillar photocrosslinking. By varying the degree of gelatin functionalization with methacryloyl groups and/or photoirradiation time, &#160;we changed the hydrogel's elastic modulus by more than an order of magnitude, while preserving the fiber diameter and pore size. The hydrogel was used to seed primary mouse lung fibroblasts and test the role of ECM stiffness on fibroblast contraction and activation. Increasing hydrogel stiffness by stronger intrafibrillar crosslinking resulted in enhanced fibroblast activation and increased fibroblast contraction force, yet at reduced contraction speed. The developed approach enables the fabrication of biomimetic hydrogels with decoupled structural and mechanical properties, facilitating studies of the influence of tissue&#8208;like ECM mechanics on tissue development and disease progression.

         <title>Highly Stable and Efficient Formamidinium&#8208;Based 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cell via Lattice Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Formamidinium&#8208;based (FA) 2D perovskites have emerged as highly promising candidates in solar cells. However, the insertion of 2D spacer cations into the perovskite lattice concomitantly introduces micro&#8208;strain and unfavorable orientations that hinder efficiency and stability. In this study, by finely tuning the FA&#8208;based 2D perovskite lattice through spacer cation engineering, we achieved a stable lattice structure with balanced distortion, micro&#8208;strain relaxation, and reduced carrier&#8208;lattice interactions. These advancements effectively stabilize the inherently soft lattice against light and thermal aging stress, particularly extreme temperature changes. To reduce the photocurrent loss induced by undesired crystal texture, we further employed a polarity&#8208;matched molecular&#8208;type selenourea (SENA) additive to modulate the crystallization kinetics. The introduction of the SENA significantly inhibits the disordered crystallization induced by spacer cations and drives the templated growth of the quantum well structure with a vertical orientation. This controlled crystallization process effectively reduces crystal defects and enhances charge separation. Ultimately, the optimized FA&#8208;based perovskite photovoltaic devices achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.03% (certified steady&#8208;state efficiency of 19.30%), setting a new record for low&#8208;n 2D perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the devices exhibited less than 1% efficiency degradation after operating at maximum power point for 1000 hours and maintained 92.3% and 91.1% of the initial efficiency after aging at 85&#176;C for 720 hours and 50 cycles of cold&#8208;warm shock, respectively.

         <title>A Bioinspired Injectable, Adhesive, and Self&#8208;Healing Hydrogel with Dual Hybrid Network for Neural Regeneration after Spinal Cord Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrogel with a double&#8208;network architecture is created from dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)&#8208;grafted chitosan and a designer self&#8208;assembly peptide. Its strong tissue adhesion facilitates excellent integration in the host and demonstrates self&#8208;healing feature. The novel hydrogel demonstrates a strong capability of promoting exuberant neural regeneration after spinal cord injury and consequently promotes sensory and motor functions, particularly protecting the urinary system.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based regenerated scaffolds show promise as a platform for neural regeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI). Nevertheless, the persistent problem of poor mechanical strength and limited integration with the host tissue still exists. In this study, a bioinspired hydrogel with highly sophisticated features for neural regeneration after SCI is developed. The hydrogel is composed of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)&#8208;grafted chitosan and a designer peptide, offering a unique set of qualities such as being injectable, having self&#8208;healing abilities, and adhering to tissues. Compared to conventional hydrogels, this hydrogel ensures a significant promotion of immune response modulation and axon regrowth while featuring synapse formation of various neurotransmitters and myelin regeneration. Subsequently, functional recoveries are enhanced, including motor function, sensory function, and particularly bladder defect repair. These positive findings demonstrate that the hydrogel has great potential as a strategy for repairing SCI. Moreover, the versatility of this strategy goes beyond neural regeneration and holds promise for tissue regeneration in other contexts. Overall, this proposed hydrogel represents an innovative and multifaceted tool for engineering structures in the biomedical field.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Balanced Intra&#8208; and Interchain Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Polymers: Beyond 30% External Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer&#8208;featured non&#8208;conjugated polymers with largely enhanced thermally activated delayed fluorescence performance are demonstrated, in which a secondary phosphine oxide acceptor is introduced to balance intra&#8208; and interchain charge transfer for radiation facilitation and non&#8208;radiation suppression, resulting in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoluminescence and electroluminescence quantum efficiencies beyond 95% and 30%, respectively.








Abstract
Through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) is crucial for developing highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence polymers. The balance of intra&#8208; and interchain TSCT can markedly improve performance, but it is still a big challenge. In this work, an effective strategy for &#8220;intra&#8208; and interchain TSCT balance&#8221; is demonstrated by way of a series of non&#8208;conjugated copolymers containing a 9,9&#8208;dimethylacridine donor and triazine&#8208;phosphine oxide (PO)&#8208;based acceptors. Steady&#8208;state and transient emission spectra indicate that compared to the corresponding blends, the copolymers can indeed achieve balanced intra&#8208; and interchain TSCT by accurately optimizing the inductive and steric effects of the acceptors. The DPOT acceptor with the strongest electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and the second bigger steric hindrance endows its copolymers with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoluminescence and electroluminescence quantum efficiencies beyond 95% and 32%, respectively. This demonstrates that, compared to other congeners, the synergistic inductive and steric effects effectively enhance TSCT in DPOT&#8208;based copolymers for radiation, and suppress singlet and triplet quenching. The record&#8208;high efficiencies of its devices make this kind of copolymers hold the potential for low&#8208;cost, large&#8208;scale, and high&#8208;efficiency applications.

         <title>Photothermal&#8211;Magnetic Synergistic Effects in an Electrocatalyst for Efficient Water Splitting under Optical&#8211;Magnetic Fields</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the corresponding optical and magnetic design of Co3O4/CoFe2O4@NF, its resistance is reduced from 16 &#937; to 7&#160;&#937; under an optical&#8211;magnetic field (AM 1.5G, 100&#160;mT). Furthermore, spin polarization occurs inducing the parallel alignment of oxygen atoms and the formation of paramagnetic triplet oxygen, reducing the reaction energy barrier, and improving the kinetics of the OER reaction. The overpotential required to reach a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in the optical&#8211;magnetic field is only 172.4&#160;mV, achieving a &#916;&#951; of 76.51&#160;mV.








Abstract
The slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits water splitting, and external fields can help improve it. However, the effect of a single external field on the OER is limited and unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the mechanism by which external fields improve the OER is unclear, particularly in the presence of multiple fields. Herein, a strategy is proposed for enhancing the OER activity of a catalyst using the combined effect of an optical&#8211;magnetic field, and the mechanism of catalytic activity enhancement is studied. Under the optical&#8211;magnetic field, Co3O4 reduces the resistance by increasing the catalyst temperature. Meanwhile, CoFe2O4 further reduces the resistance via the negative magnetoresistance effect, thus decreasing the resistance from 16 to 7.0&#160;&#937;. Additionally, CoFe2O4 acts as a spin polarizer, and electron polarization results in a parallel arrangement of oxygen atoms, which increases the kinetics of the OER under the magnetic field. Benefiting from the optical and magnetic response design, Co3O4/CoFe2O4@Ni foam requires an overpotential of 172.4&#160;mV to reach a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 under an optical&#8211;magnetic field, which is significantly higher than those of recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Integration of Ultrabright OLEDs on a Miniaturized Needle&#8208;Shaped CMOS Backplane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;brightness organic LED arrays are produced by direct vacuum deposition of the organic materials onto complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) backplanes produced in a commercial chip foundry. The composition of the foundry&#8208;provided aluminum anodes is analyzed by scanning transmission electron microscopy and their surface is pre&#8208;conditioned for optimal electrical contact by plasma treatment.








Abstract
Direct deposition of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) on silicon&#8208;based complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) chips has enabled self&#8208;emissive microdisplays with high resolution and fill&#8208;factor. Emerging applications of OLEDs in augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) displays and in biomedical applications, e.g., as brain implants for cell&#8208;specific light delivery in optogenetics, require light intensities orders of magnitude above those found in traditional displays. Further requirements often include a microscopic device footprint, a specific shape and ultrastable passivation, e.g., to ensure biocompatibility and minimal invasiveness of OLED&#8208;based implants. In this work, up to 1024 ultrabright, microscopic OLEDs are deposited directly on needle&#8208;shaped CMOS chips. Transmission electron microscopy and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy are performed on the foundry&#8208;provided aluminum contact pads of the CMOS chips to guide a systematic optimization of the contacts. Plasma treatment and implementation of silver interlayers lead to ohmic contact conditions and thus facilitate direct vacuum deposition of orange&#8208; and blue&#8208;emitting OLED stacks leading to micrometer&#8208;sized pixels on the chips. The electronics in each needle allow each pixel to switch individually. The OLED pixels generate a mean optical power density of 0.25&#160;mW&#160;mm&#8722;2, corresponding to &gt;40&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, well above the requirement for daylight AR applications and optogenetic single&#8208;unit activation in the brain.

         <title>Exploring the Synergies of Single&#8208;Molecule Fluorescence and 2D Materials Coupled by DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating single&#8208;molecule (SM) fluorescence methods with 2D materials by using DNA and related nanostructures as molecular anchors provides significant benefits for both fields: deepening knowledge about the materials while adding information to SM fluorescence experiments. This Perspective delves into the rich interplay, highlights new opportunities for further synergies, and identifies challenges in this cross&#8208;disciplinary venture.








Abstract
The world of 2D materials is steadily growing, with numerous researchers attempting to discover, elucidate, and exploit their properties. Approaches relying on the detection of single fluorescent molecules offer a set of advantages, for instance, high sensitivity and specificity, that allow the drawing of conclusions with unprecedented precision. Herein, it is argued how the study of 2D materials benefits from fluorescence&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule modalities, and vice versa. A special focus is placed on DNA, serving as a versatile adaptor when anchoring single dye molecules to 2D materials. The existing literature on the fruitful combination of the two fields is reviewed, and an outlook on the additional synergies that can be created between them provided.

         <title>In Situ Engineering of Inorganic&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphases via Anion Choice Enables Stable, Lithium Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The discovery of liquid battery electrolytes that facilitate the formation of stable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) to mitigate dendrite formation is imperative to enable lithium anodes in next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;dense batteries. Compared to traditional electrolyte solvents, tetrahydrofuran (THF)&#8208;based electrolyte systems have demonstrated great success in enabling high&#8208;stability lithium anodes by encouraging the decomposition of anions (instead of organic solvent) and thus generating inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs. Herein, by employing a variety of different lithium salts (i.e., LiPF6, LiTFSI, LiFSI, and LiDFOB),&#160;we&#160;demonstrate that electrolyte anions modulate the inorganic composition and resulting properties of the SEI. Through novel analytical ToF&#8208;SIMS methods, such as hierarchical clustering of depth profiles and compositional analysis using integrated yields,&#160;we&#160;examine the chemical composition and morphology of the SEIs generated from each electrolyte system. Notably, the LiDFOB electrolyte provides an exceptionally stable system to enable lithium anodes, delivering &gt; 1500 cycles at a current density of 0.5 mAh g&#8722;1 and a capacity of 0.5 mAh g&#8722;1 in symmetrical cells. Furthermore, Li//LFP cells using this electrolyte demonstrate high&#8208;rate, reversible lithium storage, supplying 139 mAh g(LFP)&#8722;1 at C/2 (&#8764; 0.991 mAh cm&#8722;2, @ 0.61 mA cm&#8722;2) with 87.5% capacity retention over 300 cycles (average Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.86%).

         <title>Nonflammable Polyfluorides&#8208;Anchored Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolytes for Ultra&#8208;Safe Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Pouch Cells Without Thermal Runaway</title>

Abstract
The safe operation of rechargeable batteries is crucial because of numerous instances of fire and explosion mishaps. However, battery chemistry involving metallic lithium (Li) as the anode is prone to thermal runaway in flammable organic electrolytes under abusive conditions. Herein, an in&#8208;situ encapsulation strategy is proposed to construct nonflammable quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes through the radical polymerization of a hexafluorobutyl acrylate (HFBA) monomer and a pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (PETEA) crosslinker. The quasi&#8208;solid system eliminated the inherent flammability of ether electrolytes with zero self&#8208;extinguishing time owing to the radical capturing ability of HFBA in the gas phase. Additionally, the graphitized carbon layer generated during the decomposition of PETEA at high temperatures obstructs the heat and oxygen required for combustion. When coupled with Au&#8208;modified reduced graphene oxide anodic current collectors and lithium sulfide cathodes, the assembled anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal cell based on the QSE exhibited no signs of cell expansion or gas generation during cycling, and thermal runaway was eliminated under multiple mechanical, electrical, and thermal abuse scenarios and even rigorous strikes. This nonflammable quasi&#8208;solid configuration with gas&#8208; and condensed&#8208;phase flame&#8208;retardant mechanisms can drive a technological leap in anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal pouch cells and secure the practical applications necessary to power our society in a safe manner.

         <title>Liquid Nanoparticles for Nanocatalytic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanotechnology is revolutionizing cancer therapy, and catalyzes the emerging of ion&#8208;involved cancer&#8208;therapeutic modality, which unfortunately suffers from undesirable nanocarriers for efficient intracellular ion delivery. To radically extricate from this critical issue, the glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive organosilica network was employed to lock the liquid drops at the nanoscale via a general bottom&#8208;up strategy to achieve the systemic delivery of &#8220;ion drugs&#8221;. In this work, a sulfate radical generation donor (Na2S2O8), as a paradigm &#8220;ion drug&#8221;, was entrapped into this liquid nanoparticle for efficiently delivering to the tumor region. After further surface engineering with pH&#8208;responsive tannic acid&#8208;Fe2+ framework, these liquid nanoparticles achieved tumor&#8208;microenvironmental pH/GSH&#8208;dual responsive ion release (Fe2+/Na+/S2O82&#8722;) after reaching the tumor sites, where the Fe2+ further triggered S2O82&#8722; to generate toxic &#8226;SO4&#8722; and &#8226;OH, effectively executing cancer cell ferroptosis (Fe2+, ROS) and pyroptosis (Na+, ROS). Such a tumor&#8208;responsive/specific liquid nanoplatform is highly instructive for further ion&#8208;mediated nanomedicine and disease treatment.

Abstract
Great research efforts have been devoted to exploring the miniaturization of chip&#8208;scale coherent light sources possessing excellent lasing performance. Despite the indispensable&#160;role in Si photonics, SiO2 is generally considered not contributing to the starting up and operation of integrated lasers. Here we demonstrate an extraordinary&#8208;performance subwavelength&#8208;scale perovskite vertical cavity laser with all&#8208;transparent SiO2 cavity, whose cavity is ultra&#8208;simple and composed of only two parallel SiO2 plates. By introducing a ligand&#8208;assisted thermally co&#8208;evaporation strategy, highly luminescent perovskite film with high reproducibility and excellent optical gain is grown directly on SiO2. Benefitting from their high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index contrast, low&#8208;threshold, high&#8208;quality factor, and single&#8208;mode lasing is achieved in subwavelength range of &#8764;120&#160;nm, and verified by long&#8208;range coherence distance (115.6&#160;&#956;m) and high linear polarization degree (82%). More importantly, the subwavelength perovskite laser device could operate in water for 20 days without any observable degradation, exhibiting ultra&#8208;stable water&#8208;resistant performance. Our findings would provide a simple but robust and reliable strategy for the miniaturized on&#8208;chip lasers compatible with Si photonics.

         <title>How reproducible is the synthesis of Zr&#8211;porphyrin metal&#8211;organic frameworks? An interlaboratory study</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a rapidly growing class of materials that offer great promise in various applications. However, the synthesis remains challenging: for example, a range of crystal structures can often be accessed from the same building blocks, which complicates the phase selectivity. Likewise, the high sensitivity to slight changes in synthesis conditions may cause reproducibility issues. This is crucial, as it hampers the research and commercialisation of affected MOFs. Here, we&#160;present the first&#8208;ever interlaboratory study of the synthetic reproducibility of two Zr&#8211;porphyrin MOFs, PCN&#8208;222 and PCN&#8208;224, to investigate the scope of this problem. For PCN&#8208;222, only one sample out of ten was&#160;phase pure and of the correct symmetry, while for PCN&#8208;224, three were&#160;phase pure, although none of these show the spatial linker order characteristic of PCN&#8208;224. Instead, these samples resemble dPCN&#8208;224 (disordered PCN&#8208;224), which was&#160;recently reported by us. The variability in thermal behavior, defect content, and BET surface area of the synthesised samples are also studied. Our&#160;results have important ramifications for field of metal&#8211;organic frameworks and their crystallisation, by highlighting the synthetic challenges associated with a multi&#8208;variable synthesis space and flat energy landscapes characteristic of&#160;MOFs.

         <title>Stabilizing precursor solution and controlling crystallization kinetics simultaneously for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The efficiency of metal halide perovskite solar cells has skyrocketed, however defects created by aging precursor solutions and during crystallization pose a significant barrier to reproducibility and efficiency of solar cells. Herein, we report an additive method using Fluoro&#8208;N,N,N&#8243;,N&#8243;&#8208;tetramethylformamidinium hexafluorophosphate (F&#8208;(CH3)4CN2PF6, abbreviated as TFFH) to stabilize precursor solution and improve crysallization dynamics simutaneously for high&#8208;performance FAPbI3 (FA = formamidinium)&#8208;based perovskite indoor photovoltaics. The F&#8208;(CH3)4CN2 cations stabilize precursor solution by inhibiting oxidation of I&#8722; and reducing newly generated I0 to I&#8722; simultaneously. The PF6&#8722; anions interact strongly with the Pb&#8208;I framework to passivate undercoordinated Pb2+. Time&#8208;resolved optical diagnostics show a prolonged perovskite crystallization dynamics during which in situ defect passivation is achieved in the precesence of strong FA+&#183;&#183;&#183;TFFH&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb&#8208;I interaction. Simultaneous regulation of precursor solution and crystallizaiton dynamics guarantee larger perovskite grain sizes, better crystal orientation, and less defects of perovskite films as well as more efficient charge extraction in complete solar cells. The optimized solar cells achieve improved reproducibility, better stability and reach effciency of 42.43% at illumination of 1002 lux, which is the highest efficiency among all indoor photovoltaics. It is anticipated that the concurrent stabilization of solutions and regulation of crystallization dynamics will emerge as a prevalent approach for enhancing the reproducibility and efficiency of perovskite.

         <title>A Data&#8208;Driven Approach to Molten Salt Synthesis of N&#8208;rich Carbon Adsorbents for Selective CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Applying a design of experiments methodology to molten salt synthesis of nanoporous carbons enables inverse design and optimization of N&#8208;rich carbon adsorbents with excellent CO2/N2 selectivity and appreciable CO2 capacity for carbon capture via swing adsorption from dilute gas mixtures, such as natural gas combined cycle flue gas. This data&#8208;driven study reveals fundamental relationships between the synthesis conditions, physicochemical properties, and achievable selective adsorption performance of N&#8208;rich nanoporous carbons derived from molten salt synthesis for CO2 capture. Taking advantage of size&#8208;sieving separation of CO2 (3.30 &#197;) from N2 (3.64 &#197;) within the turbostratic nanostructure of these N&#8208;rich carbons, while limiting deleterious N2 adsorption in a weaker adsorption site that harms selectivity, enables a large low&#8208;pressure CO2 capacity (0.73&#160;mmol/g at 30.4&#160;Torr and 30&#176;C) with noteworthy concurrent CO2/N2 selectivity (SIAST = 246, adsorbed phase purity = 91%) from a simulated gas stream with only 4% CO2. This study reveals general structure&#8208;function relationships of selective CO2 adsorption by nanoporous carbon adsorbents. Optimized N&#8208;rich porous carbons, with good physicochemical stability, low cost, and moderate regeneration energy, can achieve performance for selective CO2 adsorption that competes with other classes of advanced porous materials, such as chemisorbing zeolites and functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Guided Activation of Cgas&#8208;STING by Aie Photosensitizer Nanoparticles for Targeted Tumor Therapy And Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) leverage reactive oxygen species (ROS) and control local hyperthermia by photosensitizer to perturb intracellular redox equilibrium, inducing DNA damage in both mitochondria and nucleus, activating the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, ultimately eliciting antitumor immune responses. However, current photosensitizers are encumbered by limitations such as suboptimal tumor targeting, aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ), and restricted excitation and emission wavelengths. Here, we&#160; designed novel nanoparticles based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer (BODTPE) for targeted tumor therapy and near&#8208;infrared II fluorescence imaging (NIR&#8208;II FLI) with enhanced PDT/PTT effects. BODTPE was employed as a monomer, DBCO&#8208;PEG2k&#8208;amine serving as an end&#8208;capping polymer, to synthesize a BODTPE&#8208;containing polymer (DBD). Further, through self&#8208;assembly, DBD and mPEG&#8208;DSPE2k combined to form nanoparticles (NP&#8208;DBD). Notably, the DBCO on the surface of NP&#8208;DBD can react with azide groups on cancer cells pretreated with Ac4ManNAz through a copper&#8208;free click reaction. This innovative formulation led to targeted accumulation of NP&#8208;DBD within tumor sites, a phenomenon convincingly demonstrated in murine tumor models subjected to Ac4ManNAz pretreatment. Significantly, NP&#8208;DBD exhibited a multifaceted effect encompassing PDT/PTT/NIR&#8208;II FLI upon 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, thereby better activating the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, culminating in a compelling tumor inhibition effect augmented by robust immune modulation.

Notably, the DBCO on the surface of NP-DBD can react with azide groups on cancer cells pretreated with Ac&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;ManNAz through a copper-free click reaction. This innovative formulation led to targeted accumulation of NP-DBD within tumor sites, a phenomenon convincingly demonstrated in murine tumor models subjected to Ac&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;ManNAz pretreatment. Significantly, NP-DBD exhibited a multifaceted effect encompassing PDT/PTT/NIR-II FLI upon 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, thereby better activating the cGAS-STING pathway, culminating in a compelling tumor inhibition effect augmented by robust immune modulation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Templating Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aerogel production methodology through freezing and lyophilization of engineerable liquid templates, generated via interfacial complexation through electrostatic interactions between the nanoparticles (NPs) and ligands, is introduced. The coined approach enables tuning of the multiscale porosities, 3D architecture, and characteristics of the aerogels by engineering the composition and arrangement of liquid templates toward advanced applications and functions.








Abstract
Modern materials science has witnessed the era of advanced fabrication methods to engineer functionality from the nano&#8208; to macroscales. Versatile fabrication and additive manufacturing methods are developed, but the ability to design a material for a given application is still limited. Here,&#160;a novel strategy that enables target&#8208;oriented manufacturing of ultra&#8208;lightweight aerogels with on&#8208;demand characteristics is introduced. The process relies on controllable liquid templating through interfacial complexation to generate tunable, stimuli&#8208;responsive 3D&#8208;structured (multiphase) filamentous liquid templates. The methodology involves nanoscale chemistry and microscale assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces to produce hierarchical macroscopic aerogels featuring multiscale porosity, ultralow density (3.05&#8211;3.41&#160;mg cm&#8722;3), and high compressibility (90%) combined with elastic resilience and instant shape recovery. The challenges are overcome facing ultra&#8208;lightweight aerogels, including poor mechanical integrity and the inability to form predefined 3D constructs with on&#8208;demand functionality, for a multitude of applications. The controllable nature of the coined methodology enables tunable electromagnetic interference shielding with high specific shielding effectiveness (39 893&#160;dB cm2 g&#8722;1), and one of the highest&#8208;ever reported oil&#8208;absorption capacities (487 times the initial weight of aerogel for chloroform), to be obtained. These properties originate from the engineerable nature of liquid templating, pushing the boundaries of lightweight materials to systematic function design and applications.

         <title>Electrochemically Controlled Hydrogels with Electrotunable Permeability and Uniaxial Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique properties of hydrogels enable the design of life&#8208;like soft intelligent systems. This work demonstrates how the swelling of hydrogels from cellulose nanofibrils and carbon nanotubes can be electrochemically controlled to achieve electrochemical osmotic actuation. This new materials system paves the way for integrated actuation, sensing, and controlled permeation in electrotunable separation membranes or soft actuators.








Abstract
The unique properties of hydrogels enable the design of life&#8208;like soft intelligent systems. However, stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels still suffer from limited actuation control. Direct electronic control of electronically conductive hydrogels can solve this challenge and allow direct integration with modern electronic systems. An electrochemically controlled nanowire composite hydrogel with high in&#8208;plane conductivity that stimulates a uniaxial electrochemical osmotic expansion is demonstrated. This materials system allows precisely controlled shape&#8208;morphing at only &#8722;1&#160;V, where capacitive charging of the hydrogel bulk leads to a large uniaxial expansion of up to 300%, caused by the ingress of &#8776;700 water molecules per electron&#8211;ion pair. The material retains its state when turned off, which is ideal for electrotunable membranes as the inherent coupling between the expansion and mesoporosity enables electronic control of permeability for adaptive separation, fractionation, and distribution. Used as electrochemical osmotic hydrogel actuators, they achieve an electroactive pressure of up to 0.7&#160;MPa (1.4&#160;MPa vs dry) and a work density of &#8776;150&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3 (2&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3&#160;vs dry). This new materials system paves the way to integrate actuation, sensing, and controlled permeation into advanced soft intelligent systems.

         <title>Topological Flat Bands in 2D Breathing&#8208;Kagome Lattice Nb3TeCl7</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental evidence of the nearly independent single topological flat band (FB) generated by the 2D Nb breathing&#8208;kagome layer&#160;in Nb3TeCl7 with identical on&#8208;site energy of Nb sites is reported. The possibility of modulating the bandwidth, energy position, and topology of the FB by altering the on&#8208;site energy over Nb sites in the 2D breathing&#8208;kagome frustrated geometry is disclosed.








Abstract
Flat bands&#160;(FBs) can appear in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) geometrically frustrated systems caused by quantum destructive interference (QDI). However, the scarcity of pure 2D frustrated crystal structures in natural materials makes FBs hard to be identified, let alone modulate FBs relating to electronic properties. Here, the experimental evidence of the complete electronic QDI induced FB contributed by the 2D breathing&#8208;kagome layers of Nb atoms in Nb3TeCl7 (NTC) is reported. An identical chemical state and 2D localization characteristics of the Nb breathing&#8208;kagome layers are experimentally confirmed, based on which NTC is demonstrated to be a superior concrete candidate for the breathing&#8208;kagome tight&#8208;binding model. Furthermore, it theoretically establishes the tunable roles of the on&#8208;site energy over Nb sites on bandwidth, energy position, and topology of FBs in NTC. This work opens an aveanue to manipulate FB characteristics in these 4d transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based breathing&#8208;kagome materials.

         <title>Bimetallic Organic Frameworks of High Piezovoltage for Sono&#8208;Piezo Dynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel piezoelectric Mn&#8211;Ti bimetallic organic framework (MT&#8208;MOF) of high piezovoltage is designed for new sono&#8208;piezoelectric dynamic therapy with significant antitumor efficiency in vitro and in vivo. Strikingly, the MT&#8208;MOF, which has a piezopotential of 2.9&#160;V, exciting charges under low&#8208;intensity ultrasound, not only causes ROS overproduction but also disrupts the polarization of the plasma and mitochondrial membranes inducing intense cytotoxicity.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials produce charges to directly act on cancer medium or promote the generation of&#160;reactive oxygen species (ROS) for novel tumor therapy triggered by sonography. Currently, piezoelectric sonosensitizers are mainly used to catalyze ROS generation by the band&#8208;tilting effect for sonodynamic therapy. However, it remains a challenge for piezoelectric sonosensitizers to produce high piezovoltages to overcome the bandgap barrier for direct charge generation. Herein, Mn&#8211;Ti bimetallic organic framework tetragonal nanosheets (MT&#8208;MOF TNS) are designed to produce high piezovoltages for novel sono&#8208;piezo (SP)&#8208;dynamic therapy (SPDT) with remarkable antitumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo. The MT&#8208;MOF TNS comprise non&#8208;centrosymmetric secondary building units of Mn&#8211;Ti&#8211;oxo cyclic octamers with charge heterogeneous components for piezoelectricity. The MT&#8208;MOF TNS promotes strong sonocavitation to induce piezoelectric effect with a high SP voltage (2.9&#160;V) in situ, to directly excite charges, which is validated by SP&#8208;excited luminescence spectrometry. The SP voltage and charges depolarize the mitochondrial and plasma membrane potentials and cause ROS overproduction and serious tumor cell damage. Importantly, MT&#8208;MOF TNS can be decorated with targeting molecules and chemotherapeutics for more severe tumor regression by combining SPDT with chemodynamic therapy and chemotherapy. This report develops a fascinating MT&#8208;MOF piezoelectric nano&#8208;semiconductor and provides an efficient SPDT strategy for tumor treatment.

         <title>Circular Reprocessing of Thermoset Polyurethane Foams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Foam&#8208;to&#8208;foam reprocessing of thermoset polyurethane is reported for circular recycling of polyurethane products. As carbamate exchange catalysts enable melt&#8208;reprocessing of thermoset polyurethanes, extrusion foaming and foam injection molding of polyurethane are demonstrated, and the potential scalability is assessed. The structure&#8211;processing&#8211;property relationship of the processes is investigated to achieve low&#8208;density foam with comparable mechanical properties to those of as&#8208;synthesized polyurethane foams.








Abstract
Thermoset polyurethane (PU) foams are widely used in industrial applications, but they cannot be recycled by conventional melt reprocessing because of their cross&#8208;linked structures. The introduction of carbamate exchange catalysts converts thermoset PU into covalent adaptable networks (CANs), which are amenable to reprocessing at elevated temperatures. However, this approach has produced solid PU films, which have fewer uses and lower commercial demand. In this work, simultaneous reprocessing and refoaming of thermoset PU foams is demonstrated by leveraging the melt&#8208;processability of PU CANs and allowing cell growth by gas generation in a twin&#8208;screw extruder. The optimal operating temperature of the refoaming process is determined through chemical, thermal, and structural analysis of PU foam extrudates. The foam&#8208;to&#8208;foam extrusion process produces controllable, continuous, and uniform foam structures, as characterized by cell diameter and cell number density. Low&#8208;density PU foams are obtained through a process simulating injection molding. The compression properties of reprocessed PU foam are compared with as&#8208;synthesized PU foam to demonstrate efficacy of the refoaming processes. These results demonstrate that PU foams can be prepared through recycling while maintaining microstructural and chemical integrity. In the future, this strategy may be applied to thermoset PU foams of various chemical compositions and shows promise for scalability.

         <title>Giant Atomic Swirl in Graphene Bilayers with Biaxial Heterostrain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biaxial heterostrain in bilayer graphene leads to a new atomic lattice relaxation to minimize the stacking energy. Elastic energy is stored in solitons hosting topological states. This demonstrates that heterostrain can be an additional tuning parameter in moir&#233; materials opening new possibilities for moir&#233; engineering.








Abstract
The study of moir&#233; engineering started with the advent of van der Waals heterostructures, in which stacking 2D layers with different lattice constants leads to a moir&#233; pattern controlling their electronic properties. The field entered a new era when it&#160;was&#160;found that adjusting the twist between two graphene layers led to strongly&#8208;correlated&#8208;electron physics and topological effects associated with atomic relaxation. A twist is now routinely used to adjust the properties of 2D materials. This study investigates a new type of moir&#233; superlattice in bilayer graphene when one layer is biaxially strained with respect to the other&#8212;so&#8208;called biaxial heterostrain. Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements uncover spiraling electronic states associated with a novel symmetry&#8208;breaking atomic reconstruction at small biaxial heterostrain. Atomistic calculations using experimental parameters as inputs reveal that a giant atomic swirl forms around regions of aligned stacking to reduce the mechanical energy of the bilayer. Tight&#8208;binding calculations performed on the relaxed structure show that the observed electronic states decorate spiraling domain wall solitons as required by topology. This study establishes biaxial heterostrain as an important parameter to be harnessed for the next step of moir&#233; engineering in van der Waals&#160;multilayers.

         <title>Inhabiting Inactive Transition by Coupling Function of Oxygen Vacancies and Fe&#9472;C Bonds achieving Long Cycle Life of an Iron&#8208;Based Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coupling effect of oxygen vacancies and Fe&#9472;C bonds increases the reaction energy barrier and restrains the irreversible structure reconstruction from FeOOH to &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3, endowing an Fe@Fe3O4(v)@Fe3C@C electrode with the coexistence of high capacity, excellent rate capability, and outstanding cycle stability.








Abstract
Fe&#8208;based battery&#8208;type anode materials with many faradaic reaction sites have higher capacities than carbon&#8208;based double&#8208;layer&#8208;type materials and can be used to develop aqueous supercapacitors with high energy density. However, as an insurmountable bottleneck, the severe capacity fading and poor cyclability derived from the inactive transition hinder their commercial application in asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). In this work, driven by the &#8220;oxygen pumping&#8221; mechanism, oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich Fe@Fe3O4(v)@Fe3C@C nanoparticles that consist of a unique &#8220;fruit with stone&#8221;&#8208;like structure are developed, and they exhibit enhanced specific capacity and fast charge/discharge capability. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the capacity attenuation in conventional iron&#8208;based anodes is greatly alleviated in the the Fe@Fe3O4(v)@Fe3C@C anode because the irreversible phase transition to the inactive &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 phase can be inhibited by a robust barrier formed by the coupling of oxygen vacancies and Fe&#9472;C bonds, which promotes cycle stability (93.5% capacity retention after 24&#160;000 cycles). An ASC fabricated using this Fe&#8208;based anode is also observed to have extraordinary durability, achieving capacity retention of 96.4% after 38&#160;000 cycles, and a high energy density of 127.6&#160;W&#160;h&#160;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 981&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1.

         <dc:description>
Shape&#8208;programmable liquid&#8208;crystalline polyurethane&#8208;based multimode actuators triggered by light&#8208;driven molecular motors are prepared. The shape&#8208;programmable polymeric film presents superior mechanical properties and characteristic shape&#8208;memory effect. Furthermore, diverse modes of motions including bending, unwinding, and contracting with tunable actuation speed over a wide range are achieved.








Abstract
In recent years, light&#8208;driven soft actuators have been rapidly developed as enablers in the fabrication of artificial robots and biomimetic devices. However, it remains challenging to amplify molecular isomerization to multiple modes of macroscopic actuation with large amplitude and complex motions. Here, a strategy is reported to build a light&#8208;responsive liquid&#8208;crystalline polyurethane elastomer by phototriggered overcrowded alkene&#8208;based molecular motors. A trifunctional molecular motor modified with an ethylene glycol spacer on the rotor and stator functions as a crosslinker and unidirectional stirrer that amplifies molecular motion into macroscopic movement. The shape&#8208;programmable polymeric film presents superior mechanical properties and characteristic shape&#8208;memory effect. Furthermore, diverse modes of motions including bending, unwinding, and contracting with tunable actuation speed over a wide range are achieved. Such research is hoped to pave a new way for the design of advanced light&#8208;responsive soft actuators and robots.

         <title>Fundamentals, Advances, and Artifacts in Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized luminescence enables exciting applications such as holography, advanced cryptography, and energy&#8208;efficient displays. This Perspective lays out the fundamentals of the corresponding spectroscopic technique and reports a home&#8208;built setup. The corrections necessary for accurate measurements as well as the most common artifacts and pitfalls to avoid are detailed. Custom operating software is made available free of charge.








Abstract
Objects are chiral when they cannot be superimposed with their mirror image. Materials can emit chiral light with an excess of right&#8208; or left&#8208;handed circular polarization. This circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is key to promising future applications, such as highly efficient displays, holography, sensing, enantiospecific discrimination, synthesis of drugs, quantum computing, and cryptography. Here, a practical guide to CPL spectroscopy is provided. First, the fundamentals of the technique are laid out and a detailed account of recent experimental advances to achieve highly sensitive and accurate measurements is given, including all corrections required to obtain reliable results. Then the most common artifacts and pitfalls are discussed, especially for the study of thin films, for example, based on molecules, polymers, or halide perovskites, as opposed to dilute solutions of emitters. To facilitate the adoption by others, custom operating software is made publicly available, equipping the reader with the tools needed for successful and accurate CPL determination.

         <title>A High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Oxides&#8208;Based Memristor: Outstanding Resistive Switching Performance and Mechanisms in Atomic Structural Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resistive random&#8208;access memory based on high&#8208;entropy oxide exhibits excellent performance, such as low power consumption, long retention time, and excellent endurance. The excellent properties are due to the interactions among the five metal cations and the entropy stabilization effect. The switching behavior is induced by the migration of oxygen ions, leading to a structural transformation between spinel and rock salt.








Abstract
The application of high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) has attracted significant attention in recent years owing to their unique structural characteristics, such as excellent electrochemical properties and long&#8208;term cycling stability. However, the application of resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM) has not been extensively studied, and the switching mechanism of HEO&#8208;based RRAM has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this study, HEO (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni)3O4 with a spinel structure is epitaxially grown on a Nb:STO conductive substrate, and Pt metal is deposited as the top electrode. After the resistive&#8208;switching operation, some regions of the spinel structure are transformed into a rock&#8208;salt structure and analyzed using advanced transmission electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. From the results of X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy, only specific elements would change their valence state, which results in excellent resistive&#8208;switching properties with a high on/off ratio on the order of 105, outstanding endurance (&gt;4550 cycles), long retention time (&gt;104 s), and high stability, which suggests that HEO is a promising RRAM material.

         <title>Photoinduced Mechanical Cloaking of Diarylethene&#8208;Crosslinked Microgels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical cloaking in microgels: a diarylethene photoswitch is introduced as a co&#8208;crosslinker into PVCL microgels. Light&#8208;induced photoswitching of the diaryethene results in a phase&#8208;transition shift and thus changes the swelling status of microgels at a fixed temperature, rendering them differently reactive to mechanical force.








Abstract
The serial connection of multiple stimuli&#8208;responses in polymer architectures enables the logically conjunctive gating of functional material processes on demand. Here, a photoswitchable diarylethene (DAE) acts as a crosslinker in poly(N&#8208;vinylcaprolactam) microgels and allows the light&#8208;induced shift of the volume phase&#8208;transition temperature (VPTT). While swollen microgels below the VPTT are susceptible to force and undergo breakage&#8211;aggregation processes, collapsed microgels above the VPTT stay intact in mechanical fields induced by ultrasonication. Within a VPTT shift regime, photoswitching of the DAE transfers microgels from the swollen to the collapsed state and thereby gates their response to force as demonstrated by the light&#8208;gated activation of an embedded fluorogenic mechanophore. This photoinduced mechanical cloaking system operates on the polymer topology level and is thereby principally universally applicable.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Anchored Curved Carbon Surface for Efficient CO2 Electro&#8208;Reduction with Nearly 100% CO Selectivity and Industrially&#8208;Relevant Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Ni&#8208;N4 sites on curved carbon surfaces possess a lower energy barrier for *COOH formation, which benefits the CO2 reduction reaction. Accordingly, porous carbon with atomic Ni&#8208;N4 sites and a rich curved surface is developed and exhibits nearly 100 % selectivity for CO formation under a high current density of 400 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Although single metal atoms on porous carbons (PCs) are widely used in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, these systems have long relied on flat graphene&#8208;based models, which are far beyond reality because of abundant curved structures in PCs; the effect of curved surfaces has long been ignored. In addition, the selectivity generally decreases under high current density, which severely limits practical application. Herein, theoretical calculations reveal that a single&#8208;Ni&#8208;atom on a curved surface can simultaneously enhance the total density of states around Fermi level and decrease the energy barrier for *COOH formation, thereby enhancing catalytic activity. This work reports a rational molten salt approach for preparing PCs with ultra&#8208;high specific surface area of up to 2635 m2 g&#8722;1. As determined by cutting&#8208;edge techniques, a single Ni atom on a curved carbon surface is obtained and used as a catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction. The CO selectivity reaches up to 99.8% under industrial&#8208;level current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PC&#8208;based catalysts. This work not only offers a new method for the rational synthesis of single atom catalysts with strained geometry to host rich active sites, but also provides in&#8208;depth insights for the origin of catalytic activity of curved structure&#8208;enriched PC&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Photostable Cascade&#8208;Activatable Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly on a Cancer Cell Membrane for High&#8208;Performance Identification of Human Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A target reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (TRAP) system can construct a polypeptide&#8208;based nanofiber structure in situ on a cell membrane to achieve long&#8208;term stable imaging of bladder cancer. The targeted peptide can specifically react with the reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (RAP) to form TRAP, which exhibits enhanced hydrophobicity simultaneously aggregating into nanofibers. The nanofibers can achieve accurate tumor recognition and enable high&#8208;performance stable imaging, retaining the high signal/noise ratio.








Abstract
Missed or residual tumor burden results in high risk for bladder cancer relapse. However, existing fluorescent probes cannot meet the clinical needs because of inevitable photobleaching properties. Performance can be improved by maintaining intensive and sustained fluorescence signals via resistance to intraoperative saline flushing and intrinsic fluorescent decay, providing surgeons with sufficiently clear and high&#8208;contrast surgical fields, avoiding residual tumors or missed diagnosis. This study designs and synthesizes a photostable cascade&#8208;activatable peptide, a target reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (TRAP) system, which can construct polypeptide&#8208;based nanofibers in situ on the cell membrane to achieve long&#8208;term and stable imaging of bladder cancer. The probe has two parts: a target peptide (TP) targets CD44v6 to recognize bladder cancer cells, and a reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (RAP) is introduced, which effectively reacts with the TP via a click reaction to enhance the hydrophobicity of the whole molecule, assembling into nanofibers and further nanonetworks. Accordingly, probe retention on the cell membrane is prolonged, and photostability is significantly improved. Finally, the TRAP system is successfully employed in the high&#8208;performance identification of human bladder cancer in ex vivo bladder tumor tissues. This cascade&#8208;activatable peptide molecular probe based on the TRAP system enables efficient and stable imaging of bladder cancer.

         <title>A Computationally Assisted Approach for Designing Wearable Biosensors toward Non&#8208;Invasive Personalized Molecular Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An automated computational framework named QuantumDock is developed for universal molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) development toward a variety of wearable biosensing applications. QuantumDock employs molecular docking and density functional theory to probe the molecular interactions between monomers and the target/interferent molecules, optimizing the selectivity of the MIP biosensor for the wearable analysis of a wide range of biomarkers. (e.g., phenylalanine).








Abstract
Wearable sweat sensors have the potential to revolutionize precision medicine as they can non&#8208;invasively collect molecular information closely associated with an individual's health status. However, the majority of clinically relevant biomarkers cannot be continuously detected in situ using existing wearable approaches. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are a promising candidate to address this challenge but haven't yet gained widespread use due to their complex design and optimization process yielding variable selectivity. Here, QuantumDock is introduced, an automated computational framework for universal MIP development toward wearable applications. QuantumDock utilizes density functional theory to probe molecular interactions between monomers and the target/interferent molecules to optimize selectivity, a fundamentally limiting factor for MIP development toward wearable sensing. A molecular docking approach is employed to explore a wide range of known and unknown monomers, and to identify the optimal monomer/cross&#8208;linker choice for subsequent MIP fabrication. Using an essential amino acid phenylalanine as the exemplar, experimental validation of QuantumDock is performed successfully using solution&#8208;synthesized MIP nanoparticles coupled with ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectroscopy. Moreover, a QuantumDock&#8208;optimized graphene&#8208;based wearable device is designed that can perform autonomous sweat induction, sampling, and sensing. For the first time, wearable non&#8208;invasive phenylalanine monitoring is demonstrated in human subjects toward personalized healthcare applications.

Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are a promising candidate to address this challenge but haven't yet gained widespread use due to their complex design and optimization process yielding variable selectivity. Here, QuantumDock is introduced, an automated computational framework for universal MIP development toward wearable applications. QuantumDock utilizes density functional theory to probe molecular interactions between monomers and the target/interferent molecules to optimize selectivity, a fundamentally limiting factor for MIP development toward wearable sensing. A molecular docking approach is employed to explore a wide range of known and unknown monomers, and to identify the optimal monomer/cross-linker choice for subsequent MIP fabrication. Using an essential amino acid phenylalanine as the exemplar, experimental validation of QuantumDock is performed successfully using solution-synthesized MIP nanoparticles coupled with ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectroscopy. Moreover, a QuantumDock-optimized graphene-based wearable device is designed that can perform autonomous sweat induction, sampling, and sensing. For the first time, wearable non-invasive phenylalanine monitoring is demonstrated in human subjects toward personalized healthcare applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Doping in Ordered and Disordered Domains of Organic Mixed Ionic&#8211;Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel organic bioelectronic technologies rely on the efficient electrochemical doping of conjugated polymers. In this work, it is investigated how the doping process can be controlled by the co&#8208;existence of ordered and disordered domains in polymeric films. It is shown that both domains are doped trough different mechanisms and extents, and that optimal conductivity can be achieved by modulating film order.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers are increasingly used as organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors in electrochemical applications for neuromorphic computing, bioelectronics, and energy harvesting. The design of efficient electrochemical devices relies on large modulations of the polymer conductivity, fast doping/dedoping kinetics, and high ionic uptake. In this work, structure&#8211;property relations are established and control of these parameters by the co&#8208;existence of order and disorder in the phase morphology is demonstrated. Using in&#160;situ time&#8208;resolved spectroelectrochemistry, resonant Raman, and terahertz (THz) conductivity measurements, the electrochemical doping in the different morphological domains of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is investigated. The main finding is that bipolarons are found preferentially in disordered polymer regions, where they are formed faster and are thermodynamically more favored. On the other hand, polarons show a preference for ordered domains, leading to drastically different bipolaron/polaron ratios and doping/dedoping dynamics in the distinct regions. A significant enhancement of the electronic conductivity is evident when bipolarons start forming in the disordered regions, while the presence of bipolarons in the ordered regions is detrimental for transport. This study provides significant advances in the understanding of the impact of morphology on the electrochemical doping of conjugated polymers and the induced increase in conductivity.

         <title>In Situ Covalent Reinforcement of a Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Tricarboxamide Supramolecular Polymer Enables Biomimetic, Tough, and Fibrous Hydrogels and Bioinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Creating fibrillar yet tough synthetic hydrogel and bioink remains highly desired. Inspired by collagen's covalent cross&#8208;linking of fibrils; herein, a benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) based synthetic supramolecular/covalent strategy is reported for creating a tough hydrogel and bioink. The bioink enables 3D bioprinting of hMSCs spheroids and supports cartilage&#8208;like tissue formation within the hydrogel.








Abstract
Synthetic hydrogels often lack the load&#8208;bearing capacity and mechanical properties of native biopolymers found in tissue, such as cartilage. In natural tissues, toughness is often imparted via the combination of fibrous noncovalent self&#8208;assembly with key covalent bond formation. This controlled combination of supramolecular and covalent interactions remains difficult to engineer, yet can provide a clear strategy for advanced biomaterials. Here, a synthetic supramolecular/covalent strategy is investigated for creating a tough hydrogel that embodies the hierarchical fibrous architecture of the extracellular matrix (ECM). A benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) hydrogelator is developed with synthetically addressable norbornene handles that self&#8208;assembles to form a and viscoelastic hydrogel. Inspired by collagen's covalent cross&#8208;linking of fibrils, the mechanical properties are reinforced by covalent intra&#8208; and interfiber cross&#8208;links. At over 90% water, the hydrogels withstand up to 550% tensile strain, 90% compressive strain, and dissipated energy with recoverable hysteresis. The hydrogels are shear&#8208;thinning, can be 3D bioprinted with good shape fidelity, and can be toughened via&#160;covalent cross&#8208;linking. These materials enable the bioprinting of human mesenchymal stromal cell (hMSC) spheroids and subsequent differentiation into chondrogenic tissue. Collectively, these findings highlight the power of covalent reinforcement&#160;of supramolecular fibers, offering a strategy for the bottom&#8208;up design of dynamic, yet tough, hydrogels and bioinks.

         <title>Tumor Eradication by Boron Neutron Capture Therapy with 10B&#8208;enriched Hexagonal Boron Nitride Nanoparticles Grafted with Poly(Glycerol)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;10&#160;nm 10B&#8208;enriched hexagonal boron nitride nanoparticles grafted with poly(glycerol) (h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG) are developed as a boron nanocarrier for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Benefiting from the small particle size and high stealth efficiency, h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles efficiently accumulate in CT26 tumors with a high intratumor 10B concentration of 8.8%ID&#160;g&#8722;1 or 102.1&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1, resulting in significant tumor shrinkage by BNCT alone.








Abstract
Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) has emerged as a treatment modality with high precision and efficacy of intractable tumors. At the core of effective tumor BNCT are 10B carriers with facile preparation as well as advantageous pharmacokinetic and therapeutic profiles. Herein, the design and preparation of sub&#8208;10 nm&#160;10B&#8208;enriched hexagonal boron nitride nanoparticles grafted with poly(glycerol) (h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG), and their application to cancer treatment by BNCT are reported. By virtue of their small particle size and outstanding stealth property, h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles accumulate efficiently in murine CT26 colon tumors with a high intratumor 10B concentration of 8.8%ID&#160;g&#8722;1 or 102.1&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1 at 12&#160;h post&#8208;injection. Moreover, h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles penetrate into the inside of the tumor parenchyma and then are taken up by the tumor cells. BNCT comprising a single bolus injection of h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles and subsequent one&#8208;time neutron irradiation results in significant shrinkage of subcutaneous CT26 tumors. h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG&#8208;mediated BNCT not only causes direct DNA damage to the tumor cells, but also triggers pronounced inflammatory immune response in the tumor tissues, which contributes to long&#8208;lasting tumor suppression after the neutron irradiation. Thus, the h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles are promising BNCT agents to eradicate tumor through highly efficient 10B accumulation.

         <title>Multistable Metafluid based Energy Harvesting and Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a novel approach to energy harvesting, storage, and on&#8208;demand release by integrating compressible gas within a multistable structure. An analytical and experimental investigation is carried out into this &#8220;metafluid.&#8221; We&#160;examine its potential for energy harvesting from temperature fluctuations (such as day and night cycles), store the energy internally, and convert it into mechanical energy when needed.








Abstract
The thermodynamic properties of fluids play a crucial role in many engineering applications, particularly in the context of energy. Fluids with multistable thermodynamic properties may offer new paths for harvesting and storing energy via transitions between equilibria states. Such artificial multistable fluids can be created using the approach employed in metamaterials, which controls macro&#8208;properties through micro&#8208;structure composition. In this work, the dynamics of such &#8220;metafluids&#8221; is examined for a configuration of calorically&#8208;perfect compressible gas contained within multistable elastic capsules flowing in a fluid&#8208;filled tube. The velocity&#8208;, pressure&#8208;, and temperature&#8208;fields of multistable compressible metafluids is studied by both analytically and experimentally, focusing on transitions between different equilibria. The dynamics of a single capsule is first examine, which may move or change equilibrium state, due to fluidic forces. The interaction and motion of multiple capsules within a fluid&#8208;filled tube is then studied. It shows that such a system can be used to harvest energy from external temperature variations in either time or space. Thus, fluidic multistability allows specific quanta of energy to be captured and stored indefinitely as well as transported as a fluid, via tubes, at standard atmospheric conditions without the need for thermal&#160;isolation.

Thus, fluidic multistability allows specific quanta of energy to be captured and stored indefinitely as well as transported as a fluid, via tubes, at standard atmospheric conditions without the need for thermal&#160;isolation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nonlinear Inflatable Actuators for Distributed Control in Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces conical shell actuators that display buckling instability when loaded with pressure. The critical peak&#8208; and valley&#8208;pressures are independently tunable through geometrical parameters. When these thresholds are carefully tuned for a system of actuators, a complex actuation sequence can be designed for, with only one input. This study demonstrates this by playing Beethoven on a piano.








Abstract
As soft robotic systems grow in complexity and functionality, the size and stiffness of the needed control hardware severely limits their application potential. Alternatively, functionality can be embodied within actuator characteristics, drastically reducing the amount of peripherals. Functions such as memory, computation, and energy storage then result from the intrinsic mechanical behavior of precisely designed structures. Here, actuators are introduced with tunable characteristics to generate complex actuation sequences from a single input. Intricate sequences are made possible by harnessing hysteron characteristics encoded in the buckling of a cone&#8208;shaped shell incorporated in the actuator design. A large variety of such characteristics are generated by varying the actuator geometry. This dependency is mapped and used for creating a tool to determine the actuator geometry that yields a desired characteristic. Using this tool, a system with six actuators is created that plays the final movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with a single pressure supply.

         <title>Gate&#8208;Defined Josephson Weak&#8208;Links in Monolayer WTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) can be both a quantum spin Hall insulator and gated into a superconducting state. Josephson weak&#8208;links are fabricated using local gates on hBN&#8208;encapsulated WTe2 and the 2D nature of the superconducting leads is demonstrated. The fabrication provides a first step toward realizing versatile all&#8208;in&#8208;one gate configurable topological Josephson weak&#8208;links.








Abstract
Systems combining superconductors with topological insulators offer a platform for the study of Majorana bound states and a possible route to realize fault tolerant topological quantum computation. Among the systems being considered in this field, monolayers of tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) have a rare combination of properties. Notably, it has been demonstrated to be a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) and can easily be gated into a superconducting state. Measurements on gate&#8208;defined Josephson weak&#8208;link devices fabricated using monolayer WTe2 are reported. It is found that consideration of the 2D superconducting leads are critical in the interpretation of magnetic interference in the resulting junctions. The reported fabrication procedures suggest a facile way to produce further devices from this technically challenging material and the results mark the first step toward realizing versatile all&#8208;in&#8208;one topological Josephson weak&#8208;links using monolayer WTe2.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Thermoelectric Microdevices for 4D Thermometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D printed micro&#8208;thermoelectric device is developed for direct 4D (3D Space + Time) thermometry at the microscale. The paradigm of a 3D&#8208;printed thermocouple micro&#8208;network provides new advantages to access microscopic thermodynamics without dimensional limit. In this study, microscale 4D temperature fields generated by Joule&#8208;heating or evaporative cooling are directly observed.








Abstract
Thermometry, the process of measuring temperature, is one of the most fundamental tasks not only for understanding the thermodynamics of basic physical, chemical, and biological processes but also for thermal management of microelectronics. However, it is a challenge to acquire microscale temperature fields in both space and time. Here, a 3D printed micro&#8208;thermoelectric device that enables direct 4D (3D Space + Time) thermometry at the microscale is reported. The device is composed of freestanding thermocouple probe networks, fabricated by bi&#8208;metal 3D printing with an outstanding spatial resolution of a few &#181;m. It shows that the developed 4D thermometry can explore dynamics of Joule heating or evaporative cooling on microscale subjects of interest such as a microelectrode or a water meniscus. The utilization of 3D printing further opens up the possibility to freely realize a wide range of on&#8208;chip, freestanding microsensors or microelectronic devices without the design restrictions by manufacturing processes.

         <title>Directed Neural Stem Cells Differentiation via Signal Communication with Ni&#8211;Zn Micromotors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;driven Ni&#8211;Zn micromotors precisely approach target neural stem cells (NSCs) under magnetic guidance and further activate the cellular voltage&#8208;gated ion channel, thus directing the differentiation fate of the target cell. Such micromotors provide a possibility for non&#8208;invasive, minimally invasive therapy for neuron regeneration.








Abstract
Neural stem cells (NSCs), with the capability of self&#8208;renewal, differentiation, and environment modulation, are considered promising for stroke, brain injury therapy, and neuron regeneration. Activation of endogenous NSCs, is attracting increasing research enthusiasm, which avoids immune rejection and ethical issues of exogenous cell transplantation. Yet, how to induce directed growth and differentiation in situ remain a major challenge. In this study, a pure water&#8208;driven Ni&#8211;Zn micromotor via a self&#8208;established electric&#8211;chemical field is proposed. The micromotors can be magnetically guided and precisely approach target NSCs. Through the electric&#8211;chemical field, bioelectrical signal exchange and communication with endogenous NSCs are allowed, thus allowing for regulated proliferation and directed neuron differentiation in vivo. Therefore, the Ni&#8211;Zn micromotor provides a platform for controlling cell fate via a self&#8208;established electrochemical field and targeted activation of endogenous NSCs.

         <title>Buckling Metamaterials for Extreme Vibration Damping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Damping mechanical resonances is a formidable challenge in an increasing number of applications. It is shown that allowing buckling of the primary load path can be used to set an upper limit for vibration transmission. In free&#8208;standing mechanical metamaterials, this principle is used to generate extreme vibration damping with very high stiffness, far exceeding typical values for lightweight structural materials.








Abstract
Damping mechanical resonances is a formidable challenge in an increasing number of applications. Many passive damping methods rely on using low stiffness, complex mechanical structures or electrical systems, which render them unfeasible in many of these applications. Herein, a new method for passive vibration damping, by allowing buckling of the primary load path in mechanical metamaterials and lattice structures, is introduced, which sets an upper limit for vibration transmission: the transmitted&#160;acceleration saturates at a maximum value in both tension and compression, no matter what the input acceleration is. This nonlinear mechanism leads to an extreme damping coefficient tan&#948; &#8776; 0.23 in a metal metamaterial&#8212;orders of magnitude larger than the linear damping coefficient of traditional lightweight structural materials. This principle is demonstrated experimentally and numerically in free&#8208;standing rubber and metal mechanical metamaterials over a range of accelerations. It is also shown that damping nonlinearities even allow buckling&#8208;based vibration damping to work in tension, and that bidirectional buckling can further improve its performance. Buckling metamaterials pave the way toward extreme vibration damping without mass or stiffness penalty, and, as such, could be applicable in a multitude of high&#8208;tech applications, including aerospace, vehicles, and sensitive&#160;instruments.

         <title>Delocalized Electronic Engineering of Ni5P4 Nanoroses for Durable Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen heteroatoms are introduced to effectively induce electron delocalization and construction of strong electronegative centers of nickel phosphide, significantly decreasing the energy barrier for efficient oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction in Li&#8211;O2 batteries.








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics and issues associated with the parasitic reactions of cathodes are major obstacles to the large&#8208;scale application of Li&#8211;O2 batteries (LOBs), despite their large theoretical energy density. Therefore, efficient electrocatalyst design is critical for optimizing their performance. Ni5P4 is analyzed theoretically as a cathode material, and the downshift of the d&#8208;band center is found to enhance electron occupation in antibonding orbits, providing a valuable descriptor for understanding and enhancing the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. In this study, it is demonstrated that incorporating additional nitrogen atoms into Ni5P4 nanoroses regulates the electronic structure, resulting in superior electrocatalytic performance in LOBs. Further spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal that the incorporated nitrogen sites can effectively induce localized structure polarization, lowering the energy barrier for the production of desirable intermediates and thus enhancing battery capacity and preventing cell degradation. This approach provides a sound basis for developing advanced electrode materials with optimized electronic structures for high&#8208;performance LOBs.

         <title>A Gas/phototheranostic Nanocomposite Integrates NIR&#8208;II&#8208;Peak Absorbing Aza&#8208;BODIPY with Thermal&#8208;Sensitive Nitric Oxide Donor for Atraumatic Osteosarcoma Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
In this work, an enhanced intramolecular charge transfer mechanism is engineered to obtain the second near&#8208;infrared&#8208;peak (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;peak) absorbing aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BODIPY), combining with a thermal&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide donor to form a gas/phototheranostics. This gas/phototheranostics that combines gas therapy with low&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy executes the therapeutic mechanism of enhanced cell apoptosis for osteosarcoma, simultaneously, achieving an atraumatic therapeutic process.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) has received increasing interest in cancer therapeutics owing to its excellent efficacy and controllability. However, there are two major limitations in PTT applications, which are the tissue penetration depth of lasers within the absorption range of photothermal agents and the unavoidable tissue empyrosis induced by high&#8208;energy lasers. Herein, a gas/phototheranostic nanocomposite (NA1020&#8208;NO@PLX) is engineered that integrates the second near&#8208;infrared&#8208;peak (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;peak) absorbing aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BODIPY,NA1020) with the thermal&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide (NO) donor (S&#8208;nitroso&#8208;N&#8208;acetylpenicillamine, SNAP). An enhanced intramolecular charge transfer mechanism is proposed to achieve the NIR&#8208;II&#8208;peak absorbance (&#955;max = 1020&#160;nm) on NA1020, thereby obtaining its deep tissue penetration depth. The NA1020 exhibits a remarkable photothermal conversion, making it feasible for the deep&#8208;tissue orthotopic osteosarcoma therapy and providing favorable NIR&#8208;II emission to precisely pinpoint the tumor for a visible PTT process. The simultaneously investigated atraumatic therapeutic process with an enhanced cell apoptosis mechanism indicates the feasibility of the synergistic NO/low&#8208;temperature PTT for osteosarcoma. Herein, this gas/phototheranostic strategy optimizes the existing PTT to present a repeatable and atraumatic photothermal therapeutic process for deep&#8208;tissue tumors, validating its potential clinical applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature, Reversible, and Robust Thermochromic Fluorescence Based on Rb2MnBr4(H2O)2 for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature thermochromic fluorescence up to 473 K and robust structural and optical reversibility of 80 cycles are demonstrated in Rb2MnBr4(H2O)2 and related crystals. Such unique features showcase a multicolor anti&#8208;counterfeiting label based on a broad temperature gradient and multidimensional information encryption application.








Abstract
Thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) characterized by noticeable emission color variation with temperature have attracted pervasive attention for their frontier application in stimulus&#8208;response and optical encryption technologies. However, existing TFMs typically suffer from weak PL reversibility as well as limited mild operating temperature and severe temperature PL quenching. PL switching under extreme conditions such as high temperature will undoubtedly improve encryption security, while it is still challenging for present TFMs. In this work, high&#8208;temperature thermochromic fluorescence up to 473 K and robust structural and optical reversibility of 80 cycles are observed in Rb2MnBr4(H2O)2 and related crystals, which is seldom reported for PL changes at such a high temperature. Temperature&#8208;driven nonluminous, red and green light emission states can be achieved at specific temperatures and the modulation mechanism is verified by in situ optical and structural measurements and single particle transition. By virtue of this unique feature, a multicolor anti&#8208;counterfeiting label based on a broad temperature gradient and multidimensional information encryption applications are demonstrated. This work opens a window for the design of inorganic materials with multi&#8208;PL change and the development of advanced encryption strategies with extreme stimuli source.

         <title>All&#8208;Day Multicyclic Atmospheric Water Harvesting Enabled by Polyelectrolyte Hydrogel with Hybrid Desorption Mode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent with free and coordinated hygroscopic salt is described, which exhibits fast sorption due to the large interior osmotic pressure and prevention of salt aggregation and leakage through the strong salt&#8211;polymer electrostatic interactions. By using a multicyclic operation strategy and a hybrid desorption mode, the sorbent achieves high&#8208;yield water production, outperforming single&#8208;cyclic solar&#8208;driven mode by three times.








Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is a promising approach for mitigating worldwide water scarcity. However, reliable water supply driven by sustainable energy regardless of diurnal variation and weather remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. To address this issue, a polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent with an optimal hybrid&#8208;desorption multicyclic&#8208;operation strategy is proposed, achieving all&#8208;day AWH and a significant increase in daily water production. The polyelectrolyte hydrogel possesses a large interior osmotic pressure of 659 atm, which refreshes sorption sites by continuously migrating the sorbed water within its interior, and thus enhancing sorption kinetics. The charged polymeric chains coordinate with hygroscopic salt ions, anchoring the salts and preventing agglomeration and leakage, thereby enhancing cyclic stability. The hybrid desorption mode, which couples solar energy and simulated waste heat, introduces a uniform and adjustable sorbent temperature for achieving all&#8208;day ultrafast water release. With rapid sorption&#8211;desorption kinetics, an optimization model suggests that eight moisture capture&#8211;release cycles are capable of achieving&#160;high water yield of 2410 mLwater kgsorbent&#8722;1 day&#8722;1, up to 3.5 times that of single&#8208;cyclic non&#8208;hybrid modes. The polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent and the coupling with sustainable energy driven desorption mode pave the way for the next&#8208;generation AWH systems, significantly bringing freshwater on a multi&#8208;kilogram scale closer.

         <title>Visualizing Interfacial Energy Offset and Defects in Efficient 2D/3D Heterojunction Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of energy offset and defects with different halide types in 2D perovskite are studied, providing a new approach for designing stable and efficient PSCs. Using 2D/3D perovskite heterojunctions can improve the passivation and charge&#8208;carrier extraction, boosting the efficiency to 25.32% for the small devices and 21.48% for the large module.








Abstract
Currently, the full potential of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is limited by chargecarrier recombination owing to imperfect passivation methods. Here, the recombination loss mechanisms owing to the interfacial energy offset and defects are quantified. The results show that a favorable energy offset can reduce minority carriers and suppress interfacial recombination losses more effectively than chemical passivation. To obtain high&#8208;efficiency PSCs, 2D perovskites are promising candidates, which offer powerful field effects and require only modest chemical passivation at the interface. The enhanced passivation and charge&#8208;carrier extraction offered by the 2D/3D heterojunction PSCs has boosted their power conversion efficiency to 25.32% (certified 25.04%) for small&#8208;size devices and to 21.48% for a large&#8208;area module (with a designated area of 29.0&#160;cm2). Ion migration is also suppressed by the 2D/3D heterojunction, such that the unencapsulated small&#8208;size devices maintain 90% of their initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of continuous operation at the maximum power point.

         <title>Paintable Physical Unclonable Functions using DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA liquid crystals (LCs), which are extracted from nature, biocompatible, and eco&#8208;friendly, are used as a paint for anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels. The entropy&#8208;driven instability in the evaporation process of DNA LCs induces a stochastic birefringent pattern that provides high&#8208;level security codes based on physical unclonable functions. The platform can allow the fabrication&#160;of protective barriers with a simple method, brushstrokes.








Abstract
Controversy over artwork's authenticity is ongoing despite numerous technologies for copyright protection. Artists should build their own ways to protect the authority, but these are still open to piracy. Here, a platform is proposed for developing anticounterfeiting labels based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs), in an artist&#8208;friendly manner, brushstrokes. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which is natural, biocompatible, and eco&#8208;friendly, can be applied as a paint that shows entropy&#8208;driven buckling instability of the liquid crystal phase. Brushed and wholly dried DNA exhibits line&#8208;shaped zig&#8208;zag textures with inherent randomness as a source of the PUF, and its primary performance and reliability are systematically examined. This breakthrough enables the utilization of these drawings in a wider range of applications.

         <title>An Artificial Olfactory System Based on a Chemi&#8208;Memristive Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hysteretic chemi&#8208;memristive gas sensor containing TiO2&#8208;nanorod memristors based on oxygen vacancy dynamics different from that of conventional sensors is developed. Analog conductance modulation based on the redox reaction with external gas molecules in a ruptured filament area after memristive switching converts external gas stimuli into synaptic weights to realize an artificial olfactory system.








Abstract
Technologies based on the fusion of gas sensors and neuromorphic computing to mimic the olfactory system have immense potential. However, the implementation of neuromorphic olfactory systems remains in a state of infancy because conventional gas sensors lack the necessary functions. Therefore, this study proposes a hysteretic &#8220;chemi&#8208;memristive gas sensor&#8221; based on oxygen vacancy chemi&#8208;memristive dynamics that differ from that of conventional gas sensors. After the memristive switching operation, the redox reaction with the external gas molecules is enhanced, resulting in the generation and elimination of oxygen vacancies that induce rapid current changes. In addition, the pre&#8208;generated oxygen vacancies enhance the post&#8208;sensing properties. Therefore, fast responses, short recovery times, and hysteretic gas response are achieved by the proposed sensor at room temperature. Based on the advantageous functionality of the sensor, device&#8208;level olfactory systems that can monitor the history of input gas stimuli are experimentally demonstrated as a potential application. Moreover, analog conductance modulation induced by oxidizing and reducing gases enables the conversion of external gas stimuli into synaptic weights and hence the realization of typical synaptic functionalities without an additional device or circuit. The proposed chemi&#8208;memristive device represents an advance in the bioinspired technology adopted in creating artificial intelligence systems.

         <title>Seeded Synthesis of Hollow PdSn Intermetallic Nanomaterials for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Glycerol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seeded method is developed to prepare hollow PdSn intermetallic nanoparticles, i.e., orthorhombic Pd2Sn and monoclinic Pd3Sn2, based on rational modulation of phase and morphology. The obtained hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn nanoparticles with modified electronic structure, high intrinsic activity, and abundant active sites exhibit excellent catalytic performances toward electrochemical glycerol oxidation, outperforming hollow monoclinic Pd3Sn2 and solid orthorhombic Pd2Sn nanoparticles.








Abstract
Intermetallic nanomaterials have shown promising potential as high&#8208;performance catalysts in various catalytic reactions due to their unconventional crystal phases with ordered atomic arrangements. However, controlled synthesis of intermetallic nanomaterials with tunable crystal phases and unique hollow morphologies remains a challenge. Here, a seeded method is developed to synthesize hollow PdSn intermetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with two different intermetallic phases, that is, orthorhombic Pd2Sn and monoclinic Pd3Sn2. Benefiting from the rational regulation of the crystal phase and morphology, the obtained hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn NPs deliver excellent electrocatalytic performance toward glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), outperforming solid orthorhombic Pd2Sn NPs, hollow monoclinic Pd3Sn2 NPs, and commercial Pd/C, which places it among the best reported Pd&#8208;based GOR electrocatalysts. The reaction mechanism of GOR using the hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn as the catalyst is investigated by operando infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, which reveals that the hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn catalyst cleaves the C&#63743;C bond more easily compared to the commercial Pd/C. This work can pave an appealing route to the controlled synthesis of diverse novel intermetallic nanomaterials with hollow morphology for various promising applications.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Molecular Dynamics Elucidates the Mechanics of Reinforcement in Graphene&#8208;Based Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of reinforcement of polymer materials by graphene&#8208;based inclusions is highly important for the design of high&#8208;performance composites. Very large molecular simulations show that single graphene layers can effectively reinforce the polymer matrix via a shear&#8208;lag process down to flake sizes of 500 nm, as long as the flake is predominantly flat. However, even small undulations of the surface substantially degrade the enhancement of materials properties.








Abstract
Using very large&#8208;scale classical molecular dynamics, the mechanics of nano&#8208;reinforcement of graphene&#8208;based nanocomposites are &#160;examined. Simulations show that significant quantities of large, defect&#8208;free, and predominantly flat graphene flakes are required for successful enhancement of materials properties in excellent agreement with experimental and proposed continuum shear&#8208;lag theories. The critical lengths for enhancement are approximately 500 nm for graphene and 300 nm and for graphene oxide (GO). The reduction of Young's modulus in GO results in a much smaller enhancement of the composite's Young's modulus. The simulations reveal that the flakes should be aligned and planar for optimal reinforcement. Undulations substantially degrade the enhancement of materials properties.

         <title>Polyimides Physically Crosslinked by Aromatic Molecules Exhibit Ultrahigh Energy Density at 200&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D rigid aromatic molecules are introduced into aromatic polyimides to form physical crosslinking networks through electrostatic interactions between their oppositely charged phenyl groups. The dense physical crosslinking networks strengthen the polyimides to boost breakdown strength and trap charge carriers to suppress dielectric loss. An ultrahigh Ud of 5.12&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and superior cyclic stability at 200&#160;&#176;C are achieved in the all&#8208;organic composites.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics possess significant advantages in electrostatic energy storage applications, such as high breakdown strength (Eb) and efficiency (&#951;), while their discharged energy density (Ud) at high temperature is limited by the decrease in Eb and &#951;. Several strategies including introducing inorganic components and crosslinking have been investigated to improve the Ud of polymer dielectrics, but new issues will be encountered, e.g., the sacrifice of flexibility, the degradation of the interfacial insulating property and the complex preparation process. In this work, 3D rigid aromatic molecules are introduced into aromatic polyimides to form physical crosslinking networks through electrostatic interactions between their oppositely charged phenyl groups. The dense physical crosslinking networks strengthen the polyimides to boost the Eb, and the aromatic molecules trap the charge carriers to suppress the loss, allowing the strategy to combine the advantages of inorganic incorporation and crosslinking. This study demonstrates that this strategy is well applicable to a number of representative aromatic polyimides, and ultrahigh Ud of 8.05&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 (150&#160;&#176;C) and 5.12&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 (200&#160;&#176;C) is achieved. Furthermore, the all&#8208;organic composites exhibit stable performances during ultralong 105 charge&#8211;discharge cycles in harsh environments (500&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1 and 200&#160;&#176;C) and prospects for large&#8208;scale preparation.

         <title>Electrocatalysts for Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries Featuring Single Molybdenum Atoms in a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of multicomponent core&#8211;shell structures presents a versatile route to produce bifunctional molybdenum&#8208;based single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalysts. Zinc&#8211;air batteries with such multicomponent single&#8208;atom catalysts deliver high power density (&#8776;376.4&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) and a long cycle life of over 630&#160;h, significantly outperforming noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmarks.








Abstract
Bifunctional catalysts can facilitate two different electrochemical reactions with conflicting characteristics. Here, a highly reversible bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) is reported featuring a &#8220;core&#8211;shell structure&#8221; in which N&#8208;doped graphene sheets wrap around vanadium molybdenum oxynitride nanoparticles. Single Mo atoms are released from the particle core during synthesis and anchored to electronegative N&#8208;dopant species in the graphitic shell. The resultant Mo single&#8208;atom catalysts excel as active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) sites in pyrrolic&#8208;N and as active oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) sites in pyridinic&#8208;N environments. ZABs with such bifunctional and multicomponent single&#8208;atom catalysts deliver high power density (&#8776;376.4&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) and long cycle life of over 630&#160;h, outperforming noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmarks. Flexible ZABs that can tolerate a wide range of temperatures (&#8722;20 to 80&#160;&#176;C) under severe mechanical deformation are also demonstrated

         <title>An Ultrafast, Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrochromic and Thermochromic Device for Smart Windows</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through innovative molecular design and advanced device optimization, a high&#8208;performance electrochromic device is achieved, demonstrating high transparency, rapid color&#8208;switching, and excellent stability. In conjunction with the creation of a thermoresponsive gel electrolyte, an electro&#8208; and thermochromic device is realized, exhibiting flame&#8208;retardant properties and energy&#8208;saving characteristics. Such an advanced device equips smart windows with energy efficiency, privacy protection, and decorative enhancements.








Abstract
Smart windows nowadays undertake the esteemed obligation of reducing energy consumption as well as upgrading living experience. This project aims to devise a smart window that responds to both electricity and heat, with the intention of achieving energy efficiency, privacy preservation, and enhanced decorative attributes. Through the implementation of a novel electrochromic material design, coupled with the optimization of electrochromic devices (ECDs), a high&#8208;performance ECD is obtained, demonstrating coloring/bleaching time of 0.53/0.16&#160;s, a transmittance modulation of 78% (from 99% to 21%), and superior performance in six dimensions. Furthermore, temperature&#8208;responsive units and an ionic liquid are incorporated into the electrolyte system to create a novel thermochromic gel electrolyte with transmittance modulation from 80% to 0%, and excellent thermal insulation (6.4&#160;&#176;C reduction). Ultimately, an electro&#8208; and thermochromic device is developed, featuring an ultrafast color&#8208;switching speed of 0.82/0.60&#160;s and multiple working modes. Overall, this work showcases a prospective design pathway for the development of next&#8208;generation ultrafast&#8208;switching, and energy&#8208;efficient intelligent windows.

         <title>Constructing Oxygen&#8208;Related Defects in Carbon Nanodots with Janus Optical Properties: Noninvasive NIR Fluorescent Imaging and Effective Photocatalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;related defects with unpaired electrons are constructed in carbon dots via post&#8208;oxidation with 2&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid, which not only contribute to the enhanced near&#8208;infrared (NIR) bandgap emission but also act as trappers for photoexcited electrons to promote efficient charge separation on the surface, leading to noninvasive NIR fluorescent imaging and effective photocatalytic therapy.








Abstract
Noninvasive fluorescence (FL) imaging and high&#8208;performance photocatalytic therapy (PCT) are opposing optical properties that are difficult to combine in a single material system. Herein, a facile approach to introducing oxygen&#8208;related defects in carbon dots (CDs) via post&#8208;oxidation with 2&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid is reported, in which some nitrogen atoms are substituted by oxygen atoms. Unpaired electrons in these oxygen&#8208;related defects rearrange the electronic structure of the oxidized CDs (ox&#8208;CDs), resulting in an emerging near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption band. These defects not only contribute to enhanced NIR bandgap emission but also act as trappers for photoexcited electrons to promote efficient charge separation on the surface, leading to abundant photo&#8208;generated holes on the ox&#8208;CDs surface under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Under white LED torch irradiation, the photo&#8208;generated holes oxidize hydroxide to hydroxyl radicals in the acidification of the aqueous solution. In contrast, no hydroxyl radicals are detected in the ox&#8208;CDs aqueous solution under 730&#160;nm laser irradiation, indicating noninvasive NIR FL imaging potential. Utilizing the Janus optical properties of the ox&#8208;CDs, the in vivo NIR FL imaging of sentinel lymph nodes around tumors and efficient photothermal enhanced tumor PCT are demonstrated.

         <title>Multifunctional Flexible Sensor Based on PU&#8208;TA@MXene Janus Architecture for Selective Direction Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the asymmetric structural features and functions of finger skin, an innovative PU&#8208;TA@MXene sensing film with bionic Janus architecture is proposed by a simple but ingenious gravity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy, and the derived flexible sensor reveals strong mechanical properties, self&#8208;healing ability, and well&#8208;selective response behavior to normal pressure, stretching, and directional bending.








Abstract
Multifunctional selectivity and mechanical properties are always a focus of attention in the field of flexible sensors. In particular, the construction of biomimetic architecture for sensing materials can endow the fabricated sensors with intrinsic response features and extra&#8208;derived functions. Here, inspired by the asymmetric structural features of human skin, a novel tannic acid (TA)&#8208;modified MXene&#8208;polyurethane film with a bionic Janus architecture is proposed, which is prepared by gravity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly for the gradient dispersion of 2D TA@MXene nanosheets into a PU network. This obtained film reveals strong mechanical properties of a superior elongation at a break of 2056.67% and an ultimate tensile strength of 50.78&#160;MPa with self&#8208;healing performance. Moreover, the Janus architecture can lead to a selective multifunctional response of flexible sensors to directional bending, pressure, and stretching. Combined with a machine learning module, the sensor is endowed with high recognition rates for force detection (96.1%). Meanwhile, direction identification in rescue operations and human movement monitoring can be realized by this sensor. This work offers essential research value and practical significance for the material structures, mechanical properties, and application platforms of flexible sensors.

         <title>Thin&#8208;Film Organic Heteroepitaxy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating crystalline organic semiconductors into electronic devices requires understanding of heteroepitaxy given the ubiquity of heterojunctions in these devices. However, rules for heteroepitaxy of molecular systems have not been fully clarified. In this work, one&#8208;to&#8208;one commensurate heteroepitaxy is demonstrated and it is shown that the lattice matched plane of the adcrystal must also be its lowest energy surface.








Abstract
Incorporating crystalline organic semiconductors into electronic devices requires understanding of heteroepitaxy given the ubiquity of heterojunctions in these devices. However, while rules for commensurate epitaxy of covalent or ionic inorganic material systems are known to be dictated by lattice matching constraints, rules for heteroepitaxy of molecular systems are still being written. Here, it is found that lattice matching alone is insufficient to achieve heteroepitaxy in molecular systems, owing to weak intermolecular forces that describe molecular crystals. It is found that, in addition, the lattice matched plane also must be the lowest energy surface of the adcrystal to achieve one&#8208;to&#8208;one commensurate molecular heteroepitaxy over a large area. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrates the lattice matched interface to be of higher electronic quality than a disordered interface of the same materials.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Electrochemically Promoting Lithium Atom Diffusion and Relieving Accumulative Stress for Deep&#8208;Cycling Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tensile stress can be incorporated into lithium metal anodes to reduce lithium atom diffusion energy barrier by designing an adhesive copolymer layer attached to lithium through copolymer thinning. Elastic lithium metal anode (ELMA) is further prepared via introducing a 3D elastic conductive polyurethane (CPU) host for the copolymer&#8208;lithium bilayer to release accumulated internal stresses and resist volume variation.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) can double the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the notorious lithium dendrite growth and large volume change are not well addressed, especially under deep cycling. Here, an in&#8211;situ mechanical&#8211;electrochemical coupling system is built, and it is found that tensile stress can induce smooth lithium deposition. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation and finite element method (FEM) simulation confirm that the lithium atom diffusion energy barrier can be reduced when the lithium foils are under tensile strain. Then tensile stress is incorporated into lithium metal anodes by designing an adhesive copolymer layer attached to lithium in which the copolymer thinning can yield tensile stress to the lithium foil. Elastic lithium metal anode (ELMA) is further prepared via introducing a 3D elastic conductive polyurethane (CPU) host for the copolymer&#8211;lithium bilayer to release accumulated internal stresses and resist volume variation. The ELMA can withstand hundreds of compression&#8208;release cycles under 10% strain. LMBs paired with ELMA and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode can operate beyond 250 cycles with 80% capacity retention under practical condition of 4 mAh cm&#8722;2 cathode capacity, 2.86&#160;g Ah&#8722;1 electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio (E/C) and 1.8 negative&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio (N/P), five times of the lifetime using lithium foils.

         <title>Flexible Modulation of Cellular Activities with Cationic Photosensitizers: Insights of Alkyl Chain Length on Reactive Oxygen Species Antimicrobial Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cationic aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) derivatives (CABs) with berberine (BBR) cores with different length alkyl chains are successfully designed for different binding, localization, and photodynamic killing effects among bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells. Moderate length alkyl chains enable CABs to effectively kill Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and fungi with light, while still maintaining excellent mammalian cell and blood compatibility.








Abstract
Cationic photosensitizers have good binding ability with negatively charged bacteria and fungi, exhibiting broad applications potential in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). However, cationic photosensitizers often display unsatisfactory transkingdom selectivity between mammalian cells and pathogens, especially for eukaryotic fungi. It is unclear which biomolecular sites are more efficient for photodynamic damage, owing to the lack of systematic research with the same photosensitizer system. Herein, a series of cationic aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) derivatives (CABs) (using berberine (BBR) as the photosensitizers core) with different length alkyl chains are successfully designed and synthesized for flexible modulation of cellular activities. The BBR core can efficiently produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and achieve high&#8208;performance aPDT . Through the precise regulation of alkyl chain length, different bindings, localizations, and photodynamic killing effects of CABs are achieved and investigated systematically among bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells. It is found that intracellular active substances, not membranes, are more efficient damage sites of aPDT. Moderate length alkyl chains enable CABs to effectively kill Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and fungi with light, while still maintaining excellent mammalian cell and blood compatibility. This study is expected to provide systematic theoretical and strategic research guidance for the construction of high&#8208;performance cationic photosensitizers with good transkingdom selectivity.

         <title>Multienzyme&#8208;Mimicking LaCoO3 Nanotrigger for Programming Cancer&#8208;Cell Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide&#8208;based nanocrystals are developed to trigger the generation of aberrant reactive oxygen species, release of La ions, and the activation of inflammasomes to induce pyroptosis&#8208;mediated cell death and inhibit metastasis during lung cancer.








Abstract
Pyroptosis, a distinct paradigm of programmed cell death, is an efficient strategy against cancer by overcoming resistance to apoptosis. In this study, LaCoO3 (LCO) lanthanide&#8208;based nanocrystals with multienzyme characteristics are rationally designed and engineered to trigger the generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the release of lanthanum ions, ultimately inducing lung cancer cell pyroptosis. The peroxidase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;mimicking activities of LCO nanocrystals endow LCO with ROS production capacity in tumor tissues with an acidic pH and high hydrogen peroxide content. Concurrently, the LCO nanoenzyme exhibits catalase&#8208; and glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like activities, reversing the hypoxic microenvironment, destroying the activated antioxidant system of tumor cells, and amplifying the sensitivity of tumor cells to ROS. The use of ultrasound further accelerates the enzymatic kinetic rate. Most importantly, the La3+ ions released by LCO robustly destroy the lysosomal membrane, finally inducing canonical pyroptotic cell death, together with ROS. LCO&#8208;nanocrystal&#8208;triggered programmed cell pyroptosis amplifies the therapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo, effectively restraining lung cancer growth and metastasis. This study paves a new avenue for the efficient treatment of lung cancer and metastasis through US&#8208;enhanced lanthanum&#8208;based nanoenzyme platforms and pyroptotic cell death.

In this study, LaCoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (LCO) lanthanide-based nanocrystals with multienzyme characteristics are rationally designed and engineered to trigger the generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the release of lanthanum ions, ultimately inducing lung cancer cell pyroptosis. The peroxidase- and oxidase-mimicking activities of LCO nanocrystals endow LCO with ROS production capacity in tumor tissues with an acidic pH and high hydrogen peroxide content. Concurrently, the LCO nanoenzyme exhibits catalase- and glutathione peroxidase-like activities, reversing the hypoxic microenvironment, destroying the activated antioxidant system of tumor cells, and amplifying the sensitivity of tumor cells to ROS. The use of ultrasound further accelerates the enzymatic kinetic rate. Most importantly, the La&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions released by LCO robustly destroy the lysosomal membrane, finally inducing canonical pyroptotic cell death, together with ROS. LCO-nanocrystal-triggered programmed cell pyroptosis amplifies the therapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo, effectively restraining lung cancer growth and metastasis. This study paves a new avenue for the efficient treatment of lung cancer and metastasis through US-enhanced lanthanum-based nanoenzyme platforms and pyroptotic cell death.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Polarization Strategy for Enhanced Acidic Oxygen Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;polarization&#8208;mediated strategy to create a net ferromagnetic moment in antiferromagnetic RuO2 via dilute manganese (Mn2+) (S = 5/2) doping for enhancing OER activity in acidic electrolyte is reported, wherein Mn&#8208;RuO2 nanoflakes exhibit a strongly magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced OER activity.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarization is known as a promising way to promote the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), since the intermediates and products endow spin&#8208;dependent behaviors, yet it is rarely reported for ferromagnetic catalysts toward acidic OER practically used in industry. Herein, the first spin&#8208;polarization&#8208;mediated strategy is reported to create a net ferromagnetic moment in antiferromagnetic RuO2 via dilute manganese (Mn2+) (S = 5/2) doping for enhancing OER activity in acidic electrolyte. Element&#8208;selective X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism reveals the ferromagnetic coupling between Mn and Ru ions, fulfilling the Goodenough&#8211;Kanamori rule. The ferromagnetism behavior at room temperature can be well interpreted by first principles calculations as the interaction between the Mn2+ impurity and Ru ions. Indeed, Mn&#8208;RuO2 nanoflakes exhibit a strongly magnetic field enhanced OER activity, with the lowest overpotential of 143&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cmgeo&#8722;2 and negligible activity decay in 480&#160;h stability (vs 200&#160;mV/195&#160;h without magnetic field) as known for magnetic effects in the literature. The intrinsic turnover frequency is also improved to reach 5.5 s&#8722;1 at 1.45 VRHE. This work highlights an important avenue of spin&#8208;engineering strategy for designing efficient acidic oxygen evolution catalysts.

         <title>Eye&#8208;Mimicked Neural Network Composed of Photosensitive Neural Spheroids with Human Opsin Proteins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eye&#8208;to&#8208;brain mimicking model is designed with photosensitive neural spheroid and neural network. In the photosensitive neural spheroid, human opins such as rhodopsin and short&#8208;wavelength opsin are reacted by the specific wavelength of light with selective sensitivity. Photonic reaction result in the neural response, of which signal spread to other neurons through axons.








Abstract
An&#160;in vitro model, composed of the short&#8208;wavelength human opsins and rhodopsins, is created. Two types of photosensitive neural spheroids are transfected for selective reaction under bluish&#8208;purple and green lights. These are employed to two devices with intact neuron and neural&#8208;spheroid to study the interaction. By photostimulation, the photosensitive spheroid initiated photoactivation, and the signal generated from its body is transmitted to adjacent neural networks. Specifically, the signal traveled through the axon bundle in narrow gap from photosensitive spheroid to intact spheroid as an eye&#8208;to&#8208;brain model including optic nerve. The whole process with photosensitive spheroid is monitored by calcium ion detecting fluorescence images. The results of this study can be applied to examine vision restoration and novel photosensitive biological systems with spectral sensitivity.

         <title>Optical Fibers Embedded with As&#8208;Grown Carbon Nanotubes for Ultrahigh Nonlinear Optical Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with narrow diameter distribution on the inner walls of photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) by a two&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is developed. By using the as&#8208;fabricated 3&#8208;cm&#8208;long CNT&#8208;fibers with desirable nanotube optical transitions, both third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG)&#160;has been largely enhanced and mode&#8208;locked ultrafast laser has been fabricated with a stable output of &#8776;10&#160;mW, &#8776;800 fs pulse width, and &#8776;71&#160;MHz repetition rate.








Abstract
Photonic crystal fiber (PCF) embedded with functional materials has demonstrated diverse applications ranging from ultrafast lasers, optical communication to chemical sensors. Many efforts have been made to fabricating carbon nanotube (CNT) based optical fibers by ex situ transfer method; however, often suffer poor uniformity and coverage. Here, the direct growth of CNTs on the inner walls of PCFs by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD)&#160;method is reported. A two&#8208;step growth method is&#160;developed to control the narrow diameter distribution of CNTs to ensure desirable nanotube optical transitions. In the as&#8208;fabricated CNT&#8208; embedded fiber, third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG)&#160;has been enhanced by &#8776;15 times compared with flat CNT film on fused silica. A dual&#8208;wavelength all&#8208;fiber mode&#8208;locked ultrafast laser (&#8776;1561 and &#8776;1064&#160;nm) is further demonstrated by integrating the 1.36&#177;0.15&#160;nm&#8208;diameter CNTs into two kinds of photonic bandgap hollow core PCF&#160;(named HC&#8208;1550 and HC&#8208;1060) as saturable absorbers, using their S11 (&#8776;0.7&#160;eV) and S22 (&#8776;1.2&#160;eV) interband transition respectively. The fiber laser shows stable output of &#8776;10&#160;mW, &#8776;800 fs pulse width, and &#8776;71&#160;MHz repetition rate at 1561&#160;nm wavelength. These&#160;results can enable the large&#8208;scale applications of CNTs in PCF&#8208;based optical devices.

         <title>New Function of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework: Structurally Ordered Metal Promoter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A targeted post&#8208;modification strategy is developed to anchor dozen kinds of metal ions into metal&#8211;organic framework composites as structurally ordered metal promoters, which not only contributes to constructing ideal catalyst models for elucidating action mechanism of metal promoters during the catalytic process, but also provides a universal method to synthesize high&#8208;efficiency catalysts.








Abstract
The remarkable roles of metal promoters have been known for nearly a century, but it is still a challenge to find a suitable structure model to reveal the action mechanism behind metal promoters. Herein, a new function of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is developed as an ideal model to construct structurally ordered metal promoters by a targeted post&#8208;modification strategy. MOFs as model not only favor clearing the real action mechanism behind metal promoters, but also can anchor one or multiple kinds of metal promoters especially noble metal promoters. Typically, the as&#8208;prepared Pd/bpy&#8208;UiO&#8208;Cu catalysts show high selectivity (&gt;99%) toward 4&#8208;nitrophenylethane in 4&#8208;nitrostyrene hydrogenation, mainly due to the enhanced interaction between Pd nanoparticles and MOF carriers induced by Cu promoters, thus inhibiting the hydrogenation of 4&#8208;nitrophenylethane. This strategy with flexibility and universality will open up a new route to synthesize efficient catalysts with structurally ordered metal promoters.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Mechanical Bilayer Metamaterial with Global Area&#8208;Preserving Density Tunability for Acoustic Wave Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presented 2D metamaterial consists of two layers that are actuated separately by a remotely applied magnetic field. This novel bilayer design strategy enables the adjustment of the area density while simultaneously preserving the overall dimensions. These designs can be further exploited in acoustic applications, including highly tunable bandgaps and waveguides.








Abstract
2D metamaterials have immense potential in acoustics, optics, and electromagnetic applications due to their unique properties and ability to conform to curved substrates. Active metamaterials have attracted significant research attention because of their on&#8208;demand tunable properties and performances through shape reconfigurations. 2D active metamaterials often achieve active properties through internal structural deformations, which lead to changes in overall dimensions. This demands corresponding alterations of the conforming substrate, or the metamaterial fails to provide complete area coverage, which can be a significant limitation for their practical applications. To date, achieving area&#8208;preserving active 2D metamaterials with distinct shape reconfigurations remains a prominent challenge. In this paper, magneto&#8208;mechanical bilayer metamaterials are presented that demonstrate area density tunability with area&#8208;preserving capability. The bilayer metamaterials consist of two arrays of magnetic soft materials with distinct magnetization distributions. Under a magnetic field, each layer behaves differently, which allows the metamaterial to reconfigure its shape into multiple modes and to significantly tune its area density without changing its overall dimensions. The area&#8208;preserving multimodal shape reconfigurations are further exploited as active acoustic wave regulators to tune bandgaps and wave propagations. The bilayer approach thus provides a new concept for the design of area&#8208;preserving active metamaterials for broader applications.

         <title>Induction of Tumor Ferroptosis&#8208;Dependent Immunity via an Injectable Attractive Pickering Emulsion Gel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;in&#8208;oil Pickering emulsion gel is developed to deliver RSL&#8208;3, a ferroptosis inducer dissolved in iodized oil, and programmed death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)&#160;antibody, an immune checkpoint inhibitor dissolved in water. RSL&#8208;3 + PD&#8208;1@gel induces ferroptosis of tumor cells through cascade amplification and elicits antitumor immune responses via accumulation of helper T lymphocyte cells and cytotoxic T cells in tumors with low immunogenicity.








Abstract
The combination of ferroptosis inducers and immune checkpoint blockade can enhance antitumor effects. However, the efficacy in tumors with low immunogenicity requires further investigation. In this work, a water&#8208;in&#8208;oil Pickering emulsion gel is developed to deliver (1S, 3R)&#8208;RSL&#8208;3 (RSL&#8208;3), a ferroptosis inducer dissolved in iodized oil, and programmed death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1) antibody, the most commonly used immune checkpoint inhibitor dissolved in water, with optimal characteristics (RSL&#8208;3 + PD&#8208;1@gel). Tumor lipase degrades the continuous oil phase, which results in the slow release of RSL&#8208;3&#160;and PD&#8208;1&#160;antibody and a notable antitumor effect against low&#8208;immunogenic hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. Intriguingly, the RSL&#8208;3 + PD&#8208;1@gel induces ferroptosis of tumor cells, resulting in antitumor immune response via accumulation of helper T lymphocyte cells and cytotoxic T cells. Additionally, the single&#8208;cell sequence profiling analysis during tumor treatment reveals the induction of ferroptosis in tumor cells together with strong antitumor immune response in ascites.

         <title>Strong Magnetically&#8208;Responsive Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence and X&#8208;Ray Scintillation in Ultrarobust Mn(II)&#8211;Organic Helical Chains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrarobust helical Mn(II)&#8208;organic polymers are developed to realize magnetically&#8208;responsive circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) with exceptionally high performance (&#934;PL&#160;=&#160;89%, glum&#160;=&#160;0.021) as well as triboluminescence and excellent X&#8208;ray scintillation activity.&#160;We&#160;have disclosed that the magnetic field has a remarkably high negative effect on CPP for Mn(II) materials, suppressing the CPP signal noticeably.








Abstract
Over recent years, Mn(II)&#8208;organic materials showing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have attracted great interest because of their eco&#8208;friendliness, cheapness, and room temperature phosphorescence. Using the helicity design strategy, herein, chiral Mn(II)&#8208;organic helical polymers are constructed featuring long&#8208;lived circularly polarized phosphorescence with exceptionally high glum and &#934;PL magnitudes of 0.021% and 89%, respectively, while remaining ultrarobust toward humidity, temperature, and X&#8208;rays. Equally important, it is disclosed for the first time that the magnetic field has a remarkably high negative effect on CPL for Mn(II) materials, suppressing the CPL signal by 4.2&#8208;times at B&#8407;$\vec{B}$&#160;=&#160;1.6&#160;T. Using the designed materials, UV&#8208;pumped CPL light&#8208;emitting diodes are fabricated, demonstrating enhanced optical selectivity under right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed polarization conditions. On top of all this, the reported materials display bright triboluminescence and excellent X&#8208;ray scintillation activity with a perfectly linear X&#8208;ray dose rate response up to 174&#160;&#181;Gyair&#160;s&#8722;1. Overall, these observations significantly contribute to the CPL phenomenon for multi&#8208;spin compounds and promote the design of highly efficient and stable Mn(II)&#8208;based CPL emitters.

         <title>Sequential Molecule&#8208;Doped Hole Conductor to Achieve &gt;23% Perovskite Solar Cells with 3000&#8208;Hour Operational Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of solution&#8208;processed doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD hole transport layers (HTLs) is being held back by poor stability and unsatisfied scalability. Herein, a versatile molecular implantation&#8208;assisted sequential doping approach is developed to improve the spatial doping uniformity and fabricate all&#8208;evaporated HTL. The resultant devices achieve a record efficiency of 23.4%, and exhibit impressive stability both in ambient and working conditions.








Abstract
Although hole transport layers (HTLs) based on solution&#8208;processed doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD are extremely popular and effective for their remarkable performance in n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their scalable application is still being held back by poor chemical stability and unsatisfied scalability. Essentially, the volatile components and hygroscopic nature of ionic salts often cause morphological deformation that deteriorate both device efficiency and stability. Herein, a simple and effective molecular implantation&#8208;assisted sequential doping (MISD) approach is strategically introduced to modulate spatial doping uniformity of organic films and fabricate all evaporated Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD layer in which phase&#8208;segregation free HTL is achieved accompanied with high molecular density, uniform doping composition, and superior optoelectronic characteristics. The resultant MISD&#8208;based devices attain a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.4%, which represents the highest reported value among all the PSCs with evaporated HTLs. Simultaneously, the unencapsulated devices realize considerably enhanced stability by maintaining over 90% of their initial PCEs in the air for 5200&#160;h and after working at maximum power point under illumination for 3000&#160;h. This method provides a facile way to fabricate robust and reliable HTLs toward developing efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Extracellular Vesicles&#8208;Derived Hybrid Nanoplatforms for Amplified CD47 Blockade&#8208;Based Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid nanoplatforms are designed by fusing M1 macrophage extracellular vesicles with drug&#8208;loaded liposomes and decorating them with RS17 peptide, an antitumor peptide that specifically binds to CD47 on tumor cells and blocks CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling, which enables amplified CD47 blockade&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy through combinational treatment strategy.








Abstract
Immunomodulation of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) into tumor&#8208;inhibiting M1&#8208;like phenotype is a promising but challenging strategy. Cleverly, tumor cells overexpress CD47, a &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal that ligates with the signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP&#945;) on macrophages to escape phagocytosis. Thus, effective re&#8208;education of TAMs into the &#8220;eat me&#8221; type and blocking the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling play pivotal roles in tumor immunotherapy. Herein, it is reported that hybrid nanovesicles (hEL&#8208;RS17) derived from extracellular vesicles of M1 macrophages and decorated with RS17 peptide, an antitumor peptide that specifically binds to CD47 on tumor cells and blocks CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling, can actively target tumor cells and remodel TAM phenotypes. Consequently, more M1&#8208;like TAMs infiltrate into tumor tissue to phagocytize more tumor cells due to CD47 blockade. By further co&#8208;encapsulating chemotherapeutic agent shikonin, photosensitizer IR820, and immunomodulator polymetformin in hEL&#8208;RS17, an enhanced antitumor effect is obtained due to the combinational treatment modality and close synergy among each component. Upon laser irradiation, the designed SPI@hEL&#8208;RS17 nanoparticles exert potent antitumor efficacy against both 4T1 breast tumor and B16F10 melanoma models, which not only suppresses primary tumor growth but also inhibits lung metastasis and prevents tumor recurrence, exhibiting great potential in boosting CD47 blockade&#8208;based antitumor immunotherapy.

         <title>A Carbon Aerogel Lightweight Al Battery for Fast Storage of Fluctuating Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel lightweight Al battery is constructed using a dendrite&#8208;free carbon aerogel film (CAF) anode and a high&#8208;loading integrated graphite composite carbon aerogel film (GCAF) cathode. O&#8208;containing functional groups on the CAF induce Al deposition. The zero&#8208;volume expansion of the GCAF results in better stability. A CAF&#8214;GCAF full battery exhibits excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance toward fast storage of fluctuating electricity.








Abstract
Al batteries have great potential for renewable energy storage owing to their low cost, high capacity, and safety. High energy density and adaptability to fluctuating electricity are major challenges. Here, a lightweight Al battery for fast storage of fluctuating energy is constructed based on a novel hierarchical porous dendrite&#8208;free carbon aerogel film (CAF) anode and an integrated graphite composite carbon aerogel film (GCAF) cathode. A new induced mechanism by the O&#8208;containing functional groups on the CAF anode is con&#8208;firmed for uniform Al deposition. The GCAF cathode possesses a higher mass utilization ratio due to the extremely high loading mass (9.5&#8211;10.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) of graphite materials compared to conventional coated cathodes. Meanwhile, the volume expansion of the GCAF cathode is almost negligible, resulting in better cycling stability. The lightweight CAF&#8214;GCAF full battery can adapt well to large and fluctuating current densities owing to its hierarchical porous structure. A large discharge capacity (115.6 mAh g&#8722;1) after 2000 cycles and a short charge time (7.0&#160;min) at a high current density are obtained. The construction strategy of lightweight Al batteries based on carbon aerogel electrodes can promote the breakthrough of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Al batteries adapted to the fast storage of fluctuating renewable energy.

         <title>How to Adequately Describe Full Range Intercalation&#8212;A Two&#8208;Sided Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate description of the cell voltage of an intercalation electrode succeeds by applying defect thermodynamics near the ordered compositions. At large deviations thermodynamic interpolation (as indicated in the figure) or non&#8208;ideal statistics is required. Literature data on nanocrystalline LixFePO4 are reproduced where the entire range is realized, but other materials can be described analogously (i, n, v, and p stand for interstitial Li+, excess electrons, Li+ vacancies, electron holes; C&#948; denotes the chemical capacitance; electronic defects are not shown in the figure).








Abstract
One of the key challenges in battery research is to quantitatively describe the intercalation storage capacity as a function of the reversible cell voltage. The reason that such endeavors are not yet very successful, lies in the lack of an adequate charge carrier treatment. Using the most challenging example of nanocrystalline lithium iron phosphate, where the full range from FePO4 to LiFePO4 is accessible without miscibility gap, this study shows how a quantitative description of literature results can be achieved even for such a huge window. For this purpose, point&#8208;defect thermodynamics is applied and the problem is tackled from the two end&#8208;member sides including saturation effects. A first, rather heuristic treatment interpolates in&#8208;between using the safe thermodynamic criterion of local phase stability. Already this straightforward approach works very satisfactorily. In order to also gain mechanistic insight, interactions among and between ions and electrons have to be taken account of. This study shows how to implement them into the analysis.

         <title>Quantifying Charge Extraction and Recombination Using the Rise and Decay of the Transient Photovoltage of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rise time of transient photovoltage measurements on halide perovskite solar cells is used to quantify charge extraction. As the decay time of the photovoltage can be used to quantify recombination, the combination of rise and decay provides a complete analysis of recombination and extraction and its impact on photovoltaic performance.








Abstract
The extraction of photogenerated charge carriers and the generation of a photovoltage belong to the fundamental functionalities of any solar cell. These processes happen not instantaneously but rather come with finite time constants, e.g., a time constant related to the rise of the externally measured open circuit voltage following a short light pulse. Herein, a new method to analyze transient photovoltage measurements at different bias light intensities combining rise and decay times of the photovoltage. The approach uses a linearized version of a system of two coupled differential equations that are solved analytically by determining the eigenvalues of a 2&#160;&#215;&#160;2 matrix. By comparison between the eigenvalues and the measured rise and decay times during a transient photovoltage measurement, the rates of carrier recombination and extraction as a function of bias voltage are determined, and establish a simple link between their ratio and the efficiency losses in the perovskite solar cell.

         <title>Supported Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom and Clustered Catalysts Outperform Benchmark Pt for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium cobalt oxide substrate provides active sites for the dissociation of water, and the generated H intermediates recombine to generate H2 on the Ru single atoms or clusters. Comparing the two kinds of Ru sites, Ru cluster dominates the alkaline HER activity due to the more fluent migration of H intermediates and its more favorable adsorption&#8211;desorption energetics toward H intermediates.








Abstract
Guaranteeing satisfactory catalytic behavior while ensuring high metal utilization has become the problem that needs to be addressed when designing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for electrochemical reactions. Here, well&#8208;dispersed ruthenium (Ru) based clusters with adjacent Ru single atoms (SAs) on layered sodium cobalt oxide (Ru/NC) are demonstrated as a superb electrocatalyst for alkaline HER. The Ru/NC catalyst demonstrates an activity increase by a factor of two relative to the commercial Pt/C. Operando characterizations in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) simulations uncover the origin of the superior activity and establish a structure&#8211;performance relationship, that is, under HER condition, the real active species are Ru SAs and metallic Ru clusters supported on the NC substrate. The excellent alkaline HER activity of the Ru/NC catalyst can be understood by a spatially decoupled water dissociation and hydrogen desorption mechanism, where the NC substrate accelerates the water dissociation rate, and the generated H intermediates would then migrate to the Ru SAs or clusters and recombine to have H2 evolution. More importantly, comparing the two forms of Ru sites, it is the Ru cluster that dominates the HER activity.

The excellent alkaline HER activity of the Ru/NC catalyst can be understood by a spatially decoupled water dissociation and hydrogen desorption mechanism, where the NC substrate accelerates the water dissociation rate, and the generated H intermediates would then migrate to the Ru SAs or clusters and recombine to have H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution. More importantly, comparing the two forms of Ru sites, it is the Ru cluster that dominates the HER activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Multifunctional Additive Strategy Enables Efficient Pure&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;functional phenylethylammonium trifluoroacetate performs three functions on perovskites: dimensionality control, defect passivation, and surface modification. Consequently, the optimized devices exhibit a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 11.87% at 468&#160;nm, the highest reported to date for pure&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting devices.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskites have shown exceptional performance in light&#8208;emitting devices (PeLEDs), particularly in producing significant electroluminescence in sky&#8208;blue to near&#8208;infrared wavelengths. However, PeLEDs emitting pure&#8208;blue light at 465&#8211;475 nm are still not satisfactory. Herein, efficient and stable pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs are reported by controlling phase distribution, passivation of defects, as well as surface modifications using multifunctional phenylethylammonium trifluoroacetate (PEATFA) in reduced&#8208;dimensional p&#8208;F&#8208;PEA2Csn&#8722;1Pbn(Br0.55Cl0.45)3n+1 polycrystalline perovskite films. Compared with 4&#8208;fluorophenylethylammonium (p&#8208;F&#8208;PEA+) in the pristine films, phenylethylammonium (PEA+) has lower adsorption energy while interacting with perovskites, resulting in large&#8208;n low&#8208;dimensional perovskites, which can greatly facilitate charge transport within the low&#8208;dimensional perovskite films. The interaction between the C&#63742;O group in trifluoroacetate (TFA&#8722;) and perovskites significantly reduces defects in the perovskite films. Additionally, the electron&#8208;giving &#63743;CF3 group in TFA&#8208; uplifts surface potential in the films, resulting in smooth electronic injection in devices. The multifunctional additive strategy leads to elevated radiative recombination and efficient carrier transport in the films and devices. As a result, the devices exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 11.87% at 468 nm with stable spectral output, the highest reported to date for pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs. Thus, this study extends the way for high&#8208;efficiency pure&#8208;blue LED with perovskite polycrystal films.

         <title>Synergetic Enhancement of Strength&#8211;Ductility and Thermoelectric Properties of Ag2Te by Domain Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nanodomain strategy for improving the mechanical and thermoelectric properties of materials simultaneously is presented. Ag2Te with suppressed lattice thermal conductivity and improved strength&#8211;ductility synergy is achieved. These findings provide new insights into grain and domain boundary engineering for high&#8208;performance inorganic semiconductors with robust mechanical strength&#8211;ductility synergy.








Abstract
Simultaneously improving the mechanical and thermoelectric (TE) properties is significant for the engineering applications of inorganic TE materials. In this work, a novel nanodomain strategy is developed for Ag2Te compounds to yield 40% and 200% improved compressive strength (160&#160;MPa) and fracture strain (16%) when compared to domain&#8208;free samples (115&#160;MPa and 5.5%, respectively). The domained samples also achieve a 45% improvement in average ZT value. The domain boundaries (DBs) provide extra sites for dislocation nucleation while pinning the dislocation movement, resulting in superior strength and ductility. In addition, phonon scattering induced by DBs suppresses the lattice thermal conductivity of Ag2Te and also reduces the weighted mobility. These findings provide new insights into grain and DB engineering for high&#8208;performance inorganic semiconductors with robust mechanical properties.

Active Metamaterials
In article number 2303541, Ruike Renee Zhao and co&#8208;workers present a novel magneto&#8208;mechanical metamaterial that employs a double&#8208;layer design to change area density while preserving the overall area for good conformability during actuation. Magnetic actuation facilitates rapid and reversible structural deformation between multiple modes. This allows for the metamaterial to control the propagation of in&#8208;plane elastic waves of different frequencies.

Physical Unclonable Functions
In article number 2302135, Dong Ki Yoon and co&#8208;workers present a framework for the creation of physical unclonable function (PUF)&#8208;based authentication labels using DNA. The platform leverages the inherent stochastic birefringent pattern that emerges through the entropy&#8208;driven instability during the drying process of aqueous DNA solutions. By harnessing the disclinations within the DNA film, secure security codes are generated, exhibiting a level of randomness that ensures robust high&#8208;level security measures.

Gas Sensors
In article number 2302219, Suk Yeop Chun, Young Geun Song, Chong&#8208;Yun Kang, Jung Ho Yoon, and co&#8208;workers propose a hysteretic &#8220;chemi&#8208;memristive gas sensor&#8221; based on oxygen&#8208;vacancy chemi&#8208;memristive dynamics that differ from that of conventional gas sensors. Based on the advantageous functionality of the sensor, including fast responses, short recovery times, and hysteretic gas response, device&#8208;level olfactory systems that can monitor the history of input gas stimuli are experimentally demonstrated.

Organic Electrochemical Transistors
In article number 2300308, Natalie Banerji and co&#8208;workers present an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) based on a conjugated polymer film. Switching on the transistor leads to oxidation of the polymer, forming polarons and bipolarons. The charges are compensated by ions that enter the film from the electrolyte. Using time&#8208;resolved spectroelectrochemistry, they show that polarons prefer the ordered regions of the film, while bipolarons are generated in the amorphous regions.

         <title>Understanding and Suppressing Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination Losses in Non&#8208;Fullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Minimizing non&#8208;radiative recombination losses in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;fullerene solar cells is of utmost importance in order to achieve power conversion efficiencies over 20% in the future. This review discusses methods to accurately quantify non&#8208;radiative voltage losses as well as the current understanding of their origin and empirical strategies for reducing them.








Abstract
Organic solar cells benefit from non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFA) due to their high absorption coefficients, tunable frontier energy levels, and optical gaps, as well as their relatively high luminescence quantum efficiencies as compared to fullerenes. Those merits result in high yields of charge generation at a low or negligible energetic offset at the donor/NFA heterojunction, with efficiencies over 19% achieved for single&#8208;junction devices. Pushing this value significantly over 20% requires an increase in open&#8208;circuit voltage, which is currently still well below the thermodynamic limit. This can only be achieved by reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination, and hereby increasing the electroluminescence quantum efficiency of the photo&#8208;active layer. Here, current understanding of the origin of non&#8208;radiative decay, as well as an accurate quantification of the associated voltage losses are summarized. Promising strategies for suppressing these losses are highlighted, with focus on new material design, optimization of donor&#8211;acceptor combination, and blend morphology. This review aims at guiding researchers in their quest to find future solar harvesting donor&#8211;acceptor blends, which combine a high yield of exciton dissociation with a high yield of radiative free carrier recombination and low voltage losses, hereby closing the efficiency gap with inorganic and perovskite photovoltaics.

     alt="Understanding and Suppressing Non-Radiative Recombination Losses in Non-Fullerene Organic Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimizing non-radiative recombination losses in the state-of-the-art non-fullerene solar cells is of utmost importance in order to achieve power conversion efficiencies over 20% in the future. This review discusses methods to accurately quantify non-radiative voltage losses as well as the current understanding of their origin and empirical strategies for reducing them.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic solar cells benefit from non-fullerene acceptors (NFA) due to their high absorption coefficients, tunable frontier energy levels, and optical gaps, as well as their relatively high luminescence quantum efficiencies as compared to fullerenes. Those merits result in high yields of charge generation at a low or negligible energetic offset at the donor/NFA heterojunction, with efficiencies over 19% achieved for single-junction devices. Pushing this value significantly over 20% requires an increase in open-circuit voltage, which is currently still well below the thermodynamic limit. This can only be achieved by reducing non-radiative recombination, and hereby increasing the electroluminescence quantum efficiency of the photo-active layer. Here, current understanding of the origin of non-radiative decay, as well as an accurate quantification of the associated voltage losses are summarized. Promising strategies for suppressing these losses are highlighted, with focus on new material design, optimization of donor&#8211;acceptor combination, and blend morphology. This review aims at guiding researchers in their quest to find future solar harvesting donor&#8211;acceptor blends, which combine a high yield of exciton dissociation with a high yield of radiative free carrier recombination and low voltage losses, hereby closing the efficiency gap with inorganic and perovskite photovoltaics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bifunctional Single Atom Catalysts for Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries: From Dynamic Mechanism to Rational Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the dynamic oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms, the rational regulations for various single atom catalysts (SACs) to improve their bifunctional activity and stability, and the challenges and future perspectives of bifunctional SACs for high&#8208;performance zinc&#8211;air batteries are discussed systematically.








Abstract
Ever&#8208;growing demands for rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) call for efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts. Among various electrocatalysts, single atom catalysts (SACs) have received increasing attention due to the merits of high atom utilization, structural tunability, and remarkable activity. Rational design of bifunctional SACs relies heavily on an in&#8208;depth understanding of reaction mechanisms, especially dynamic evolution under electrochemical conditions. This requires a systematic study in dynamic mechanisms to replace current trial and error modes. Herein, fundamental understanding of dynamic oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms for SACs is first presented combining in situ and/or operando characterizations and theoretical calculations. By highlighting structure&#8211;performance relationships, rational regulation strategies are particularly proposed to facilitate the design of efficient bifunctional SACs. Furthermore, future perspectives and challenges are discussed. This review provides a thorough understanding of dynamic mechanisms and regulation strategies for bifunctional SACs, which are expected to pave the avenue for exploring optimum single atom bifunctional oxygen catalysts and effective ZABs.

         <title>Dendritic Solid Polymer Electrolytes: A New Paradigm for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the review, it is not only focused on reviewing dendritic polymer electrolytes (PEs) in basic concept, synthesis methodologies, balancing of properties, ion transport mechanism, etc. but also try to outline the possibility of dendritic PEs toward on&#8208;demand design. It is believed that including examples of designing advanced/safe dendritic PEs will show the readers a more comprehensive prospect of this burgeoning field.








Abstract
Li&#8208;ions battery is widely used and recognized, but its energy density based on organic electrolytes has approached the theoretical upper limit, while the use of organic electrolytes also brings some safety hazards (leakage and flammability). Polymer electrolytes (PEs) are expected to fundamentally solve the safety problem and improve energy density. Therefore, Li&#8208;ions battery based on solid PE has become a research hotspot in recent years. However, low ionic conductivity and poor mechanical properties, as well as a narrow electrochemical window limit its further development. Dendritic PEs with unique topology structure has low crystallinity, high segmental mobility, and reduced chain entanglement, providing a new avenue for designing high&#8208;performance PEs. In this review, the basic concept and synthetic chemistry of dendritic polymers are first introduced. Then, this story will turn to how to balance the mechanical properties, ionic conductivity, and electrochemical stability of dendritic PEs from synthetic chemistry. In addition, accomplishments on dendritic PEs based on different synthesis strategies and recent advances in battery applications are summarized and discussed. Subsequently, the ionic transport mechanism and interfacial interaction are deeply analyzed. In the end, the challenges and prospects are outlined to promote further development in this booming field.

         <title>Flexible and Stretchable Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Physiological Sensing Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are an emerging class of organic electronic building blocks exhibiting significant advantages for developing flexible/stretchable physiological sensors. This review discusses structure, operation, critical features, a wide spectrum of physiological sensing mechanisms and uses, as well as major challenges and opportunities for flexible/stretchable OECTs, particularly for biochemical and bioelectrical sensor applications.








Abstract
Flexible and stretchable bioelectronics provides a biocompatible interface between electronics and biological systems and has received tremendous attention for in situ monitoring of various biological systems. Considerable progress in organic electronics has made organic semiconductors, as well as other organic electronic materials, ideal candidates for developing wearable, implantable, and biocompatible electronic circuits due to their potential mechanical compliance and biocompatibility. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), as an emerging class of organic electronic building blocks, exhibit significant advantages in biological sensing due to the ionic nature at the basis of the switching behavior, low driving voltage (&lt;1 V), and high transconductance (in millisiemens range). During the past few years, significant progress in constructing flexible/stretchable OECTs (FSOECTs) for both biochemical and bioelectrical sensors has been reported. In this regard, to summarize major research accomplishments in this emerging field, this review first discusses structure and critical features of FSOECTs, including working principles, materials, and architectural engineering. Next, a wide spectrum of relevant physiological sensing applications, where FSOECTs are the key components, are summarized. Last, major challenges and opportunities for further advancing FSOECT physiological sensors are discussed.

ToC devices may become state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art models for pharmaceutical oncology trials. To achieve this, the ToC should present reliability in mimicking the TME and monitoring biophysical and chemical signals using sensors and actuators. The translation of this technology to the industrial scale must take into consideration scalability and the standardization of the materials/biomaterials, architectures, actuators, and integration with analytical tools.








Abstract
Cancer kills millions of individuals every year all over the world (Global Cancer Observatory). The physiological and biomechanical processes underlying the tumor are still poorly understood, hindering researchers from creating new, effective therapies. Inconsistent results of preclinical research, in vivo testing, and clinical trials decrease drug approval rates. 3D tumor&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip (ToC) models integrate biomaterials, tissue engineering, fabrication of microarchitectures, and sensory and actuation systems in a single device, enabling reliable studies in fundamental oncology and pharmacology. This review includes a critical discussion about their ability to reproduce the tumor microenvironment (TME), the advantages and drawbacks of existing tumor models and architectures, major components and fabrication techniques. The focus is on current materials and micro/nanofabrication techniques used to manufacture reliable and reproducible microfluidic ToC models for large&#8208;scale trial applications.

         <title>Extreme Polarization Anisotropy in Resonant Third&#8208;Harmonic Generation from Aligned Carbon Nanotube Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macroscopic films of aligned and type&#8208;separated (semiconducting and metallic) carbon nanotubes are synthesized, and third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG) processes with extreme polarization anisotropy in the broad spectral range are studied, due to the 1D character of CNTs. The THG processes are enhanced by exciton resonance (S11, S22, and M11 excitons) in both films, revealing coupling between the excitons and nonlinear effects.








Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess extremely anisotropic electronic, thermal, and optical properties owing to their 1D character. While their linear optical properties have been extensively studied, nonlinear optical processes, such as harmonic generation for frequency conversion, remain largely unexplored in CNTs, particularly in macroscopic CNT assemblies. In this work, macroscopic films of aligned and type&#8208;separated (semiconducting and metallic) CNTs are synthesized and polarization&#8208;dependent third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG) from the films with fundamental wavelengths ranging from 1.5 to 2.5&#160;&#181;m is studied.

     alt="Extreme Polarization Anisotropy in Resonant Third-Harmonic Generation from Aligned Carbon Nanotube Films"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macroscopic films of aligned and type-separated (semiconducting and metallic) carbon nanotubes are synthesized, and third-harmonic generation (THG) processes with extreme polarization anisotropy in the broad spectral range are studied, due to the 1D character of CNTs. The THG processes are enhanced by exciton resonance (S&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;, and M&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; excitons) in both films, revealing coupling between the excitons and nonlinear effects.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess extremely anisotropic electronic, thermal, and optical properties owing to their 1D character. While their linear optical properties have been extensively studied, nonlinear optical processes, such as harmonic generation for frequency conversion, remain largely unexplored in CNTs, particularly in macroscopic CNT assemblies. In this work, macroscopic films of aligned and type-separated (semiconducting and metallic) CNTs are synthesized and polarization-dependent third-harmonic generation (THG) from the films with fundamental wavelengths ranging from 1.5 to 2.5&#160;&#181;m is studied. Both films exhibited strongly wavelength-dependent, intense THG signals, enhanced through exciton resonances, and third-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities of 2.50&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;19&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (semiconducting CNTs) and 1.23&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;19&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (metallic CNTs), respectively are found, for 1.8&#160;&#181;m excitation. Further, through systematic polarization-dependent THG measurements, the values of all elements of the susceptibility tensor are determined, verifying the macroscopically 1D nature of the films. Finally, polarized THG imaging is performed to demonstrate the nonlinear anisotropy in the large-size CNT film with good alignment.

         <title>A Polycrystalline Polymer Donor as Pre&#8208;Aggregate toward Ordered Molecular Aggregation for 19.3% Efficiency Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PM6 polycrystals are incubated through a vapor diffusion method and redissolved in chloroform to prepare PM6 pre&#8208;aggregates, which can increase the structural order of both the donors and the acceptors in photovoltaic blends upon solution casting, consequently delivering high performance for both thin and thick junction organic solar cells.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors are generally featured with low structure order in solid&#8208;state films, which leads to low charge&#8208;transport mobility and strong charge recombination in their photovoltaic devices. In this work, a &#8220;polycrystal&#8208;induced aggregation&#8221; strategy orders the polymer donor (PM6) and non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (L8&#8208;BO) molecules during solution casting with the assistance of PM6 polycrystals that are incubated through a vapor diffusion method, toward improved solar cell efficiency with either thin or thick photoactive layers. These PM6 polycrystals are redissolved in chloroform to prepare PM6 pre&#8208;aggregates (PM6&#8208;PA), and further incorporated into the conventional PM6:L8&#8208;BO blend solutions, which is found to prolong the molecular organization process and enhance the aggregation of both the PM6 and the L8&#8208;BO components. As the results, with the assistance of 10% PM6&#8208;PA, PM6:L8&#8208;BO solar cell devices obtain power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from 18.0% and 16.2% to 19.3% and 17.2% with a 100 nm&#8208;thick and 300&#160;nm&#8208;thick photoactive layer, respectively.

         <title>Mold&#8208;Free Manufacturing of Highly Sensitive and Fast&#8208;Response Pressure Sensors Through High&#8208;Resolution 3D Printing and Conformal Oxidative Chemical Vapor Deposition Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paradigm&#8208;shifting mold&#8208;free manufacturing is demonstrated for high&#8208;sensitivity and ultrafast responsive sensors using sub&#8208;10&#160;&#181;m 3D&#8208;printing and conformal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymers. Much&#8208;enhanced sensing performance is achieved, compared to those manufactured with mold&#8208;based techniques, due to the high electrical conductivity of the sensing element, oxidative CVD&#160;poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene), and the benefits from the multiscale (from micrometer&#160;to millimeter) patterns.








Abstract
A new manufacturing paradigm is showcased to exclude conventional mold&#8208;dependent manufacturing of pressure sensors, which typically requires a series of complex and expensive patterning processes. This mold&#8208;free manufacturing leverages high&#8208;resolution 3D&#8208;printed multiscale microstructures as the substrate and a gas&#8208;phase conformal polymer coating technique to complete the mold&#8208;free sensing platform. The array of dome and spike structures with a controlled spike density of a 3D&#8208;printed substrate ensures a large contact surface with pressures applied and extended linearity in a wider pressure range. For uniform coating of sensing elements on the microstructured surface, oxidative chemical vapor deposition is employed to deposit a highly conformal and conductive sensing element, poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) at low temperatures (&lt;60&#160;&#176;C). The fabricated pressure sensor reacts sensitively to various ranges of pressures (up to 185&#160;kPa&#8722;1) depending on the density of the multiscale features and shows an ultrafast response time (&#8776;36&#160;&#181;s). The mechanism investigations through the finite element analysis identify the effect of the multiscale structure on the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit sensing performance. These unique findings are expected to be of significant relevance to technology that requires higher sensing capability, scalability, and facile adjustment of a sensor geometry in a cost&#8208;effective manufacturing manner.

         <title>Amphiphilic Cobalt Phthalocyanine Boosts Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic tetra&#8208;carboxyphenyl&#8208;substituted cobalt phthalocyanine is designed to adjust the hydrophilic/hydrophobic property of CoPc/carbon hybrid materials from a molecular perspective. The catalyst maintains effective contact between the active sites and the electrolyte, and achieves efficient CO2RR in both H&#8208;type cell and MEA device with exceptional selectivity and stability.








Abstract
Due to the easy accessibility, chemical stability, and structural tunability of the macrocyclic skeleton, cobalt phthalocyanines immobilized on carbon supports offer an ideal research model for advanced electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR). In this work, an amphiphilic cobalt phthalocyanine (TC&#8208;CoPc) is loaded on multiwalled carbon nanotubes to reveal the roles of hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties on catalytic efficiency. Surprisingly, the resultant electrode exhibits a CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 95% for CO2RR with turnover frequency (TOF) of 29.4 s&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 0.585&#160;V over long&#8208;term electrolysis in a H&#8208;type cell. In the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) device, the boosted transport of water vapor to the catalyst layer slows down carbonate crystallization and enhances the stability of the electrode, with FECO value of &gt;99% over 27 h at &#8722;0.25 A, representing the best selectivity and stability among reported molecular catalysts in MEA devices. The amphiphilic cobalt phthalocyanine, which decreases interfacial charge and mass transfer resistance and maintains effective contact between active sites and the electrolyte, highlights the exceptional CO2 conversion from a molecular perspective.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Molecule Bioelectronic Portable Array for Early Diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer Precursors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A portable enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&#8208;like 96&#8208;array of bioelectronic sensors assays simultaneously both proteins and nucleic&#8208;acid biomarkers at the single&#8208;molecule level in 0.1&#160;mL of plasma. The prototype comprises a disposable cartridge and a reusable reader. A cohort of 47 patients is screened for the minimally invasive early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The mucinous&#8208;cysts precursors are 100% correctly classified via a machine&#8208;learning analysis.








Abstract
A cohort of 47 patients is screened for pancreatic cancer precursors with a portable 96&#8208;well bioelectronic sensing&#8208;array for single&#8208;molecule assay in cysts fluid and blood plasma, deployable at point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC). Pancreatic cancer precursors are mucinous cysts diagnosed with a sensitivity of at most 80% by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cytopathological molecular analyses (e.g., KRASmut DNA). Adding the simultaneous assay of proteins related to malignant transformation (e.g., MUC1 and CD55) is deemed essential to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The bioelectronic array proposed here, based on single&#8208;molecule&#8208;with&#8208;a&#8208;large&#8208;transistor (SiMoT) technology, can assay both nucleic acids and proteins at the single&#8208;molecule limit&#8208;of&#8208;identification (LOI) (1% of false&#8208;positives and false&#8208;negatives). It comprises an enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&#8208;like 8 &#215; 12&#8208;array organic&#8208;electronics disposable cartridge with an electrolyte&#8208;gated organic transistor sensor array, and a reusable reader, integrating a custom Si&#8208;IC chip, operating via software installed on a USB&#8208;connected smart device. The cartridge is complemented by a 3D&#8208;printed sensing gate cover plate. KRASmut, MUC1, and CD55 biomarkers either in plasma or cysts&#8208;fluid from 5 to 6 patients at a time, are multiplexed at single&#8208;molecule LOI in 1.5 h. The pancreatic cancer precursors are classified via a machine&#8208;learning analysis resulting in at least 96% diagnostic&#8208;sensitivity and 100% diagnostic&#8208;specificity. This preliminary study opens the way to POC liquid&#8208;biopsy&#8208;based early diagnosis of pancreatic&#8208;cancer precursors in plasma.

Pancreatic cancer precursors are mucinous cysts diagnosed with a sensitivity of at most 80% by state-of-the-art cytopathological molecular analyses (e.g., KRAS&lt;sup&gt;mut&lt;/sup&gt; DNA). Adding the simultaneous assay of proteins related to malignant transformation (e.g., MUC1 and CD55) is deemed essential to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The bioelectronic array proposed here, based on single-molecule-with-a-large-transistor (SiMoT) technology, can assay both nucleic acids and proteins at the single-molecule limit-of-identification (LOI) (1% of false-positives and false-negatives). It comprises an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-like 8 &#215; 12-array organic-electronics disposable cartridge with an electrolyte-gated organic transistor sensor array, and a reusable reader, integrating a custom Si-IC chip, operating via software installed on a USB-connected smart device. The cartridge is complemented by a 3D-printed sensing gate cover plate. KRAS&lt;sup&gt;mut&lt;/sup&gt;, MUC1, and CD55 biomarkers either in plasma or cysts-fluid from 5 to 6 patients at a time, are multiplexed at single-molecule LOI in 1.5 h. The pancreatic cancer precursors are classified via a machine-learning analysis resulting in at least 96% diagnostic-sensitivity and 100% diagnostic-specificity. This preliminary study opens the way to POC liquid-biopsy-based early diagnosis of pancreatic-cancer precursors in plasma.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Completely Activated and Phase&#8208;Transformed KFeMnHCF for Zn/K Hybrid Batteries with 14&#160;500 Cycles by an OH&#8208;Rich Hydrogel Electrolyte</title>

The utilization of hydroxyl&#8208;rich hydrogel electrolytes with extended electrochemical stability windows activates the redox site of low&#8208;spin Fe within the KxFeyMn1&#8722;y[Fe(CN)6]w&#183;zH2O (KFeMnHCF) cathode while concurrently tuning its structure. The robust adhesion of the hydrogel electrolyte prevents the KFeMnHCF particles from detaching and dissolving. The facile desolvation of metal ions within the developed hydrogel electrolytes facilitates reversible (de)intercalationin KFeMnHCF cathode.

Abstract
Metal hexacyanoferrates are recognized as superior cathode materials for zinc and zinc hybrid batteries, particularly the Prussian blue analog (PBA). However, PBA development is hindered by several limitations, including small capacities (&lt;70&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) and short lifespans (&lt;1000 cycles). These limitations generally arise due to incomplete activation of redox sites and structure collapse during intercalation/deintercalation of metal ions in PBAs. According to this study, the adoption of a hydroxyl&#8208;rich (OH&#8208;rich) hydrogel electrolyte with extended electrochemical stability windows (ESWs) can effectively activate the redox site of low&#8208;spin Fe of the KxFeyMn1&#8722;y[Fe(CN)6]w&#183;zH2O (KFeMnHCF) cathode while tuning its structure. Additionally, the strong adhesion of the hydrogel electrolyte inhibits KFeMnHCF particles from falling off the cathode and dissolving. The easy desolvation of metal ions in the developed OH&#8208;rich hydrogel electrolytes can lead to a fast and reversible intercalation/deintercalation of metal ions in the PBA cathode. As a result, the Zn||KFeMnHCF hybrid batteries achieve the unprecedented characteristics of 14&#160;500 cycles, a 1.7&#160;V discharge plateau, and a 100&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 discharge capacity. The results of this study provide a new understanding of the development of zinc hybrid batteries with PBA cathode materials and present a promising new electrolyte material for this application.

         <title>2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Embedded with Iodine for High&#8208;Performance Ammonium&#8208;Ion Hybrid Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework embedded with iodine (Cu&#8208;HHB/I2) is demonstrated as an electroactive cathode material for advanced NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors. Benefiting from excellent electrical conductivity, abundant Cu&#9472;O4 species, and adsorbed iodide at the Cu sites of the Cu&#8208;HHB/I2, an assembled NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors deliver a superior energy density (31.5 mWh cm&#8722;2) and record&#8208;long cycling lifetime (89.5% after 10&#160;000 cycles).








Abstract
Ammonium ions (NH4+) are emerging non&#8208;metallic charge carriers for advanced electrochemical energy storage devices, due to their low cost, elemental abundance, and environmental benignity. However, finding suitable electrode materials to achieve rapid diffusion kinetics for NH4+ storage remains a great challenge. Herein, a 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) for immobilizing iodine, as a high&#8208;performance cathode material for NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors, is reported. Cu&#8208;HHB (HHB = hexahydroxybenzene) MOF embedded with iodine (Cu&#8208;HHB/I2) features excellent electrical conductivity, highly porous structure, and rich accessible active sites of copper&#8208;bis(dihydroxy) (Cu&#9472;O4) and iodide species, resulting in a remarkable areal capacitance of 111.7 mF cm&#8722;2 at 0.4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that the Cu&#9472;O4 species in Cu&#8208;HHB play a critical role in binding polyiodide and suppressing its dissolution, as well as contributing to a large pseudocapacitance with adsorbed iodide. In combination with a porous MXene anode, the full NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors deliver an excellent energy density of 31.5 mWh cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term cycling stability with 89.5% capacitance retention after 10&#160;000 cycles, superior to those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors. This study sheds light on the material design for NH4+ storage, enabling the development of novel high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.

         <title>Customized Microenvironments Spontaneously Facilitate Coupled Engineering of Real&#8208;Life Large&#8208;Scale Clean Water Capture and Pollution Remediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;one&#8208;stone&#8211;two&#8208;birds&#8221; strategy for the large&#8208;scale production of drinking water directly from contaminated seawater is proposed. The strategy is based on a novel coupling perspective (parallel reaction space) to achieve photocatalytic degradation of pollutants while capturing clean water. It is demonstrated that this evaporator (CCMs&#8208;x) is widely adaptable and persistent to multiple real&#8208;life scenarios with excellent scalability. This work makes it crucial to elucidate the photocatalytic mechanism and gain insight into the performance of catalytic materials at the microscopic level.








Abstract
Harnessing abundant renewable resources and pollutants on a large scale to address environmental challenges, while providing sustainable freshwater, is a significant endeavour. This study presents the design of fully functional solar vaporization devices (SVD) based on organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanocomposites (CCMs&#8208;x). These devices exhibit efficient photothermal properties that facilitate multitargeted interfacial reactions, enabling simultaneous catalysis of sewage and desalination. The localized interfacial heating generated by the photothermal effect of CCMs&#8208;x triggers surface&#8208;dominated catalysis and steam generation. The CCMs&#8208;x SVD achieves a solar water&#8208;vapor generation rate of 1.41&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 (90.8%), and it achieves over 95% removal of pollutants within 60&#160;min under one&#8208;sun for practical application. The exceptional photothermal conversion rate of wastewater for environmental remediation and water capture is attributed to customized microenvironments within the system. The integrated parallel reaction system in SVD ensures it is a real&#8208;life application in multiple scenarios such as municipal/medical wastewater and brine containing high concentrations. Additionally, the SVD exhibits long&#8208;term durability, antifouling functionality toward complex ionic contaminants. This study not only demonstrates a one&#8208;stone&#8211;two&#8208;birds strategy for large&#8208;scale direct production of potable water from polluted seawater, but also opens up exciting possibilities for parallel production of energy and water resources.

         <title>Mechanochromism and Strain&#8208;Induced Crystallization in Thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;Derived Stereoelastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semicrystalline, mechanochromic stereoelastomers possessing spiropyran mechanophores are synthesized via thiol&#8208;yne Michael addition polymerization. Tensile tests across two decades of strain rates reveal significant correlations between strain hardening, strain&#8208;induced crystallization, and mechanochromism, which exhibits a novel multiregime behavior. Spiropyran recovery kinetics after failure are controlled by strain&#8208;induced crystallization, resulting in record activation lifetimes.








Abstract
Most elastomers undergo strain&#8208;induced crystallization (SIC) under tension; as individual chains are held rigidly in a fixed position by an applied strain, their alignment along the strain field results in a shift from strain&#8208;hardening (SH) to SIC. A similar degree of stretching is associated with the tension necessary to accelerate mechanically coupled, covalent chemical responses of mechanophores in overstretched chains, raising the possibility of an interplay between the macroscopic response of SIC and the molecular response of mechanophore activation. Here, thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;derived stereoelastomers doped covalently with a dipropiolate&#8208;derivatized spiropyran (SP) mechanophore (0.25&#8211;0.38&#160;mol%) are reported. The material properties of SP&#8208;containing films are consistent with undoped controls, indicating that the SP is a reporter of the mechanical state of the polymer. Uniaxial tensile tests reveal correlations between mechanochromism and SIC, which are strain&#8208;rate&#8208;dependent. When mechanochromic films are stretched slowly to the point of mechanophore activation, the covalently tethered mechanophore remains trapped in a force&#8208;activated state, even after the applied stress is removed. Mechanophore reversion kinetics correlate with the applied strain rate, resulting in highly tunable decoloration rates. Because these polymers are not covalently crosslinked, they are recyclable by melt&#8208;pressing into new films, increasing their potential range of strain&#8208;sensing, morphology&#8208;sensing, and shape&#8208;memory applications.

&lt;p&gt;Semicrystalline, mechanochromic stereoelastomers possessing spiropyran mechanophores are synthesized via thiol-yne Michael addition polymerization. Tensile tests across two decades of strain rates reveal significant correlations between strain hardening, strain-induced crystallization, and mechanochromism, which exhibits a novel multiregime behavior. Spiropyran recovery kinetics after failure are controlled by strain-induced crystallization, resulting in record activation lifetimes.

         <title>Achieving All&#8208;Plateau and High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Insertion in Topological Graphitized Carbon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly cross&#8208;linked topological graphitized carbon is constructed through a two&#8208;step rapid thermal&#8208;annealing strategy. Evidence from advanced techniques indicates that the sodium ions' insertion and Na cluster formation occurred between curved topological graphite layers and in the topological cavity of adjacent graphite band entanglements, resulting in a single full low&#8208;voltage plateau capacity of 290&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Hard carbon anodes with all&#8208;plateau capacities below 0.1&#160;V are prerequisites to achieve high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium&#8208;ion storage, which holds promise for future sustainable energy technologies. However, challenges in removing defects and improving the insertion of sodium ions head off the development of hard carbon to achieve this goal. Herein, a highly cross&#8208;linked topological graphitized carbon using biomass corn cobs through a two&#8208;step rapid thermal&#8208;annealing strategy is reported. The topological graphitized carbon constructed with long&#8208;range graphene nanoribbons and cavities/tunnels provides a multidirectional insertion of sodium ions whilst eliminating defects to absorb sodium ions at the high voltage region. Evidence from advanced techniques including in situ XRD, in situ Raman, and in situ/ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicates that the sodium ions' insertion and Na cluster formation occurred between curved topological graphite layers and in the topological cavity of adjacent graphite band entanglements. The reported topological insertion mechanism enables outstanding battery performance with a single full low&#8208;voltage plateau capacity of 290&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, which is almost 97% of the total capacity.

         <title>Intrinsically Stretchable and Efficient Fully &#928;&#8208;Conjugated Polymer via Internal Plasticization for Flexible Deep&#8208;Blue Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with CIEy = 0.08</title>

         <dc:description>
A universal internal plasticization strategy is proposed to construct intrinsically stretchable and efficient fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers for the flexible deep&#8208;blue polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs). The introduction of pendant phenyl&#8208;ester plasticizers in polyfluorenes can simultaneously obtain excellent intrinsic stretchability, robust deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence, and comparable charge&#8208;transport behavior. Stable deep&#8208;blue PLEDs based on stretchable layers are also fabricated with a CIE of (0.15, 0.08).








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable polymeric semiconductors are essential to flexible polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) owing to their excellent strain tolerance capacity under long&#8208;time deformation operation. Obtaining intrinsic stretchability, robust emission properties, and excellent charge&#8208;transport behavior simultaneously from fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (FCPs) is difficult, particularly for applications in deep&#8208;blue PLEDs. Herein, an internal plasticization strategy is proposed to introduce a phenyl&#8208;ester plasticizer into polyfluorenes (PF&#8208;MC4, PF&#8208;MC6, and PF&#8208;MC8) for narrowband deep&#8208;blue flexible PLEDs. Compared with controlled poly[4&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl]&#8208;co&#8208;[5&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl] (PODPFs) (2.5%), the freestanding PF&#8208;MC8 thin film shows a fracture strain of &gt;25%. The three stretchable films exhibit stable and efficient deep&#8208;blue emission (PLQY &gt; 50%) because of the encapsulation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone via pendant phenyl&#8208;ester plasticizers. The PF&#8208;MC8&#8208;based PLEDs show deep&#8208;blue emission, which corresponds to CIE and EQE values of (0.16, 0.10) and 1.06%, respectively. Finally, the narrowband deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence (FWHM of &#8776;25&#160;nm; CIE coordinates: (0.15, 0.08)) and performance of the transferred PLEDs based on the PF&#8208;MC8 stretchable film are independent of the tensile ratio (up to 45%); however, they show a maximum brightness of 1976&#160;cd m&#8722;2 at a ratio of 35%. Therefore, internal plasticization is a promising approach for designing intrinsically stretchable FCPs for flexible electronics.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Oscillation of Thermoplasmonic Nanocolloids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;oscillation is the periodic change of a system under a non&#8208;periodic stimulus. A new self&#8208;oscillator model is presented in which photoactive plasmonic nanoparticles display periodic clustering under non&#8208;periodic illumination. The surface temperature of nanoparticles and the number density of their clusters jointly oscillate at infrasonic/acoustic frequencies. Further mathematical extension of the model suggests the emergence of a thermoplasmonic attractor.








Abstract
Self&#8208;oscillation&#8212;the periodic change of a system under a non&#8208;periodic stimulus&#8212;is vital for creating low&#8208;maintenance autonomous devices in soft robotics technologies. Soft composites of macroscopic dimensions are often doped with plasmonic nanoparticles to enhance energy dissipation and generate periodic response. However, while it is still unknown whether a dispersion of photonic nanocrystals may respond to light as a soft actuator, a dynamic analysis of nanocolloids self&#8208;oscillating in a liquid is also lacking. This study presents a new self&#8208;oscillator model for illuminated colloidal systems. It predicts that the surface temperature of thermoplasmonic nanoparticles and the number density of their clusters jointly oscillate at frequencies ranging from infrasonic to acoustic values. New experiments with spontaneously clustering gold nanorods, where the photothermal effect alters the interplay of light (stimulus) with the disperse system on a macroscopic scale, strongly support the&#160;theory. These findings enlarge the current view on self&#8208;oscillation phenomena and anticipate the colloidal state of matter to be a suitable host for accommodating light&#8208;propelled machineries. In broad terms, a complex system behavior is observed, which goes from periodic solutions (Hopf&#8211;Poincar&#233;&#8211;Andronov bifurcation) to a new dynamic attractor driven by nanoparticle interactions, linking thermoplasmonics to nonlinearity and&#160;chaos.

         <title>Modulating the d&#8208;Band Center Enables Ultrafine Pt3Fe Alloy Nanoparticles for pH&#8208;Universal Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activated N&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon spheres supported&#160;ultrafine Pt3Fe alloy nanoparticles (Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A), as a highly&#8208;efficient electrocatalyst for pH&#8208;universal HER, are reported. Owing to the strong Pt 5d&#8211;Fe 3d orbital electronic interactions that intentionally modulate the d&#8208;band center of Pt 5d orbital, both the required energy barrier for H2O dissociation and adsorption energy for H* intermediates are reduced, thereby resulting in the enhanced HER activities of Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A in acidic, alkaline, and neutral conditions.








Abstract
By providing dual active sites to synergistically accelerate H2O dissociation and H+ reduction, ordered intermetallic alloys usually show extraordinary performance for pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, activated N&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon spheres supported intermetallic Pt3Fe alloys (Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A), as a highly&#8208;efficient electrocatalyst for pH&#8208;universal HER, are reported. The Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A exhibits low overpotentials (&#951;10) of 13, 29, and 48&#160;mV to deliver 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;m&#160;H2SO4, 1.0&#160;m&#160;KOH, and 1.0&#160;m phosphate buffered solution (PBS), respectively, as well as robust stability to maintain the overall catalytic performances. Theoretical studies reveal that the strong Pt 5d&#8211;Fe 3d orbital electronic interactions negatively shift the d&#8208;band center (&#949;d) of Pt 5d orbital, resulting in reduced H* adsorption energy of Pt sites and enhanced acidic HER activity. With Pt and Fe acting as co&#8208;adsorption sites for H* and *OH intermediates, respectively, a low energy barrier is required for Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A to dissociate H2O to afford H* intermediates, which greatly promotes the H* adsorption and H2 formation in alkaline and neutral conditions.

     alt="Modulating the d-Band Center Enables Ultrafine Pt3Fe Alloy Nanoparticles for pH-Universal Hydrogen Evolution Reaction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activated N-doped mesoporous carbon spheres supported&#160;ultrafine Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe alloy nanoparticles (Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe/NMCS-A), as a highly-efficient electrocatalyst for pH-universal HER, are reported. Owing to the strong Pt 5d&#8211;Fe 3d orbital electronic interactions that intentionally modulate the d-band center of Pt 5d orbital, both the required energy barrier for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O dissociation and adsorption energy for H* intermediates are reduced, thereby resulting in the enhanced HER activities of Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe/NMCS-A in acidic, alkaline, and neutral conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By providing dual active sites to synergistically accelerate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O dissociation and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reduction, ordered intermetallic alloys usually show extraordinary performance for pH-universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, activated N-doped mesoporous carbon spheres supported intermetallic Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe alloys (Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe/NMCS-A), as a highly-efficient electrocatalyst for pH-universal HER, are reported. The Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe/NMCS-A exhibits low overpotentials (&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) of 13, 29, and 48&#160;mV to deliver 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in 0.5&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&#160;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 1.0&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&#160;KOH, and 1.0&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; phosphate buffered solution (PBS), respectively, as well as robust stability to maintain the overall catalytic performances. Theoretical studies reveal that the strong Pt 5d&#8211;Fe 3d orbital electronic interactions negatively shift the d-band center (&lt;i&gt;&#949;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) of Pt 5d orbital, resulting in reduced H* adsorption energy of Pt sites and enhanced acidic HER activity. With Pt and Fe acting as co-adsorption sites for H* and *OH intermediates, respectively, a low energy barrier is required for Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe/NMCS-A to dissociate H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to afford H* intermediates, which greatly promotes the H* adsorption and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formation in alkaline and neutral conditions. The synthetic strategy is further extended to the synthesis of Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Co and Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ni alloys with excellent HER activity in pH-universal electrolytes, demonstrating the great potential of these Pt-based alloys for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Crosslinking of Commodity Polymers via Photocontrolled Metal&#8211;Ligand Coordination for High&#8208;Performance and Recyclable Thermoset Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recyclable thermoset plastics are prepared using a commodity polyacrylonitrile and reversible crosslinker via reversible metal&#8211;ligand coordination. The thermosets are mechanically robust, and they are recyclable via reversible coordination upon light irradiation in a solvent and heating. This reversible coordination method enables the preparation of recyclable materials using other commodity polymers and polymer composites. The thermosets can be recycled from plastic waste.








Abstract
Thermoset plastics, highly desired for their stability, durability, and chemical resistance, are currently consumed in over 60 million tons annually across the globe, but they are difficult to recycle due to their crosslinked structures. The development of recyclable thermoset plastics is an important but challenging task. In this work, recyclable thermoset plastics are prepared by crosslinking a commodity polymer, polyacrylonitrile (PAN), with a small percentage of a Ru complex via nitrile&#8211;Ru coordination. PAN is obtained from industry and the Ru complex is synthesized in one step, which enables the production of recyclable thermoset plastics in an efficient way. In addition, the thermoset plastics exhibit impressive mechanical performance, boasting a Young's modulus of 6.3&#160;GPa and a tensile strength of 109.8&#160;MPa. Moreover, they can be de&#8208;crosslinked when exposed to both light and a solvent and can then be re&#8208;crosslinked upon heating. This reversible crosslinking mechanism enables the recycling of thermosets from a mixture of plastic waste. The preparation of recyclable thermosets from other commodity polymers such as poly(styrene&#8208;coacrylonitrile) (SAN) resins and polymer composites through reversible crosslinking is also demonstrated. This study shows that reversible crosslinking via metal&#8211;ligand coordination is a new strategy for designing recyclable thermosets using commodity polymers.

         <title>Indirect Electrocatalysis S&#9472;N/S&#9472;S Bond Construction by Robust Polyoxometalate Based Foams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of di&#8208;copper&#8208;substituted phosphotungstate based foams (PW10Cu2@CMC) with tunable loadings (17 to 44 wt%) is fabricated, which can be successfully applied in indirect electrocatalytic syntheses of sulfenamides and disulfides.








Abstract
Indirect electrocatalytic conversion of cheap organic raw materials via the activation of S&#9472;H and N&#9472;H bonds into the value&#8208;added S&#9472;N/S&#9472;S bonds chemicals for industrial rubber production is a promising strategy to realize the atomic economic reaction, during which the kinetic inhibition that is associated with the electron transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface in traditional direct electrocatalysis can be eliminated to achieve higher performance. In this work, a series of di&#8208;copper&#8208;substituted phosphotungstatebased foams (PW10Cu2@CMC) are fabricated with tunable loadings (17 to 44&#160;wt%), which can be successfully applied in indirect electrocatalytic syntheses of sulfenamides and disulfides. Specifically, the optimal PW10Cu2@CMC (44&#160;wt%) exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for the construction of S&#9472;N/S&#9472;S bonds (yields up to 99%) coupling with the efficient production of H2 (&#8776;50&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1). Remarkably, it enables the scale&#8208;up production (&#8776;14.4&#160;g in a batch experiment) and the obtained products can serve as rubber vulcanization accelerators with superior properties to traditional industrial rubber additives in real industrial processes. This powerful catalysis system that can simultaneously produce rubber vulcanization accelerator and H2 may inaugurate a new electrocatalytic avenue to explore polyoxometalate&#8208;based foam catalysts in electrocatalysis field.

         <title>Surface Engineering of Fluorinated Graphene Nanosheets Enables Ultrafast Lithium/Sodium/Potassium Primary Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient surface engineering strategy combining surface defluorination and nitrogen doping enables fluorinated graphene nanosheets to construct conductive nanolayers and fast ion channels. Based on this, the DFG&#8208;N materials developed in this work achieve record&#8208;fast discharge rates and ultrahigh power densities without sacrificing energy density in both lithium/sodium/potassium primary batteries, proving promising for commercial applications.








Abstract
Fluorinated carbon (CFx) is considered as a promising cathode material for lithium/sodium/potassium primary batteries with superior theoretical energy density. However, achieving high energy and power densities simultaneously remains a considerable challenge due to the strong covalency of the C&#8211;F bond in the highly fluorinated CFx. Herein, an efficient surface engineering strategy combining surface defluorination and nitrogen doping enables fluorinated graphene nanosheets (DFG&#8208;N) to possess controllable conductive nanolayers and reasonably regulated C&#8211;F bonds. The DFG&#8208;N delivers an unprecedented dual performance for lithium primary batteries with a power density of 77456&#160;W kg&#8722;1 and an energy density of 1067&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at an ultrafast rate of 50 C, which is the highest level reported to date. The DFG&#8208;N also achieves a record power density of 15 256 and 17 881&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 10 C for sodium and potassium primary batteries, respectively. The characterization results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the excellent performance of DFG&#8208;N is attributed to surface engineering strategies that remarkably improve electronic and ionic conductivity without sacrificing the high fluorine content. This work provides a compelling strategy for developing advanced ultrafast primary batteries that combine ultrahigh energy density and power density.

         <title>Power&#8208;Efficient Multisensory Reservoir Computing Based on Zr&#8208;Doped HfO2 Memcapacitive Synapse Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A memcapacitive&#8208;synapse&#8208;based physical reservoir computing (RC) system is reported. The device's intrinsic property matches the dynamics of multisensory information processing. A touchless user interface (TUI) for a virtual shopping system is demonstrated, benefitting from the robustness and versatility of such a device, which is of profound implication for energy&#8208;efficient human&#8722;computer interface and edge computing apparatus.








Abstract
Hardware implementation tailored to requirements in reservoir computing would facilitate lightweight and powerful temporal processing. Capacitive reservoirs would boost power efficiency due to their ultralow static power consumption but have not been experimentally exploited yet. Here, this work&#160;reports an oxide&#8208;based memcapacitive synapse (OMC) based on Zr&#8208;doped HfO2 (HZO) for a power&#8208;efficient and multisensory processing reservoir computing system. The nonlinearity and state richness required for reservoir computing could originate from the capacitively coupled polarization switching and charge trapping of hafnium&#8208;oxide&#8208;based devices. The power consumption (&#8776;113.4 fJ per spike) and temporal processing versatility outperform most resistive reservoirs. This&#160;system is verified by common benchmark tasks, and it exhibits high accuracy (&gt;94%) in recognizing multisensory information, including acoustic, electrophysiological, and mechanic modalities. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a touchless user interface for virtual shopping based on the&#160;OMC&#8208;based reservoir computing system is demonstrated, benefiting from its interference&#8208;robust acoustic and electrophysiological perception. These&#160;results shed light on the development of highly power&#8208;efficient human&#8211;machine interfaces and machine&#8208;learning platforms.

This&#160;system is verified by common benchmark tasks, and it exhibits high accuracy (&amp;gt;94%) in recognizing multisensory information, including acoustic, electrophysiological, and mechanic modalities. As a proof-of-concept, a touchless user interface for virtual shopping based on the&#160;OMC-based reservoir computing system is demonstrated, benefiting from its interference-robust acoustic and electrophysiological perception. These&#160;results shed light on the development of highly power-efficient human&#8211;machine interfaces and machine-learning platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Transformable Mucoadhesive Microgel Network for Noninvasive Multimodal Imaging And Radioprotection of a Large Area of the Gastrointestinal Tract</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mucoadhesive microgel (Bi&#8208;GLUE) integrating high mucoadhesion and flowability is developed as a novel gastrointestinal (GI) modulation platform, which can cover large&#8208;area GI tracts through oral administration. The contrast&#8208;loaded Bi&#8208;GLUE achieves multimodal, large&#8208;area GI imaging that traditional contrasts cannot fulfill. Moreover, the Bi&#8208;GLUE offers a new GI&#8208;radioprotection strategy by constructing an intracorporal radiation&#8208;attenuating shield in the GI lumen.








Abstract
The lack of noninvasive imaging and modulation of a large area of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract constrain the diagnosis and treatment of many GI&#8208;related diseases. Recent advances use novel mucoadhesive materials to coat a part of the GI tract and then modulate its functions. High mucoadhesion is the key factor of the partial coating, but also the limitation for not spreading and covering the lower GI tract. Here, a bismuth&#8211;pectin organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid complex is screened and engineered into a transformable microgel network (Bi&#8208;GLUE) with high flowability and mucoadhesion, such that it&#160;can quickly transit through and coat a large area of the GI tract. In murine and porcine models, Bi&#8208;GLUE delivers contrast agents to achieve real&#8208;time, large&#8208;area GI&#8208;tract imaging under X&#8208;ray or magnetic resonance &#160;modalities and to facilitate the non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis. Moreover, Bi&#8208;GLUE, like an intracorporal radiation shield, decreases the radiotoxicity in a whole&#8208;abdomen irradiation rat model. This transformable microgel network offers a new direction that can modulate a large area of the GI tract and may have broad applications for GI&#8208;related conditions.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Platelet Lysates Proteins into Microparticles by Unnatural Disulfide Bonds for Bottom&#8208;Up Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteins from human&#8208;derived platelet lysates (PLs) produce microparticles by forming unnatural disulfide bonds (&#8211;S&#8211;S&#8211;). In this study, protein&#8208;based microparticles are produced with defined surface topography and tunable size using a direct, simple, and low&#8208;cost methodology. These bioactive microstructures allow cell&#8208;guided microaggregates to form and have applications in bottom&#8208;up approaches.








Abstract
There is a demand to design microparticles holding surface topography while presenting inherent bioactive cues for applications in the biomedical and biotechnological fields. Using the pool of proteins present in human&#8208;derived platelet lysates (PLs), the production of protein&#8208;based microparticles via a simple and cost&#8208;effective method is reported, exploring the prone redox behavior of cysteine (Cy&#8208;SH) amino acid residues. The forced formation of new intermolecular disulfide bonds results in the precipitation of the proteins as spherical, pompom&#8208;like microparticles with adjustable sizes (15&#8211;50&#160;&#181;m in diameter) and surface topography consisting of grooves and ridges. These PL microparticles exhibit extraordinary cytocompatibility, allowing cell&#8208;guided microaggregates to form, while also working as injectable systems for cell support. Early studies also suggest that the surface topography provided by these PL microparticles can support osteogenic behavior. Consequently, these PL microparticles may find use to create live tissues via bottom&#8208;up procedures or injectable tissue&#8208;defect fillers, particularly for bone regeneration, with the prospect of working under xeno&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>A Quasi&#8208;2D Polypyrrole Film with Band&#8208;Like Transport Behavior and High Charge&#8208;Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first band&#8208;like transport behavior in polypyrrole (PPy) is reported. Utilizing an air/H2SO4&#8208;interface&#8208;assisted approach, a quasi&#8208;2D polypyrrole (q2DPPy) film is synthesized, formed by a layered assembly of fully extended quinoidal PPy chains. Terahertz time&#8208;domain spectroscopy at various temperatures reveals unprecedented high charge&#8208;carrier mobility up to &#8776;107.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, attributed to the efficient band&#8208;like short&#8208;range transport in q2DPPy.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D (q2D) conjugated polymers (CPs) are polymers that consist of linear CP chains assembled through non&#8208;covalent interactions to form a layered structure. In this work, the synthesis of a novel crystalline q2D polypyrrole (q2DPPy) film at the air/H2SO4 (95%) interface is reported. The unique interfacial environment facilitates chain extension, prevents disorder, and results in a crystalline, layered assembly of protonated quinoidal chains with a fully extended conformation in its crystalline domains. This unique structure features highly delocalized &#960;&#8208;electron systems within the extended chains, which is responsible for the low effective mass and narrow electronic bandgap. Thus, the temperature&#8208;dependent charge&#8208;transport properties of q2DPPy are investigated using the van der Pauw (vdP) method and terahertz time&#8208;domain spectroscopy (THz&#8208;TDS). The vdP method reveals that the q2DPPy film exhibits a semiconducting behavior with a thermally activated hopping mechanism in long&#8208;range transport between the electrodes. Conversely, THz&#8208;TDS reveals a band&#8208;like transport, indicating intrinsic charge transport up to a record short&#8208;range high THz mobility of &#8776;107.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1.
