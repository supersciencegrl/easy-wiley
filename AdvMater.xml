         <title>Self&#8208;Evolving Discovery of Carrier Biomaterials with Ultra&#8208;Low Nonspecific Protein Adsorption for Single Cell Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;evolving discovery integrating automation and AI is developed to address the high&#8208;dimensional&#8208;parameter&#8208;space challenge in carrier biomaterials. The discovered biomaterials showed ultra&#8208;low nonspecific protein adsorption, achieving a 10&#160;000&#8208;fold reduction in experiment workload; and they are further fabricated into microfluidic&#8208;used carriers for protein&#8208;analysis applications, showing a 9&#8208;fold enhancement in detection sensitivity. This study has potential for applications in single&#8208;cell analysis.








Abstract
Carrier biomaterials used in single&#8208;cell analysis face a bottleneck in protein detection sensitivity, primarily attributed to elevated false positives caused by nonspecific protein adsorption. Toward carrier biomaterials with ultra&#8208;low nonspecific protein adsorption, a self&#8208;evolving discovery is developed to address the challenge of high&#8208;dimensional parameter spaces. Automation across nine self&#8208;developed or modified workstations is integrated to achieve a &#8220;can&#8208;do&#8221; capability, and develop a synergy&#8208;enhanced Bayesian optimization algorithm as the artificial intelligence brain to enable a &#8220;can&#8208;think&#8221; capability for small&#8208;data problems inherent to time&#8208;consuming biological experiments, thereby establishing a self&#8208;evolving discovery for carrier biomaterials. Through this approach, carrier biomaterials with an ultra&#8208;low nonspecific protein adsorption index of 0.2537 are successfully discovered, representing an over 80% decrease, while achieving a 10&#160;000&#8208;fold reduction in experiment workload. Furthermore, the discovered biomaterials are fabricated into microfluidic&#8208;used carriers for protein&#8208;analysis applications, showing a 9&#8208;fold enhancement in detection sensitivity compared to conventional carriers. This is the very demonstration of a self&#8208;evolving discovery for carrier biomaterials, paving the way for advancements in single&#8208;cell protein analysis and further its integration with genomics and transcriptomics.

         <title>Stochastic Orientational Encoding via Hydrogen Bonding Driven Assembly of Woven&#8208;Like Molecular Physically Unclonable Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel stochastic orientational encoding approach utilizing a nanoscopic film of a novel rod&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;architecture, achieved through facile ambient&#8208;atmosphere solution processing. Energetically favorable molecular assembly, driven by directional multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs and uniaxial microcrystal growth, results in a woven&#8208;textured pattern with random 1D features. The rich variations in microcrystal domain properties and crystal orientations coupled with artificial coloration enable high encoding capacity in a single&#8208;material, solution&#8208;processed system.








Abstract
The prevention of counterfeiting and the assurance of object authenticity require stochastic encoding schemes based on physically unclonable functions (PUFs). There is an urgent need for exceptionally large encoding capacities and multi&#8208;level responses within a molecularly defined, single&#8208;material system. Herein, a novel stochastic orientational encoding approach is demonstrated using a facile ambient&#8208;atmosphere solution processing of a molecular thin film based on the rod&#8208;shaped oligo(p&#8208;phenyleneethynylene) (OPE) &#960;&#8208;architecture. The nanoscopic film, derived from the small molecule 2EHO&#8208;CF3PyPE with donor, acceptor, and &#960;&#8208;spacer building units, is designed for energetically favorable uniaxial molecular assembly and crystal growth via directional multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs at the molecular termini and short C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; contacts at the center. A facile solvent vapor annealing induces concurrent dewetting and microscopic 1D random crystallization, yielding a woven&#8208;textured random features. Using convolutional neural networks, the rich variations in microcrystal domain properties and stochastic encoding of 1D crystal orientations generate artificial coloration, achieving an encoding capacity reaching (6.5 &#215; 10&#8308;)(2752 &#215; 2208). The results demonstrate an effective strategy for achieving ultrahigh encoding capacities in a thin film composed of a single&#8208;material. This approach enables low&#8208;cost, solution&#8208;processed fabrication for mass production and broad adoption, while opening new opportunities to explore molecular&#8208;PUFs through structural design and engineering noncovalent interactions.

         <title>Observation of Z2 Non&#8208;Hermitian Skin Effect in Projective Mirror&#8208;Symmetric Acoustic Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetry&#8208;protected Z&#8322; non&#8208;Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is experimentally demonstrated in acoustic metamaterials. By implementing projective mirror symmetry&#8212;which enables pseudospins in spinless systems&#8212;both uniform and bidirectional Z&#8322; NHSEs characterized by different accumulation directions are observed. Active feedback circuits provide the requisite non&#8208;Hermitian gain/loss, establishing a platform for topological wave manipulation.








Abstract
Non&#8208;Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), where eigenstates localize at the boundary of non&#8208;Hermitian lattices, has gained significant attention in various fields. This phenomenon, driven by the point&#8208;gap topology of complex energy bands, occurs even without special symmetries. Nevertheless, additional symmetry may significantly enrich the NHSE. Notably, time&#8208;reversal symmetry protects a Z2 NHSE, featuring oppositely accumulated skin modes. Here, a 1D bilayer Z2 NHSE model based on projective mirror symmetry is proposed, making Z2 NHSE possible in spinless systems. Experimentally, both uniform and bidirectional Z2 NHSEs are observed in acoustic metamaterials, where the necessary non&#8208;Hermitian elements&#8212;gain and loss&#8212;are achieved through active feedback circuits. These findings open new avenues for exploring symmetry&#8208;enriched non&#8208;Hermitian topological phenomena and pave the way for potential applications in wave manipulation, sensing, and beyond.

         <title>Nanocrystal&#8208;Nucleus Template Strategy for Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells with Enhanced Homogeneity and Energy&#8208;Level Alignment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanocrystal&#8208;nucleus template strategy addresses nanoscale phase separation and energy&#8208;level mismatch in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells. By tailoring nanocrystals to match the target perovskite's composition and structure, this approach enables uniform halide distribution, enhanced crystallization, and improved electron extraction. The strategy achieves 23.4%&#8208;efficient PSCs (1.68 eV) with a record VOC of 1.30 V and certified 31.7%&#8208;efficient perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are critical for advancing tandem solar cell efficiencies, yet suffer from severe photovoltage deficits and halide segregation, substantially degrading their performance and stability. Here, a nanocrystal&#8208;nucleus template (NCNT) strategy is developed to directly addresses heterogeneous nucleation&#8212;the root cause of phase separation&#8212;by precisely matching the I/Br ratio of nanocrystal to that of the target perovskite film. This approach guides homogeneous assembly of Pb&#8208;I/Br octahedra, achieving exceptional halide uniformity and precise crystallization control for WBG films. The NCNT simultaneously induces p&#8208;type doping and reduces the perovskite/C60 interfacial energy barrier, significantly enhancing charge extraction. Remarkably, 1.68&#8208;eV WBG PSCs fabricated via this approach achieve a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.30&#160;V, alongside a champion efficiency of 23.4%. The broad applicability of this strategy is demonstrated across a wide bandgap range of 1.63&#8211;1.76&#160;eV, all exhibiting (001)&#8208;preferred orientation and exceptional photostability. When integrated into a 0.945 cm2 monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell, the NCNT&#8208;based device delivers a high efficiency of 32.0% (certified 31.7%). This work highlights the pivotal role of nanocrystals in regulating perovskite crystallization, resolves long&#8208;standing VOC limitations in WBG perovskites, and establishes a scalable platform for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices and tandem photovoltaics.

         <title>Superblack Carbon Hierarchitectures for Multispectral Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superblack carbon hierarchitectures are developed through synergistic cross&#8208;dimensional engineering that integrates physical structuring with chemical modification, enabling high&#8208;performance multispectral absorption across visible, infrared, and microwave regimes simultaneously. Carbon microparticles with a fractal dimension approaching 1.0, or those possessing a networked structure, inherently offer advantages in achieving broad and strong multispectral responses.








Abstract
Multispectral absorbing materials that can efficiently dissipate waves across the visible, infrared, and microwave regimes have long been pursued for advanced applications in fields such as space exploration, stealth, and camouflage. However, the wide range of incident wavelengths, spanning five orders of magnitude, presents a significant challenge for the practical implementation of multispectral absorbers. Herein, superblack carbon hierarchitectures (SCHs) are designed using a bottom&#8208;up approach involving the self&#8208;assembly and self&#8208;sacrifice of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), realizing synergistic morphological customization and dielectric gene editing (via carbon nitride like&#8208;moieties conjugated with C&#9552;C short chains). Through the cross&#8208;dimensional coupling action between light&#8208;trapping hierarchitecture and robust dielectric loss, superb visible light absorption (&gt;99.6%), high infrared absorption (98.5%/97.5%/99.6% for long&#8208;/mid&#8208;/short&#8208;wavelength infrared regimes), and ultrabroad microwave absorption (effective bandwidth of 8.52&#160;GHz, nearly covering both the X and Ku bands) can be simultaneously achieved in monolayer SCHs&#8208;based absorbers. Furthermore, the topologically transformed structures of SCHs enable a systematic dissection of the longstanding ambiguity surrounding the geometrical effect, revealing the synergistic influence of fractal dimension and interconnection status of microparticles, particularly in the microwave regime. This work introduces a new paradigm for multispectral absorption and advances the understanding of absorption mechanisms for developing next&#8208;generation absorbers.

         <title>Electrospun Lignin/ZnO Nanofibrous Membranes for Self&#8208;Powered Ultrasensitive Flexible Airflow Sensor and Wearable Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the novel sensing applications of water evaporation&#8208;induced power generation, by using lignin/ZnO nanofibrous membranes for sensing airflow through output voltage variation. Obtained lignin/ZnO airflow sensors are self&#8208;powered, precise, and quick&#8208;responding, and can be used as wearable devices for breath monitor, surrounding movement sensor, and sweat monitor.








Abstract
The interest and demand for flexible sensors and wearable devices are rapidly growing. The added benefit of electricity generation, enabling gas sensors to be self&#8208;powered, increases the applicability of these devices for flexible and wearable airflow sensors. Inspired by water evaporation&#8208;induced power generation, this study explores its potential in sensing applications, which has not yet been explored in detail. Electrospinning technology is used to prepare superhydrophilic lignin/ZnO nanofibrous membranes with a ZnO nanoparticle layer, capable of generating at least 100&#160;mV (which allows it to power its own signal transduction). The membrane is highly sensitive to variations in airflow, enabling its use as an ultrasensitive and flexible airflow sensor. This sensor demonstrates exceptional performance, including a fast response time (0.65 s), broad detection range (with lower detection limit down to 0.25 and upper detection limit of 3&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1), and extremely high airflow velocity detection accuracy. Beyond these, it can serve as a wearable sensor for sweat monitoring, motion detection, and breath monitoring (to accurately detect breathing rate, intensity and variations in speech). Such self&#8208;powered, ultrasensitive, and flexible lignin/ZnO airflow sensors provide novel potential to advance the development of smart textiles and wearable electronics.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Nanoengineered Wood for Scalable Monolithic Gas Sensor Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by insect olfactory structures, a bionic nanoengineered wood scalable monolithic gas sensor fabrication is developed. By precisely constructing vertical microchannels and sulfur&#8208;vacancy WS&#8322; nanosheets, the wood achieves selective NO&#8322; adsorption and efficient charge transfer. The 3D interdigitated electrodes enhance signal conduction, achieving a detection limit of 50 ppb, demonstrating great potential for scalable manufacturing and wireless gas detection.








Abstract
Insects exhibit exceptional olfactory abilities due to the synergistic interaction between porous sensilla and sensory receptors, optimizing gas transmission and capture. Inspired by this, a scalable structure of WS2&#8208;functionalized nanoengineered wood (WS2&#8208;NEW) for bio&#8208;inspired gas sensors is designed. A multiscale sensing network mimicking insect receptor synergy by in&#8208;situ loading WS2 nanosheets into vertically aligned microchannels formed by lignin removal, integrated with cross&#8208;sectional 3D interdigital electrodes is developed. The nanoengineered wood enables selective NO2 adsorption and optimized charge transfer through engineered gas transport pathways and defect&#8208;rich active sites. With the optimized 3D electrode structure, WS&#8322;&#8208;NEW facilitates rapid gas transmission and real&#8208;time signal transduction, achieving highly sensitive NO2 detection at room temperature with a detection limit as low as 50 ppb. Utilizing wood's processability, WS2&#8208;NEW has demonstrated the potential for large&#8208;scale manufacturing via simple cutting techniques. A wireless sensor watch based on WS2&#8208;NEW for real&#8208;time NO2 detection highlights its potential in wearable devices. This work proposes an innovative strategy for the manufacturing of gas sensors.

         <title>Coupling Tensile Strain and Electronic Modulation in Mesoporous PdMo Metallene Nanoveins for Improved Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal ligand adsorption strategy for controllable synthesis of low&#8208;dimensional (1D and 2D) Pd&#8208;based electrocatalysts to establish a fundamental understanding of the relationship between catalyst morphological structure and performance.








Abstract
Unraveling the fundamental determinants of the intrinsic activity of practical catalysts has long been challenging, mainly due to the complexity of the structures and surfaces of such catalysts. Current understandings of intrinsic activity mostly come from model catalysts. Here, a pH&#8208;induced ligand adsorption strategy is developed to achieve controllable synthesis of self&#8208;assembled low&#8208;dimensional PdMo nanostructures, including 1D nanowires, 2D metallenes, and 2D metallene nanoveins. A strong correlation is established between the intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and the density of grain boundaries. Increased grain boundary density induces more extensive tensile strain, which, in synergy with electronic interactions within PdMo alloys, effectively lowers the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step (*O to *OH). 2D PdMo metallene nanoveins, featuring the highest grain boundary density and a unique mesoporous structure, exhibit superior ORR activity and mass transport capabilities. Computational fluid dynamics simulations and in situ spectroscopy are employed to elucidate the structure&#8208;activity relationship. This work provides fundamental insights into the critical role of grain boundary engineering in enhancing ORR electrocatalysis in Pd&#8208;based nanostructures.

         <title>Spatial Coordination Structure&#8208;Driven Enzyme&#8208;Like Selectivity in Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sun et&#160;al. reviews recent progress in enhancing the enzyme&#8208;like catalytic selectivity of SAzymes through the rational design of their spatial coordination structures. They emphasize the structure&#8208;activity relationships of various attributes of these coordination structures in promoting selective catalytic behavior, the strategic design of coordination structures for target enzyme&#8208;like reactions, and effective synthesis methods for integrating these structures onto supports.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) are nanomaterials that rely on atomic&#8208;level active sites to efficiently express catalytic functions like natural enzymes. With their outstanding robustness and exceptional atomic utilization, they are among the most competitive nanozymes used to overcome the inherent shortcomings of natural enzymes. However, SAzymes lack the precise structural complexity of natural enzymes and therefore do not exhibit the same level of catalytic selectivity&#8212;a major barrier to fully replacing natural enzymes. Previous studies have primarily focused on summarizing the methods and rules for improving the enzyme&#8208;like activity of SAzymes, while comparatively little attention has been given to their catalytic selectivity. Herein, this work reviews recent progress in enhancing the enzyme&#8208;like catalytic selectivity of SAzymes through the rational design of their spatial coordination structures. It emphasizes the structure&#8208;activity relationships of various attributes of these coordination structures in promoting selective catalytic behavior, the strategic design of coordination structures for target enzyme&#8208;like reactions, and effective synthesis methods for integrating these structures onto supports. In addition, the development prospects and current challenges in exploring SAzyme coordination structures are analyzed to provide new inspiration constructing next generation, highly selective SAzymes.

         <title>Unidirectional Electrobending Deformation in Acceptor&#8208;Doped Piezoceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel unidirectional electrobending behavior with a symmetric butterfly&#8208;shaped bipolar S&#8208;E curve in acceptor&#8208;doped K0.5Na0.5NbO3 ceramics, where the bending direction is governed by the pre&#8208;poling direction rather than the applied electric field. We attribute that this unprecedented unidirectional behavior arises from the synergistic interaction between domains and defect dipoles in the surface layers.








Abstract
Since 2022, large apparent strains (&gt;1%) with highly asymmetrical strain&#8208;electric field (S&#8208;E) curves have been reported in various thin piezoceramic materials, attributed to a bidirectional electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced bending (electrobending) deformation, which consistently produces convex bending along the negative electric field direction. In this study, a novel unidirectional electrobending behavior in acceptor&#8208;doped K0.5Na0.5NbO3 ceramics are reported, where convex bending always occurs along the pre&#8208;poling direction regardless of the direction of the applied electric field. This unique deformation is related to the reorientation of the (MNb&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8722;VO&#183;&#183;$M_{{\mathrm{Nb}}}^{^{\prime\prime\prime}} - V_{\mathrm{O}}^{ \cdot \cdot }$) defect dipoles (where M2+ represents the acceptor&#8208;doped ion in the Nb&#8208; site) in one surface layer during the pre&#8208;poling process, resulting in an asymmetrical distribution of defect dipoles in the two surface layers. The synergistic interaction between ferroelectric domains and defect dipoles in the surface layers induces this unidirectional electrobending, as evidenced by a butterfly&#8208;like symmetrical bipolar S&#8208;E curve with a giant apparent strain of 3.2%. These findings provide new insights into defect engineering strategies for developing advanced piezoelectric materials with large electroinduced displacements.

         <title>In Situ Reconstructed Cu/Cu2+1O/ZnO Inverse Opals Accelerate Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction Kinetics for High Power Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel Cu/Cu2+1O/ZnO inverse opal catalyst is presented with abundant active sites and optimized electronic structure for the nitrate reduction reaction and high&#8208;power Zn&#8208;NO3&#8211; battery, resulting in the significantly enhanced catalytic reaction kinetics.








Abstract
The electroreduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3 (NO3RR) using renewable energy presents a promising strategy to mitigate environmental pollution and produce high&#8208;value chemicals. However, the practical application of NO3RR is hindered by limited active sites and sluggish reaction kinetics, stemming from the complex eight&#8208;electron process. Herein, a novel Cu/Cu2+1O/ZnO&#8208;2.5 inverse opals (CCZ&#8208;IOs&#8208;2.5) catalyst featuring a 3D porous network is designed, which provides abundant active sites and an optimized electronic structure to accelerate the NO3RR kinetics for efficient NH3 production. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of ZnO facilitates electron transfer to Cu active sites, increasing charge density and lowering the reaction energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step (*NO to *NOH). As a result, CCZ&#8208;IOs&#8208;2.5 exhibits a notable enhancement in NH3 yield (from 0.255 to 0.313&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and Faradaic efficiency (from 85.7% to 95.5%) compared to the Cu/Cu2+1O catalyst. Thanks to its excellent NO3RR activity, the Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery with the CCZ&#8208;IOs&#8208;2.5 cathode achieves a max power density of 11.93&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This study adopts a multi&#8208;dimensional strategy encompassing morphology regulation, electronic structure optimization, and surface/interface engineering, offering new insights into efficient electrocatalyst development and realizing integrated NH3 synthesis and energy output in a Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery.

         <title>Precisely Patterning Liquid Metal Microfibers Through Electrohydrodynamic Printing for Soft Conductive Composites and Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrohydrodynamic printing process is developed to precisely pattern liquid metal microfibers with ultra&#8208;high resolution (&#8776;1.5&#160;&#181;m) and minimal defects, which effectively overcomes the limitations of electrospinning. To the best of their knowledge, the patterning resolution achieved in this work is the highest reported for liquid metal particle&#8208;based inks. Applications in soft sensors and soft conductive composites are demonstrated.








Abstract
Liquid metal particle&#8208;based microfibers attract great interest in soft and wearable electronics. The most facile method to fabricate sub&#8208;50&#160;&#181;m liquid metal fiber is electrospinning. However, electrospinning has poor patterning ability and the electrospun fibers have inherent defects, which significantly lowers the electrical conductivity and limits their application. Therefore, better manufacturing methods are needed to precisely deposit high&#8208;quality liquid metal fibers. In this work, an electrohydrodynamic printing process is developed to precisely pattern liquid metal microfibers with minimal defects and ultra&#8208;high resolution (&#8776;1.5&#160;&#181;m), overcoming the limitations of electrospinning. The patterned liquid metal fibers can be used for soft conductive composites and soft electronics with highly customized microscale features. The conductive composites embedded with these fibers not only exhibit high conductivity (up to 214 S&#160;cm&#8722;1), but also possess nearly strain&#8208;insensitive resistance (7.3% resistance change at 200% strain) and exceptional cyclic stability. Additionally, the potential applications of the liquid metal fibers and composites in soft sensors, stretchable heaters, and transparent electrodes are demonstrated.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered &#945; Radionuclide Nanomedicine: Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Multimodal Energy Recycling for Amplified Radioimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional nanomedicine co&#8208;loading of the &#945;&#8208;emitter 223RaCl2 within iron&#8208;based MOFs is developed. Precisely targeted to mitochondria, it exploits the full decay spectrum to synchronize three therapeutic actions: direct &#945;&#8208;particle ionization, self&#8208;powered catalytic H2O2 generation via secondary electrons, and immunogenic cell death induction. This integrated approach overcomes the limitations of conventional radiotherapy by facilitating effective local tumor ablation and systemic anti&#8208;tumor immunity without external energy input.








Abstract
Internal Radionuclide Therapy (IRT) faces significant challenges, particularly the limited controlled penetration depth of conventional &#946; rays and the inefficient targeted delivery of &#945;&#8208;emitters. In this study, a mitochondria&#8208;targeted, self&#8208;powered &#945; radionuclide nanomedicine, and pioneer a groundbreaking &#8220;suborganelle precise radiodynamic immunotherapy&#8221; paradigm that synergistically integrates physical irradiation, catalytic chemistry, and immunomodulation to overcome the historical limitations of IRT is developed. The innovation establishes a &#8220;radionuclide energy internal cycling&#8221; strategy through 223RaCl2 (the first FDA&#8208;approved &#945;&#8208;emitter), unlocking three synergistic therapies from one radionuclide: precise ionizing radiation, self&#8208;powered catalysis, and immunogenic reprogramming. This paradigm uniquely exploits the full decay spectrum (&#945; particles, &#946; electrons, &#947; photons) to synchronize physical, chemical, and biological anti&#8208;tumor mechanisms without requiring external energy inputs, offering a transformative solution to overcome the physical&#8208;biological barriers of IRT and bridge localized eradication with systemic immune regulation.

This work engineered a LiF&#8208;rich sandwich&#8208;model cathode electrolyte interphase with LiBxOy&#8208;rich outer and &#8722;C&#8801;N&#8208;rich inner layer via LiBF4&#8208;based partially fluorinated electrolyte with para&#8208;fluorobenzeneacetonitrile additive. This optimized electrolyte formulation and stable cathode electrolyte interphase endows Li||NCM94 batteries with long&#8208;life, high&#8208;voltage, and all&#8208;climate high&#8208;performance, and a record 544 Wh kg&#8722;1 in 7.6 Ah pouch cells with 158&#8208;cycle stability.








Abstract
All&#8208;climate lithium metal batteries are highly needed, but remains a huge challenge in cycling life due to the existence of unstable electrode electrolyte interphases, especially with nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode at high cut&#8208;off voltage. To address this question, a functional and robust sandwich&#8208;model cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) is proposed, derived from a LiBF4&#8208;based electrolyte modified with para&#8208;fluorobenzeneacetonitrile (P&#8208;FBCN) additive, to realize the stability of 4.8&#160;V Li||LiNi0.94Co0.05Mn0.01O2 (NCM94) battery operated from &#8722;60 to 60 &#176;C. The LiF&#8208;rich sandwich&#8208;model CEI features an outer layer of LiBxOy&#8208;rich to enhance mechanical/thermal stability, and the inner &#8722;C&#8801;N&#8208;rich anchoring layer to facilitate Li&#8314; conduction and inhibit the dissolution of transition metal ions. Notably, the 7.6 Ah&#8208;grade Li||NCM94 pouch cell with such electrolyte can yield a high energy density of 544&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with a long lifespan of 158 cycles.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printing of Ultratough and Healable Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a 3D&#8208;printable elastomer that achieves both excellent mechanical properties (toughness of 158.5&#160;MJ m&#8722;3) and self&#8208;healing performances (healing efficiency of 95.6%), achieved through the ingenious formulation of two dynamic bonds (acylsemicarbazide and carbamate) into the DLP printable resin, making it ideal for flexible and versatile fabrication of complex structures.








Abstract
Although 3D&#8208;printing has offered a promising solution for the freeform fabrication of complex, arbitrary structures, developing elastomeric materials that simultaneously possess mechanical robustness and self&#8208;healing functionality remains a significant challenge. To address this, a 3D&#8208;printable elastomer is reported by the strategic incorporation of hierarchical hydrogen bonding (acylsemicarbazide and carbamate) into the photoactive resin, thereby overcoming the traditional trade&#8208;off between mechanical strength and dynamic functionality. The resulting elastomer exhibits ultra&#8208;toughness (158.5&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), with tensile strength and breaking strain of 49.6&#160;MPa and 1136%, respectively. In addition, the acylsemicarbazide moieties endow the 3D&#8208;printed elastomers with unique dynamic characteristics, including self&#8208;healing capabilities and shape reconfigurability, thus significantly enhancing the design flexibility and versatility of complex structures.

         <title>Regulating Polymeric Adsorption Dynamics via Monolayer&#8208;Architected Hydrotalcite Integration for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular aggregation control strategy utilizing a 2D atomic crystal, hydrotalcite, regulates polymeric adsorption dynamics of donor polymers, achieving an overall efficiency of 20.63%.








Abstract
In organic solar cells (OSCs), the molecular aggregation property of donor&#8211;acceptor bulk heterojunction (BHJ) architectures serves as a critical determinant in device performance. Nevertheless, the intrinsic steric constraints imposed by polymeric side chains frequently lead to metastable molecular packing configurations with diminished structural coherence. In this study, a morphological modulation strategy is proposed by adopting a 2D layered hydrotalcite (HDC) nanocrystal to regulate polymeric adsorption dynamics. By leveraging hydroxyl&#8208;directed interfacial coordination to HDC matrices, the nanocrystal&#8208;integrated BHJ systems manifest a pronounced donor&#8208;phase H&#8208;aggregation, synergistically coupled with reduced &#960;&#8208;orbital overlap distances and enhanced long&#8208;range crystalline ordering. These nanoscale structural advancements collectively engender superior charge transfer kinetics with reduced activation energy barriers and improved charge carrier transport properties. The HDC nanocrystal&#8208;blended devices not only achieve a top&#8208;notch power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.63%, but also shows its applicability across various donor &#8211; acceptor BHJ systems. This work develops a crystal&#8208;engineering strategy that concurrently optimizes nanoscale morphology and charge transport networks in OSCs, yielding state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performance through synergistic structural&#8208;electronic modulation.

         <title>Neuromorphic Polarization Vision Enabled by Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Photosynaptic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired polarization&#8208;sensitive photosynaptic transistor using anisotropic organic micro&#8208;crystals is developed to replicate biological polarization vision. A record dichroic ratio of &gt;103 is achieved under ultraweak light of 600&#160;nW&#160;cm&#8722;2 while operating at the ultralow energy consumption of 0.22&#160;pJ per synaptic event. The artificial visual neuron replicates complex polarization vision behaviors of butterflies, including intraspecific communication and target recognition.








Abstract
Polarization vision, a highly sophisticated visual capability in insects such as butterflies and bees, plays a pivotal role in enabling survival&#8208;critical ecological behaviors, such as navigation, intraspecific communication, mating, and habitat selection. However, the replication of this capability in artificial systems has long been impeded by the limited dichroic ratio (DR, typically &lt; 10) of existing materials and the complexity of conventional optical designs. Here, the first time a bioinspired polarization&#8208;sensitive photosynaptic transistor is developed based on organic micro&#8208;crystal arrays for neuromorphic polarization vision. By leveraging the polarization&#8208;dependent photogating effect in intrinsically anisotropic organic crystals, the device achieves an unprecedented DR exceeding 103 within a minimal gate&#8208;bias window of 1 V, outperforming existing polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors by two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the device successfully mimics the synaptic plasticity of polarization&#8208;sensitive visual neurons, enabling tunable transitions between short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term plasticity through a charge&#8208;storage accumulative process. Significantly, it operates with an exceptionally low energy consumption of 0.22 pJ per synaptic event under ultraweak polarized light of 600&#160;nW&#160;cm&#8722;2, rivaling the efficiency of biological neural systems. Further it demonstrates the replication of complex polarization vision behaviors of butterflies, including intraspecific communication and target recognition, using this artificial visual neuron. Our work opens new avenues for neuromorphic polarization vision, with broad implications for intelligent neurorobotics and energy&#8208;efficient biomimetic electronics.

         <title>Hierarchically MOF&#8208;Based Porous Monolith Composites for Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the design of hierarchical porous materials for atmospheric water harvesting, focusing on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and porous monoliths. Emphasis is placed on integrating MOF nanoscale porosity with the microscale channels of monolithic scaffolds to enhance sorption&#8208;desorption performance. The role of multiscale porosity, from the nanometer scale to the macrostructure, is highlighted in optimizing water uptake, vapor transport, and stability under varying humidity.








Abstract
Water scarcity, a critical global challenge, has intensified due to the adverse effects of climate change on ecosystems and its detrimental impact on human activities. Addressing this issue requires solutions capable of providing clean water in regions facing hydroclimatic challenges and limited infrastructure. Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) offers a promising solution, particularly in arid regions, by extracting moisture from the air. This review explores AWH technologies that leverage material porosity and hygroscopicity, focusing on highly porous materials such as Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and monolithic scaffolds. While MOFs exhibit exceptional water uptake due to their tunable chemistry and nanoscale porosity, their powdery nature poses stability and processability challenges. To overcome these limitations, integrating MOFs into multiscale porous monoliths&#8212;such as foams, aerogels, cryogels, and xerogels&#8212;enhances structural integrity and performance. The role of hierarchical porosity, engineered across nano&#8208;scale in MOF (&lt;2 nm) and micro&#8208;scales (&gt;2 nm) is emphasized in porous monoliths, in optimizing water capture efficiency. This review also highlights recent advancements in MOF&#8208;based composite monoliths, their working mechanisms, and the potential for large&#8208;scale implementation. By integrating nanotechnology with material chemistry, this work outlines strategies to enhance sorption capacity, desorption kinetics, and scalability, ultimately providing a roadmap for developing efficient, sustainable, and scalable AWH systems.

To overcome these limitations, integrating MOFs into multiscale porous monoliths&#8212;such as foams, aerogels, cryogels, and xerogels&#8212;enhances structural integrity and performance. The role of hierarchical porosity, engineered across nano-scale in MOF (&amp;lt;2 nm) and micro-scales (&amp;gt;2 nm) is emphasized in porous monoliths, in optimizing water capture efficiency. This review also highlights recent advancements in MOF-based composite monoliths, their working mechanisms, and the potential for large-scale implementation. By integrating nanotechnology with material chemistry, this work outlines strategies to enhance sorption capacity, desorption kinetics, and scalability, ultimately providing a roadmap for developing efficient, sustainable, and scalable AWH systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Immunomodulatory Scaffold Based on Mineralized Lotus Stalks Laden with MnCO Microspheres for Accelerated Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MnCo@mPDA&#8208;coated mineralized lotus petiole (MM@MDL3) is developed for skull defect repair. The primary function of MM@MDL3 is to rapidly recruit cells to the bone defect area via its aligned channels. And the MM@MDL3 exhibits strong M2 macrophage polarization by the release of CO and Mn2+ ions, which further enhances angiogenesis and osteogenesis while inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and maturation.








Abstract
Bone regeneration remains a significant clinical challenge due to the complexity of the bone healing process and the need for biomaterials that provide both structural support and immunomodulatory functions. Here, a bioinspired immunomodulatory scaffold is developed, composed of mineralized decellularized lotus stalks (MDL) integrated with manganese carbonyl (MnCO)&#8208;loaded mesoporous polydopamine (mPDA) microspheres (MM@MDL3). This scaffold mimics the hierarchical architecture of natural bone while offering controlled CO and Mn2+ release, promoting M2 macrophage polarization, reducing inflammation, and enhancing osteogenesis. In vitro studies demonstrate that MM@MDL3 effectively promotes mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation by activating the BMP2/SMAD/RUNX2 pathway. In vivo rat calvarial defect models confirm significant bone regeneration, with increased bone volume, enhanced vascularization, and reduced osteoclastogenesis. These results demonstrate MM@MDL3 as a promising strategy for large&#8208;segment bone defect repair by integrating a biomimetic structure with immunomodulatory and osteogenic properties. The proposed scaffold has great potential for treating clinical large&#8208;segment bone defects.

         <title>Free&#8208;Standing Supramolecular Pyridine N&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Silver(I) Metallogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive analysis of pyridine N&#8208;oxide&#8208;silver(I) trifluoroacetate complexes reveals remarkable mechanical strengths that enable the creation of free&#8208;standing objects with shape control, reaching dimensions of up to centimeters and shedding new insights into the gelation mechanisms.








Abstract
Twenty&#8208;seven pyridine N&#8208;oxides (PyNOs) are investigated to evaluate the gelation of their silver(I) trifluoroacetate (AgTFA) complexes across eight solvents. Gelation occurs selectively with PyNOs featuring electron&#8208;donating groups, while those with electron&#8208;withdrawing or mixed groups do not form gels. A combination of two different PyNOs, one with an electron&#8208;donating group and the second with an electron&#8208;withdrawing group, form a gel, suggesting that gel&#8208;forming PyNO&#8208;AgTFA can override the non&#8208;gelling tendency of PyNOs comprising electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. Pyridine&#8208;AgTFA complexes lacking the N&#8211;O group fail to gel, underscoring the crucial role of the N&#8211;O functionality and its coordination with silver(I) in facilitating gelation. The resulting PyNO&#8208;AgTFA gels demonstrate remarkable mechanical strengths, enabling the fabrication of free&#8208;standing and load&#8208;bearing gel shapes, such as rods and horseshoes, with sizes up to several centimeters. The analysis of 65 X&#8208;ray crystal structures reveals that PyNO&#8208;AgTFA complexes manifest four distinct structural motifs, even when crystallized under different solvents and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal ratios, demonstrating a strong preference for a specific set of silver(I) complexes. X&#8208;ray crystallography and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction studies predict gel structures without single crystals. Density functional theory calculations of recurring non&#8208;covalent interactions in the crystal structures show interaction energies ranging from &#8722;1 to &#8722;92 kJ mol&#8722;1.

         <title>Bioinspired Hyperboloid Mechanical Metamaterial for Shock Absorption and Strain Regulation in Cartilage Remodeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the shock&#8208;absorbing architecture of natural insect elytra, a hyperboloid metamaterial scaffold exhibits compression&#8208;torsion coupling, converting mechanical loads into strain energy. The upper hyperboloid region promotes chondrogenesis via high strain, while the lower tough lattice favors osteogenesis, enhancing the integrative regeneration of both cartilage and subchondral bone.








Abstract
Inspired by the shock&#8208;absorbing capabilities of natural insect elytra, a hyperboloid lattice metamaterial exhibiting unique compression&#8208;torsion coupling behavior is designed and fabricated. This structure efficiently converts dynamic loads into strain energy, enabling high&#8208;strain elastic deformation. The hyperboloid lattice is integrated with a classic reticulation framework and filled with GelMA hydrogel, creating a tailored osteochondral scaffold with mechanical properties that closely match those of joint tissue. Under dynamic mechanical culture, compression&#8208;torsion stimulation in the hyperboloid zone induced high&#8208;strain elastic deformation, promoting chondrogenic differentiation of stem cells, while the more rigid reticulation zone, experiencing minimal deformation, facilitated osteogenic differentiation of stem cells. In a rabbit osteochondral defect model, hyperboloid&#8208;based shock&#8208;absorption scaffolds significantly enhanced the integrative repair of both cartilage and subchondral bone via the NF&#8208;&#954;B and calcium signaling pathways. The incorporation of the hyperboloid metamaterial, with its shock&#8208;absorbing and strain&#8208;regulating properties, demonstrates great potential for developing adaptable mechanical scaffolds for cartilage remodeling.

         <title>Deciphering the Species&#8208;Dependent Polysulfide Corrosion on Lithium Anode Toward Durable Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The corrosion of Li metal anode by different lithium polysulfide species is systematically revealed. Higher corrosion rate, more uniform Li deposition, and more durable Li anode cycling are achieved in low&#8208;order lithium polysulfides. A lithium polysulfide selection strategy is proposed to selectively inhibit the corrosion of high&#8208;order lithium polysulfides and prolong the cumulative capacity of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density of 2600&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. However, soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) violently corrode Li metal anodes, inducing rapid capacity decay and poor cycling lifespan of Li&#8211;S batteries. Herein, the corrosion of different LiPS species on the Li metal anode is systematically investigated. The corrosion rate of Li metal anode by Li2S8 and Li2S6 is higher than Li2S4. The discrepancy in corrosion rate is attributed to the continuous reaction between the LiPSs and Li metal, while the corrosion can hardly be prohibited by the LiPS&#8208;generated solid electrolyte interphase. Smaller Li nuclei size, more uniform Li deposition, and more durable cycling of Li metal anodes are found in Li2S4 electrolyte in comparison with Li2S8 and Li2S6 electrolytes. Consequently, a LiPS selection strategy is proposed to selectively inhibit the corrosion of high&#8208;order LiPSs and successfully prolong the cumulative capacity by 31% in Li&#8211;S batteries. This work clarifies the fundamentals of Li metal anode corrosion by different LiPS species and highlights the rational selection of favorable LiPS species for promoting the cycling durability of Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Engineered&#8208;Macrophage&#8208;Escorted Rotaxane Nanoscavengers for Precise Diquat Detoxification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops macrophage&#8208;escorted, ROS&#8208;responsive rotaxane nanoscavengers loaded with charge&#8208;neutralizing carboxymethyl &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin and anti&#8208;inflammatory 4&#8208;octyl itaconate, enabling precise renal targeting, active diquat detoxification, disruption of ROS&#8208;inflammatory cycles, and significantly improved survival in poisoned mice.








Abstract
This study proposes a bioinspired on&#8208;demand detoxification strategy addressing the critical need for efficient toxin poisoning therapies. Focusing on the high&#8208;mortality herbicide diquat, an active toxin&#8208;hunting paradigm is developed, diverging from passive methods like hemodialysis. Charge&#8208;neutralizing carboxymethyl &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CCD) is computationally designed to recognize, sequester, and detoxify diquat by counteracting its positive charge and suppressing ROS generation. To enhance renal targeting (diquat's primary toxic site), CCD is threaded onto PEG5K chains forming cyclodextrin rotaxanes, stabilized by ROS&#8208;cleavable cationic polymers, and encapsulated into macrophages to exploit inflammatory chemotaxis. The system incorporates 4&#8208;octyl itaconate (4&#8208;OI) to activate the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, synergistically breaking the ROS&#8208;inflammatory cycle. In poisoned mice, this biomimetic system demonstrates precise renal accumulation, significantly reducing ROS damage and increasing survival rates. The work validates a demand&#8208;driven molecular design framework integrating organ&#8208;specific antidote delivery with inflammation regulation&#8212;simultaneously enabling ROS scavenging and upstream pathway modulation&#8208;establishing an active toxin&#8208;neutralization theory. This strategy bridges biomaterials engineering and redox biology, where supramolecular stability during circulation synergizes with renal targeting to overcome limitations of current reactive therapies.

         <title>Engineering Biomimetic Nanofluidics Toward High&#8208;Performance Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively overviews the latest progress in advanced nanofluidic channels, focusing on optimizing permselectivity to boost ion transport efficiency. It emphasizes the systematic manipulation of nanochannel architectures to balance permeability and selectivity. Finally, it provides forward&#8208;looking insights into the future of osmotic energy conversion, including AI integration in nanofluidic design, expanded applications, and technology integration.








Abstract
As industrialization deepens and population surges, the demand for sustainable energy has emerged as a globally critical challenge. Osmotic energy&#8212;generated from Gibbs free energy between different solutions&#8212;stands out as a viable solution to the energy crisis. The key to efficient osmotic energy conversion is the development of nanofluidic materials with high&#8208;selectivity and high&#8208;flux transmembrane ion transport behaviors. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest progress in advanced nanofluidic channels, focusing on optimizing permselectivity to enhance ion transport efficiency. The systematic manipulation of nanochannel architectures is underscored to navigate the inherent balance between permeability and selectivity. Furthermore, the impact of external field regulation on the controlled ion transport within nanofluidic channels, aiming to boost osmotic energy conversion, is explored. At last, visionary insights into the future of osmotic energy conversion are offered, encompassing the combination with artificial intelligence (AI) in nanofluidic design, the expansion of application landscapes, and the integration with other complementary technologies.

         <title>Fueling IgA&#8208;Dominated Humoral Immunity with an Intranasal Hybrid Tumor Vaccine to Opsonize and Strike Epithelial Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the authors confirm that breast cancer cells can directly bind with IgA, dependent on polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR)&#8208;mediated transcytosis function, modulating tumorigenic phenotype and antitumor response. To harness this biology, an intranasal tumor vaccine is designed, which can effectively combat primary and metastatic breast cancer through at least two independent mechanisms, including PIGR&#8208;IgA interaction and antigen recognition.








Abstract
Humoral immunity&#8208;cancer crosstalk has gained attention recently owing to its impact on tumor immune responses and therapy responsiveness. Here, it is shown that epithelial breast cancer cells can directly bind with non&#8208;antigen&#8208;specific IgA, dependent on polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR)&#8208;mediated transcytosis function, modulating tumoral inflammatory genes and sensitizing antitumor response. To harness this biology, a hybrid tumor vaccine is designed by covering the adjuvant&#8208;loaded cancer cell vesicles with a calcium phosphate shell, which retains the antigen information of the original tumor cells and exhibits robust mucosal adhesion in nasal tissues. Following intranasal vaccination, such a hybrid vaccine preferentially activates germinal center responses in nasal&#8208;associated lymphoid tissues and drives the production of tumoral antigen&#8208;specific IgA&#8208;dominated humoral immunity in both serum and lung through the property of &#8220;common mucosal immune system&#8221;, thus coordinating cellular immune responses to prevent lung colonization of IgA&#8208;opsonized breast cancer. In the inoperable and postoperative breast cancer model, intranasal vaccination with the hybrid vaccine also enables the amplification of the therapeutic benefits of local/systemic therapies. In summary, this work presents insights into the antitumor biology of IgA in epithelial breast cancer and explores a highly effective vaccine strategy focused on governing IgA&#8208;dominated humoral immunity to combat breast cancer, especially lung metastasis.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Chiroptical Hybrid Perovskites with Anomalous Photovoltaic Effect for High&#8208;Performance Self&#8208;Driven Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D chiral hybrid (R/S)&#8208;3BrMBA2PbBr4 perovskites demonstrate distinctive magneto&#8208;chiroptical effects. The circular dichroism is significantly enhanced and reversed under the magnetic field. The hybrids exhibit excellent nonlinear optical properties and high&#8208;performance in self&#8208;driven photodetector. This work provides valuable insights into the design of chiral hybrids and their applications in self&#8208;driven detectors.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites show promising applications in photodetectors due to their high absorption coefficients and outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, most hybrid perovskites exhibit centrosymmetric structures, requiring external electric fields for photodetection. Herein, 2D chiral hybrid perovskite (R/S)&#8208;3BrMBA2PbBr4 is synthesized, which exhibits broadband circularly polarized luminescence with a luminescence asymmetry factor of 1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;2. Furthermore, the circular dichroism (CD) of (R/S)&#8208;3BrMBA2PbBr4 undergoes significant enhancement and inversion under a magnetic field due to the Zeeman effect, achieving an 8&#8208;fold increase in the CD asymmetry factor and Zeeman splitting energy of 0.3 meV. The non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure endows (R/S)&#8208;3BrMBA2PbBr4 single crystals with net polarization along the b&#8208;axis, along with efficient second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) CD and a high asymmetry factor (gSHG&#8208;CD = 0.87). The self&#8208;driven photodetector fabricated from (R)&#8208;3BrMBA&#8322;PbBr&#8324; demonstrates an anomalous photovoltaic effect under ultraviolet light illumination, generating a photovoltage of 4.8&#160;V that far exceeds its bandgap (Eg = 2.96&#160;eV), while simultaneously demonstrating robust X&#8208;ray detection and circularly polarized light discrimination at zero external bias. The work provides significant insights into the application of chiral hybrid perovskites in low&#8208;energy, multifunctional optoelectronic systems and paves the way for the development of advanced photodetection technologies.

         <title>Activation and Stabilization Strategies of Aluminum Metal Anode Toward High Performance Aqueous Al Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review spotlights the critical challenges faced by aluminum metal anodes and aqueous electrolytes. Recent progress on activating and stabilizing Al metal anode is summarized and discussed in terms of two aspects, including anode engineering and electrolyte optimization. Finally, some revelatory insights and possible strategies are provided for the future design of high reaction activity of Al anode and electrolytes.








Abstract
Aqueous aluminum metal batteries (AAMBs) have garnered significant attention due to the abundant reserves, low cost, high theoretical capacity, and intrinsic safety of aluminum (Al). However, Al3+&#8208;based energy storage technologies remain in their nascent stages, facing a multitude of challenges. One major issue is the poor thermodynamic stability of the aluminum metal anode in aqueous electrolytes, stemming from self&#8208;corrosion, surface passivation, or hydrogen evolution reactions. These parasitic reactions dramatically reduce the reactivity, prevent reversible deposition/dissolution of aluminum, and restrict the electrochemical performance of AAMBs. This review spotlights the critical challenges faced by aluminum metal anodes and aqueous electrolytes. Then, recent progress on activating and stabilizing Al metal anode is summarized and discussed in terms of two aspects, including anode engineering and electrolyte optimization. Ultimately, future designs of high reaction activity of Al metal anode and electrolytes with high reversibility, long lifespan, and high energy density are proposed, which potentially facilitate the development of new generation of Al&#8208;based energy storage batteries.

         <title>Fluoroether Design Enables High&#8208;Voltage All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A durable high&#8208;voltage all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte is developed by incorporating a novel organic/inorganic hybrid porous component with a fluoroether design. Due to the weakened Li+ coordination structure, the proposed high&#8208;voltage SSE exhibits durable antioxidation. The optimized electrolytes show ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance in Li||Li cells, LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||Li cells, and LiMn0.6Fe0.4PO4||Li cells even under 4.5V.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;voltage all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) holds transformative potential for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies but remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a new prototype design is presented that integrates fluorinated ether segments into the traditional oxide nanocomposite phase, enabling poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based composite electrolytes with exceptional anti&#8208;oxidation durability and enhance overall electrochemical performance. Through a combination of experimental and computational analyses, it is demonstrated that the superior performance is attributed to the formation of reconstructed Li&#8314; solvation with weakly coordinating environments. The proposed formulation exhibits excellent Li&#8208;metal compatibility, enabling stable cycling in symmetric Li||Li cells for over 9500 h. The solid&#8208;state electrolyte also exhibits outstanding high&#8208;voltage stability with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes, extending the operational voltage from 4.0 to 4.5 V. Moreover, the LiMn1&#8208;xFexPO4||Li cells have delivered remarkable cycling performance, achieving over 1200 cycles with 99% capacity retention after 500 cycles. This work establishes an innovative platform for designing electrolytes with superior antioxidation properties and enhance structural durability, paving the way for the advancement of high&#8208;voltage all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Self&#8208;Growing Scaffold for Spatial and Border Expansive Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;growing scaffolds increase both the border and the space of obsolete defects. By balancing molecular cohesion and hydrogen bonding, the growth time can be regulated within 3&#8211;7 days. Dynamic shear forces induced by scaffold growth can inhibit hematoma, enhance focal adhesion, and accelerate extracellular matrix remodeling. This regenerative model allows for minimally invasive treatment of vertical bone augmentation.








Abstract
Tissue regeneration and repair techniques approaching personalized treatment are devoted to fabricating high&#8208;precision scaffolds that accurately match the size of the defect. However, scaffolds are difficult to implant in situ for obsolete defects with loss of original space, and the size is limited by confined boundary tissue. In nature, the development of fetuses, organs, and even plants all experience a matched growth in volume and border. Inspired by that, this study proposes a space&#8208;expanding regeneration model with a self&#8208;growing (SG) scaffold, which is then used in refractory alveolar ridge vertical bone augmentation. The SG scaffold contains a multistage hydrophilic polymer network. The initial size can be eliminated for minimally invasive implantation, and gradually increased by orderly absorption of tissue fluid, achieving controlled growth in vivo. The shearing force of the SG scaffold suppresses tissue hematoma and stimulates extracellular matrix remodeling. In addition, macrophages polarize toward M2 and secrete transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946;1. Meanwhile, bone regeneration is induced within the expanded space, achieving a &#8776;5&#8208;fold vertical increase of the rat skull, and supporting a 6&#8208;mm&#8208;long titanium implant. The SG scaffold provides a spatial and border extension model for obsolete injuries.

         <title>Polyoxometalate Directional Etching for Fabricating Defect Hollow Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Hierarchical Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The comprehensive phase diagram is established by a directional etching technique with H3PMo12O40 as an etchant to target MOFs defect&#8208;engineered hollow hierarchical structures. The etched MOF achieves an exceptional H2 evolution rate due to the enhanced exposure of encapsulated polyoxometalate clusters in the hollow structure.








Abstract
Encapsulating guests in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can widely expand their functionality, but usually reduces porosity, hindering reactant and product diffusion. Herein, a simple and rapid room temperature directional etching technique is developed to engineer MOFs with tailored hierarchical structures. With H3PMo12O40 (PMo12) as an etchant, classical cubic morphology of WNi@Z8, a ZIF&#8208;8 MOF encapsulating SiW11NiO39 (WNi), can be transformed into various defect&#8208;engineered hollow structures, and a comprehensive phase diagram is established by systematically adjusting etching parameters. Mechanistic studies reveal that PMo12 infiltrates ZIF&#8208;8 preferentially through {111} facet, followed by controlled etching along {110} and {100} facets, enabling precise spatial control over cavity formation. The etched WNi@Z8 achieves an exceptional H2 evolution rate of 12,667&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, nearly threefold enhancement over the non&#8208;etched counterpart due to the enhanced exposure of encapsulated WNi clusters in the hollow structure. This work provides a generalizable strategy for engineering guest@MOFs to achieve high&#8208;efficiency catalysis.

         <title>Unraveling the Complexity of the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya Interaction in Layered Magnets: The Full Magnitude and Chirality Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In layered magnets, the atomistic Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) depends critically not only on the orbital occupancy of the interface layer but also on the sequence of the atomic layers. The effect can be understood by analyzing the contributions of different orbitals to DMI. Both the chirality and the magnitude of the atomistic DMI can be controlled through interface engineering.








Abstract
Chirality is one of the inherent characteristics of some objects in nature. In magnetism, chiral magnetic textures can be formed in systems with broken inversion symmetry and due to an antisymmetric magnetic interaction, known as Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI). Here, aiming for a fundamental understanding of this chiral interaction on the atomic scale, several synthetic layered structures composed of alternating atomic layers of 3d ferromagnetic metals epitaxially grown on the Ir(001) surface are designed. It is demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically that the atomistic DMI depends critically not only on the orbital occupancy of the interface magnetic layer but also on the sequence of the atomic layers. It is shown that even large atomistic DMI values can result in a small effective DMI, and conversely. Furthermore, the dependence of the effective DMI on the number of atomic layers deviates from a simple scaling law. These observations are attributed to the complexity of the electronic structure and the contributions of different orbitals to the hybridization and DMI. The results are&#160;anticipated to provide guidelines for achieving full control over both the chirality and the magnitude of the atomistic DMI in layered materials.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Amide Engineered Blue Phase Liquid Crystal Elastomers: Synergistic Fatigue Resistance, Programmable Mechanochromics and Spatiotemporally Encrypted Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;amide engineering creates a hierarchical energy dissipation system in blue phase liquid crystal elastomers, yielding remarkable toughness and ultralow hysteresis. This strategy enables programmable mechanochromics via thermally induced bond rearrangement. A multidimensional encryption platform is demonstrated by synergistically combining mechanical strain, UV&#8208;triggered luminescence, and temporally&#8208;gated phosphorescent afterglow for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.








Abstract
Blue phase liquid crystal elastomers (BPLCEs) hold significant promise for flexible photonic devices due to their 3D periodic photonic lattices and intrinsic soft&#8208;matter characteristics. However, achieving an optimal balance between mechanical resilience and dynamic responsiveness remains a critical challenge. This study introduces a dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding network design strategy, wherein N,N'&#8208;bisacryloylcystamine monomers are incorporated to construct a hierarchical energy dissipation system, yielding BPLCEs with remarkable toughness (1.72 MJ m&#8722;3) and ultralow hysteresis (4.8%). By integrating thermally induced topological bond rearrangement, programmable mechanical gradient films are developed to enable high&#8208;precision strain&#8208;induced patterning and an adaptive encryption mechanism governed by a &#8220;relaxation&#8208;concealment/stretching&#8208;development&#8221; paradigm. Furthermore, leveraging the spatiotemporal gating properties of embedded phosphorescent materials, a dual&#8208;mode dynamic verification system is established, facilitating multidimensional information decryption via ultraviolet&#8208;triggered rapid visualization and controlled afterglow decay lasting up to 5 s. This study not only mitigates the inherent trade&#8208;off between mechanical durability and stimulus responsiveness in soft photonic crystals but also establishes a novel framework for multidimensional synergistic regulation across mechanical, optical, and temporal domains. These findings provide a transformative strategy for advancing next&#8208;generation dynamic encryption systems, intelligent sensing technologies, and adaptive photonic displays, paving the way for innovative applications in flexible photonic devices.

&lt;p&gt;Blue phase liquid crystal elastomers (BPLCEs) hold significant promise for flexible photonic devices due to their 3D periodic photonic lattices and intrinsic soft-matter characteristics. However, achieving an optimal balance between mechanical resilience and dynamic responsiveness remains a critical challenge. This study introduces a dynamic hydrogen-bonding network design strategy, wherein N,N'-bisacryloylcystamine monomers are incorporated to construct a hierarchical energy dissipation system, yielding BPLCEs with remarkable toughness (1.72 MJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and ultralow hysteresis (4.8%). By integrating thermally induced topological bond rearrangement, programmable mechanical gradient films are developed to enable high-precision strain-induced patterning and an adaptive encryption mechanism governed by a &#8220;relaxation-concealment/stretching-development&#8221; paradigm. Furthermore, leveraging the spatiotemporal gating properties of embedded phosphorescent materials, a dual-mode dynamic verification system is established, facilitating multidimensional information decryption via ultraviolet-triggered rapid visualization and controlled afterglow decay lasting up to 5 s. This study not only mitigates the inherent trade-off between mechanical durability and stimulus responsiveness in soft photonic crystals but also establishes a novel framework for multidimensional synergistic regulation across mechanical, optical, and temporal domains. These findings provide a transformative strategy for advancing next-generation dynamic encryption systems, intelligent sensing technologies, and adaptive photonic displays, paving the way for innovative applications in flexible photonic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Driving Multifunctional Nanomedicine Design for Non&#8208;Inflammatory Tumor Therapy with Integrated Machine Learning and Density Functional Theory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A computation&#8208;guided strategy for non&#8208;inflammatory photothermal therapy is developed, leveraging machine learning to identify RuO2 as the optimal photothermal agent with anti&#8208;inflammatory properties. Through an integrated approach, the mechanisms are elucidated using density functional theory calculations. This dual&#8208;methodology framework allows for a deeper understanding of the photothermal and anti&#8208;inflammatory performance.








Abstract
Due to the promotive role of inflammation in tumor progression, designing multifunctional nanomedicines that synergistically combine anti&#8208;tumor and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties emerges as a promising approach to enhance cancer treatment. However, identifying optimal nano&#8208;agents from a vast pool of candidates using traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods remains inefficient and lacking in systematic guidance. In this study, this challenge is addressed by integrating photothermal therapy for tumor ablation with catalase&#8208;mimicking nanozymes for inflammation mitigation as a model system to explore non&#8208;inflammatory tumor treatment strategies. Using interpretable machine learning techniques, experimental data are systematically analyzed to elucidate the relationships between nanomaterial features and functional properties, enabling the precise identification of photothermal agents with robust anti&#8208;inflammatory synergistic effects. Through this framework, ruthenium oxide nanoparticles (RuO2 NPs) are identified as a highly efficient multifunctional candidate. The catalytic properties of RuO2 NPs are further validated and rationalized through density functional theory calculations. Experimental investigations confirm the remarkable performance of RuO2 NPs, demonstrating their ability to achieve efficient photothermal tumor ablation at NIR&#8208;II biowindow and simultaneously mitigate inflammation by promoting a favorable immune microenvironment. This work highlights the transformative potential of machine learning&#8208;driven approaches in the rational design and accelerated discovery of multifunctional nanomaterials.

         <title>Use of CsPbCl3 Quantum Dots as a Chlorine Source Enables Formation of Thick Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Films for High&#8208;Performance Blue Light Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid chlorine sources allows the preparation of thick perovskite films, leading to sky&#8208;blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.2%.








Abstract
Achieving efficient and stable blue&#8208;emitting quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) remains a challenge due to the poor solubility of conventional chloride precursors and the difficulty to form thick, uniform films with a well&#8208;controlled phase distribution. A new strategy is proposed to address this challenge using CsPbCl3 quantum dots (QDs) capped with oleylamine (OLA) ligands as an alternative chlorine source. It is demonstrated how the use of these QDs enables formation of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films with vertically aligned crystalline structure, thickness over 100&#160;nm, and improved stability. OLA ligands regulate the crystal phase distribution and grain boundaries, suppressing the appearance of small&#8208;n 2D phases and reducing the number of crystal defects, while inorganic CsPbCl3 QD cores induce vertical crystallization of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films, endowing them with enhanced structural stability. The use of this non&#8208;conventional chlorine source is proven instrumental in improving external quantum efficiency of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite sky&#8208;blue LEDs, reaching 26.2% at 485&#160;nm, with significantly enhanced electroluminescence stability both in terms of peak position and brightness. This study demonstrates&#160;a novel methodology using CsPbCl3 QDs capped with conventional organic ligands to achieve thick quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers for blue LEDs, addressing existing limitations in perovskite optoelectronics.

         <title>Programmable Surface Dimpling of Textile Metamaterials for Aerodynamic Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Static aerodynamic surfaces are inherently limited in their ability to adapt to dynamic velocity profiles or environmental changes, restricting their performance. Here, a stretched&#8208;induced auxetic dimpling textile that tunes surface roughness while tightly fitted is presented. Wind&#8208;tunnel tests and FE design mapping show controllable dimples can cut drag by up to 20% in target ranges, and real&#8208;time strain adjustments can sustain optimal performance of a cylindrical body








Abstract
Static aerodynamic surfaces are inherently limited in their ability to adapt to dynamic velocity profiles or environmental changes, restricting their performance under variable operating conditions. This challenge is particularly pronounced in high&#8208;speed competitive sports, such as cycling and downhill skiing, where the properties of a static textile surface are mismatched with highly dynamic wind&#8208;speed profiles. Here, an textile metamaterial is introduced that is capable of variable aerodynamic profiles through a stretch&#8208;induced dimpling mechanism, even when tightly conformed to a body or object. Wind&#8208;tunnel experiments are used to characterize the variable aerodynamic performance of the dimpling mechanism, while Finite Element (FE) simulations efficiently characterize the design space to identify optimal textile metamaterial architectures. By controlling dimple size, the aerodynamic performance of the textile can be tailored for specific wind&#8208;speed ranges, resulting in an ability to modulate drag force at target wind&#8208;speeds by up to 20%. Furthermore, the potential for active control of a textiles' aerodynamic properties is demonstrated, in which controlled stretching allows the textile to sustain optimal performance across a dynamic wind&#8208;speed profile. These findings establish a new approach to aerodynamic metamaterials, with surface dimpling and thus variable fluid&#8208;dynamic properties offering transformative applications for wearables, as well as broader opportunities for aerospace, maritime, and civil engineering&#160;systems.

Abstract
The discovery of van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials exhibiting non&#8208;trivial and tunable magnetic interactions can lead to exotic magnetic states that are not readily attainable with conventional materials. Such vdW magnets can provide a unique platform for studying new magnetic phenomena and realizing magnetization dynamics for energy&#8208;efficient and non&#8208;volatile spintronic memory and computing technologies. Here, the coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orders in vdW magnet (Co0.5Fe0.5)5&#8208;xGeTe2 (CFGT) above room temperature, inducing an intrinsic exchange bias and canted perpendicular magnetism is discovered. Such non&#8208;trivial intrinsic magnetic order enables to realize energy&#8208;efficient, magnetic field&#8208;free, and deterministic spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) switching of CFGT in heterostructure with Pt. These experiments, in conjunction with density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrate the coexistence of non&#8208;trivial magnetic orders in CFGT, which enables field&#8208;free SOT magnetization dynamics in spintronic devices.

         <title>Monolithic Terahertz Topological&#160;Mach&#8208;Zehnder Interferometer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monolithic topological Mach&#8208;Zehnder interferometer (MZI) is presented, integrating the splitter, combiner, and waveguide arms on a single chip. The interferometric fringes exhibiting high on&#8208;off contrast with extinction ratios over 20 dB are achieved by utilizing tailored unit cells that facilitate interface&#8208;dependent out&#8208;of&#8208;plane radiation losses. We also demonstrate active tuning of the MZI response through photoexcitation of the MZI arms.








Abstract
The pursuit of on&#8208;chip electromagnetic wave control for high throughput communication, spectroscopy, and quantum computing underlies the motivation for terahertz photonic integrated circuitry. Recent breakthroughs in topological photonics have enabled the development of chips that harness topologically resilient interface modes to achieve area and performance efficiency. However, the demonstration of a compact, monolithic topological Mach&#8208;Zehnder interferometer (MZI), remains a critical gap. In this work, a terahertz topological MZI is presented, exhibiting six interferometric fringes across a 17&#160;GHz bandwidth, with splitter, combiner, and arms integrated on a single chip. The interferometric fringes exhibiting high on&#8208;off contrast with extinction ratios over 20&#160;dB are achieved by utilizing tailored unit cells that facilitate interface&#8208;dependent out&#8208;of&#8208;plane radiation losses.

&lt;p&gt;A monolithic topological Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) is presented, integrating the splitter, combiner, and waveguide arms on a single chip. The interferometric fringes exhibiting high on-off contrast with extinction ratios over 20 dB are achieved by utilizing tailored unit cells that facilitate interface-dependent out-of-plane radiation losses. We also demonstrate active tuning of the MZI response through photoexcitation of the MZI arms.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of on-chip electromagnetic wave control for high throughput communication, spectroscopy, and quantum computing underlies the motivation for terahertz photonic integrated circuitry. Recent breakthroughs in topological photonics have enabled the development of chips that harness topologically resilient interface modes to achieve area and performance efficiency. However, the demonstration of a compact, monolithic topological Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), remains a critical gap. In this work, a terahertz topological MZI is presented, exhibiting six interferometric fringes across a 17&#160;GHz bandwidth, with splitter, combiner, and arms integrated on a single chip. The interferometric fringes exhibiting high on-off contrast with extinction ratios over 20&#160;dB are achieved by utilizing tailored unit cells that facilitate interface-dependent out-of-plane radiation losses. Active tuning of the MZI response is also demonstrated through photoexcitation of the MZI arms. The presented approach is the first step toward realizing topological photonic modulators that leverage the phase degree of freedom for photonic integrated communication and quantum information processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrocatalytic and Photocatalytic C&#9472;N Coupling From Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent electrocatalytic/photocatalytic synthesis of C&#8211;N coupling compounds (including urea, amide, and amino acids) from various carbonaceous species and various nitrogenous species, focusing on the designs of different catalytic sites and reaction mechanisms. The existing challenges and future research directions are also supplemented.









Abstract
Electrocatalytic/photocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling from small carboncontaining (such as CO2 and CH3OH) and nitrogen&#8208;containing species (such as N2, NO3&#8722;, and NH3) enables the synthesis of value&#8208;added organonitrogen compounds, including urea, amides, and amino acids. This approach, ideally driven by renewable energy, holds great promise for sustainable developments and has thus been attracting increasing research interest in recent years. To enhance the C&#9472;N coupling under mild reaction conditions, it is necessary to activate different substrate molecules effectively and balance the adsorption and desorption of various C&#8208; and N&#8208;containing intermediates and/or radicals, thereby realizing different value&#8208;added organonitrogen compounds. In this review, the recent advances in electrocatalytic/photocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling reactions targeting those three types of products, i.e., urea, amides, and amino acids is aimed to summarized. The rational designs of active sites for synergistic catalysis are discussed, including their types, compositions, spatial arrangements, crystal facets, heterostructures, and local environments. Different reactant molecules and catalytic mechanisms for the electrocatalytic/photocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling reactions, as well as the methods of C&#9472;N coupling products detection, are also described. Finally, the existing challenges in this field are summarized, and the potential research perspectives are also proposed.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Engineered Orthopedic Implant to Break the Antimicrobial&#8208;Osteogenic Paradox at Biointerfaces in the &#8220;Race for the Surface&#8221;</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through polyphenol&#8208;amine&#8208;mediated covalent modification, quaternary ammonium groups (bactericidal agents) and phosphate groups (promoting bone&#8208;regeneration factors) are spatially organized on titanium (Ti) surfaces to regulate the surface chemical characteristics of dental implants. The surface&#8208;engineered implants (Ti&#8208;AQs) exhibited balanced antibacterial and biocompatible properties.








Abstract
Implant&#8208;associated infections and compromised osseointegration pose a dual threat to bone implants due to the biological conflict between microbial invasion and host cell colonization. However, conventional contact&#8208;killing antimicrobial coatings may negatively affect the viability of mammalian cells, limiting their further application. Here, a surface modification strategy is proposed to help mammalian cells to win the &#8220;race for the surface&#8221; on the material&#8208;tissue interfaces. Through polyphenol&#8208;amine&#8208;mediated covalent modification, quaternary ammonium groups (bactericidal agents) and phosphate groups (promoting bone&#8208;regeneration factors) are spatially organized on titanium (Ti) surfaces to regulate the surface chemical characteristics of dental implants. The surface&#8208;engineered implants (Ti&#8208;AQs) exhibited balanced antibacterial and biocompatible properties. The optimized Ti&#8208;AQ&#8208;2 coating eradicated &gt;99% of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) via destruction of disrupted bacterial membranes through metabolic interference, and simultaneously promoted adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells through Ca2+&#8208;mediated signaling pathways. Moreover, Ti&#8208;AQs can drive immunomodulation biased macrophages toward pro&#8208;repair M2 polarization. In vivo evaluations in an implant&#8208;associated infection modal confirmed that Ti&#8208;AQ&#8208;2 inhibited infection at the early stage and enhanced bone&#8208;implant integration at the late stage. This work presents a facile strategy to regulate the surface performances for developing of antibacterial implants with high biocompatibility and bioactivity.

         <title>Porous Elastomer Film with Controlled Liquid&#8208;Metal Distribution for Recyclable Highly Customizable and Stretchable Patterned Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a customizable porous liquid&#8208;metal (LM)/elastomer composite film with controlled LM distribution, overcoming conventional limitations of LM&#8208;based composites (unintended activation of unsintered regions under strain). It can achieve&#160;precise patterning through imprinting, thereby enabling the creation of flexible conductive patterns, which can be used in multifunctional stretchable electronics.








Abstract
Stretchable conductors with conductive patterns are crucial for flexible electronics, which demand high conductivity and stable electrical properties under significant deformations. Liquid&#8208;metal (LM)&#8208;based composites patterned by selective sintering are promising for flexible electronics, however, short&#8208;circuiting may occur due to unintended activation of unsintered regions under strain. Hence, developing highly customizable LM&#8208;based stretchable conductors remains a persistent challenge. Stretchable LM/thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) porous films are designed with controlled LM distribution through non&#8208;solvent&#8208;induced phase separation and surface modification of LM particles, which overcomes the limitations of conventional LM&#8208;based stretchable composites and enables the design of diverse flexible electronics with conductive patterns via imprinting. The porous structure increases spacing between LM particles and alleviates stress on LM particles, ensuring electrical insulation of the unimprinted regions during stretching. The customizable patterning process enables the films to be used for electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, and stripe patterns allow for dynamic tuning of EMI shielding performance. Additionally, they demonstrate excellent performance in wireless communications, tunable EM wave filters, and stretchable Joule heaters. Moreover, the solubility of TPU makes it easy to recycle LM from the film, thus demonstrating ideal recyclability. Outstanding electrical stability and versatile applications guarantee its significant impact on stretchable electronics.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Topological/Ferroelectric Bi2Te3/SnSe Hetero&#8208;Memristor for In Situ Bionic&#8208;Visual Semi&#8208;Hardware Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining the advantages of two&#8208;dimensional (2D)two&#8208;dimensional ferroelectrics and 2D topological insulators, the Bi2Te3/SnSe hetero&#8208;memristor is constructed to achieve ultra&#8208;high and stable optoelectronic sensing characteristics. The device shows an average 0.25 &#181;W on/off power and 32 controllable conductive states. The semi&#8208;hardware neuromorphic system based on it achieved a 97.68% classification accuracy in low orbit satellite image recognition tasks.









Abstract
As the application of artificial vision systems continues to grow, developing efficient and low&#8208;power visual sensing devices has become a key challenge. Memristors offer tunable conductivity and integrated in&#8208;situ storage and computation functions, making them ideal for low&#8208;cost visual systems. However, most memristors currently face the dual challenges of poor stability and limited optoelectronic synaptic plasticity. Here, a Bi2Te2.7Se0.3/SnSe hetero&#8208;memristor is designed, which combines the advantages of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) topological insulators and 2D ferroelectric materials. The hetero&#8208;memristor performance can be tuned by the SnSe ferroelectric polarization and Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 topological surface state, which improve the utilization and mobility of carriers, thereby significantly improving the performance. The high 104&#8208;cycle stability, average 0.25 &#181;W on/off power, and 25 conductive states are achieved. Under different signals, the hetero&#8208;memristor can enable in situ light&#8208;electric conversion and successfully simulate various optoelectronic plasticity behaviors, such as paired&#8208;pulse facilitation, post&#8208;tetanic potentiation, spike rate&#8208;dependent plasticity, etc. Mean while, an efficient in&#8208;situ bionic&#8208;visual semi&#8208;hardware system is constructed based on the 28 &#215; 28 perception hetero&#8208;memristor array. This system efficiently performs satellite image recognition and classification, achieving an accuracy of 97.68%. The research shows that the Bi2Te2.7Se0.3/SnSe hetero&#8208;memristor is with&#160;excellent optoelectronic performances and broad application prospects, particularly in brain&#8208;like computing, smart hardware, and storage technologies.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Robust Skyrmion Lattice at Room Temperature in van der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates formation of robust ordered skyrmion lattices in pre&#8208;annealed 2D Fe3GaTe2 at room temperature via minimal strain. Magnetic force microscopy reveals that the stabilized skyrmion phase endures thousands of cycles of mechanical fatigue (stretching/bending/twisting), maintains stability across broad magnetic field and temperature ranges, and exhibits field&#8208;free stability. These results hold promise for flexible, low&#8208;power spintronic applications. 








Abstract
Manipulating topological magnetic orders of 2D magnets by strain, once achieved, offers enormous potential for future low&#8208;power flexible spintronic applications. In this work, by placing Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT), a room&#8208;temperature 2D ferromagnet, on flexible substrate, a field&#8208;free and robust formation of skyrmion lattice induced by strain is demonstrated. By applying a minimal strain of &#8776;0.80% to pre&#8208;annealed FGaT flakes, the Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) tip directly triggers the transition from maze&#8208;like domains to an ordered skyrmion lattice while scanning the sample surface. The skyrmion lattice is rather stable against extensive cyclic mechanical testing (stretching, bending, and twisting over 2000 cycles each). It also exhibits stability across a wide range of magnetic fields (&#8776;2.9 kOe) and temperatures (&#8776;323 K), as well as long&#8208;term retention stability, highlighting its robustness and field&#8208;free stabilization. The strain effect reduces the lattice symmetry and enhances the Dzyaloshinskii&#8208;Moriya interaction (DMI) of FGaT, thus stabilizing the skyrmion lattice. The findings highlight the potential of FGaT for integrating magnetic skyrmions into future low&#8208;power&#8208;consumption flexible spintronics devices.

         <title>Eliminating Nearfield Coupling in Dense High Quality Factor Phase Gradient Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for fully suppressing nearfield coupling is reported between subwavelength separated meta&#8208;atoms with arbitrarily large resonant quality factors, opening the door to dynamic high resolution wavefront shaping with vanishingly small refractive index biasing. The platform provides a route for densely arrayed high Q metasurfaces with independently addressable meta&#8208;atoms, paving the way for highly efficient nonlinear and dynamic wavefront shaping.








Abstract
High Q phase gradient metasurfaces are promising for revolutionizing light manipulation, but near&#8208;field coupling typically forces a trade&#8208;off between quality factor and resolution. Here, a strategy for eliminating coupling&#8208;based nonlocal effects in wave shaping metasurfaces composed of meta&#8208;pixels is presented with arbitrarily long resonant lifetimes arranged with sub&#8208;diffraction spatial resolution. By working at a zero&#8208;coupling regime introduced by the interference between enhanced longitudinal and transverse electric fields, the tradeoff between Q and resolution no longer exists. Numerical demonstrations show that metasurfaces with quality factors of a few million and resolution &lt;&#955;/1.6 can produce beam&#8208;splitting to angles of &#177;53&#176; and beam&#8208;steering to an angle of 33&#176; with diffraction efficiencies over 90% via refractive index modulations of just 2 &#215; 10&#8722;6 and 7 &#215; 10&#8722;6, respectively. Experimentally, the signature of a zero&#8208;coupling regime is discovered in the form of a sign flip in the angular dispersion with resonant wavelength, which validates the scheme. Aside from triangulating a perfect decoupling configuration, one of the fabricated nanofin&#8208;isolated metasurfaces with Q&#8208;factor &gt;870 has a resonant wavelength that stays within the half linewidth for incident angles of &#8722;20&#176; to 20&#176;. This platform paves the way for combining precise wavefront shaping with highly efficient nonlinearity and rapid programmability.

         <title>Bioinspired Adaptive Sensors: A Review on Current Developments in Theory and Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively summarizes the recent progress in the design and fabrication of sensory&#8208;adaptation&#8208;inspired devices and highlights their valuable applications in electronic skin, wearable electronics, and machine vision. The existing challenges and future directions are addressed in aspects such as device performance optimization, multimodal adaptive sensors, and system&#8208;level integration.








Abstract
The human perception system features many dynamic functional mechanisms that efficiently process the large amount of sensory information available in the surrounding environment. In this system, sensory adaptation operates as a core mechanism that seamlessly filters familiar and inconsequential external stimuli at sensory endpoints. Such adaptive filtering minimizes redundant data movement between sensory terminals and cortical processing units and contributes to a lower communication bandwidth requirement and lower energy consumption at the system level. Recreating the behavior of sensory adaptation using electronic devices has garnered significant research interest owing to its promising prospects in next&#8208;generation intelligent perception platforms. Herein, the recent progress in bioinspired adaptive device engineering is systematically examined, and its valuable applications in electronic skins, wearable electronics, and machine vision are highlighted. The rapid development of bioinspired adaptive sensors can be attributed not only to the recent advances in emerging neuromorphic electronic elements, including piezoelectric and triboelectric sensors, memristive devices, and neuromorphic transistors, but also to the improved understanding of biological sensory adaptation. Existing challenges hindering device performance optimization, multimodal adaptive sensor development, and system&#8208;level integration are also discussed, providing insights for the development of high&#8208;performance neuromorphic sensing systems.

         <title>Triboelectric Nanogenerators Enable Multifunctional Ice Accretion, Melting, and Interfacial Fracture Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water impacting, freezing, melting, and being mechanically removed from the designed dielectric surfaces generates a triboeletric signal that can be used to detect various icing and de&#8208;icing scenarios. The charge transferred directly scales with the interfacial fracture mechanism, further validating triboelectricity as an excellent ice&#8208;detection platform, including in&#8208;flight on drones flying at subzero temperatures, as demonstrated.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have significant potential to perform as sensors or compact electric power generators through the production of electrical charge during the frictional interactions between two dissimilar materials, such as liquids impacting solids. However, whether phase transitions generate a triboelectric response is not known. This study investigates the occurrence of triboelectrification during the water&#8208;ice phase transition using TENGs for real&#8208;time ice detection on critical engineering surfaces such as aircraft, wind turbine blades, and vehicles. TENGs are fabricated using aluminum electrodes and either polyethylene, silicone, or polytetrafluoroethylene as the dielectric. The freezing of water and the melting of ice are found to generate triboelectric current only during motion of the contact line, and the presence of ice can lessen additional charge transfer during continuous ice accretion. Further, ice type (rime versus glaze) can be differentiated during accretion by the initial transferred charge and how quickly the signal plateaus. It is observed that mechanical de&#8208;icing generates triboelectric charges that are proportional to the de&#8208;icing force, and this allows for the identification and quantification interfacial fracture mechanisms such as stress&#8208;controlled, toughness&#8208;controlled, and cavitation&#8208;controlled de&#8208;bonding. A prototype ice sensor is validated on a flying drone exposed to simulated rain under icing conditions, where it is able to detect both icing and de&#8208;icing in flight. The TENGs exhibited a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio as high as 83 dB, highlighting triboelectricity as a novel, real&#8208;time, and energy&#8208;efficient solution for ice detection and protection systems.

         <title>Heterogeneous Polymer Multilayers Enabling Photoresponsive Nonreciprocal Patterns for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonreciprocal optical patterns are fabricated using heterogeneous multilayers of photopatternable azopolymers and polyvinyl alcohol polarizers. The nonreciprocal optical patterns can only be read from one direction, providing a unique security feature for information encryption. The responsiveness of the nonreciprocal optical patterns and the mechanical robustness of the multilayers enable the design of flexible, portable, and wearable devices for information encryption.








Abstract
Society has a growing demand for information security. The development of nonreciprocal patterns is a new approach for high&#8208;security information encryption, but it is difficult to achieve due to its complexity in material design. Herein, heterogeneous polymer multilayers are designed to prepare nonreciprocal patterns for information encryption. The heterogeneous polymer multilayers are constructed by gluing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) polarizers and photoresponsive azobenzene&#8208;containing polymers (azopolymers) via photocontrolled adhesion. Nonreciprocal optical patterns are fabricated via photopatterning of the azopolymer layer with polarized light. The information can only be decrypted from one direction of the nonreciprocal optical patterns. The nonreciprocal optical patterns are dynamic, which can be erased and rewritten with updated information via light irradiation.

&lt;p&gt;Nonreciprocal optical patterns are fabricated using heterogeneous multilayers of photopatternable azopolymers and polyvinyl alcohol polarizers. The nonreciprocal optical patterns can only be read from one direction, providing a unique security feature for information encryption. The responsiveness of the nonreciprocal optical patterns and the mechanical robustness of the multilayers enable the design of flexible, portable, and wearable devices for information encryption.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Society has a growing demand for information security. The development of nonreciprocal patterns is a new approach for high-security information encryption, but it is difficult to achieve due to its complexity in material design. Herein, heterogeneous polymer multilayers are designed to prepare nonreciprocal patterns for information encryption. The heterogeneous polymer multilayers are constructed by gluing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) polarizers and photoresponsive azobenzene-containing polymers (azopolymers) via photocontrolled adhesion. Nonreciprocal optical patterns are fabricated via photopatterning of the azopolymer layer with polarized light. The information can only be decrypted from one direction of the nonreciprocal optical patterns. The nonreciprocal optical patterns are dynamic, which can be erased and rewritten with updated information via light irradiation. The nonreciprocal optical patterns can be further imprinted with diffraction elements, showing dual-mode optical signals. The nonreciprocal optical patterns with dynamic, dual-mode features enable high-security information encryption. Moreover, the heterogeneous polymer multilayers are flexible, bendable, and foldable, enabling the design of devices with nonreciprocal optical patterns for encryption in 3D space. The heterogeneous polymer multilayers with photoresponsive nonreciprocal patterns offer a solution for designing secure, updatable, and mechanically robust information encryption materials for flexible photonics, portable electronics, new anti-counterfeiting technologies, and wearable devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Employing an acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A'&#8208;D&#8208;A)&#160;structural motif, single&#8208;component small&#8208;molecule mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors with ion&#8208;dependent ambipolarity are first developed for organic electrochemical transistors and inverters featuring ultrathin channel layers. Their outstanding figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit, remarkable voltage gains, and adaptability for ternary/quaternary logic operations signify significant advances in this field, highlighting their potential as versatile platforms for organic (bio)electronics with high sensitivity and high&#8208;density integration.








Abstract
Single&#8208;component, ultrathin ambipolar organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) combined with multivalued logic (MVL) circuits offer new opportunities for advancing next&#8208;generation bioelectronic systems due to their low&#8208;power consumption, manufacturing simplicity, and high&#8208;density integration, central to which is the evolution of ambipolar organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) as channel materials. However, small&#8208;molecule analogues remain unexplored to date for lack of well&#8208;defined molecular strategies. Herein, first two acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type vinyl&#8208;linked bis&#8208;diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;core ambipolar small&#8208;molecule OMIECs are developed featuring multiple conformational locks. It is discovered that grafting shortened glycolated sidechains produces stronger solid&#8208;state aggregation, tighter lamellar stacking, and higher crystallinity, consequently elevating the ambipolar &#181;C* figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit by over fourfold. Furthermore, the skillful manipulation of anionic species to facilitate oxidation doping enables significant increasement in p&#8208;type &#181;C* (170 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and a record&#8208;high n&#8208;type &#181;C* of 360 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, especially at a channel thickness of sub&#8208;10&#160;nm. Crucially, single&#8208;component OECT&#8208;based inverters constructed therefrom are for the first time demonstrated to accommodate ternary/quaternary logic, achieving a remarkable gain of 135&#160;V/V. This work not only provides an effective molecular design strategy for creating high&#8208;performing ultrathin&#8208;film ambipolar small&#8208;molecule OMIECs, highlighting ionic doping effect on ambipolarity, but also demonstrates their potential in MVL circuits for organic bioelectronics applications.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuning of Molecular Self&#8208;Assembly Morphology via Synergistic Ternary Copolymerization and Side Chain Optimization of Low&#8208;Cost Polymer Donors Toward Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new low&#8208;cost PTQ derivative donors PTQ17, PTQ18, and PTQ19 are rationally designed and synthesized by synergistic ternary copolymerization and side chain optimization strategies, to fine&#8208;tune the molecular self&#8208;assembly morphology. Due to ideal microscopic morphology of active layer and optimized energy level alignment, PTQ18&#8208;based binary and ternary organic solar cells achieve excellent efficiencies of 19.68% and 20.06%.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly morphology optimization of organic photovoltaic materials is crucial to improve the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, three low&#8208;cost PTQ derivative donors, PTQ17, PTQ18, and PTQ19 are developed by synergistic ternary copolymerization and side chain optimization of utilizing different benzothiadiazole (BT) units, to fine&#8208;tune molecular self&#8208;assembly morphology. PTQ17, containing difluorinated BT, shows the tightest &#960;&#8208;&#960; packing and strongest molecular crystallinity, leading to excessive molecular aggregation and phase separation morphology in active layer. In contrast, PTQ19, containing dialkoxy&#8208;substituted BT, has the weakest molecular crystallinity, resulting in the worst long&#8208;range ordered molecular packing and the smallest phase domains in active layer. Remarkably, PTQ18, containing monofluorinated and monoalkoxy&#8208;substituted BT, has moderate molecular crystallinity and the best compatibility with acceptor, resulting in the most ideal microscopic morphology of active layer with desirable domain size and phase separation features. In result, the PTQ18&#8208;based binary OSC achieves an outstanding efficiency of 19.68%; and further optimized energy level alignment leads to an enhanced PCE of 20.06% in the PTQ18&#8208;based ternary device. This work demonstrates the importance of self&#8208;assembly morphology modification of organic photovoltaic molecules in improving performance of OSCs, and it has guiding role in design of high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaic materials.

         <title>Catalytic Solder Fuses Solid&#8208;Solid Interfaces for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic &#8220;soldering&#8221; strategy based on TiS2 enables in situ formation of amorphous TiS4 and Li&#8208;Ti&#8208;P&#8208;S&#8208;Cl interphases, which promote seamless interfacial fusion and significantly enhance Li+ transport and catalytic kinetics. The resulting all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries deliver outstanding areal capacity and long&#8208;term stability under high sulfur loading.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) have garnered significant research interest due to their inherent safety and high energy density. Nevertheless, their practical applications remain constrained by the sluggish sulfur reaction kinetics. While catalytic strategies have been demonstrated to facilitate sulfur conversion, their efficacy is fundamentally constrained by the lack of interfacial continuity. Thus, there is an urgent need for interfacial fusion to achieve such continuity and construct efficient catalytic interfaces. In this work, an amorphous interfacial fusion strategy using TiS2 as a catalytic &#8220;solder&#8221;, enabling intimate integration among sulfur, the catalyst, and the solid&#8208;state electrolyte is proposed. Upon reacting with sulfur and the sulfide&#8208;based solid electrolyte, TiS2 induces the in situ formation of amorphous TiS4 and Li&#8208;Ti&#8208;P&#8208;S&#8208;Cl interfacial phases. These amorphous phases facilitate interfacial &#8220;soldering&#8221;, creating integrated catalytic interfaces that enhance Li+ transport and catalytic efficiency. As a result, the optimized ASSLSBs show a reversible specific capacity of 720 mAh g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 1 C. It also delivers a high areal capacity of 7.05 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a sulfur loading of 4.0 mg cm&#8722;2. This interfacial fusion strategy offers a promising pathway toward the practical development of high&#8208;performance ASSLSBs.

         <title>Zeolite Structure Direction: Metals with a Dual Role as Amine Coordinators and Siloxy Connectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual role of metal ions as amine coordinators and siloxy connectors leads to the formation of new 3D silicate&#8208;based hybrid materials. Its isolated inorganic layers serve as a platform for the synthesis of novel porous materials. This paper serves as the seed of a new field in zeolite&#8208;zeotypes synthesis and presents the first example of a true coordination polymer&#8208;zeolite hybrid.









Abstract
Innovation in the synthesis of new zeolites is achieved primarily through the use of costly novel organic compounds as structure&#8208;directing agents (SDAs). Here, a novel type of structure&#8208;direction based on a metal&#8208;amine coordination polymer leading to a 3&#8208;dimensional silicate&#8208;based hybrid material, LEU&#8208;1, is presented. The Zn&#8208;amine polymer not only serves as an SDA, but also plays a practical role in extending the inorganic connectivity in the form of Zn&#8208;O&#8208;Si bonds. This dual&#8208;role mechanism leads to unique hybrids with huge potential for creating zeolite&#8208;like materials. It is demonstrated that by using the silicate layer in LEU&#8208;1 as a platform, two novel pure&#8208;silica zeolites can be generated. This synthesis strategy, rooted in the coordination diversity of metal&#8208;amines, opens the door to more novel zeolite structures.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation in the synthesis of new zeolites is achieved primarily through the use of costly novel organic compounds as structure-directing agents (SDAs). Here, a novel type of structure-direction based on a metal-amine coordination polymer leading to a 3-dimensional silicate-based hybrid material, LEU-1, is presented. The Zn-amine polymer not only serves as an SDA, but also plays a practical role in extending the inorganic connectivity in the form of Zn-O-Si bonds. This dual-role mechanism leads to unique hybrids with huge potential for creating zeolite-like materials. It is demonstrated that by using the silicate layer in LEU-1 as a platform, two novel pure-silica zeolites can be generated. This synthesis strategy, rooted in the coordination diversity of metal-amines, opens the door to more novel zeolite structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Engineering Cellulose Nanofibers via In Situ PEDOT Polymerization for Superior Thermoelectric Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for homogeneous in situ polymerization of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) along cellulose nanofibril surfaces is presented. Featuring enhanced charge delocalization and exceptional durability under 2000 bends and 5000 abrasions, wet&#8208;heat aging, freezing, and UV aging tests, the conductive nanocellulose fibers maintain stable electrical conductivity and thermoelectric output&#8212;a key advance for nanocellulose wearables and flexible electronics.








Abstract
Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) are abundant and possess exceptional mechanical strength, but their intrinsic electrical insulation limits their application in wearable electronics. In this study, a versatile methodology is presented to produce highly conductive and durable CNFs through electrostatic potential&#8208;enhanced in situ polymerization of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). Guided by molecular dynamics simulations, electrostatic interactions are controlled by tailoring the chain length of PEDOT, achieving homogeneous polymerization. Compared to conventional polymerization and blending methods, this approach prevented the self&#8208;aggregation of PEDOT crystallites, which would otherwise localize charge carriers and hinder electrical transport, as confirmed by scanning Kelvin probe microscope (SKPM). These fibers can leverage nanocellulose's capillary effects to rearrange PEDOT crystallites, thereby boosting electrical conductivity by 5 orders of magnitude over suboptimal samples. The conductive nanocellulose paper achieves superior electrical conductivity (91 S cm&#8722;1) and durability, retaining 90% of electrical properties over 2000 bending cycles, 5000 abrasion tests, and prolonged wet&#8208;heat aging, freezing, and UV aging, while also demonstrating stable thermoelectric performance with power factor exceeding 3.8 &#181;W mK&#8722;2 and a promising device output of 46.6 nW. These findings advance the conventional notion that charge&#8208;transporting nanocellulose can only be obtained by carbonization, graphitization, or physical blending with conductive components, which further boosts its potential for wearable applications.

         <title>Biased Plasma Treated Nickel Oxide for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ biased plasma treatment (BPT) reconstructs the surface of sputtered Nickel oxide (NiOx), enabling controlled Ni3&#8314;/Ni2&#8314; ratios and optimized surface roughness, thereby enhancing interfacial properties. This strategy enhances perovskite crystallinity and optimizes band alignment, resulting in power conversion efficiencies of 21.8% in single&#8208;junction and 32.1% (certified 31.7%) in tandem solar cells, with outstanding operational stability.








Abstract
Nickel oxide (NiOx) hole transport layer deposited by magnetron sputtering shows high stability, low cost, high reproducibility, and scalability for perovskite and tandem solar cells. However, the performance of perovskite and tandem solar cells with sputtered NiOx is limited by the defective interface and suboptimal energy band alignment. This work focuses on reconstructing the sputtered NiOx surface with in situ biased plasma treatment (BPT). It is demonstrated that in situ BPT following sputtering induces both physical and chemical changes on the NiOx surface, enabling a smoother and denser surface with controllable Ni3+/Ni2+ ratios. The in situ BPT NiOx is proven to be effective in improving the conductivity of NiOx, suppressing the non&#8208;radiation recombination, fine&#8208;tuning the energy band alignment, and facilitating the crystallinity of the perovskite. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of wide bandgap perovskite solar cells is improved to 21.8% by the implementation of BPT NiOx. Further integrating the BPT NiOx into monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells results in a high PCE of 32.1% (certified 31.7%) with excellent operational stability.

         <title>Anisotropic Magnetic Heating for Adaptive Thermal Ablation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimorph thermal ablation probe is designed by integrating a heating layer containing magnetically aligned Fe3O4@SiO2 nanorods in PDMS and an actuation layer with NdFeB microparticles. Under alternating magnetic fields, anisotropic nanorods generate directional heating, and the application of a static magnetic field induces controlled probe bending to dynamically adjust nanorod orientation, thereby modulating heat generation for targeted ablation while minimizing collateral tissue damage.








Abstract
Thermal ablation provides minimally invasive treatment for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions but risks damaging healthy tissues due to their low imaging contrast against diseased areas. This study introduces an adaptive thermal ablation probe leveraging anisotropic magnetic heating of magnetite nanorods pre&#8208;aligned within a polymer substrate. During magnetic pre&#8208;alignment, the nanorods form chain&#8208;like aggregates, enhancing their magnetic anisotropy and minimizing demagnetization effects. Under an alternating magnetic field, these features create a distinct difference in heat generation along the aggregates&#8217; easy and hard axes. This probe utilizes a bimorph structure incorporating a heating layer with aligned nanorods and an actuation layer containing NdFeB microparticles. Exposure to static and alternating magnetic fields induces probe bending, adjusting nanorod orientation to modulate heat generation and prevent overheating. In vitro experiments demonstrate successful thrombus phantom ablation in both fluid flow and porcine artery models while preserving tissue viability. This innovative approach advances thermal ablation technology by offering a safer, more precise, and adaptive solution with a high potential for clinical translation.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Driven Closed&#8208;Loop Chemical Recycling System for Polypinacols</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel strategy for the photochemical closed&#8208;loop recycling of hydroxyl&#8208;rich polymers. Simple bis&#8208;aldehyde precursors are employed to synthesize polypinacols via UV light irradiation. Subsequent depolymerization is achieved under visible light using a cerium&#8208;based photocatalyst, enabling monomer recovery through selective cleavage of C&#9472;C bonds within the polymer backbone.








Abstract
The development of innovative recycling strategies for polymers is crucial to addressing the rapidly growing plastic waste challenge. While thermal ground&#8208;state chemistry is the standard for closed&#8208;loop chemical recycling, the potential of photochemical excited&#8208;state chemistry remains largely unexplored. This study bridges this gap by investigating light&#8208;driven polymerization and depolymerization processes for hydroxyl&#8208;rich polymers. Through consecutive pinacol coupling reactions, a range of simple bis&#8208;aldehyde monomers is photopolymerized into well&#8208;defined polypinacols on a gram scale. These polymers exhibit excellent thermal stability, retaining their integrity up to 306&#160;&#176;C, with glass transition temperatures ranging from 72 to 137&#160;&#176;C. Using an earth&#8208;abundant cerium photocatalyst, selective cleavage of stable C&#9472;C bonds within the polypinacol backbone is achieved under visible light, efficiently regenerating the original monomer. As this approach tolerates the presence of standard commodity plastics, it presents an opportunity for orthogonal recycling methods that could help recover specific polymers from diverse plastic waste streams. The successful completion of one recycling cycle, resulting in a polymer with comparable properties to the original, highlights the significant potential and advantages of (photo)chemical recycling.

         <title>Van der Waals Welding of Carbon Nanotubes with Near&#8208;Limit High Strength</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The welding of CNTs for the first time by a fast chemical&#8208;vapor&#8208;deposition self&#8208;assembly (FCVDS) technique using TiO2 nanoparticles as the solder is reported. It is simple, fast, pressure&#8208;free, and applicable to ambient conditions. The welded junctions have the highest strength realized in nanowelding field so far, to the best of the knowledge.








Abstract
The strength of carbon nanotube (CNT) bundles and fibers is generally much lower than that of single CNTs, the short length of CNT components results in the assembly strength can only be contributed by the weak shearing interaction between CNTs. Here, the welding of CNTs by a fast chemical&#8208;vapor&#8208;deposition self&#8208;assembly (FCVDS) technique using TiO2 nanoparticles as the solder is reported. It is simple, fast, pressure&#8208;free, applicable to ambient conditions, and can weld samples with macroscale length. The welded junctions have a mechanical strength approaching the tensile strength of a single CNT. Whereas the interface interaction between TiO2 and CNTs is only contributed by Van der Waals forces, avoiding the destruction of the defect&#8208;free structure of CNTs. The solder mass can be only &#8776;1&#160;wt% of welded CNTs.

&lt;p&gt;The welding of CNTs for the first time by a fast chemical-vapor-deposition self-assembly (FCVDS) technique using TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles as the solder is reported. It is simple, fast, pressure-free, and applicable to ambient conditions. The welded junctions have the highest strength realized in nanowelding field so far, to the best of the knowledge.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strength of carbon nanotube (CNT) bundles and fibers is generally much lower than that of single CNTs, the short length of CNT components results in the assembly strength can only be contributed by the weak shearing interaction between CNTs. Here, the welding of CNTs by a fast chemical-vapor-deposition self-assembly (FCVDS) technique using TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles as the solder is reported. It is simple, fast, pressure-free, applicable to ambient conditions, and can weld samples with macroscale length. The welded junctions have a mechanical strength approaching the tensile strength of a single CNT. Whereas the interface interaction between TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CNTs is only contributed by Van der Waals forces, avoiding the destruction of the defect-free structure of CNTs. The solder mass can be only &#8776;1&#160;wt% of welded CNTs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrathin Deployable Femtosecond Vortex Laser</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deployable ultrathin femtosecond vortex laser based on a BIC&#8208;enabled polymer membrane is demonstrated, delivering MW/cm2 peak power and structured light emission. With its modular design and compact footprint, it is considered promising for integration into advanced imaging and lithography.








Abstract
Ultrafast vortex lasers, capable of emitting structured femtosecond pulses with orbital angular momentum, hold great potential for high&#8208;speed optical communications, super&#8208;resolution imaging, and advanced laser processing. However, the direct generation of femtosecond vortex pulses in micro/nanoscale lasers remains a major challenge. Here, an ultrathin deployable femtosecond vortex laser based on a &#8776;200&#160;nm&#8208;thick conjugated polymer gain membrane integrated with a square&#8208;lattice photonic crystal supporting symmetry&#8208;protected bound states in the continuum mode is demonstrated. The high&#8208;Q vortex modes driven by Purcell enhancement enable low&#8208;threshold (1.5&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm2), femtosecond (&#8776;600&#160;fs) vortex pulse emission with peak power reaching several MW/cm2. The freestanding membrane can be modularly deployed onto arbitrary substrates, where direct laser fabrication is challenging. When deployed onto an optical mirror, the membrane laser achieved unidirectional emission, nearly doubling its output efficiency. Furthermore, a confocal optical path aligned the vortex laser coaxially with the pump light, highlighting its potential as an integrated module for simplifying super&#8208;resolution imaging and lithography techniques.

         <title>Bilateral Anchoring for Enhanced Mechanical Stability and Efficiency in Flexible all&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bilateral anchoring strategy using 2&#8208;bromoethylamine hydrobromide (2&#8208;BH) at PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface enhances interfacial adhesion and charger transfer in flexible Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cells. The introduction of 2&#8208;BH additionally mitigates Sn2+ oxidation, thereby improving the film morphology and crystallinity. Overall, such optimized flexible all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells achieve a power conversion efficiency of 24.1% and present superior mechanical durability.








Abstract
Flexible all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs) feature an outstanding power&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio, rendering them perfect for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic, wearable electronics, and aerospace applications, owing to their adaptability to flexible and lightweight substrates. However, the weak mechanical adhesion between the perovskite and adjacent functional layers, combined with tin (Sn) oxidation at the buried interface in tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) perovskites solar cells (PSCs), substantially hampers the durability and performance of device. Herein, a bilateral anchoring strategy is proposed by employing 2&#8208;bromoethylamine hydrobromide (2&#8208;BH) at the NBG perovskite/ hole transporting layer (PEDOT:PSS) interface. The incorporation of 2&#8208;BH establishes robust bonds with both PEDOT:PSS and the perovskite layer, thereby enhancing interfacial adhesion and charge transfer. Meanwhile, the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite films are also improved due to the mitigated oxidation of Sn2+. Thus, this approach yields flexible single&#8208;junction NBG &#160;with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.5%, maintaining its 95% efficiency after 3000 bending cycles. When integrated into monolithic flexible all&#8208;perovskite TSCs, a certified PCE of 24.01% is achieved.

         <title>Fundamental Chemistry and Functional Mechanisms of Nitrile&#8208;Based Electrolyte in Advanced Battery Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given the critical role of electrolyte engineering in advancing secondary batteries with high energy density and enhanced safety, this review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of nitrile&#8208;based electrolytes. It explores the electrochemical behavior of nitriles as solvents and additives, and their influence on battery performance, and highlights recent advancements and challenges for future development.








Abstract
Nitriles have gained attention as promising candidates for secondary battery electrolytes due to the high polarity of cyano groups, excellent cathode compatibility, remarkable oxidation resistance, and broad thermal stability. As additives, nitriles effectively stabilize cathode surfaces and inhibit the dissolution of transition metals. Besides, as the electrolyte solvent, the characteristics of a wide liquidus range, excellent high&#8208;voltage tolerance, and superior conductivity endow it with outstanding performance. Moreover, nitriles are also beneficially applied in solid&#8208;state electrolytes, offering advantages such as strong cation coordination, excellent thermal and electrochemical stability, and enhanced ionic conductivity. However, obstacles such as side reactions with anodes, the formation of non&#8208;robust SEI layers, and inherent toxicity hinder their broader application. Herein, the mechanism of nitriles as additives, and the application progress of nitriles in liquid electrolytes and solid&#8208;state electrolytes are introduced in detail. Furthermore, the current challenges faced by nitriles are in depth analyzed, and the advanced modification strategies of nitriles as secondary battery electrolytes are thoroughly summarized and discussed. Additionally, the future development of nitriles in the field of secondary batteries is prospected. This review provides important references for the future development of nitrile&#8208;based electrolytes, with guiding significance for other electrolyte solvents and additives.

         <title>Xolography for Rapid Volumetric Production of Objects from the Nanoscopic to Macroscopic Length Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article explores the development of materials with multi&#8208;scale control at the nanoscale (&lt;100 nm), micrometer&#8208;scale (80 &#181;m), and macro&#8208;scale (multi&#8208;component geometries). This is achieved by applying polymerization&#8208;induced microphase separation (PIMS) process via volumetric 3D printing (Xolography), expanding the design space for functional nanomaterials in diverse applications.








Abstract
Light&#8208;mediated 3D printing has revolutionized additive manufacturing, progressing from pointwise stereolithography, to layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer digital light processing, and most recently to volumetric 3D printing. Xolography, a novel light&#8208;sheet&#8208;based volumetric 3D printing approach, offers high&#8208;speed and high&#8208;precision fabrication of complex geometries unattainable with traditional methods. However, achieving nanoscale control (&lt;100&#160;nm) within these 3D printing systems remains unexplored. This work leverages polymerization&#8208;induced microphase separation (PIMS) within the xolography process to prepare network polymer materials with simultaneous control over feature sizes at the nano&#8208;, micro&#8208;, and macro&#8208;scale. By controlling the chain length and mass fraction of macromolecular chain transfer agents used in the PIMS process, precise manipulation of nanodomain size within 3D printed materials is demonstrated, while optimization of the other resin components enables the fabrication of rigid materials with feature sizes of 80&#160;&#181;m. Critically, the rapid one&#8208;step fabrication of complex and multi&#8208;component structures such as a functional waterwheel with interlocking parts, at high volume&#8208;building rates is showcased. This combined approach expands the design space for functional nanomaterials, opening new avenues for applications in diverse fields such as polymer electrolyte membranes, biomedical delivery systems, and semi&#8208;permeable microcapsules.

Synergistic Hybrid&#8208;Ligand Passivation of Perovskite Quantum Dots
This illustration demonstrates multi&#8208;functional CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot (PQD) solids with high luminescence, conductivity, and stability fabricated by synergistic hybrid&#8208;ligand exchange and passivation strategies. The multiple interactions between introduced ligands not only improve inherent properties but also suppress the dimensionality change that cause severe stability degradation of PQDs. Therefore, hybrid&#8208;ligand strategies enable realizing highly efficient and stable optoelectronic device. More details can be found in article number 2410128 by Jongmin Choi, Bo Ram Lee, Younghoon Kim, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Pure Bromide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 25, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to unstable&#8208;spectra mixed&#8208;halide perovskites, pure bromide blue perovskites have demonstrated good spectral stability. Here, the recent advances of blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs)&#160;on pure bromide perovskites are summarized and categorized according to the different strategies of tuning emission. Moreover, the challenges and research directions for achieving highly bright, efficient, and stable blue perovskite LEDs in the future are also addressed.








Abstract
Blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are essential for the creation of full&#8208;color displays and white&#8208;light illumination, and some significant progress is made in recent years. However, most high&#8208;performance blue perovskite LEDs are currently based on mixed&#8208;halide perovskites and suffer from unstable spectra due to inevitable halide phase segregation, which is unfavorable for the application of blue perovskite LEDs. In contrast, blue emissions from pure bromide perovskites generally exhibit stable spectra (consistent emission peak positions and spectral shapes) and are worthy of attention. In this review, the recent advances in blue LEDs based on pure bromide perovskites according to different strategies are classified and summarized. Moreover, the challenges related to poor charge injection, high defect&#8208;state density, lack of high&#8208;performance in the deeper blue region, and inferior operational stability are addressed. Finally, an outlook is provided on feasible future research directions for highly bright, efficient, and stable blue perovskite LEDs.

         <title>Advances and Challenges in Large&#8208;Area Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 25, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers the key fabrication techniques for large&#8208;area perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs), including spin coating, blade coating, inkjet printing, and vacuum thermal evaporation. The pros and cons of each method are discussed in detail, along with the latest advances in large&#8208;area PeLEDs development. Specific challenges are discussed and potential improvement strategies are proposed, all of which are crucial for scalable PeLEDs production. The goal of this review is to offer guidelines for overcoming the challenges in fabricating large&#8208;area devices.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have shown promise for high&#8208;definition displays and flat&#8208;panel lighting because of their wide color gamut, narrow emission band, and high brightness. The external quantum efficiency of PeLEDs increased rapidly from &#8776;1% to more than 25% in the past few years. However, most of these high&#8208;performance devices are fabricated using a spin coating method with a small device area of &lt;0.1 cm2, limiting their commercial applications. Recently, large&#8208;area PeLEDs have attracted growing attention and significant breakthroughs have been reported. This perspective first introduces the pros and cons of each technique in making large&#8208;area PeLEDs. The advances in the fabrication of large&#8208;area PeLEDs are then summarized using spin coating and mass&#8208;production methods such as inkjet printing, blade coating, and thermal evaporation. Moreover, the challenging issues will be discussed that are urgent to be solved for large&#8208;area PeLEDs.

&lt;p&gt;Metal halide perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have shown promise for high-definition displays and flat-panel lighting because of their wide color gamut, narrow emission band, and high brightness. The external quantum efficiency of PeLEDs increased rapidly from &#8776;1% to more than 25% in the past few years. However, most of these high-performance devices are fabricated using a spin coating method with a small device area of &amp;lt;0.1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, limiting their commercial applications. Recently, large-area PeLEDs have attracted growing attention and significant breakthroughs have been reported. This perspective first introduces the pros and cons of each technique in making large-area PeLEDs. The advances in the fabrication of large-area PeLEDs are then summarized using spin coating and mass-production methods such as inkjet printing, blade coating, and thermal evaporation. Moreover, the challenging issues will be discussed that are urgent to be solved for large-area PeLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulation of Charge Transport Layer for Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 25, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the roles of charge transport layers (CTLs) in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (Pero&#8208;LEDs) and categorizes both reported and potential CTL materials. Then, various CTL optimization strategies are presented, alongside an analysis of the selection criteria for CTLs in high&#8208;performance Pero&#8208;LEDs. Finally, a summary and outlook on the potential of CTL modulation to further advance Pero&#8208;LED performances are provided.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (Pero&#8208;LEDs) have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional emission characteristics, including narrow full width at half maximum, high color purity, and tunable emission colors. Recent efficiency and operational stability advancements have positioned Pero&#8208;LEDs as a promising next&#8208;generation display technology. Extensive research and review articles on the compositional engineering and defect passivation of perovskite layers have substantially contributed to the development of multi&#8208;color and high&#8208;efficiency Pero&#8208;LEDs. However, the crucial aspect of charge transport layer (CTL) modulation in Pero&#8208;LEDs remains relatively underexplored. CTL modulation not only impacts the charge carrier transport efficiency and injection balance but also plays a critical role in passivating the perovskite surface, blocking ion migration, enhancing perovskite crystallinity, and improving light extraction efficiency. Therefore, optimizing CTLs is pivotal for further enhancing Pero&#8208;LED performance. Herein, this review discusses the roles of CTLs in Pero&#8208;LEDs and categorizes both reported and potential CTL materials. Then, various CTL optimization strategies are presented, alongside an analysis of the selection criteria for CTLs in high&#8208;performance Pero&#8208;LEDs. Finally, a summary and outlook on the potential of CTL modulation to further advance Pero&#8208;LED performances are provided.

         <title>Reduced&#8208;Dimensional Perovskites: Quantum Well Thickness Distribution and Optoelectronic Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 25, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript elucidates the relationship between the structure and optoelectronic properties of reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskites (RDPs) and describes their carrier recombination behaviours. It highlights the importance of the QW thickness distribution in RDPs for achieving high&#8208;efficiency light&#8208;emitting diodes and summarizes the latest advances in controlling the QW thickness distribution of RDPs.








Abstract
Reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskites (RDPs), a large category of metal halide perovskites, have attracted considerable attention and shown high potential in the fields of solid&#8208;state displays and lighting. RDPs feature a quantum&#8208;well&#8208;based structure and energy funneling effects. The multiple quantum well (QW) structure endows RDPs with superior energy transfer and high luminescence efficiency. The effect of QW confinement directly depends on the number of inorganic octahedral layers (QW thickness, i.e., n value), so the distribution of n values determines the optoelectronic properties of RDPs. Here, it is focused on the QW thickness distribution of RDPs, detailing its effect on the structural characteristics, carrier recombination dynamics, optoelectronic properties, and applications in light&#8208;emitting diodes. The reported distribution control strategies is also summarized and discuss the current challenges and future trends of RDPs. This review aims to provide deep insight into RDPs, with the hope of advancing their further development and applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 25, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the developments of lead&#8208;free perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes, with a particular emphasis on tin&#8208;based devices. Recent progress in device efficiency enhancements through the refinement of material properties and the optimization of device configurations are discussed.

Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have been identified as a promising class of materials for light&#8208;emitting applications. The development of lead&#8208;based perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) has led to substantial improvements, with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) now surpassing 30% and operational lifetimes comparable to those of organic LEDs (OLEDs). However, the concern over the potential toxicity of lead has motivated a search for alternative materials that are both eco&#8208;friendly and possess excellent optoelectronic properties, with lead&#8208;free perovskites emerging as a strong contender. In this review, the properties of various lead&#8208;free perovskite emitters are analyzed, with a particular emphasis on the more well&#8208;reported tin&#8208;based variants. Recent progress in enhancing device efficiencies through refined crystallization processes and the optimization of device configurations is also discussed. Additionally, the remaining challenges are examined, and propose strategies that may lead to stable device operation. Looking forward, the potential future developments for lead&#8208;free PeLEDs are considered, including the extension of spectral range, the adoption of more eco&#8208;friendly deposition techniques, and the exploration of alternative materials.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Orbital Ordering Effects of Light Emission in Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 25, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskites are multifunctional semiconductors carrying both orbital and spin momentum toward forming strong spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC). Consequently, the orbital and spin momentum provide dual tuning mechanisms to advance the photoluminescence (PL), circularly&#8208;polarized luminescence (CPL), amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), photovoltaic responses (JSC), ferroelectricity (P), and optically&#8208;induced magnetization (M).








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskites carrying strong spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) have demonstrated remarkable light&#8208;emitting properties in spontaneous emission, amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), and circularly&#8208;polarized luminescence (CPL). Experimental studies have shown that SOC plays an important role in controlling the light&#8208;emitting properties in such hybrid perovskites. Here, the SOC consists of both orbital (L) and spin (S) momentum, leading to the formation of J (= L + S) excitons intrinsically involving orbital and spin momentum. In general, there are three issues in determining the effects of SOC on the light&#8208;emitting properties of J excitons. First, when the J excitons function as individual quasi&#8208;particles, the configurations of orbital and spin momentum directly decide the formation of bright and dark J excitons. Second, when the J excitons are mutually interacting as collective quasi&#8208;particles, the exciton&#8211;exciton interactions can occur through orbital and spin momentum. The exciton&#8211;exciton interactions through orbital and spin momentum give rise to different light&#8208;emitting properties, presenting SOC ordering effects. Third, the J excitons can develop ASE through coherent exciton&#8211;exciton interaction and CPL through exciton&#8208;helical ordering effect. This review article discusses the SOC effects in spontaneous emission, ASE, and CPL in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskites.

Abstract
Layered halide perovskites have garnered significant interest due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties and great promises in light&#8208;emitting applications. Achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) requires a deep understanding of exciton dynamics in these materials. This review begins with a fundamental overview of the structural and photophysical properties of layered halide perovskites, then delves into the importance of dimensionality control and cascade energy transfer in quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs. In the second half of the review, more complex exciton dynamics, such as multiexciton processes and triplet exciton dynamics, from the perspective of LEDs are explored. Through this comprehensive review, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the critical aspects of exciton dynamics in layered halide perovskites and their impacts on future research and technological advancements for layered halide PeLEDs is provided.

         <title>Strategies for Controlling Emission Anisotropy in Lead Halide Perovskite Emitters for LED Outcoupling Enhancement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 25, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rise of lead halide perovskite semiconductors has enabled high&#8208;performance LEDs with internal quantum efficiencies approaching 100%. In order to further enhance the external quantum efficiencies limited by light outcoupling effects, in this account, the strategies for reducing energy dissipation through the substrate, waveguide, and evanescent modes, with a focus on manipulating the transition dipole moment orientation are reviewed.








Abstract
In the last decade, momentous progress in lead halide perovskite (LHP) light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) is witnessed as their external quantum efficiency (&#951;ext) has increased from 0.1 to more than 30%. Indeed, perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs), which can in principle reach 100% internal quantum efficiency as they are not limited by the spin&#8208;statistics, are reaching their full potential and approaching the theoretical limit in terms of device efficiency. However, &#8776;70% to 85% of total generated photons are trapped within the devices through the dissipation pathways of the substrate, waveguide, and evanescent modes. To this end, numerous extrinsic and intrinsic light&#8208;outcoupling strategies are studied to enhance light&#8208;outcoupling efficiency (&#951;out). At the outset, various external and internal light outcoupling techniques are reviewed with specific emphasis on emission anisotropy and its role on &#951;out. In particular, the device &#951;ext can be enhanced by up to 50%, taking advantage of the increased probability for photons outcoupled to air by effectively inducing horizontally oriented emission transition dipole moments (TDM) in the perovskite emitters. The role of the TDM orientation in PeLED performance and the factors allowing its rational manipulation are reviewed extensively. Furthermore, this account presents an in&#8208;depth discussion about the effects of the self&#8208;assembly of LHP colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) into superlattices on the NC emission anisotropy and optical properties.

         <dc:description>
The review covers the past and current developments in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) exploiting nanocrystals of halide perovskites and perovskite&#8208;related materials. The review examines the aspects of material optimizations, device engineering, and applications. Furthermore, the current existing challenges and future possible opportunities are discussed in order to define a roadmap in this field of research.








Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on halide perovskite nanocrystals have attracted extensive attention due to their considerable luminescence efficiency, wide color gamut, high color purity, and facile material synthesis. Since the first demonstration of LEDs based on MAPbBr3 nanocrystals&#160;was&#160;reported in 2014, the community has witnessed a rapid development in their performances. In this review, a historical perspective of the development of LEDs based on halide perovskite nanocrystals is provided and then a comprehensive survey of current strategies for high&#8208;efficiency lead&#8208;based perovskite nanocrystals LEDs, including synthesis optimization, ion doping/alloying, and shell coating is presented. Then the basic characteristics and emission mechanisms of lead&#8208;free perovskite and perovskite&#8208;related nanocrystals emitters in environmentally friendly LEDs, from the standpoint of different emission colors are reviewed. Finally, the progress in LED applications is covered and an outlook of the opportunities and challenges for future developments in this field is provided.

         <dc:description>
Nanocrystalline perovskites enable efficient, high&#8208;color&#8208;purity future displays through advanced material engineering. This review highlights their roles in improving PeLED efficiency and stability, focusing on three types: polycrystalline perovskites, quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, and perovskite nanoparticles. It discusses material design strategies, exciton recombination dynamics, development trends, challenges, and pathways for commercialization.








Abstract
Nanocrystalline perovskites have driven significant progress in metal halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) over the past decade by enabling the spatial confinement of excitons. Consequently, three primary categories of nanocrystalline perovskites have emerged: nanoscale polycrystalline perovskites, quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, and perovskite nanocrystals. Each type has been developed to address specific challenges and enhance the efficiency and stability of PeLEDs. This review explores the representative material design strategies for these nanocrystalline perovskites, correlating them with exciton recombination dynamics and optical/electrical properties. Additionally, it summarizes the trends in progress over the past decade, outlining four distinct phases of nanocrystalline perovskite development. Lastly, this review addresses the remaining challenges and proposes a potential material design to further advance PeLED technology toward commercialization.

         <title>Exciton Transport in Perovskite Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 25, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the spatiotemporal dynamics of excitons in halide perovskite materials, with a particular emphasis on low&#8208;dimensional perovskites and the effects of nanoscale morphology on excitonic behavior. Novel phenomena unique to halide perovskites are emphasized while introducing the basic theory needed to understand the importance of those observations.








Abstract
Halide perovskites have emerged as promising materials for a wide variety of optoelectronic applications, including solar cells, light&#8208;emitting devices, photodetectors, and quantum information applications. In addition to their desirable optical and electronic properties, halide perovskites provide tremendous synthetic flexibility through variation of not only their chemical composition but also their structure and morphology. At the heart of their use in optoelectronic technologies is the interaction of light with electronic excitations in the form of excitons. This review discusses the properties and behavior of excitons in halide perovskite materials, with a particular emphasis on low&#8208;dimensional perovskites and the effects of nanoscale morphology on excitonic behavior. The basic theory of excitonic energy migration in semiconductor nanomaterials is introduced, and novel observations in halide perovskite nanomaterials that have evolved our current understanding are explored. Finally, many important questions that remain unanswered are presented and exciting emerging directions in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite exciton physics are discussed.

         <title>Tribenzyl Organic Cations Carried Multidentate X&#8208;Type Lewis Soft Base for High&#8208;Performance Foldable Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

This study proposes tribenzyl organic cation carried multidentate X&#8208;type Lewis soft base to enhance adhesion and passivate defects simultaneously, aiming to achieve foldable and efficient perovskite nanocrystal&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes.&#160;The resulting pure red F&#8208;PeLEDs exhibit a recorded high EQE of 16.2% and robust mechanical properties to endure 5000 folding cycles with small radius of 1 mm.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) exhibit significant potential for advancing foldable perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (F&#8208;PLEDs) due to their discrete crystalline morphology, bright emission across an extensive color gamut, and remarkable color purity; however, their progression remains in the early stages with the concerns of inadequate performance and mechanical instability. This study proposes a ligand strategy employing tribenzyl organic cation (tribenzylamine, TBA) carried multidentate X&#8208;type Lewis soft base (sodium acid pyrophosphate, SAPP) to address the challenges above simultaneously. Specifically, the use of multibranched aromatic ligands considerably improved the adhesion force between PNCs and adjacent layers, enhancing mechanical stability during folding, while the control sample shows deleterious cracks. Additionally, TBA&#8208;SAPP ligands effectively eliminate the defects in PNC film, yielding exceptional photoluminescence properties with a near&#8208;unity quantum yield. Consequently, the multifunctional ligands improved F&#8208;PLEDs to achieve a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 16.2% compared to the previously reported pure&#8208;red flexible PLEDs and display substantially improved spectral and operational stability. Equally important, these devices demonstrate robust mechanical properties, enduring a small folding radius of 1 mm for 5000 cycles. This ligand strategy is anticipated to inspire relevant research in PNCs and promote the realization of highly efficient and mechanically stable F&#8208;PLEDs.

         <title>Synthetic Control of Water&#8208;Stable Hybrid Perovskitoid Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 25, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid metal&#8208;halide perovskites are promising semiconductors for optoelectronics, yet their water stability is problematic. A new synthesis method is developed using lead iodide and cysteamine under various pH conditions, forming stable perovskitoid structures. This approach significantly enhances water stability and allows for tuning of the bandgap properties, paving the way for robust optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Hybrid metal&#8208;halide perovskites and their derived materials have emerged as the next&#8208;generation semiconductors with a wide range of applications, including photovoltaics, light&#8208;emitting devices, and other optoelectronics. Over the past decade, numerous single&#8208;crystalline perovskite derivatives have been synthesized and developed. However, the synthetic methods for these derivatives mainly rely on acidic crystallization conditions. This approach leads to crystals comprising metal halide building blocks, which show problematic stability when directly exposed to water. In this study, a methodology is developed for synthesizing hybrid metal&#8208;halide compounds using lead iodide and the zwitterionic bifunctional molecule cysteamine (CYS), to form various perovskitoid structures under a broad pH range. Interestingly, the different pH conditions alter the coordination environment of lead halides, leading to lead&#8208;sulfide and lead&#8208;nitride covalent bond formation. This modification significantly enhances their stability when in direct contact with water, lasting for months. Photoluminescence measurements and first principal density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the perovskitoids synthesized under basic and acidic pH conditions exhibit a direct bandgap nature, while those synthesized under neutral conditions display an indirect bandgap. This approach opens new avenues for manipulating synthetic methods to develop water&#8208;stable hybrid semiconductors suitable for a wide range of applications, such as solid&#8208;state light emitters.

         <title>Thin Film Stoichiometry and Defects Management for Low Threshold and Air Stable Near&#8208;Infrared Perovskite Laser</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 25, June 26, 2025. </description>

As defect density in 3D perovskites is controlled by adjusting excess formamidinium iodide concentration, shallow defects acts as a carrier sink for amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). A comprehensive charge carrier dynamic model is presented to understand the critical factor of the reduction of ASE threshold.








Abstract
While significant efforts have been devoted to optimize the thin&#8208;film stoichiometry and processing of perovskites for applications in photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting diodes, there is a noticeable lack of emphasis on tailoring them for lasing applications. In this study, it is revealed that thin films engineered for efficient light&#8208;emitting diodes, with passivation of deep and shallow trap states and a tailored energetic landscape directing carriers toward low&#8208;energy emitting states, may not be optimal for light amplification systems. Instead, amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) is found to be sustained by shallow defects, driven by the positive correlation between the ASE threshold and the ratio of carrier injection rate in the emissive state to the recombination rate of excited carriers. This insight has informed the development of an optimized perovskite thin film and laser device exhibiting a low threshold (&#8776; 60 &#181;J cm&#8722;2) and stable ASE emission exceeding 21 hours in ambient conditions.

         <title>Crosslinkable Ligands for High&#8208;Density Photo&#8208;Patterning of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 25, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and synthesis of a bidentate photo&#8208;crosslinkable ligand for high&#8208;density photo&#8208;patterning of perovskite nanocrystals is reported. The incorporation of the photo&#8208;crosslinker to perovskite nanocrystals enables the creation of a high&#8208;density crosslinked film with high optical density of 1.1, at a film thickness of only 1.4 &#181;m. Patterning via laser writing gave well&#8208;defined patterns with feature sizes of 20 &#181;m.








Abstract
Perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are promising luminescent materials for electronic color displays due to their high luminescence efficiency, widely&#8208;tunable emission wavelengths, and narrow emission linewidth. Their application in emerging display technologies&#160;necessitates precise micron&#8208;scale patterning&#160;while maintaining good optical performance. Although photolithography is a well&#8208;established micro&#8208;patterning technique in the industry, conventional processes are incompatible with PNCs as the use of polar solvents can damage the ionic PNCs, causing&#160;severe luminescence quenching. Here,&#160;we report the rational design and synthesis of a new bidentate photo&#8208;crosslinkable ligand for the direct photo&#8208;patterning of PNCs. Each ligand contains two photosensitive acrylate groups and two carboxylate groups, and is introduced to the PNCs via an entropy&#8208;driven ligand exchange process. In a close&#8208;packed thin film, the acrylate ligands photo&#8208;polymerize and crosslink under ultraviolet light, rendering the PNCs insoluble in developing solvents. A high&#8208;density crosslinked PNC film with an optical density of 1.1 is attained at 1.4&#160;&#181;m thickness, surpassing industry requirements on the absorption coefficient. Micron&#8208;scale patterning is further demonstrated using direct laser writing, producing well&#8208;defined 20&#160;&#181;m features. This study thus offers an effective and versatile approach for micro&#8208;patterning PNCs, and may also be broadly applicable to other nanomaterial systems.

         <title>Synergistic Hybrid&#8208;Ligand Passivation of Perovskite Quantum Dots: Suppressing Reduced&#8208;Dimensionality and Enhancing Optoelectronic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 25, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation and phase transition of reduced dimensional perovskites triggered by phenethylammonium iodide deteriorates the structural and optical properties of CsPbI3&#8208;perovskite quantum dots (PQDs). Triphenylphosphine oxide, introduced as an ancillary ligand, not only suppresses the phase transition but also further passivates the trap sites on the CsPbI3&#8208;PQDs, leading to improved device performance in CsPbI3&#8208;PQD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diode and solar cell devices.









Abstract
In terms of surface passivation for realizing efficient CsPbI3&#8208;perovskite quantum dot (CsPbI3&#8208;PQD)&#8208;based optoelectronic devices, phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) is widely used during the ligand exchange. However, the PEA cation, due to its large ionic radius incompatible with the 3D perovskite framework, acts as an organic spacer within polycrystalline perovskites, leading to the formation of reduced dimensional perovskites (RDPs). Despite sharing the identical 3D perovskite framework, the influence of PEAI on the structure of CsPbI3&#8208;PQDs remains unexplored. Here, it is revealed that PEAI can induce the formation of high&#8208;n RDPs (n&#160;&gt;&#160;2) within the CsPbI3&#8208;PQD solids, but these high&#8208;n RDPs undergo an undesirable phase transition to low&#8208;n RDPs, leading to the structural and optical degradation of CsPbI3&#8208;PQDs. To address the PEAI&#8208;induced issue, we employ triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) as an ancillary ligand during the ligand exchange process. The incorporation of TPPO prevents H2O penetration and regulates the rapid diffusion of PEAI, suppressing the formation of low&#8208;n RDPs. Moreover, TPPO can passivate the uncoordinated Pb2+ sites, reducing the nonradiative recombination. This hybrid&#8208;ligand exchange strategy using both PEAI and TPPO enables realizing efficient and stable CsPbI3&#8208;PQD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diode (external quantum efficiency of 21.8%) and solar cell (power conversion efficiency of 15.3%) devices.

         <title>Managing Edge States in Reduced&#8208;Dimensional Perovskites for Highly Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue LEDs</title>

         <dc:description>
An edge&#8208;state management strategy toward highly efficient pure&#8208;halide low n&#8208;value (&#8220;n&#8221; represents the number of octahedral sheets) reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskites is developed. Realizing octahedral tilting reconstruction with sterically hindered, edge&#8208;anchored ligands can effectively suppress lattice vibrations, thereby inhibiting exciton&#8208;phonon coupling. Consequently, high&#8208;efficiency and color&#8208;stable deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes are presented, showing the potential of reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskites for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays.








Abstract
Pure&#8208;halide reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskites, featuring large exciton binding energy and tunable bandgap, show great potential for high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). However, their efficiency, particularly in the low n&#8208;value phase domain (&#8220;n&#8221; represents the number of octahedral sheets), lags behind analogous perovskite emitters. Herein, it is demonstrated that the vibration of edge&#8208;dangling octahedra in the low n&#8208;value phase activates notorious exciton&#8208;phonon (EP) coupling, thereby deteriorating efficiency. To address this issue, an approach is reported to manage edge&#8208;state lattices by introducing tris(4&#8208;fluorophenyl) phosphine (TFP) ligands. Attributed to the large steric hindrance of TFP ligands and their strong binding affinity for edge&#8208;dangling octahedra, the edged&#8208;octahedral tilting reconstruction can effectively suppress lattice vibration and inhibit EP coupling. This strategy yields deep&#8208;blue emitting film with a spectral linewidth of 21&#160;nm and a photoluminescence quantum yield of 85% at low excitation densities. The resulting PeLEDs achieve deep&#8208;blue emission at 469&#160;nm, with a maximum luminance of 2,428&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 10.4%, marking them among the most efficient deep&#8208;blue PeLEDs reported. The strategy also showcases universality for higher n&#8208;value reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskites. It is believed that the observation, along with the edge&#8208;state management strategy, lays the groundwork for further advancements in reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Solution Processed Bilayer Metal Halide White Light Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 25, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile approach for generating white electroluminescence is demonstrated by combining the blue emission from metal halide perovskite (2D CsPBr3 NPLs) with the orange/red emission from 0D organic metal halide hybrid (TPPcarzSbBr4). The resulting tunable WLEDs, featuring a solution&#8208;processed bilayer structure without energy transfer between the two emitting layers, exhibit a peak external quantum efficiency of 4.8% with a luminance of 1507 cd m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites and perovskite&#8208;related organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have recently emerged as a new class of luminescent materials for light emitting diodes (LEDs), owing to their unique and remarkable properties, including near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies, highly tunable emission colors, and low temperature solution processing. While substantial progress has been made in developing monochromatic LEDs with electroluminescence across blue, green, red, and near&#8208;infrared regions, achieving highly efficient and stable white electroluminescence from a single LED remains a challenging and under&#8208;explored area. Here, a facile approach to generating white electroluminescence is reported by combining narrow sky&#8208;blue emission from metal halide perovskites and broadband orange/red emission from zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) OMHHs. For the proof of concept, utilizing TPPcarz+ passivated two&#8208;dimensional (2D) CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets (NPLs) as sky blue emitter and 0D TPPcarzSbBr4 as orange/red emitter (TPPcarz+ = triphenyl (9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl) phosphonium), white LEDs (WLEDs) with a solution processed bilayer structure have been fabricated to exhibit a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 4.8% and luminance of 1507 cd m&#8722;2 at the Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinate of (0.32, 0.35). This work opens a new pathway for creating highly efficient and stable WLEDs using metal halide perovskites and related materials.

         <title>Designing Robust Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskites Thin Films for Stable Light&#8208;Emitting Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 25, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasi&#8208;2D perovskites are bright light emitter, but are thermodynamically unstable. In this work, it is found that 2D phase are re&#8208;distributed upon thermal stress that degrades the emission. To stabilize the 2D phases, a di&#8208;amine linker is introduced that can hold the 2D structure strongly that maintains the high emission.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D perovskite made with organic spacers co&#8208;crystallized with inorganic cesium lead bromide inorganics is demonstrated for near unity photoluminescence quantum yield at room temperature. However, light emitting diodes made with quasi&#8208;2D perovskites rapidly degrade which remains a major bottleneck in this field. In this work, It is shown that the bright emission originates from finely tuned multi&#8208;component 2D nano&#8208;crystalline phases that are thermodynamically unstable. The bright emission is extremely sensitive to external stimuli and the emission quickly dims away upon heating. After a detailed analysis of their optical and morphological properties, the degradation is attributed to 2D phase redistribution associated with the dissociation of the organic spacers departing from the inorganic lattice. To circumvent the instability problem, a diamine is investigated spacer that has both sides attached to the inorganic lattice. The diamine spacer incorporated perovskite film shows significantly improved thermal tolerance over maintaining a high photoluminescence quantum yield of over 50%, which will be a more robust material for lighting applications. This study guides designing quasi&#8208;2D perovskites to stabilize the emission properties.

         <title>Manipulating Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling for Efficient Tin Halide Perovskite Blue LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 25, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a novel 2D perovskite (BrPMA)2SnBr4 with negligible intra&#8208;octahedral distortion and strong lattice rigidity via intermolecular interaction, which leads to a significantly reduced electron&#8211;phonon coupling and consequently excellent blue emission at room temperature, is designed. Finally, the Sn&#8208;based blue LED is successfully prepared for the first time with a EQE of 1.3% and a maximum brightness of 800&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional perovskites have opened up a new frontier in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LED) due to their excellent properties. However, concerns regarding the potential toxicity of Pb limited their commercial development. Sn&#8208;based perovskites are regarded as a promising candidate to replace Pb&#8208;based counterparts, while they generally exhibit strong electron&#8211;phonon coupling and consequently blue emission quenching at room temperature (RT), thus the Sn&#8208;based perovskite blue LED devices have not yet been reported. Herein, the luminescence properties are regulated by assembling a rigid organic skeleton within perovskite structure, and the protonated 4&#8208;bromobenzylamine (BrPMA+ = C7H9BrN+) is employed as A site cation to synthesize a 100&#8208;oriented 2D perovskite (BrPMA)2SnBr4, which exhibits a strong lattice rigidity via strong intermolecular interaction and consequently weak electron&#8211;phonon coupling, achieving the excellent blue PL emission at RT. The high quality (BrPMA)2SnBr4 perovskite thin films are obtained by further inhibiting oxidation and promoting crystallization. Finally, the Sn&#8208;based perovskite blue emission LED is successfully fabricated for the first time at 467&#160;nm with a champion EQE of 1.3% and a maximum brightness of 800&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. This work gives insights into the luminescence mechanism of Sn&#8208;based perovskites and provides a new theoretical basis for the development of lead&#8208;free blue LEDs.

         <title>Optimizing Perovskite Surfaces to Enhance Post&#8208;Treatment for Efficient Blue Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskite Light&#8208;emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 25, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The halide postdeposition process is optimized by engineering blue mixed&#8208;halide 3D perovskites with acetate&#8208;rich surfaces. This engineered perovskite minimizes the washing effect of isopropanol, which slows down surface reconstruction and ultimately promotes the formation of a uniform mixed&#8208;halide perovskite phase. The optimized blue 3D mixed&#8208;halide PeLEDs achieve a record external quantum efficiency of 19.28% among blue&#8208;emissive 3D PeLEDs.








Abstract
The halide postdeposition treatment technique is a widely used strategy for mitigating defects in perovskite. However, when applied to mixed&#8208;halide perovskites, it often leads to surface and internal halide heterogeneity, which compromises luminescence performance and spectral stability. In this work, blue mixed&#8208;halide 3D perovskites are engineered with acetate (Ac&#8315;)&#8208;rich surfaces to optimize the post&#8208;treatment process and achieve halide homogeneity. The findings demonstrate that the strong interaction between surface Ac&#8315; ions and Pb2+ ions significantly reduces the formation of halide vacancy defects caused by the washing effect of isopropanol during post&#8208;treatment. This defect reduction slows the infiltration of halide ions into the perovskite lattice, providing more time for surface reconstruction and minimizing the accumulation of introduced halide ions at the surface. As a result, a mild halide redistribution occurs, promoting the formation of a uniform mixed&#8208;halide perovskite phase. This approach enabled the development of blue mixed&#8208;halide 3D PeLEDs with a record external quantum efficiency of 19.28% (emission peak at 482&#160;nm), comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art blue reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskite&#8208;based PeLEDs. Additionally, the device demonstrated a narrowband and stable electroluminescence spectrum with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of less than 16&#160;nm.

         <title>Bright and Efficient CsSnBr3 Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Enabled by Interfacial Reaction&#8208;Assisted Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 25, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the crystallization process is crucial for the fabrication of high&#8208;quality tin perovskites. In this work, an interfacial reaction&#8208;assisted crystallization process is developed to fabricate high&#8208;quality CsSnBr3 films. Combined with the defect passivation effect of potassium thiocyanate, CsSnBr3 perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with record high brightness (787&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2) and high external efficiency (0.91%) are achieved.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskites are more environmentally friendly than their lead&#8208;based alternatives. Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) using iodide&#8208;based tin perovskites have achieved considerable advancements in efficiency. However, PeLEDs using bromide&#8208;based tin perovskites have not progressed as rapidly, primarily due to challenges in controlling their crystallization processes. Here, an interfacial reaction&#8208;assisted crystallization method is introduced to achieve bright and efficient CsSnBr3 PeLEDs. It is started by forming an intermediate phase through the coordination of SnBr2 with ethylenediamine derivatives. Subsequently, a protonation reaction is designed between the intermediate phase and the acidic polyethylenedioxythiophene: poly(styrene sulfonate) hole&#8208;transport layer to generate high&#8208;quality CsSnBr3 films. Additionally, the use of potassium thiocyanate additives effectively enhances the photoluminescence efficiency of the CsSnBr3 films. These efforts result in CsSnBr3&#8208;based PeLEDs achieving a maximum luminance of 787&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and a peak external quantum efficiency of 0.91%, demonstrating the most efficient and brightest CsSnBr3&#8208;based PeLEDs to date. This work opens an avenue to better control the crystallization of tin&#8208;based perovskite.

         <title>1.4% External Quantum Efficiency 988 nm Light Emitting Diode Based on Tin&#8208;Lead Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 25, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tin&#8208;lead based halide perovskite film with the 3&#8208;AMP passivate exhibits a significantly longer carrier lifetime of over 1 &#181;s compared to the neat films (0.43 &#181;s). The optimized tin&#8208;lead halide perovskite LEDs show a single emission peak at 988 nm and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8776;1.4%.









Abstract
In recent years, metal halide perovskite&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) have garnered significant attention as they display high quantum efficiency, good spectral tunability, and are expected to have low processing costs. When the peak emission wavelength is beyond 900&#8201;nm the interest is even higher because of the critical importance of this wavelength for biomedical imaging, night vision, and sensing. However, many challenges persist in fabricating these high&#8208;performance NIR LEDs, particularly for wavelengths above 950&#160;nm, which appear to be limited by low radiance and poor stability. In this study, 3&#8208;(aminomethyl) piperidinium (3&#8208;AMP) is employed as a bulk additive for a tin&#8208;lead halide perovskite. The 3&#8208;AMP passivated films exhibit a significantly longer carrier lifetime of over 1 &#181;s compared to neat films (0.43 &#181;s) or to those passivated with a perfluorinated aromatic mono&#8208;ammonium molecule (0.41 &#181;s). Our optimized tin&#8208;lead halide perovskite&#8208;based LEDs show a single emission peak at 988&#160;nm and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of &#8776;1.4%.

         <title>Advances in Spectro&#8208;Microscopy Methods and their Applications in the Characterization of Perovskite Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 25, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this perspective, &#160;current advanced spectro&#8208;microscopy methods that have been applied to perovskite materials are highlighted. Continued development of multimodal measurement techniques may be the key to covering the remaining parameter space to achieve both high spatial resolution and a deep penetration depth for a complete materials characterization.








Abstract
Perovskite materials are promising contenders as the active layer in light&#8208;harvesting and light&#8208;emitting applications if their long&#8208;term stability can be sufficiently increased. Chemical and structural engineering are shown to enhance long&#8208;term stability, but the increased complexity of the material system also leads to inhomogeneous functional properties across various length scales. Thus, scanning probe and high&#8208;resolution microscopy characterization techniques are needed to reveal the role of local defects and the results promise to act as the foundation for future device improvements. A look at the parameter space: technique&#8208;specific sample penetration depth versus probe size highlights a gap in current methods. High spatial resolution combined with a deep penetration depth is not yet achievable. However, multimodal measurement technique may be the key to covering this parameter space. In this perspective, current advanced spectro&#8208;microscopy methods which have been applied to perovskite materials are highlighted.

         <title>Metal Halide Perovskite LEDs for Visible Light Communication and Lasing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 25, June 26, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are expected to be key optoelectronics in next&#8208;generation technologies. Beyond traditional solid&#8208;state lighting and displays, the progress, ongoing challenges, and future perspectives for the applications of perovskite LEDs in visible light communication and lasing technologies are discussed.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites, known for their pure and tunable light emission, near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields, favorable charge transport properties, and excellent solution processability, have emerged as promising materials for large&#8208;area, high&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Over the past decade, significant advancements have been made in enhancing the efficiency, response speed, and operational stability of perovskite LEDs. These promising developments pave the way for a broad spectrum of applications extending beyond traditional solid&#8208;state lighting and displays to include visible light communication (VLC) and lasing applications. This perspective evaluates the current state of perovskite LEDs in those emerging areas, addresses the primary challenges currently impeding the development of perovskite&#8208;based VLC systems and laser diodes, and provides an optimistic outlook on the future realization of perovskite&#8208;based VLC and electrically pumped perovskite lasers.

         <title>Performance&#8208;Recoverable Closed&#8208;Loop Neuroprosthetic System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing and stretchable bilayer (SSB) electrode with spontaneous performance recovery consists of a nanomembrane (closely packed aligned Pt&#8208;coated Ag nanowires embedded in the self&#8208;healing polymer) and a nanocomposite (Pt&#8208;coated Ag flakes in the self&#8208;healing polymer). The SSB electrodes are used for wearable artificial mechanoreceptors and implantable peripheral neural interfaces in a closed&#8208;loop performance&#8208;recoverable neuroprosthetic system supported by a machine learning technique.








Abstract
Soft bioelectronics mechanically comparable to living tissues have driven advances in closed&#8208;loop neuroprosthetic systems for the recovery of sensory&#8208;motor functions. Despite notable progress in this field, critical challenges persist in achieving long&#8208;term stable closed&#8208;loop neuroprostheses, particularly in preventing uncontrolled drift in the electrical sensitivity and/or charge injection performance owing to material fatigue or mechanical damage. Additionally, the absence of an intelligent feedback loop has limited the ability to fully compensate for sensory&#8208;motor function loss in nervous systems. Here, a novel class of soft, closed&#8208;loop neuroprosthetic systems is presented for long&#8208;term operation, enabled by spontaneous performance recovery and machine&#8208;learning&#8208;driven correction to address the material fatigue inherent in chronic wear or implantation environments. Central to this innovation is the development of a tough, self&#8208;healing, and stretchable bilayer material with high conductivity and exceptional cyclic durability employed for robot&#8208;interface touch sensors and peripheral&#8208;nerve&#8208;adaptive electrodes. Furthermore, two central processing units, integrated in a prosthetic robot and an artificial brain, support closed&#8208;loop artificial sensory&#8208;motor operations, ensuring accurate sensing, decision&#8208;making, and feedback stimulation processes. Through these characteristics and seamless integration, our performance&#8208;recoverable closed&#8208;loop neuroprosthesis addresses challenges associated with chronic&#8208;material&#8208;fatigue&#8208;induced malfunctions, as demonstrated by successful in vivo under 4 weeks of implantation and/or mechanical damage.

     alt="Performance-Recoverable Closed-Loop Neuroprosthetic System"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A self-healing and stretchable bilayer (SSB) electrode with spontaneous performance recovery consists of a nanomembrane (closely packed aligned Pt-coated Ag nanowires embedded in the self-healing polymer) and a nanocomposite (Pt-coated Ag flakes in the self-healing polymer). The SSB electrodes are used for wearable artificial mechanoreceptors and implantable peripheral neural interfaces in a closed-loop performance-recoverable neuroprosthetic system supported by a machine learning technique.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft bioelectronics mechanically comparable to living tissues have driven advances in closed-loop neuroprosthetic systems for the recovery of sensory-motor functions. Despite notable progress in this field, critical challenges persist in achieving long-term stable closed-loop neuroprostheses, particularly in preventing uncontrolled drift in the electrical sensitivity and/or charge injection performance owing to material fatigue or mechanical damage. Additionally, the absence of an intelligent feedback loop has limited the ability to fully compensate for sensory-motor function loss in nervous systems. Here, a novel class of soft, closed-loop neuroprosthetic systems is presented for long-term operation, enabled by spontaneous performance recovery and machine-learning-driven correction to address the material fatigue inherent in chronic wear or implantation environments. Central to this innovation is the development of a tough, self-healing, and stretchable bilayer material with high conductivity and exceptional cyclic durability employed for robot-interface touch sensors and peripheral-nerve-adaptive electrodes. Furthermore, two central processing units, integrated in a prosthetic robot and an artificial brain, support closed-loop artificial sensory-motor operations, ensuring accurate sensing, decision-making, and feedback stimulation processes. Through these characteristics and seamless integration, our performance-recoverable closed-loop neuroprosthesis addresses challenges associated with chronic-material-fatigue-induced malfunctions, as demonstrated by successful in vivo under 4 weeks of implantation and/or mechanical damage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
This note responds to Schwartz and Hutchison's Comment. Differences appear to have arisen not in the experimental results themselves but in their interpretation: more extensive experiments allow one to distinguish between &#8220;true positive&#8221; and &#8220;false positive&#8221; results. Potential evidence of non&#8208;polaritonic effects in Schwartz and Hutchison's own work is identified. It is hoped that this work will encourage others to produce more systematic investigations of strong coupling.

A recent article by Barnes and co&#8208;workers reported an experimental re&#8208;evaluation of earlier work on photoisomerization reactions inside optical cavities under conditions of strong light&#8208;matter coupling. They correctly highlight the importance of controlling irradiation conditions from sample to sample where optical cavities are involved. This comment aims to emphasize the great lengths the original study went to ensure exactly this.








Abstract
Recently, an article by Barnes and co&#8208;workers reported an in&#8208;depth experimental re&#8208;evaluation of the earlier work on photoisomerization reactions inside optical cavities under conditions of strong light&#8208;matter coupling. That earlier work, which constituted the first demonstration of &#8216;polaritonic chemistry&#8217;, associated cavity&#8208;induced modifications of photoisomerization rates with the emergence of strong light&#8208;matter coupling (and the formation of polaritonic states). Barnes and co&#8208;workers instead found that cavity&#8208;induced changes in light absorption can account for changes in the photochemical reaction rates. While Barnes and co&#8208;workers correctly highlight the importance of controlling irradiation conditions from sample to sample where optical cavities are involved, this comment aims to emphasize the great length the original study went to ensure exactly this. The original experimental methods are summarized to point out the significant differences between them and those conducted by Barnes and co&#8208;workers. Furthermore, the importance of monochromatic photoexcitation at an isosbestic point rather than using broadband (UV through to IR) irradiation, as well as the careful control for photon flux reaching the molecular layer in all samples, as per the original work, is discussed. Further examination of important issues facing this new and developing domain of Physical Chemistry, is&#160;anticipated.

Direct Observation of Unidirectional Exciton Polaritons
In article number 2501669, Guangwei Hu, Qing Zhang, Yuanjie Yang, and co&#8208;workers report direct nano&#8208;imaging of spin&#8208;orbital coupling induced unidirectional exciton&#8208;polaritons in van der Waals semiconductors. Via shining spin photons into the tip of a scattering&#8208;type SNOM, the exciton&#8208;polaritons can be transported to one preferred spin&#8208;controlled direction and mapped, promising optical switching, nanoscale light manipulation, polaritonic circuits, and other nanotechnologies.

Glycated ECM Derived Carbon Dots
The Glycated ECM, once fertile soil for the tumor &#8220;tree&#8221;, becomes tumor&#8208;suppressing carbon dots, causing the tree to wither and the ecosystem to collapse. This transformation mirrors the impermanence in Buddhist &#8220;Four Signs of Decay and Growth,&#8221; where decay births healing. In this pathological microenvironment, destruction can be restructured into healing, where science and philosophy converge.

These characteristics paved the way for developing novel flexible electronic devices and products. This review provides an overview of the current status and future potential of LM&#8208;based EM functional materials. It highlights the latest progress in LM&#8208;based materials for applications such as EMI shielding, EM&#8208;wave absorption, and wireless communication (antennas). Finally, the primary obstacles of LM&#8208;based EM functional materials are discussed and revealed potential directions for their advancement. Overall, the current research on LM&#8208;based EM functional materials indicates that they have great potential to promote the development of EM functional materials, thus providing new possibilities for the advancement of flexible electronic products.

         <title>Micro&#8208; and Nano&#8208;Bots for Infection Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a strategic vision for integrating micro&#8208; and nanobots in the pipeline for infection diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. To develop these robots as a practical solution for infection management, their design principles are clarified based on their propulsion mechanisms and then categorized infection management domains based on usage scenarios.








Abstract
Medical micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;bots (MMBs and MNBs) have attracted a lot of attention owing to their precise motion for accessing difficult&#8208;to&#8208;reach areas in the body. These emerging tools offer the promise of non&#8208;invasive diagnostics and therapeutics for a wide range of ailments. Here, it is highlighted how MMBs and MNBs can revolutionize infection management. The latest applications of MMBs and MNBs are explored for infection prevention, including their use as accurate, minimally invasive surgeons&#160;and diagnosis, where they function as sensitive and rapid biosensors or carriers for contrast agents for real&#8208;time imaging of infected tissue. Further, the&#160;applications are outlined in treatment serving as anti&#8208;biofilm agents and smart carriers for antibiotics and anti&#8208;infective biologics. The current challenges in designing MMBs and MNBs are highlighted for overcoming immune barriers, moving to deep infected tissue, and swimming in low Reynolds numbers and discuss mitigating strategies. Finally, as a future perspective, the potential advantages of multi&#8208;drive propulsion, bioinspired, and artificial&#8208;intelligence&#8208;trained MMBs and MNBs are discussed, with a special focus on challenges and opportunities for their commercialization.

         <title>Multiple Functional Engineering Strategies and Active Site Identification in Ru&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Catalytic Conversion Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive analysis of engineering modification strategies for ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based catalysts, highlighting their critical role in optimizing electronic structures and surface properties to enhance electrocatalytic conversion. Furthermore, it emphasizes the integration of multiple engineering strategies aimed at improving catalytic performance, while also addressing key commercialization challenges.








Abstract
Electrochemical conversion has been regarded as an ideal technology for achieving clean and sustainable energy, showing significant promise in addressing the increasingly serious energy crisis and environmental pollution. Ru&#8208;containing electrocatalysts (RUCE) outperform other precious metals due to elevated intrinsic activity and superior cost&#8208;effectiveness, developing into a promising candidate for electrochemical conversion reactions. A significant challenge in the field of catalyst discovery lies in its heavy reliance on empirical methods, rather than approaches that are rooted in rational design principles. This review first concentrates on the catalytically active sites and critical factors governing catalytic activity and performance durability. Then, a comprehensive summary of multifunctional modification strategies ranging from nanoscale to atomic scale is explored to control the structure and improve the performance. By unveiling the roles of each component in the modified RUCE at the atomic level, their intrinsic active sites are identified and discussed to establish the structure&#8208;performance relationship of the catalysts. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of Ru&#8208;based materials for electrochemical hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen conversion reactions are presented to inspire further efforts toward understanding RUCE to meet the ever&#8208;growing demand in the future.

         <dc:description>
This review charts the transformative potential of next&#8208;generation nano&#8208;flexible embolic agents in redefining TACE for HCC. By dissecting innovations in tunable coagulation dynamics, real&#8208;time imaging integration and hypoxia&#8208;responsive drug delivery, it unveils how to overcome the pitfalls of conventional therapies. The strategies extend to synergies with immunotherapy and energy&#8208;conversion strategies, while confronting scalability and regulatory hurdles critical for clinical adoption.








Abstract
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) remains the gold standard for treating intermediate&#8208;stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), yet faces great challenges in overcoming tumor heterogeneity, hypoxia&#8208;induced angiogenesis, and metastatic progression. The development of advanced flexible embolization materials marks a revolutionary leap in interventional therapy, offering opportunities to revolutionize embolization precision, drug delivery kinetics, and tumor microenvironment modulation. This comprehensive review systematically examines the paradigm shift toward next&#8208;generation TACE technology, emphasizing the limitations of conventional approaches and innovations in flexible embolic agents. A detailed discussion of next&#8208;generation nano&#8208;flexible embolic systems is presented, emphasizing their unique coagulation dynamics, real&#8208;time imaging capabilities, and therapeutic precision. The review delves into groundbreaking TACE strategies integrating hypoxia modulation, energy conversion therapeutics, and sophisticated tumor microenvironment engineering. Clinical translation aspects are thoroughly explored, including large&#8208;scale trial outcomes, vascular recanalization dynamics, and patient&#8208;specific treatment optimization. Looking forward, key frontiers in the field is identified: intelligent nanocomposite systems, synergistic combination therapies, and precision medicine approaches tailored to individual tumor biology. This work not only objectively evaluates current progress but also charts future research priorities, aiming to transform TACE from a palliative intervention to a precision medicine platform and ultimately reshaping the landscape of HCC treatment and patient care.

         <title>Solid Polymer Electrolytes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Different Designs Dependent on Their Interaction with Sulfur Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different designs between the strategies used for solid polymer electrolyte (SPE)&#8208;based lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) and those from SPE based Li batteries and liquid electrolyte (LE)&#8208;based LSBs caused by the unique interactions of SPEs with S cathodes are successively reviewed. Subsequently, several challenges that need to be urgently addressed and the future prospects of SPE&#8208;containing LSBs are discussed.









Abstract
Nonflammable and flexible solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are widely studied to improve the safety of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Studies on SPE&#8208;based LSBs primarily focus on addressing issues stemming from poor SPE properties, Li dendrites, and &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of polysulfides. Currently, strategies from SPE&#8208;based lithium batteries (without sulfur cathodes) and liquid electrolyte (LE)&#8208;based LSBs (without SPEs) are the most commonly employed approaches to tackle above issues. These strategies are designed without taking into account the problems caused by the coexistence of SPEs and sulfur cathodes, resulting in SPE&#8208;based LSBs exhibiting significantly inferior performance than liquid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based LSBs. Therefore, the strategies for SPE&#8208;based LSBs necessitate different designs. However, no reviews have focused on the aforementioned differences and analyzing their corresponding causes thus far, which is unfavorable for the development of this field. Herein, the emerging advances in SPE&#8208;based LSBs are comprehensively reviewed. In particular, for the first time, the different designs and their corresponding causes are comprehensively discussed. These causes include the high adsorption strength of SPEs with polysulfides, corrosion of polysulfides to barrier layers, deterioration of the ionic conductivity of SPEs, and defective interfaces between cathodes and SPEs. Finally, several pressing challenges and future prospects for the field are discussed.

         <title>Unlocking the Sodium Storage Potential in Fluorophosphate Cathodes: Electrostatic Interaction Lowering Versus Structural Disordering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na+&#8208;density and degree of order in Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cathode are regulated via divalent cation doping to compare the importance of electrostatic interaction and Na+&#8208;ordering on the Na+ diffusivity and storage property. A higher Mg2+&#8208;doping concentration at both Na&#8208; and V&#8208;site, though incorporating extra Na+ and higher repulsive forces, contributes to a higher structural disorder, which reveals a higher throughout Na+ diffusivity with a superior energy/power density.








Abstract
Electrostatic interaction and Na+&#8208;ordering are identified as two possible kinetic constraints in determining the Na+ diffusivity in Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF), a representative polyanionic&#8208;based cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. As both factors are compositionally related and intertwined, isolating individual factors to pinpoint the dominant one is essential yet challenging for achieving the full electrochemical potential of NVPOF. Herein, NVPOF doped with Zn2+ or Mg2+ is developed to study the relative influence of the electrostatic interaction and structural disordering on the Na+ diffusivity and thus Na+ storage performance. The crystal structural analysis and theoretical modeling reveal that a limited amount (0.6 at% of Na) of Zn2+ doped at the Na&#8208;site with Na&#8208;vacancies created, while a ten&#8208;fold higher Mg2+ doped at both the Na&#8208; and V&#8208;site, which introduces additional Na+ for charge compensation. As a result, compared to the Zn2+ doped counterpart, the Mg2+ doped NVPOF cathode shows a Na+ diffusivity up to 3 times higher even encountering larger repulsive forces, and a much enhanced Na+ storage property. This work demonstrates the superiority of regulating the degree of order in the framework to address the defect formation energy of NVPOF, which is realized via doping and can be extendable to other polyanionic&#8208;based cathode materials.

         <title>Achieving &gt;23% Efficiency Perovskite Solar Minimodules with Surface Conductive Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study addresses a critical challenge in the commercialization of perovskite solar modules by reducing photovoltage loss through the in situ formation of a surface conductive coordination polymer at the surface/interface of the perovskite film.








Abstract
Despite the reported high efficiencies of small&#8208;area perovskite photovoltaic cells, the deficiency in large&#8208;area modules has impeded the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics. Enhancing the surface/interface conductivity and carrier&#8208;transport in polycrystalline perovskite films presents significant potential for boosting the efficiency of perovskite solar modules (PSMs) by mitigating voltage losses. This is particularly critical for multi&#8208;series connected sub&#8208;cell modules, where device resistance significantly impacts performance compared to small&#8208;area cells. Here, an effective approach is reported for decreasing photovoltage loss through surface/interface modulation of perovskite film with a surface conductive coordination polymer. With post&#8208;treatment of meso&#8208;tetra pyridine porphyrin on perovskite film, PbI2 on perovskite film reacts with pyridine units in porphyrins to generate an iso&#8208;structural 2D coordination polymer with a layered surface conductivity as high as 1.14 &#215; 102 S&#160;m&#8722;1, due to the effect of surface structure reconstruction. Modified perovskite film exhibits greatly increased surface/interface conductivity. The champion PSM obtains a record efficiency up to 23.39% (certified 22.63% with an aperture area of 11.42 cm2) featuring only 0.33&#8208;volt voltage loss. Such a modification also leads to substantially improved operational device stability.

         <title>A Salidroside&#8208;Based Radiosensitizer Regulates the Nrf2/ROS Pathway for X&#8208;Ray Activated Synergistic Cancer Precise Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel radiosensitizer integrating traditional Chinese medicine compound salidroside, Cu2+, and &#8226;OH activated FL molecules is developed, which achieves enhanced radiosensitization effect and promotes CDT efficacy monitored by NIR&#8208;II FL imaging. Salidroside blocks cells in the G2/M phase with the highest radiosensitivity and amplifies ROS levels, which provides sufficient chemical fuel for Cu+&#8208;mediated CDT to generate more &#8226;OH.








Abstract
The hypoxic microenvironment and radioresistance of tumor cells, as well as the delay in efficacy evaluation, significantly limit the effect of clinical radiotherapy. Therefore, developing effective radiosensitizers with monitoring of tumor response is of great significance for precise radiotherapy. Herein, a novel radiosensitizer (term as: SCuFs) is developed, consisting of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) compounds salidroside, Cu2+, and hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) activated second near&#8208;infrared window fluorescence (NIR&#8208;II FL) molecules, which make the radiosensitization effect and boosted chemodynamic therapy (CDT) efficacy. The overexpressed glutathione in the tumor induces the SCuFs dissociation, allowing deep penetration of the drug to the whole tumor region. After X&#8208;ray irradiation, salidroside inhibits the Nuclear factor erythroid 2&#8208;like 2 (Nrf2)protein expression and blocks cells in the G2/M phase with the highest radiosensitivity, which amplifies the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation to exacerbate DNA damage, thus achieving radiosensitization. Meanwhile, the upregulated ROS provides sufficient chemical fuel for Cu+&#8208;mediated CDT to produce more &#8226;OH. NIR&#8208;II FL imaging can monitor the &#8226;OH changes during the therapy process, confirming the radiosensitization effect and CDT process related to &#8226;OH. This study not only achieves effective radiosensitization and cascaded ROS&#8208;mediated CDT efficacy, but also provides a useful tool for monitoring therapeutic efficacy, showing great prospects for clinical application.

         <title>2D Indium&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Rich ZnIn2S4 Nanocatalysts for Sonocatalytic Cancer Suppression by Boosting Cancer&#8208;Cell Pyroptosis</title>

This work reports on the engineering of distinctive 2D ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets with interlayer indium vacancies for highly efficient sonocatalytic lung cancer treatment.








Abstract
Sonocatalytic therapy is gaining interest for its non&#8208;invasive nature, precise control, and excellent tissue penetration, making it a promising approach for treating malignant tumors. While defect engineering enhances electron and hole separation to boost reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, challenges in constructing effective hole traps compared to electron traps severely limit ROS production. In this study, 2D ZnIn2S4&#8208;VIn nanosheets enriched are rationally designed with In vacancies for the efficient capture of electrons and holes, which has achieved substantial sonocatalytic performance in suppressing tumor growth. Compared to pristine ZnIn2S4 nanosheets, which possess a periodic electrostatic potential inherent in their structure, In vacancies effectively disrupt this potential field, promote the simultaneous separation and migration of charge carriers, and inhibit their recombination, thereby boosting ROS production and inducing tumor cell pyroptosis via the ROS&#8208;NLRP3&#8208;caspase&#8208;1&#8208;GSDMD pathway under ultrasound (US) irradiation. Furthermore, both pristine ZnIn2S4 and ZnIn2S4&#8208;VIn nanosheets exhibited remarkable biocompatibility. In vitro and in vivo antineoplastic experiments demonstrate that this sonocatalytic approach effectively promotes tumor elimination, underscoring the critical importance of defect&#8208;engineered optimization in sonocatalytic tumor therapy.

         <title>A Charge&#8208;Coupled Phototransistor Enabling Synchronous Dynamic and Static Image Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208;coupled phototransistor is presented that uses dual photosensitive capacitors to provide gate voltage to a single transistor channel, enabling simultaneous capture of dynamic and static information, surpassing existing DAVIS technology. This charge&#8208;coupled phototransistor paves the way for the development of high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;power, and highly integrated machine vision technology.








Abstract
Emerging machine vision applications require efficient detection of both dynamic events and static grayscale information within visual scenes. Current dynamic vision and active pixel sensors (DAVIS) technology integrates event&#8208;driven vision sensors and active pixel sensors within single pixels. However, the complex multi&#8208;component pixel architecture, typically requiring 15&#8211;50 transistors, limits integration density, increases power consumption, and complicates clock synchronization. Here, a charge&#8208;coupled phototransistor is presented that uses dual photosensitive capacitors to provide gate voltage to a single transistor channel, enabling simultaneous capture of dynamic and static information, surpassing existing DAVIS technology. Under illumination, both top and bottom gates generate photogenerated electrons through a charge&#8208;coupling effect; electrons in the top gate are blocked by a thick dielectric layer, producing a stable current change for static grayscale detection, while electrons in the bottom gate tunnel through a thin dielectric layer, creating transient current spikes for dynamic event detection. This device demonstrates a dynamic range of 120&#160;dB and a response time of 15 &#181;s, comparable to traditional DAVIS pixels, while significantly reducing power consumption to 10&#160;pW and overcoming clock synchronization issues. This charge&#8208;coupled phototransistor paves the way for the development of high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;power, and highly integrated machine vision technology.

         <title>Accurate Thermal Resection of Atomically Precise Copper Clusters to Achieve Near&#8208;IR Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel copper&#8208;sulfur&#8208;nitrogen cluster Cu8SN is synthesized by using a strong anchoring ability protective ligand (2&#8208;mercaptopyrimidine) and a relatively weak monodentate tert&#8208;butyl mercaptan ligand. Then, a precise thermal&#8208;resection strategy is applied to only peel the targeted weak ligands off, which induces a structural transformation of the initial Cu8SN cluster into a new and more stable Cu&#8211;S&#8211;N cluster (Cu8SN&#8211;T). Cu8SN&#8211;T exhibits greatly enhanced light&#8208;harvesting abilities and full&#8208;spectrum responsive overall CO2 photoreduction with &#8776;100% CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO selectivity.









Abstract
Atomically precise copper clusters are desirable as catalysts for elaborating the structure&#8211;activity relationships. The challenge, however, lies in their tendency to sinter when protective ligands are removed, resulting in the destruction of the structural integrity of the model system. Herein, a copper&#8208;sulfur&#8208;nitrogen cluster [Cu8(StBu)4(PymS)4] (denoted as Cu8SN) is synthesized by using a mixed ligand approach with strong chelating 2&#8208;mercaptopyrimidine (PymSH) ligands and relatively weak monodentate tert&#8208;butyl mercaptan ligands. A precise thermal&#8208;resection strategy is applied to selectively peel only the targeted weak ligands off, which induces a structural transformation of the initial Cu8 cluster into a new and more stable Cu&#8211;S&#8211;N cluster [Cu8(S)2(PymS)4] (denoted as Cu8SN&#8208;T). The residual bridging S2&#8722; within the metal core forms asymmetric Cu&#8208;S species with a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) response, which endows Cu8SN&#8208;T with the capability for full&#8208;spectrum responsive CO2 photoreduction, achieving a &#8776;100% CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO selectivity. Especially for NIR&#8208;driven CO2 reduction, it has a CO evolution of 42.5 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 under &#955; &gt; 780 nm. Importantly, this work represents the first NIR light&#8208;responsive copper cluster for efficient CO2 photoreduction and opens an avenue for the precise manipulation of metal cluster structures via a novel thermolysis strategy to develop unprecedented functionalized metal cluster materials.

         <title>Charge Density Wave and Ferromagnetism in Intercalated CrSBr</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft chemical intercalation of the van der Waals magnetic semiconductor CrSBr induces a quasi&#8208;1D charge density wave (CDW) phase. The combination of this CDW with ferromagnetism from a spin&#8208;polarized band generates an unusual coupling of the charge and spin modulations in the intercalated material.








Abstract
In materials with 1D electronic bands, electron&#8211;electron interactions can produce intriguing quantum phenomena, including spin&#8208;charge separation and charge density waves (CDW). Most of these systems, however, are non&#8208;magnetic, motivating a search for anisotropic materials where the coupling of charge and spin may affect emergent quantum states. Here, chemical intercalation of the van der Waals magnetic semiconductor CrSBr yields Li0.17(2)(tetrahydrofuran)0.26(3)CrSBr, which possesses an electronically driven quasi&#8208;1D CDW with an onset temperature above room temperature. Concurrently, electron doping increases the magnetic ordering temperature from 132 to 200 K and switches its interlayer magnetic coupling from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic. The spin&#8208;polarized nature of the anisotropic bands that give rise to this CDW enforces an intrinsic coupling of charge and spin. The coexistence and interplay of ferromagnetism and charge modulation in this exfoliatable material provide a promising platform for studying tunable quantum phenomena across a range of temperatures and thicknesses.

         <title>Flexible Tunable&#8208;Plasticity Synaptic Transistors for Mimicking Dynamic Cognition and Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible tunable&#8208;plasticity synaptic transistor (TST) is developed using indium gallium zinc oxide as a channel and a hybrid polyimide and Al2O3 layer as dielectric. The TST exhibits a transition from short&#8208;term plasticity to long&#8208;term plasticity by adjusting stimulus amplitude. It also enables neural networks with 94.1% recognition and 4&#8208;bit reservoir computing, laying the foundation for intelligent and efficient computing systems.








Abstract
Inspired by biological systems, neuromorphic computing can process extensive data and complex tasks more efficiently than traditional architectures. Artificial synaptic devices, serving as fundamental components in neuromorphic computing, needto closely mimic synaptic characteristics and construct neural network computing systems. However, most existing multifunctional synapse devices are structurally complex and lack tunability, making them unsuitable for building smarter computing systems. In this work, a flexible tunable&#8208;plasticity synaptic transistor (TST) is realized with memory modulation and neuromorphic computing capabilities by using indium gallium zinc oxide as channel and a hybrid layer of polyimide and Al2O3 as dielectric. The TST exhibits a novel transition from short&#8208;term plasticity to long&#8208;term one by adjusting stimulus amplitude, mirroring dynamic human memory and forgetting behaviors across various scenarios. A neural network system with low non&#8208;linearity and a wide range of conductance variations is constructed, and it demonstrates a 94.1% recognition rate on classical datasets. A reservoir computing system for 4&#8208;bit coding is also developed, which significantly reduces computational complexity and network size without sacrificing recognition accuracy. The devices and the system work as the foundation of more intelligent and more efficient computing systems.

         <title>Flexible 3D Kirigami Probes for In Vitro and In Vivo Neural Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A customizable and scalable approach to fabricate flexible 3D kirigami microelectrode arrays (MEAs) featuring up to 128 shanks, including surface and penetrating electrodes designed to interact with the 3D space of neural tissue, is presented. The 3D kirigami MEAs are successfully deployed in several neural applications, both in vitro and in vivo, and identified spatially dependent electrophysiological activity patterns.








Abstract
3D microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are gaining popularity as brain&#8211;machine interfaces and platforms for studying electrophysiological activity. Interactions with neural tissue depend on the electrochemical, mechanical, and spatial features of the recording platform. While planar or protruding 2D MEAs are limited in their ability to capture neural activity across layers, existing 3D platforms still require advancements in manufacturing scalability, spatial resolution, and tissue integration. In this work, a customizable, scalable, and straightforward approach to fabricate flexible 3D kirigami MEAs containing both surface and penetrating electrodes, designed to interact with the 3D space of neural tissue, is presented. These novel probes feature up to 512 electrodes distributed across 128 shanks in a single flexible device, with shank heights reaching up to 1&#160;mm. The 3D kirigami MEAs are successfully deployed in several neural applications, both in vitro and in vivo, and identified spatially dependent electrophysiological activity patterns. Flexible 3D kirigami MEAs are therefore a powerful tool for large&#8208;scale electrical sampling of complex neural tissues while improving tissue integration and offering enhanced capabilities for analyzing neural disorders and disease models where high spatial resolution is required.

         <title>Green Fabrication of Sulfonium&#8208;Containing Bismuth Materials for High&#8208;Sensitivity X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
[(CH3CH2)3S]6Bi8I30 and [[(CH3CH2)3S]AgBiI5 are introduced as novel X&#8208;ray detector materials with exceptional sensitivity and low detection limits. Produced via scalable, green synthesis, they remain highly durable after 9 months of storage and continuous X&#8208;ray use, setting a new benchmark for medical imaging and outperforming many existing and emerging technologies.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials based on lead and bismuth have recently been proposed as novel X&#8208; and gamma&#8208;ray detectors for medical imaging, non&#8208;destructive testing, and security, due to their high atomic numbers and facile preparation compared to traditional materials like amorphous selenium and Cd(Zn)Te. However, challenges related to device operation, excessively high dark currents, and long&#8208;term stability have delayed commercialization. Here, two novel semiconductors incorporating stable sulfonium cations are presented, [(CH3CH2)3S]6Bi8I30 and [(CH3CH2)3S]AgBiI5, synthesized via solvent&#8208;free ball milling and fabricated into dense polycrystalline pellets using cold isostatic compression, two techniques that can easily be upscaled, for X&#8208;ray detection application. The fabricated detectors exhibit exceptional sensitivities (14&#160;100&#8211;15&#160;190&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2) and low detection limits (90&#160;nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1 for [(CH3CH2)3S]6Bi8I30 and 78&#160;nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1 for [(CH3CH2)3S]AgBiI5), far surpassing current commercial detectors. Notably, they maintain performance after 9 months of ambient storage. The findings highlight [(CH3CH2)3S]6Bi8I30 and [(CH3CH2)3S]AgBiI5 as scalable, cost&#8208;effective and highly stable alternatives to traditional semiconductor materials, offering great potential as X&#8208;ray detectors in medical and security applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells via Nucleation and Crystallization Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pumping rate&#8208;controllable strategy regulates nucleation and crystallization in Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites during vacuum&#8208;flash&#8208;assisted solution processing. This approach enables additive&#8208;free, antisolvent&#8208;free fabrication of high&#8208;quality films, achieving &gt;21% and &gt;19% efficiency for 0.08 and 1 cm2 devices, respectively, with uniformity over 6 &#215; 6 cm2. It also delivers 27.5% efficiency for all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells, ensuring scalability and reliability.








Abstract
The rapid crystallization of mixed tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites and their dependence on antisolvent processes limit the development of large&#8208;area Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Vacuum&#8208;flash&#8208;assisted solution processing (VASP) has emerged as a promising technique for large&#8208;scale fabrication. However, achieving consistent control over crystallization parameters remains a limitation. To address this, a pumping rate&#8208;controllable strategy is introduced, fitted from cavity pressure and time, to control nucleation and crystallization in Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films. By tuning the pressure rate, the solvent volatilization rate of the perovskite wet film is optimized, enabling controlled nucleation and crystallization dynamics. This allows for the scalable fabrication of high&#8208;quality FA0.7MA0.3Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 films without additives to aid crystallization, achieving power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 21% and 19% for Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs at 0.08 cm2 and 1 cm2, respectively, the additives&#8208;free and antisolvent&#8208;free highest records. This further demonstrates that the uniformity and reproducibility of pumping rate control on a large 6 &#215; 6 cm2 substrate. The approach is also applicable to wide bandgap PSCs, normal bandgap PSCs, and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells, delivering a PCE &gt;27% for the antisolvent&#8208;free and additive&#8208;free tandem device. This work establishes a scalable and versatile approach for developing large&#8208;area Sn&#8208;Pb and all&#8208;perovskite tandem&#160;devices, advancing the field toward practical applications.

The approach is also applicable to wide bandgap PSCs, normal bandgap PSCs, and all-perovskite tandem solar cells, delivering a PCE &amp;gt;27% for the antisolvent-free and additive-free tandem device. This work establishes a scalable and versatile approach for developing large-area Sn-Pb and all-perovskite tandem&#160;devices, advancing the field toward practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Neuransistor with Excitatory and Inhibitory Neuronal Behaviors for Liquid State Machine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The neuransistor integrates hybrid excitatory and inhibitory dynamics, enabling liquid state machine implementation. It operates via charge trapping in a two&#8208;dimensional electron electron gas (2DEG)/TiO2&#8722;x structure and features a three&#8208;terminal design for efficient masking functionality. Simulations demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting temporal signals, emphasizing its role as a robust reservoir for neuromorphic computing and advancing biologically inspired applications.








Abstract
A liquid state machine (LSM) is a spiking neural network model inspired by biological neural network dynamics designed to process time&#8208;varying inputs. In the LSM, maintaining a proper excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance among neurons is essential for ensuring network stability and generating rich temporal dynamics for accurate data processing. In this study, a &#8220;neuransistor&#8221; is proposed that implements the E/I neurons in a single device, allowing for the hardware implementation of the LSM. The device features a three&#8208;terminal transistor structure embodying TiO2&#8722;x/Al2O3 bi&#8208;layer, providing a two&#8208;dimensional electron electron gas (2DEG) channel at their interface. This device demonstrates hybrid excitatory and inhibitory dynamics with respect to the applied gate bias polarity, originating from the charge trapping/detrapping between the 2DEG and TiO2&#8722;x layers. Additionally, the three&#8208;terminal configuration allows masking capabilities by selecting terminal biases, realizing a reservoir behavior with superior reliability and durability. Its use in an LSM reservoir for time&#8208;series data prediction tasks using the Henon dataset and a chaotic equation solver for the Lorenz attractor is demonstrated. This benchmarking indicates that the LSM exhibits enhanced performance and efficiency compared to the conventional echo state network, underscoring its potential for advanced applications in reservoir computing.

         <title>Enthalpy&#8208;Driven Molecular Engineering Enables High&#8208;Performance Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Long Life Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a co&#8208;polymerization approach using 1,1,1&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2,3&#8208;epoxypropane to integrate lithium nitrate into poly&#8208;DOL&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes. The resulting electrolyte exhibits high ionic conductivity (2.23&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1), exceptional Coulombic efficiency (99.34%) in Li|Cu cell, and long&#8208;term stability (2000 cycles in Li|LFP cells). Scale&#8208;up tests in Li|NCM811 cells show 94.4% capacity retention over 60 cycles, offering a promising path for high&#8208;performance, in situ polymerized batteries.








Abstract
The advancement of lithium metal batteries toward their theoretical energy density potential remains constrained by safety and performance issues inherent to liquid electrolytes. Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (QSSEs) based on poly&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (poly&#8208;DOL) represent a promising development, yet challenges in achieving satisfactory Coulombic efficiency and long&#8208;term stability have impeded their practical implementation. While lithium nitrate addition can enhance efficiency, its incorporation results in prohibitively slow polymerization rates spanning several months. In this work, high&#8208;polymerization&#8208;enthalpy 1,1,1&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2,3&#8208;epoxypropane is introduced as a co&#8208;polymerization promoter, successfully integrating lithium nitrate into poly&#8208;DOL&#8208;based QSSEs. The resulting electrolyte demonstrates exceptional performance with 2.23&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 of ionic conductivity at 25&#160;&#176;C, a Coulombic efficiency of 99.34% in Li|Cu cells, and stable lithium metal interfaces sustained through 1300 h of symmetric cell cycling. This co&#8208;polymerization approach also suppresses poly&#8208;DOL crystallization, enabling Li|LiFePO4 cells to maintain stability beyond 2000 cycles at 1C. Scale&#8208;up validation in a &#8776;1&#160;Ah Li|NCM811 pouch cell achieves 94.4% capacity retention over 60 cycles. This strategy establishes a new pathway for developing high&#8208;performance, in situ polymerized quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries for practical energy storage applications.

&lt;p&gt;The advancement of lithium metal batteries toward their theoretical energy density potential remains constrained by safety and performance issues inherent to liquid electrolytes. Quasi-solid-state electrolytes (QSSEs) based on poly-1,3-dioxolane (poly-DOL) represent a promising development, yet challenges in achieving satisfactory Coulombic efficiency and long-term stability have impeded their practical implementation. While lithium nitrate addition can enhance efficiency, its incorporation results in prohibitively slow polymerization rates spanning several months.

         <title>NASICON&#8208;NaV0.25Al0.25Nb1.5(PO4)3/C: A High&#8208;Rate and Robust Anode for Fast Charging and Long&#8208;Life Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

The NaV0.25Al0.25Nb1.5(PO4)3/C (NaVAlNb/C) anode offers a transformative solution for fast&#8208;charging sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Paired with a Na4V2(PO4)3 cathode in a full cell, it achieves 6&#8208;min rechargeability and a long cycle life of over 3000 cycles. This work underscores the significance of local structure modification along with carbon&#8208;coating and particle downsizing to advance NASICON&#8208;based anodes for high&#8208;performance energy storage.









Abstract
Nb&#8208;based NAtrium Super Ionic CONductor (NASICON) frameworks (e.g., Nb2(PO4)3 and Na1.5V0.5Nb1.5(PO4)3) are emerging as the attractive Na&#8208;ion anodes due to their lower intercalation voltage (&#8776;1.4&#8211;1.2&#160;V vs Na+/Na0) and higher storage capacities (&#8776;140&#8211;160 mAh g&#8722;1). However, their practical realization is limited by moderate cycle life and rate performances. In this work, a carbon&#8208;coated NASICON&#8208;NaV0.25Al0.25Nb1.5(PO4)3 (NaVAlNb/C) anode is unveiled for fast charging Na&#8208;ion batteries. The incorporation of Al3+ increases covalency of NASICON and creates disordered Na&#8208;ion sublattice as observed by X&#8208;ray diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements. Besides, the carbon&#8208;coating and particle downsizing produces facile electron and ion percolation network. Accordingly, the NaVAlNb/C anode renders extraordinary rate performances (80 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20C) with longer cycling stability (95.2% retention after 5000 cycles at 10C). Climbing image nudged elastic band calculations reveal reduced Na&#8208;ion migration barrier (202 meV) for NaVAlNb/C. Most importantly, a full Na&#8208;ion cell based on Na4V2(PO4)3 cathode and NaVAlNb/C anode is demonstrated with a high&#8208;power density (6493&#160;W kg&#8722;1) and long&#8208;cycle life (3000 cycles at 20C), which are far excellent compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NASICON&#8208;based cells. This work demonstrates the significance of carbon coating and chemical tuning to tailor high&#8208;rate NASICON anodes, which can produce fast&#8208;charging Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Glycated ECM Derived Carbon Dots Inhibit Tumor Vasculogenic Mimicry by Disrupting RAGE Nuclear Translocation and Its Interaction With HMGB1</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, AGEs derived is found from glycated ECM significantly promote tumor growth and VM formation through the RAGE&#8208;HMGB1&#8208;SNAI2 axis. However, carbon dots (egCDs) derived from glycated ECM can competitively bind to RAGE, promoting its lysosomal degradation and inhibiting this process. This finding reveals the transformation of pathogenic substances into therapeutic targeting carriers after carbonization, reversing disease&#8208;driving factors.








Abstract
This study investigates the role of advanced glycation end&#8208;products (AGEs) in tumor vasculogenic mimicry (VM). Using high&#8208;sugar diet animal models and glycated extracellular matrix (ECM) ex vivo models, AGEs derived is demonstrated from glycated ECM significantly enhanced tumor growth and VM formation. However, carbon dots (egCDs) derived from glycated ECM effectively inhibit tumor growth and VM formation in this glycated microenvironment. Mechanistic studies show that AGEs from glycated ECM bind to the Receptor of Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE) receptors on tumor cells, promoting RAGE nuclear translocation and binding with high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which increases the transcription of Snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (SNAI2), thereby driving VM formation. However, egCDs competitively bind to RAGE, promoting its lysosomal degradation and blocking VM formation induced by the RAGE&#8208;HMGB1&#8208;SNAI2 axis. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that egCDs can target RAGE and promote its lysosomal degradation to block VM formation induced by glycated ECM. This finding not only reveals the transformation of glycated ECM from a pro&#8208;VM factor to an anti&#8208;VM therapeutic agent after carbonization, but also provides a theoretical basis for the innovative strategy of &#8220;reconstructing pathogenic substances into carbon dots to reverse disease&#8208;driving factors into therapeutic targeting carriers&#8221;.

         <title>Polymer Microarray with Tailored Morphologies through Condensed Droplet Polymerization for High&#8208;Resolution Optical Imaging Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Study introduces condensed droplet polymerization (CDP) technology, enabling the fabrication of polymeric micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;dome arrays (PDAs) with tunable geometric properties. By manipulating polymerization kinetics, CDP allows for the rapid manufacturing of PDAs with specific sizes, radii of curvature, and surface densities. The research explores the optical properties of PDAs as nanolenses, enhancing high&#8208;resolution optical imaging capabilities.








Abstract
Nature&#8208;inspired functional surfaces with micro&#8208; and nanoscale features have garnered interest for potential applications in optics, imaging, and sensing. Traditional fabrication methods, such as lithography and self&#8208;assembly, face limitations in versatility, scalability, and morphology control. This study introduces an innovative technology, condensed droplet polymerization (CDP), for fabricating polymeric micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;dome arrays (PDAs) with readily tunable geometric properties&#8212;a challenging feat for conventional methods. The CDP process leverages free&#8208;radical polymerization in condensed monomer droplets, allowing rapid production of PDAs with targeted sizes, radii of curvature, and surface densities by manipulating a key synthesis parameter: the temperature of a filament array that activates initiators. This work systematically unravels its effects on polymerization kinetics, viscoelastic properties of the polymerizing droplets, and geometric characteristics of the PDAs. Utilizing in situ digital microscope, this work reveals the morphological evolution of the PDAs during the process. The resulting PDAs exhibit distinct optical properties, including magnification that enables high&#8208;resolution imaging beyond the diffraction limit of conventional microscopes. This work demonstrates the ability to magnify and focus light, enhancing imaging of subwavelength structures and biological specimens. This work advances the understanding of polymerization mechanisms in nano&#8208;sized reactors (i.e., droplets) and paves the way for developing compact optical imaging and sensing technologies.

         <title>Asymmetric Self&#8208;Assembly of Colloidal Superstructures in Nested Transient Emulsion Aerosols</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nested transient emulsion aerosol system is presented for the asymmetric self&#8208;assembly of colloidal nanoparticles into superstructures with anisotropic morphologies. These nested transient emulsion aerosols break the spherical symmetry associated with conventional emulsion droplets, enabling the production of anisotropic superstructures with potential applications previously considered unattainable.








Abstract
Emulsions are versatile and robust platforms for colloidal self&#8208;assembly, but their ability to create complex and functional superstructures is hindered by the inherent symmetry of droplets. Here the creation of an aerosol of nested transient emulsion droplets with inherent asymmetry is reported, achieved by converging beams of water and 1&#8208;butanol mists. Self&#8208;assembly of nanoparticles occurs within such emulsion droplets as driven by the rapid two&#8208;phase interface diffusion, producing anisotropic superstructures. A unique hollowing process is observed due to the asymmetric diffusion of solvents, akin to the Kirkendall effect. This novel assembly platform offers several advantages, including asymmetric self&#8208;assembly in air, surfactant&#8208;free operation, and tunable droplet size. It enables the creation of clean, functional nanoparticle superstructures that can be easily disassembled when needed. These advancements pave the way for exploring intricate, anisotropic superstructures with diverse applications that are unavailable in conventional superstructures of spherical symmetry.

         <title>Modulating Coalescence Timing of Liquid Marbles via Wettability Adaptation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of nanoparticles embedded with wettability adaptation allows the modulation of coalescence timing of liquid marbles on solid surfaces with &#8776;1 min resolutions without requiring external interventions. It enables droplet&#8208;based cascade chemical reaction and Janus liquid/gas marble formation. Overall, it opens new possibilities in droplet/bubble science.








Abstract
Droplet coalescence is ubiquitous in nature, and its regulation is significant in industrial processes and biomedical applications. While bare droplets suddenly coalesce in contact, the droplets covered with liquid&#8208;repellent particles to form &#8220;liquid marbles (LMs)&#8221; are not. Previously, the external stimuli&#8208;responsive breakage of the particle layer enables the regulation of the coalescence timing. However, preprogramming the coalescence timing of droplets without stimuli is challenging. In this work, LMs that break the particle layer in preprogrammed time are reported. The particles have a core wettable site and are tethered with a low&#8208;wettability flexible molecular chain, which gradually increases wettability with time. The time&#8208;dependent wettability variation is observed because of the differences in the adaptation of the molecular chain; thus, it is repeatedly available, and its speed is controllable by chain length. The formed LMs expose bare droplet surfaces in preprogrammed timing, which enables the modulation of coalescence timing from 2 to 45 min without relying on external stimuli. Moreover, the additivity of the particles enables the fine&#8208;tuning of the coalescence time with &#8776;1&#160;min resolutions. Further, the contact of several LMs with different adaptation times enables cascade droplet coalescence, opening a new route for droplet manipulation.

         <title>Multifunctional Spinel Structure for Efficient Direct Recycling of Spent Layered Cathodes into Fast&#8208;Charging Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A channel&#8208;assisted regeneration strategy that utilizes waste spinel cathode materials to construct fast lithium&#8208;ion replenishment channels on the surface of spent LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 materials is proposed. This surface reconstruction not only facilitates efficient material regeneration but also effectively mitigates lattice expansion and side reactions under fast&#8208;charging conditions, thereby optimizing the comprehensive electrochemical performance of the regenerated materials.








Abstract
Direct recycling is increasingly recognized as a promising solution to alleviate the burgeoning contradiction between the growing demand for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and amidst resource shortages. A critical challenge in this process is achieving efficient lithium compensation, which is vital for replenishing lost elements and promoting the reconstruction of degraded structures. Herein, inspired by the concept of &#8220;recycle waste with waste,&#8221; a channel&#8208;assisted regeneration strategy is proposed that utilizes waste spinel materials to reconstruct the surface of the spent layered cathode, clearing blocked channels and transforming them into a 3D&#160;structure that facilitates rapid lithium&#8208;ion transmission. This approach enhances the efficient replenishment of exogenous lithium salts into the particle lattice and prevents intrinsic thermal decomposition during heat treatment due to element deficiencies. The presence of the 3D ion channels can also improve the fast&#8208;charging performance of the regenerated cathode material, achieving a capacity retention rate of 87.9% after 500 cycles at 10&#160;C. Additionally, its overall electrochemical performance significantly outperforms that of commercial materials. This work addresses critical challenges in the direct solid&#8208;phase regeneration of cathode materials and offers valuable insights for optimizing next&#8208;generation LIB recycling technologies.

This work addresses critical challenges in the direct solid-phase regeneration of cathode materials and offers valuable insights for optimizing next-generation LIB recycling technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>2D Piezo&#8208;Ferro&#8208;Opto&#8208;Electronic Artificial Synapse for Bio&#8208;Inspired Multimodal Sensory Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel PFOE Artificial Synapse integrating multimodal fusion perception in one device with a single functional material is presented, enabled by combined ferroelectricity (for synaptic behaviors), piezoelectricity (for tactile modulation), and optoelectronic responsiveness (for visual detection) of NbOI2. Under the synergistic modulation of strain and light, visual&#8208;tactile fusion perception has been fully demonstrated, advancing multifunctional sensing devices for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Multimodal sensory integration is vital for the evolution of artificial intelligence, yet current approaches often rely on physically connecting distinct sensing units (such as visual and tactile devices) through external circuits, leading to data transmission delays and information loss. Here, a groundbreaking paradigm is demonstrated for integrating visual&#8208;tactile fusion perception in one device with a single functional material. This is achieved by developing an unprecedented 2D Piezo&#8208;Ferro&#8208;Opto&#8208;Electronic (PFOE) Artificial Synapse, which combines the comprehensive ferroelectricity (for synaptic behaviors), piezoelectricity (for tactile modulation), and optoelectronic responsiveness (for visual detection) of strained 2D NbOI2. Under the synergistic influence of light and strain, the device exhibits remarkable persistent photoconductivity (PPC), a notable increase in paired&#8208;pulse facilitation (PPF) index (from 116% to 180%), and a reduction in the power exponent of the sublinear power&#8208;law fitting photocurrent curve (from 0.797 to 0.376). These features enhance the clarity and recognition of fingerprint images that integrate visual and tactile information. The work provides a robust foundation for integrating multisensory capabilities into advanced human&#8208;machine interfaces and artificial intelligence systems, marking a significant leap forward in the development of multifunctional neuromorphic devices.

         <title>Efficient Perovskite/Organic Tandem Photovoltaic Devices and Large&#8208;area Modules Featuring Thick&#8208;Film Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fine&#8208;grained sub&#8208;cell matching model is developed to optimize the series current density of perovskite&#8208;organic tandem solar cells (TSCs). Based on the thick organic films strategy, the TSC achieve a remarkable efficiency of 24.31% (certified as 24.00%). A large&#8208;area module (18.48 cm2) is further fabricated with an impressive efficiency of 18.54%, which is the first demonstration of perovskite&#8208;organic tandem modules.








Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;organic tandem solar cells (TSCs) possess significant potential due to their unique features, such as orthogonal processing solvents, tunable bandgap, and infinite molecular designs. However, their device performance is often hindered by the limited series current density, which is constrained by the absorption of the rear organic solar cell (OSC). Here, a fine&#8208;grained sub&#8208;cell matching model has been developed that enables rapid screening of material combinations based on practical sub&#8208;cell device parameters. The model indicates that increasing the thickness of the OSC layer is an effective approach to boost efficiency, while also reducing manufacturing challenges for large&#8208;scale production. To mitigate the charge collection issues arising from excessive thickness, a contact passivation technique based on a self&#8208;assembled monolayer has been developed, which minimizes non&#8208;radiative recombination and reduces the Schottky barrier at the interface, enabling more balanced hole&#8208;electron transport. As a result, the thick&#8208;film (300&#160;nm) has achieved a record&#8208;high efficiency of 18.08% (certified as 17.80%), enhancing the efficiency of TSCs to 24.31% (certified at 24.00%). Furthermore, a large&#8208;area tandem photovoltaic module with an efficiency exceeding 18.54% (18.48 cm2) has been demonstrated. To the knowledge, this represents the first module demonstration for perovskite&#8208;organic TSCs.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Mediated Topological Interlayer Shift in 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Present work demonstrates an efficient proton&#8208;mediation strategy for precise regulation of interlayer shift of 2D D&#8208;A COFs for facilitated charge transfer and exciton dissociation in photocatalytic water reduction. The structure with eclipsed AA stacking delivers an improved hydrogen evolution rate up to 171.2 mmol&#160;g&#8722;1h&#8722;1, setting a new benchmark in photocatalysis employing 2D COFs. These findings highlight the significance of addressing the topology&#8208;governed charge transfer dynamics in COFs for efficient solar energy conversion.








Abstract
The interlayer carriers dynamics are of significance in optoelectronic applications of 2D donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) covalent organic frameworks (COFs), while are challenged by the delicate control over the inherently variable and sensitive interlayer interaction. Present work demonstrates an efficient proton&#8208;mediation strategy that allows for the precise regulation of interlayer shift of 2D D&#8208;A COFs for facilitated charge transfer and exciton dissociation. Exemplified by three imine&#8208;linked D&#8208;A COFs (IMDA), mild proton&#8208;mediation generates an eclipsed AA stacking (IMDA&#8208;AA) featuring in&#8208;plane D&#8208;A pairs and fully overlapping D&#8208;A &#960;&#8208;conjugations, while excessive proton&#8208;mediation disrupts these conjugations, resulting in a slipped AA stacking (IMDA&#8208;SAA) with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane D&#8208;A pairs. Further analysis reveals that the interlayer topology of eclipsed AA stacking of IMDA favors for the synergistically optimized charge transfer dynamics, including enhanced intralayer charge transport with reduced exciton binding energy, and boosted interlayer exciton dissociation. IMDA&#8208;AA COF delivers an improved hydrogen evolution rate up to 171.2&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1h&#8722;1 under visible light illumination in the presence of 1.5 wt.% Pt co&#8208;catalysts, which is as far as is known the highest value among the reports of 2D COFs based photocatalysis. Present work will provide an important avenue of addressing the topology&#8208;governed charge transfer dynamics within COFs for solar energy conversion.

         <title>Fast Encapsulation of Microbes into Dissolvable Hydrogel Beads Enables High&#8208;Throughput Microbial Single&#8208;Cell RNA Sequencing of Clinical Microbiome Samples</title>

This work develops smGel&#8208;seq, a high&#8208;throughput microbial single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing method characterized by low microbial&#160;input, minimal loss, reduced bias, and high sample compatibility using dissolvable hydrogel beads. smGel&#8208;seq achieves the first microbial single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing in a clinical sputum microbiome sample and found different subpopulations, one of which may be critical for antibiotic resistance and virulence.








Abstract
Microbial single&#8208;cell RNA&#8208;seq (mscRNA&#8208;seq) can achieve resolution at the cellular level, enhancing the understanding of microbial communities. However, current high&#8208;throughput mscRNA&#8208;seq methods are limited by multiple centrifugation steps, which can lead to microbial loss and bias. smGel&#8208;seq is reported, a high&#8208;throughput single&#8208;microbe RNA sequencing method for clinical microbiome samples that employs hydrogel beads to encapsulate individual microbes to reduce microbial loss and input requirements. In this method, a novel microchannel array device is implemented for encapsulating single microbe in dissolvable hydrogel beads (smDHBs), along with an optimized automated microfluidic platform to co&#8208;encapsulate barcoded beads and smDHBs, enabling high&#8208;throughput barcoding of individual microbes. smGel&#8208;seq significantly increases the microbial recovery rate in a gut microbiome sample from 8.8% to 91.8%. Furthermore, this method successfully processes clinical microbiome samples with microbial inputs 20 times lower than those required by previous methods. Notably, smGel&#8208;seq enables the first mscRNA&#8208;seq in a clinical sputum microbiome sample, revealing a specific microbial subpopulation that may play a key role in environmental adaptability, antibiotic resistance, and pathogenicity. These results highlight the compatibility of smGel&#8208;seq with clinical microbiome samples and demonstrate its potential for widespread application in diverse clinical and research settings.

         <title>Artificial Mitochondrial Nanorobots Deliver Energy In Vivo by Oral Administration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oral artificial mitochondrial nanorobots (AMNs) can treat ischemic heart disease by delivering ATP to damaged cardiomyocytes, modulating oxidative stress, and restoring cell viability. It improves energy metabolism and mitochondrial structure and reduces inflammation at the genetic level, providing a universal and innovative approach to repair therapies for mitochondrial damage&#8208;related diseases.








Abstract
Delivering energy in vivo is essential for treating mitochondrial damage&#8208;related diseases. Current methods, including natural mitochondrial transplantation and artificial energy delivery systems, lack non&#8208;destructive, external energy&#8208;free, and clinically viable potential solutions. Here, artificial mitochondrial nanorobots (AMNs) carrying high&#8208;energy phosphate bonds rebuild the in vivo energy supply system to provide energy. Using ischemic heart disease (IHD) as an energy&#8208;deficient disease model and the oral route, which has high patient compliance and facilitates long&#8208;term administration, to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of AMNs. AMNs remain stable in the gastrointestinal tract, cross the intestinal barrier via a barrier&#8208;crossing unit, and target damaged heart tissue and cardiomyocytes using a motion unit chemotactically. Intracellularly, their energy&#8208;generating unit provides high&#8208;energy phosphate bonds for ATP synthesis (duration 12&#160;h), while synergistically reducing inflammation and restoring cell viability. At the same frequency of administration, oral AMNs (50&#160;mg&#160;kg&#8722;1) match intravenous AMNs (10 mg&#160;kg&#8722;1) in therapeutic efficacy, offering a convenient approach to improving cardiac function. Transcriptomics confirm that 200&#160;&#181;g AMNs emulate 5 &#215; 10&#8310; natural mitochondria, restoring energy metabolism and structural function in damaged hearts at the genetic level. This innovative design opens a new pathway for the construction of artificial energy delivery systems in vivo.

         <title>Manipulating the Assembly and Architecture of Fibrillar Silk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, advanced in situ AFM, PiFM, and Cryo&#8208;EM are leveraged to realize in situ observations of nucleation, growth, and degradation of silk nanofibrils. A clear picture of the assembly and structural evolution of regenerated silk nanofibrils is defined and demonstrates a novel strategy for manipulating their structure and properties, which emerges from the understanding of their structure and assembly.








Abstract
Silk is a unique and exceptionally strong biological material. However, no synthetic method has yet come close to replicating the properties of natural silk. This shortfall is attributed to an insufficient understanding of both silk nanofibril structure and the mechanism of formation. Here in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) and photo&#8208;induced force microscopy (PiFM) is utilized to investigate the formation process and define the basic structural paradigm of individual silk nanofibrils. By visualizing the multistage process of silk nanofibril formation, the importance of conformational transformations along the assembly pathway is revealed. Unfolded silk structures initially accumulate into amorphous clusters, which then evolve into crystal nuclei via conformational transformation into &#946;&#8208;crystallites. Nanofibril elongation then occurs through the attachment of silk molecules at a single end of the nanofibril tip; this is facilitated through the formation of a new amorphous cluster that then repeats the aforementioned conformational transformation. However, enzymatic digestion of the amorphous regions leads to direct, rapid elongation of &#946;&#8208;crystalline fibers. These findings imply that the energy landscape is characterized by shallow minima associated with intermediate states, which can be eliminated by introducing &#946;&#8208;crystallites, and motivate research into the directed modification of the silk assembly pathway to select for features beneficial to specific applications.

         <title>Acceptor Crystallinity Engineering Enables &gt;20% Efficiency Binary Organic Solar Cells with 83.0% Fill Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new solvent, trichloroethylene (TCE), is introduced and used as an acceptor processing solvent in layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer processed devices. The active layer exhibits a higher proportion of transport phases and lower trap&#8208;assisted charge recombination. The efficiency of the binary organic solar cell reached 20.05%, with a record&#8208;high fill factor of 83%.








Abstract
For spontaneously crystallized organic photovoltaic materials, morphology optimization remains a challenge due to the disparity in crystallinity between the donor and acceptor components. Imperfections in the crystalline phases result in significant trap&#8208;assisted recombination, which emerges as a critical factor limiting the fill factor (FF) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a method is introduced for precise regulation of the acceptor crystallinity, utilizing a novel upper&#8208;layer acceptor processing solvent, trichloroethylene (TCE), to improve the state and vertical morphology of the active layer. The TCE solvent synergistically optimizes intermolecular interactions among acceptor molecules and balances the film&#8208;forming process, thereby increasing the proportion of transport phases and forming high&#8208;speed channels for electron transport, which subsequently reduces trap&#8208;assisted charge recombination. As a result, the photovoltaic efficiency of binary organic solar cells reaches 20.05%. More importantly, an unprecedented FF of 83.0% is obtained, representing the highest FF value for OSCs. This facile and effective approach offers a promising means for constructing efficient charge transport networks and fabricating high&#8208;efficiency and morphologically stable OSCs.

         <title>Mesoporous Silica Nanotraps for Mitigating Bleeding Risk From &#8216;Irreversible&#8217; Antiplatelet Drugs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;term antiplatelet therapy increases bleeding risk, particularly in emergency surgeries or accidental injuries. The click chemistry&#8208;functionalized mesoporous silica nanotraps are developed to selectively capture the sulfhydryl&#8208;containing active metabolites of clopidogrel and prasugrel, rapidly reversing their antiplatelet activity and restoring hemostasis. Bleeding models in mice, rabbits, and pigs confirmed their efficacy and safety, underscoring their potential as a functional reversal agent for &#8220;irreversible&#8221; antiplatelet drugs.








Abstract
The severe bleeding complications of long&#8208;term antiplatelet therapy limit its broader application in the treatment or prevention of thrombosis&#8208;associated diseases. This risk is particularly serious when facing emergency surgeries where rapid restoration of normal platelet function is required. Timely reversal of the effects of antiplatelet agents becomes crucial in such scenarios. Despite the widespread use of clopidogrel and prasugrel for their potent antiplatelet activity, the absence of specific and effective reversal agents remains a notable challenge. The pharmacological activity of clopidogrel and prasugrel is mediated by sulfhydryl&#8208;containing active metabolites, which form disulfide bonds with P2Y12 receptors on the surface of platelets to inhibit their aggregation. Taking advantage of this action mechanism of these &#8220;irreversible&#8221; antiplatelet drugs, click chemistry&#8208;functionalized mesoporous silica (SiO2&#8208;Mal) nanotraps are fabricated to capture the antiplatelet drugs' active metabolites and restore hemostasis. Subsequently, a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness and safety of the SiO2&#8208;Mal nanotraps is conducted using mouse, rabbit, and pig animal models, highlighting their potential application as a functional reversal agent for clinically relevant thienopyridine antiplatelet drugs, believed until now to be irreversible in their inhibition of platelet activity.

         <title>Molecular Reconstruction for the High&#8208;Performance Recycled Fluororubbers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular reconstruction strategy is proposed to upcycle waste fluororubber into chemically awakenable and high&#8208;performance ATLF&#8208;Boc through three reactions: controlled oxidative degradation, fluorination addition and decarboxylation amination. This strategy solved the problem of difficult recovery of waste fluororubber, realized the upgrading and recycling of waste fluororubber. Furthermore, an epoxy curing system is constructed to achieve control of ATLF performance.








Abstract
To address the challenges associated with the difficult recycling of fluorinated specialty materials and the subpar performance of recycled products, a molecular reconstruction strategy of oxidative degradation, fluorination addition is reported, and end&#8208;group transformation, which upcycled waste fluororubber into high&#8208;performance, chemically awakenable amino&#8208;terminated low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fluoropolymer (ATLF&#8208;Boc). Leveraging the chemical properties of the vinylidene fluoride structure in the waste fluororubber, carboxyl&#8208;terminated low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fluoropolymer (CTLF) with controlled molecular weight and end&#8208;group content are synthesized. Further, the whole chain is structurally strengthened at the molecular scale to achieve higher fluorine content and thermal stability, and saturated carboxyl&#8208;terminated low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight fluoropolymer (SCTLF) is synthesized. Subsequently, to balance high reactivity and stable storage, high&#8208;performance ATLF&#8208;Boc is synthesized, realizing the upcycling of waste fluororubber. After upcycling, the awakened ATLF exhibits a high fluorine content (66.95%), and the cured ATLF shows the regulation of surface hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity (between 43&#176; and 114&#176;), a high tensile strength of 13.3&#160;MPa, an excellent thermal stability (T10% = 359&#160;&#176;C). In this study, a novel solution for the upcycling of waste fluororubbers for fabricating functional materials is offered, which is of great significance in the field of fluorinated specialty materials.

     alt="Molecular Reconstruction for the High-Performance Recycled Fluororubbers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A molecular reconstruction strategy is proposed to upcycle waste fluororubber into chemically awakenable and high-performance ATLF-Boc through three reactions: controlled oxidative degradation, fluorination addition and decarboxylation amination. This strategy solved the problem of difficult recovery of waste fluororubber, realized the upgrading and recycling of waste fluororubber. Furthermore, an epoxy curing system is constructed to achieve control of ATLF performance.

         <dc:description>
A versatile assembly method is developed to uniformly assemble 2D single&#8208;crystal copper nanosheets (Cu NS) onto substrates with complex shapes via ultrasonication process. This technique leverages cavitation effects to deposit monolayer Cu NS films with minimal overlap. The assembly is optimized by tuning solvent polarity and substrate surface energy. Demonstrated applications include a resistive heater, highlighting the potential in flexible electronics.








Abstract
Scalable and cost&#8208;effective fabrication of conductive films on substrates with complex geometries is crucial for industrial applications in electronics. Herein, an ultrasonic&#8208;driven omni&#8208;directional and selective assembly technique is introduced for the uniform deposition of 2D single&#8208;crystalline copper nanosheets (Cu NS) onto various substrates. This method leverages cavitation&#8208;induced forces to propel Cu NS onto hydrophilic surfaces, enabling the formation of monolayer films with largely monolayer films with some degree of nanosheet overlap. The assembly process is influenced by solvent polarity, nanosheet concentration, and ultrasonic parameters, with non&#8208;polar solvents significantly enhancing Cu NS adsorption onto hydrophilic substrates. Furthermore, selective assembly is achieved by patterning hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions on the substrate, ensuring precise localization of Cu NS films. The practical potential of this approach is demonstrated by fabricating a Cu NS&#8208;coated capillary tube heater, which exhibits excellent heating performance at low operating voltages. This ultrasonic&#8208;driven and selective assembly method offers a scalable and versatile solution for producing conductive films with tailored geometries, unlocking new possibilities for applications in flexible electronics, energy storage, and wearable devices with complex structural requirements.

         <title>Integrating Ethereal Molecular Backbones into the Ester Solvent with High Solubility of Nitrate for High&#8208;Voltage Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating the ethereal backbones into ester solvents and designing new organic nitrates, the high solubility of nitrate salt into the ester electrolyte is successfully achieved. The electrolyte containing new organic nitrate and designed ester solvent exhibits excellent cycle stability for Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) batteries. Consequently, 1 Ah Li||NCM811 pouch cell showcases excellent cycle stability over 150 times.








Abstract
The high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries require high&#8208;voltage cathode, low negative/positive capacity (N/P) ratio and lean electrolyte. Despite the all&#8208;fluorinated electrolytes with severe corrosion, the development of ester electrolytes is stagnant due to the incompatibility of ester solvent with Li metal anode. Hence, various electrolyte additives have been developed. Among them, LiNO3 is considered as the most effective electrolyte additive for improving the reversibility of Li deposition. Unfortunately, their solubility into the ester solvent is extremely low. This investigation suggests that the strong ionic bonds in LiNO3 and the low solvation energy of ester solvent are the main triggers for the insolubility of LiNO3 in the ester electrolyte. Hence, a new organic nitrate salt (N&#8208;propyl&#8208;N&#8208;methylpyrrolidinium nitrate (Py13NO3)) with large organic cations and a new liner ester solvent (dipropyleneglycol methyl ether acetate (DPGMEA)) is designed, which integrates the ethereal molecular backbones into the ester solvent. Consequently, the electrolyte containing 1.2&#160;m lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI), 0.3&#160;m Py13NO3 and 0.1&#160;m lithium disfluorophosphate (LiPO2F2) in fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC):DPGMEA (2:8) showcases excellent electrochemical performance in high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries. Eventually, the &#8220;1 Ah level&#8221; Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) pouch cell (N/P ratio &#8776;1.2; electrolyte/capacity (E/C) ratio &#8776;2.5&#160;g Ah&#8722;1) exhibits excellent cycle life over 150 times in the designed electrolyte.

         <title>Direct Observation of Unidirectional Exciton Polaritons in Layered van der Waals Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Real&#8208;space nanoimaging of unidirectional hybridized exciton&#8208;polariton (EPs). The resolution to observe near&#8208;field SOC can be very high (down to 10&#160;nm) and the contrast can be clearly distinguished at the real&#8208;space. The work provides an alternative but more direct approach to uncover the underlying physics of optical SOC and EP properties.








Abstract
Unidirectional excitation of highly confined guided modes is essential for nanoscale energy transport, photonic integrated devices, and quantum information processing. Among various feasible approaches, the mechanism based on optical spin&#8211;orbit coupling is investigated for unidirectional routing of surface plasmons and valley exciton&#8208;polaritons, without needing the use of complicated magneto&#8208;optical effects and parity symmetry breaking. So far, the direct near&#8208;field nanoimaging of such exotic polaritonic modes based on optical spin&#8211;orbit coupling has remained elusive. Here, the real&#8208;space nanoimaging of unidirectional polaritons in van der Waals semiconductors are reported. Specifically, photonic spins are coupled into the tip of a scattering&#8208;type scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy for circular dipolar excitations of spin&#8211;orbit interactions, thus enabling the unidirectional waveguide exciton&#8208;polariton propagation with remarkable unidirectionality (ratio of spectrum amplitudes under opposite circularly polarized illumination) R = 0.291 for TM mode. Via switching to the opposite helicities, the reversed opposite directions are observed. The work offers a promising avenue for detecting and processing spin information for future communication technology at the nanoscale.

         <title>Active Organic Salts Enabling Non&#8208;Intrusive Electrolyte Presodiation Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a non&#8208;intrusive electrolyte presodiation strategy is reported. Active organic salt sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) as an electrolyte additive, which is dissolved in the electrolyte and subsequently injected into dry cells. During cell charging, the salt undergoes anodic oxidation, releasing active Na ions to compensate for capacity loss. Meanwhile, the organic ligand (&#8208;SCN) dimerizes to form the electrolyte cosolvent NCS&#8208;SCN.








Abstract
Na&#8208;ion batteries show great promise, but their practical utilization is hindered by irreversible Na&#8208;ion loss during cell formation, resulting in initial coulombic efficiencies typically below 80%. Conventional presodiation methods, which involve solid additives in the cathode, can compromise electrode integrity and leave deteriorated residues, especially with high Na ion compensation (20%). An electrolyte presodiation approach is introduced that utilizes sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) as an electrolyte additive, discovered through cheminformatics and machine learning. This organic salt decomposes at 3.3&#8211;4.0&#160;V, releasing active Na ions and forming a cosolvent without damaging the electrode and the cell, as confirmed by spectroscopic and microscopic analyses. The method improves the initial coulombic efficiency of a hard carbon|P2&#8208;Na2/3Ni1/3Mn1/3Ti1/3O2 pouch cell from 80.8% to 95.2%, with a capacity retention of 84.5% over 400 cycles.

     alt="Active Organic Salts Enabling Non-Intrusive Electrolyte Presodiation Strategy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, a non-intrusive electrolyte presodiation strategy is reported. Active organic salt sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) as an electrolyte additive, which is dissolved in the electrolyte and subsequently injected into dry cells. During cell charging, the salt undergoes anodic oxidation, releasing active Na ions to compensate for capacity loss. Meanwhile, the organic ligand (-SCN) dimerizes to form the electrolyte cosolvent NCS-SCN.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na-ion batteries show great promise, but their practical utilization is hindered by irreversible Na-ion loss during cell formation, resulting in initial coulombic efficiencies typically below 80%. Conventional presodiation methods, which involve solid additives in the cathode, can compromise electrode integrity and leave deteriorated residues, especially with high Na ion compensation (20%). An electrolyte presodiation approach is introduced that utilizes sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) as an electrolyte additive, discovered through cheminformatics and machine learning. This organic salt decomposes at 3.3&#8211;4.0&#160;V, releasing active Na ions and forming a cosolvent without damaging the electrode and the cell, as confirmed by spectroscopic and microscopic analyses. The method improves the initial coulombic efficiency of a hard carbon|P2-Na&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cell from 80.8% to 95.2%, with a capacity retention of 84.5% over 400 cycles. These findings present a practical and non-intrusive way to address Na-ion deficiency challenges in Na-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lead Derivative&#8208;Based Precursor Engineering Enables Halogen&#8208;Uniform Perovskite Solar Cells with Enhanced Stability and Mechanical Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite solar cells achieve high efficiency and stability using lead derivative (nPbI2:1PbXA) to minimize halide segregation. This approach enhances mechanical resistance and yields efficiencies of 21.3% and 20.3% in all&#8208;inorganic and hybrid wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites, retaining &gt;90% efficiency after 1500 h under maximum power point tracking.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with supreme opto&#8208;electrical properties and solution&#8208;processability have attracted tremendous interest. To realize state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiencies in PSCs, delicate control of bandgap (E
g) is required, which generally involves using mixed halogens. This, however, can result in unfavorable phase segregation to negatively influence on the target efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. Herein, a viable precursor method is demonstrated for preparing halide&#8208;uniform perovskites based on lead derivatives of nPbI2:1PbXA. It is found that nPbI2:1PbXA enables tuning the bonding preference and strength between PbI2 and PbBr2 in the precursor, leading to generating stable &#8208;I&#8208;Br&#8208;I&#8208;Br&#8208; fragments, which eventually minimizes halide segregation in the perovskite. The precursor approach have been applied to a series of wide&#8208;bandgap mixed halide perovskites, achieving boosted efficiencies of 21.3% and 20.3% in CsPbI2.8Br0.2 (bandgap of 1.74&#160;eV) and Cs0.2FA0.8I1.9Br1.1 (bandgap of 1.77&#160;eV) based solar cells. Interestingly, the connection between the modified halide homogeneity and mechanical tolerance is found: the better the uniformity in the halide distribution, the higher the mechanical resistance of the perovskite to compressive or bending forces. The solar cells with modified halogen uniformity exhibit impressive long&#8208;term stability, with the retention of &gt;90% of the initial efficiencies after 1500 h of continuous illumination under maximum power point tracking.

         <title>A Robust and Tough Composite Hydrogel Electrolyte with Anion&#8208;Locked Supramolecular Network for Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite hydrogel electrolyte is prepared by constructing a 3D supramolecular network. The hydrogel electrolyte possesses good mechanical properties, superior ionic conductivity, and high zinc ion transference number, which can inhibit dendrite growth, enable uniform zinc deposition, achieve long cycle life, and realize high capacity retention.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes have garnered extensive attention in zinc ion batteries due to their excellent flexibility and good safety. However, their limited mechanical properties, low ionic conductivity, and poor Zn2+ transference number pose significant challenges for developing high&#8208;performance zinc ion batteries. Herein, this work constructs a 3D supramolecular network capable of locking anions and active water molecules through the abundant hydrogen bonding interactions between aramid nanofibers, polyvinyl alcohol, and anions. This network synergistically enhances the mechanical properties (with a mechanical strength of 0.88&#160;MPa and a toughness of 3.28&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), ionic conductivity (4.22 S m&#8722;1), and Zn2+ transference number (0.78). As a result, the supramolecular composite hydrogel electrolyte can effectively inhibit dendrite growth and side reactions, facilitate interface regulation, and enable uniform zinc deposition. The Zn anode exhibits a cycle life of 1500&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 5 mAh cm&#8722;2, with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.1% over 600 cycles. Additionally, the Zn||polyaniline full cell maintains a high capacity retention of 78% after 9100 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. The assembled pouch cells demonstrate good flexibility, deformability, and compression resistance. This work provides valuable insights into the design of high&#8208;performance hydrogel electrolytes for zinc ion batteries.

         <title>Ultrasound Tip&#8208;Assisted Piezotronic Transduction in Monolayer MoS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric transduction in monolayer MoS2 is demonstrated using an ultrasound tip (&#160;100 kHz) from a wire bonder. Transient current measurements reveal sharp peaks with high peak&#8208;to&#8208;base ratios, tunable via gate voltage and ultrasound power. Multiple acoustic wave reflections enhance signal linewidth, validated by microacoustic simulations, establishing a robust platform for ultrasound&#8208;driven piezoelectric sensing.








Abstract
The interaction of ultrasonic waves with piezoelectric materials provides a quantitative route to enhance electrical and mechanical coupling in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. Here, wire&#8208;bonding tip&#8208;assisted ultrasound (&#8776;100 kHz) is presented as an effective approach to achieve piezoelectric transduction in monolayer MoS2 on Si/SiO2 substrates. Transient current measurements show reproducible sharp peaks with a peak&#8208;to&#8208;base ratio (Ipeak/Ibase &#8776; 12) unique to monolayer MoS2, under an impact duration of 10&#8211;100 ms. Electrostatic gate voltage (Vg) and ultrasound power (WP) tunable piezocurrent exhibit 3&#8211;5 times higher sensitivity in the ON&#8208;state (Vg &#10878; 0) compared to the OFF&#8208;state. Multiple reflections of acoustic waves at source&#8208;drain electrodes, with an increment in reflection coefficients, enhance the linewidth of peak currents, validated by microacoustic simulations of surface acoustic wave (SAW) propagation in submicron geometries. The localized strain and Joule heating under ultrasonic excitation may generate a temperature rise of &#8776;20 K, which reduces activation energy barriers, potentially enhancing reaction rates in temperature&#8208;sensitive chemical processes, such as hydrogen peroxide decomposition. This thermal&#8208;damage&#8208;free method integrates with silicon&#8208;based fabrication, establishing a robust platform for on&#8208;chip catalysis and energy harvesting in FET&#8208;based&#160;piezotransducers.

         <title>Rational Design of a Bilayer Interface for Long&#8208;Term Stability of Zn Anodes and MnO2 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bilayer electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface engineering strategy is presented to introduce sodium thioctate into bare ZnSO4 electrolytes. Benefiting from the bilayer electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, optimized solvation structure, and reconstructed inner Helmholtz plane, the resulting Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries exhibit prominent cycling stability. This work provides effective guidance for the rational design of safe and long&#8208;life aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Understanding the composition&#8211;characteristics&#8211;performance relationship of the electrolyte&#8211;electric double layer&#8211;electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface (EEI) is crucial to construct stable EEIs for high&#8208;performance aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO2 batteries (AZMBs). However, the interaction mechanisms in AZMBs remain unclear. This work introduces sodium thioctate (ST) into ZnSO4 electrolyte to construct a stable bilayer EEI on both Zn and MnO2 electrodes. First, zincophilic ST regulates the solvation structure of hydrated Zn2+, suppressing corrosion and the hydrogen evolution reaction. Second, the specific adsorption of ST reconstructs the inner Helmholtz plane, facilitating the desolvation of hydrated Zn2+ and homogenizing charge distribution.

&lt;p&gt;A bilayer electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface engineering strategy is presented to introduce sodium thioctate into bare ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrolytes. Benefiting from the bilayer electrode-electrolyte interface, optimized solvation structure, and reconstructed inner Helmholtz plane, the resulting Zn&#8722;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries exhibit prominent cycling stability. This work provides effective guidance for the rational design of safe and long-life aqueous zinc-ion batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the composition&#8211;characteristics&#8211;performance relationship of the electrolyte&#8211;electric double layer&#8211;electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface (EEI) is crucial to construct stable EEIs for high-performance aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries (AZMBs). However, the interaction mechanisms in AZMBs remain unclear. This work introduces sodium thioctate (ST) into ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte to construct a stable bilayer EEI on both Zn and MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrodes. First, zincophilic ST regulates the solvation structure of hydrated Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, suppressing corrosion and the hydrogen evolution reaction. Second, the specific adsorption of ST reconstructs the inner Helmholtz plane, facilitating the desolvation of hydrated Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and homogenizing charge distribution. Finally, ST molecules undergo reversible polymerization at the interface, forming a stable bilayer EEI with a poly(zinc thioctate) outer layer and a ZnS&#8211;organic amorphous inner layer, which ensures uniform zinc-ion flux and enhances mechanical stability. Additionally, the dynamic disulfide bonds in ST further enable self-regulation and self-healing of the interface, mitigating damage during cycling. As a result, the ST-enhanced Zn symmetric battery achieves 7800 cycles at 60&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, while the AZMB exhibits only 0.0014% capacity decay over 10&#160;000 cycles at 2000&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This bilayer EEI engineering strategy offers effective guidance for the rational design of safe and long-life aqueous zinc-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processable PEDOT for Organic Solar Cells: From One&#8208;Pot Synthesis to Kinetically&#8208;Controlled Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>

It is shown that the synthesis of solution&#8208;processable poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) hole transporting materials (HTMs) follows the principle of oxidative polymerization&#8208;induced electrostatic self&#8208;assembly (OPIESA), with the kinetic behavior strongly correlated to the volume of the polyanion matrix, and propose a kinetically&#8208;controlled polymerization (KCP) approach to synthesize solution&#8208;processable, high&#8208;performance PEDOT HTMs by halting the polymerization at certain stages within a low&#8208;volume polyanion matrix.








Abstract
The updating of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole transporting material (HTM) is crucial for organic solar cells (OSCs). Despite decades of development in PEDOT:PSS and its derivatives, a comprehensive understanding of their supramolecular polymerization mechanisms remains elusive, precluding the attainment of the optimal architectures and functions. Herein, it is shown that the synthesis of PEDOT:PSS follows the principle of oxidative polymerization&#8208;induced electrostatic self&#8208;assembly, with the kinetic behavior strongly correlated to the volume of PSS polyanion matrix. Moreover, a kinetically controlled polymerization approach is proposed to synthesize PEDOT HTMs with exceptional time efficiency by prematurely halting the rapid polymerization process within a low&#8208;volume PSS matrix. The reduced interference from PSS confers unique advantages to the methodology in achieving highly oxidized and interconnected PEDOTs. This leads to comprehensive improvements in the physico&#8208;chemical properties of PEDOT:PSS, significantly enhancing OSC efficiency to 20.04%. Furthermore, the optimized PEDOT maintains exceptional semiconducting characteristics and outstanding OSC efficiency even at an unprecedentedly high PSS insulator content of 94.12%. The substantial increase in loading significantly amplifies the manifestation of polyanion functionalities, such as improving colloidal stability, thereby facilitating the resurgence of previously underutilized naphthalene sulfonate polyanion in the fabrication of high&#8208;quality, solution&#8208;processable PEDOT HTMs.

         <title>Understanding Multi&#8208;Stage Charge Storage on Nanoporous Carbons in Zn&#8208;Ion Hybrid Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous carbons with tunable pore sizes are synthesized to investigate the impact of pore size on charge storage in Zn&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors. An unusual multi&#8208;stage charge storage mechanism is revealed, involving a transition from capacitive Zn2+ ion storage to faradaic Had adsorption on the carbon surface, providing new insights into Zn&#8208;ion electrochemistry.








Abstract
Zn&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors (ZIHCs) are promising high&#8208;power energy storage devices. However, the underlying charge storage mechanisms, especially the influence of proton storage, remain poorly understood. Herein, the model porous carbons are synthesized having similar specific surface areas (SSAs) and surface chemistry but different pore sizes. They highlight the role of supermicropores and small mesopores (0.86&#8211;4&#160;nm) enabling a high capacity of 198 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (capacitance of 446 F&#160;g&#8722;1), while larger mesopores (4&#8211;13&#160;nm) significantly enhance cycling stability, exceeding 0.6 million cycles. Electrochemical studies, including EQCM analysis, reveal a 4&#8208;stage charge&#8208;storage process under cathodic polarization, comprising adsorption and desolvation of hydrated Zn2+ ions, followed by water reduction, catalyzed by Zn2+, and formation of Had. The rising pH leads to the formation of insoluble zinc hydroxysulfate hydrates (ZHS). Depending on the pore architecture, the precipitation of ZHS has different effects on the overall stability of cycling. The study overall: (i) presents a simplified method for pore control in carbon synthesis; (ii) discuss the effect of pore size on charge storage and cycling stability in respect of ZHS formation; (iii) sheds light on the charge storage mechanism indicating the important contribution of cation effect known from electrocatalysis on faradaic charge storage mechanism.

         <title>Phototunable Rayleigh 3D Soft Self&#8208;Oscillator Enabling Versatile Biomimetic Tubular Peristaltic Pumping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging biomechanical strategy based on two direction&#8208;and&#8208;dimension&#8208;tubular instabilities: postbuckling and snapping, it has created a phototunable Rayleigh 3D soft self&#8208;oscillator with direction/dimension/symmetry tunable self&#8208;oscillating deformations, which allow for controllable manipulation of spatiotemporal 3D motions of local tubular walls to achieve high&#8208;DOF, multimodal, autonomous biomimetic tubular peristaltic pumping that can adapt to transporting a variety of matter.








Abstract
Living tubular organs can spatiotemporally and cyclically deform their muscular walls to implement adaptable and sustainable peristaltic pumping applicable to broad matter, achieved via asymmetric and non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;oscillating deformations of muscular walls. However, man&#8208;made tubular soft actuators have been limited to pumping a few simple matters, because of their reciprocal and monotonic wall motions that cannot break time&#8208;reversal symmetry and system equilibrium to gain adaptable and sustainable pumping. Here, a phototunable Rayleigh 3D soft self&#8208;oscillator (PR3DSSO) capable of multimodal, nonreciprocal, self&#8208;sustainable wall deformations is presented. PR3DSSO's design leverages two direction&#8208;and&#8208;dimension&#8208;phototunable tubular instabilities: snapping and postbuckling. The post&#8208;buckling instability can generate local&#8208;wall origami which cannot only fold local walls into multimodal shape&#8208;mode waves, but also break wall&#8208;motion symmetry; snapping instabilities help break equilibrium in wall motions to initiate autonomous wall motions. These phototunable&#8208;instabilities&#8208;driven wall deformations unprecedentedly create Rayleigh&#8208;like 3D wall motions, which allow for versatile biomimetic tubular peristaltic pumping adapt to broad matter. Our PR3DSSO would spur creative life&#8208;like active&#8208;material designs and novel pumping functions.

         <title>Robust Homogeneous Segmented Power Generator Driven by Sb2Te3&#8208;Based Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cd&#8211;S co&#8208;alloying&#8208;induced microstructural evolution enables high&#8208;performance Sb2Te3&#8208;based thermoelectrics. Subsequently, an innovative full&#8208;scale Bi&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te segmented power generator is fabricated, extending the operational range of conventional Bi2Te3&#8208;based modules from 500 to 650 K and achieving an exceptional efficiency of 9.3% under a distinct &#916;T = 350 K. Notably, it exhibits remarkable stability after 80&#8208;cycle thermal shock and 160&#8208;h thermal durability, highlighting great potential for low&#8208;grade waste heat recovery.








Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) technology offers a promising solution for waste heat recovery, particularly in applications involving abundant low&#8208;grade heat (&lt;650 K). However, for over half a century, TE power generators have predominantly relied on Bi2Te3 alloys with limited efficiencies below 7%.

&lt;p&gt;The Cd&#8211;S co-alloying-induced microstructural evolution enables high-performance Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based thermoelectrics. Subsequently, an innovative full-scale Bi&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te segmented power generator is fabricated, extending the operational range of conventional Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based modules from 500 to 650 K and achieving an exceptional efficiency of 9.3% under a distinct &#916;&lt;i&gt;T =&lt;/i&gt; 350 K. Notably, it exhibits remarkable stability after 80-cycle thermal shock and 160-h thermal durability, highlighting great potential for low-grade waste heat recovery.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thermoelectric (TE) technology offers a promising solution for waste heat recovery, particularly in applications involving abundant low-grade heat (&amp;lt;650 K). However, for over half a century, TE power generators have predominantly relied on Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; alloys with limited efficiencies below 7%. Herein, Cd and S are doped into Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to promote microstructural regulation characterized by dense twin boundaries and dislocations, resulting in a 45% reduction of lattice thermal conductivity at 300 K. Combined with the optimized density-of-states effective mass and expanded band gap, the Cd&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;1.96&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2.94&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;0.06&lt;/sub&gt; sample attains a peak &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; of 1.1 at 650 K and an average &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; of 1.0 from 500 to 650 K, while exhibiting remarkable compressive and bending strengths of 197 and 56&#160;MPa.

         <title>Optical Synaptic Devices with Multiple Encryption Features Based on SERS&#8208;Revealed Charge&#8208;Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid R6G/InSe structure is designed, and the charge transfer mechanism within this structure is validated using SERS. This structure effectively emulates biological synapses, comprising a presynaptic membrane (R6G photosensitive layer), synaptic cleft (R6G/InSe interface), and postsynaptic membrane (InSe sensing layer). The charge transfer process in this structure closely mirrors the neurotransmitter transfer across the synaptic cleft. Surface treatment techniques are employed to regulate the charge transfer process, enabling multiple on&#8208;chip encryption anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications to be developed.








Abstract
2D optical synaptic devices with atomic&#8208;scale thickness show potential for building highly integrated tunable artificial visual neural networks. However, their atomic&#8208;scale thickness also leads to weak light absorption, limiting device photoresponse. Here, a high&#8208;performance optical synaptic device based on a Rhodamine 6G (R6G)/InSe hybrid structure is proposed, achieving a remarkable 328.9% enhancement in photoresponse compared to InSe devices. Using surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) as a nondestructive probing technique, it is demonstrated that light&#8208;induced charge transfer between R6G and InSe is the key mechanism enabling the device's high performance. Furthermore, introducing a self&#8208;limited oxide layer on the InSe surface provides additional evidence for the charge transfer process. This charge&#8208;transfer&#8208;based device effectively mimics the neurotransmitter transmission process in biological synapses, showing unique potential in applications such as image preprocessing and decoding within artificial neural networks. In addition, through surface treatment techniques, precise control over the charge transfer process is achieved, enabling the design of a multiple encryption&#8208;based anti&#8208;counterfeiting array and highlighting their value in on&#8208;chip anti&#8208;counterfeiting. By employing a spectrally noninvasive method to probe charge transfer, this study elucidates the critical role of charge transfer in optical synaptic devices and opens novel application pathways.

         <title>Interfacial Thermal Transport and Energy Dissipation in Multilayer PdSe2 Field Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the high&#8208;field breakdown and energy dissipation of multilayer PdSe2 FETs, with a focus on the interfacial thermal transport at the PdSe2/SiO2 interface. The research proposes optimization strategies to enhance device performance and improve the thermal management, paving the way for the more efficient next&#8208;generation electronic and optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
The continuous miniaturization of 2D electronic circuits results in increased power density during device operation, leading to heat localization and placing higher demands on their performance thresholds. The risk to thermal breakdown and subsequent damage, due to the energy dissipation in the 2D semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) supported on the bulk substrates, represents a significant challenge in maintaining their optimal performance. Herein, this study investigates energy dissipation behavior in multilayer PdSe2 FETs for the first time. The high&#8208;field breakdown behavior is firstly studied in multilayer PdSe2 FETs on SiO2/Si substrates, where a maximum current density of &#8776;2.74 MA cm&#8722;2 is observed, which is comparable to that of multilayer black phosphorus FET and significantly higher&#8212;by about five times&#8212;than that of multilayer MoS2 FET. Additionally, the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of PdSe2/SiO2 interface is measured at room temperature using Raman thermometry. The TBC is found to be &#8776;12&#8211;13 MW m&#8722;2 K&#8722;1, which is relatively low compared to the other known solid&#8211;solid interfaces, indicating that enhancing the performance of PdSe2 FETs can be possible by optimizing the TBC at the PdSe2/SiO2 interface. These findings provide valuable insights for design of high&#8208;quality and high&#8208;performance PdSe2 electronic and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Enabling High Performance in a Positive Potential of Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis Over Mesoporous Core@Shell Cu2O/Cu@PdCu Nanozyme</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous core@shell Cu2O/Cu@PdCu nanozymes are demonstrated as efficient tandem electrocatalyst for highly selective NH3 electrosynthesis from NO3&#8722; at fairly positive potentials. Meanwhile, this enzyme&#8208;like electrocatalyst performs perfectly in the two&#8208;electrode coupling system for cathode NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 and anode ethanol oxidation in a more energy&#8208;efficient manner.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic tandem nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3) offers a promising pathway for energy and environmental sustainability. Although considerable efforts have been presented to modulate the reaction pathways for enhanced NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 electrocatalysis, these advances often require relatively high overpotentials to balance yield rate and selectivity of NH3, resulting in a remarkable energy inefficiency. Inspired by enzyme catalysis in nature, herein a tandem enzyme&#8208;like electrocatalyst is designed consisting of a core of Cu2O/Cu heterojunction surrounded by mesoporous PdCu shell (Cu2O/Cu@mesoPdCu) that accelerated NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 electrocatalysis in positive potentials. Impressively, Cu2O/Cu@mesoPdCu nanozymes hold superior performance for robust NH3 electrosynthesis in a fairly positive potential of 0.10&#160;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode), having Faraday efficiency of 96.2%, yield rate of 13.3&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1, and half&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 46.0%. Kinetic studies, in situ spectra and density functional theory calculations revealed that Cu2O/Cu core preferentially adsorbed NO3&#8722; and further reduced to *NO2, while active hydrogen radicals enriched on PdCu shell promoted multistep hydrodeoxygenation of *NO2 to NH3 within &#8220;semi&#8208;closed&#8221; mesoporous microenvironment, both of which synergistically enabled tandem electrocatalysis in positive potentials. Moreover, this enzyme&#8208;like electrocatalyst disclosed better NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 performance in a more energy&#8208;efficient manner when coupling with more thermodynamically favorable ethanol oxidation reaction.

         <title>Nanosized Multistate Configurations of Relaxor&#8208;Like Antiferroelectric Revealed by Atomic&#8208;Scale In Situ Electron Microscopy</title>

Atomic&#8208;scale in situ heating scanning transmission electron microscopy of the (Pb,La)(Zr,Sn,Ti)O3 materials reveals the origin of characteristic hysteresis behavior of relaxor&#8208;like antiferroelectric. The nanosized multistate configurations which encompass antiferroelectric, quasi&#8208;paraelectric, and ferroelectric nanoregions are responsible for the slim double hysteresis loops of relaxor&#8208;like antiferroelectric. Such nanosized multistate configurations break the common belief of single&#8208;phase antiferroelectric nanodomains.








Abstract
Antiferroelectric materials have garnered significant attention for their potential applications in high&#8208;power capacitors. Among the four technically important types of ferroelectric states&#8208;classical ferroelectric, relaxor ferroelectric, antiferroelectric, and relaxor antiferroelectric&#8208;the first three have well&#8208;defined physical pictures, while the fourth remains contentious. Here, atomic&#8208;scale in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy is demonstrated to provide a clear resolution to this long&#8208;standing issue. The temperature&#8208;dependent configurational evolution during the transition from room&#8208;temperature classical antiferroelectric to high&#8208;temperature relaxor&#8208;like antiferroelectric in (Pb,La)(Zr,Sn,Ti)O3 materials is directly observed. The nanosized multistate configurations formed during transformation, which encompass antiferroelectric, quasi&#8208;paraelectric, and ferroelectric nanoregions, are responsible for the slim double hysteresis loops characteristic of relaxor&#8208;like antiferroelectric. These findings offer new guidelines for validating the physical models essential for the development of high&#8208;performance relaxor&#8208;like antiferroelectrics.

         <title>Azepination&#8208;Induced Frontier Molecular Orbital Delocalization of Multiple Resonance Emitters: Constructing Highly Efficient Narrowband Electroluminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for azepination&#8208;induced frontier molecular orbital (FMO) delocalization of multiple resonance (MR) emitters is proposed to construct long&#8208;wavelength MR materials. Organic light&#8208;emitting diode based on m&#8208;PAz&#8208;BNCz exhibits excellent electroluminescence performances with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.26, 0.70) and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 36.2%.








Abstract
Developing diversified construction strategies for high&#8208;color&#8208;purity and efficient multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials is a major strategic demand to meet the requirements of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) displays, posing a significant challenge to the design and synthesis of emitters at the molecular level. Herein, a strategy is proposed for azepination&#8208;induced frontier molecular orbital (FMO) delocalization of MR emitters, that is, embedding azepine into the prototype molecule BNCz can effectively improve the &#960;&#8208;conjugation degree and extend the FMO delocalization, thereby constructing a series of long&#8208;wavelength MR&#8208;TADF materials with narrowband emission. Through an intramolecular Scholl reaction, these target molecules with an azepine&#8208;embedded core are afforded by one&#8208;fold heptagonal cyclization of BNCz core and the phenyl ring attached to (aromatic amine&#8208;substituted) aryl precursor. They all exhibit efficient green emission around 520&#160;nm and narrow full&#8208;widths at half&#8208;maximum (FWHMs) of &#8804; 37&#160;nm in toluene. OLEDs employing these emitters show excellent electroluminescence (EL) performances, among which m&#8208;PAz&#8208;BNCz&#8208;based OLED exhibits the optimal EL performances with a peak of 528&#160;nm, a FWHM of 37&#160;nm, Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.26, 0.70), and a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.2%.

         <title>Simultaneously Tailoring Hydrostability and Photoelectroactivity in Heterocluster Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first heterocluster&#8208;based crystalline MOF photocatalysts integrating copper&#8208;sulfur and copper&#8208;halide clusters are obtained through the heterocluster assembly engineering and localized microenvironment regulation, demonstrating an unprecedented synergistic enhancement of hydrostability and photoelectroactivity, facilitating the efficient synthesis of green hydrogen at an exceptionally high rate under visible light.








Abstract
The simultaneous enhancement of structural stability and photoelectroactivity in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) remains a critical challenge for sustainable photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production. Herein, an atomically&#8208;precise heterocluster assembly approach is presented to construct two isostructural 3D MOFs, CuSL&#8208;CuX (X = Cl, Br), featuring a cds net. CuSL&#8208;CuXs integrate hexanuclear copper&#8208;sulfur {Cu6S6} cluster and dinuclear copper&#8208;halogen {Cu2X2} cluster, which not only impart exceptional stability across a broad pH range (1&#8211;14) but also enable wide visible&#8208;light absorption, tailored redox potentials, and efficient charge&#8208;carrier dynamics. Notably, halogen substitution markedly boosts photocatalytic activity: CuSL&#8208;CuBr achieves an efficient H2 evolution rate of 50.28&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 without noble metals, doubling that of CuSL&#8208;CuCl (26.99&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) and surpassing most reported MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Both experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that bromine substitution optimizes electronic structure, refines orbital distribution, and accelerates charge separation, ultimately leading to promoted photocatalytic efficiency. This research provides insights into the structure&#8208;property interplay in heterocluster MOFs and establishes a paradigm for designing robust, high&#8208;performance photocatalysts through precise cluster engineering.

         <title>Suppression of Charge Recombination Induced by Solid Additive Assisting Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency over 20%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work highlights the strong morphological optimization capacity of the solid additive DIDOB and elucidates its impact on molecular packing to suppress both bimolecular and geminate recombination in OSCs. As a result, DIDOB not only demonstrates universality in various non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based OSCs but also achieves an impressive efficiency of 20.11% with a remarkable fill factor of 81.8% in the D18:PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based device.








Abstract
A volatile solid additive strategy, which can effectively optimize the morphology of the photoactive layer with an ideal domain size and purity, has emerged as a promising approach to improve the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the precise role of solid additives in modulating charge and exciton dynamics, especially the recombination process, remains not fully understand. In this study, a solid additive, 1,4&#8208;diiodo&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxybenzene (DIDOB), is developed to improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs and conduct a comprehensive investigation into its effect on the charge recombination process. As a result, the PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X&#8208;based binary OSC processed with DIDOB achieves an excellent efficiency of 19.75% with a remarkable fill factor of 81.9%, owing to the optimal fiber network morphology, tighter and ordered molecular packing, as well as the suppression of both bimolecular and geminate recombination. Notably, the DIDOB exhibits broad universality as an additive in other non&#8208;fullerene acceptor&#8208;based OSCs. Impressively, the D18:PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based ternary device processed with DIDOB yielded an excellent efficiency of 20.11% (certified as 20.03%). This work highlights the effect of the solid additive on the charge recombination process within active layer and provides insights for the further development of OSCs.

         <title>Salt&#8208;Segregated Solid Polymer Electrolytes for High&#8208;Rate Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a salt&#8208;segregation strategy for solid polymer electrolytes, which decouples surface and bulk salt distribution to form an ion&#8208;enriched surface layer. The design dramatically enhances the lithium deposition kinetics and suppresses parasitic reactions, empowering Li||LiFePO4 solid&#8208;state batteries with exceptional cycling over 20&#160;000 cycles at high&#8208;rate of 1.12&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;polymer electrolytes (SPEs) demonstrate great potential for solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs), however, interfacial instability and sluggish ion transport at the interface critically hinder their high&#8208;rate capability and long&#8208;term stability. Here, a novel salt&#8208;segregation methodology with spatial salt grade for SPEs is introduced. This approach leverages the differential solubility of lithium salts and PVDF matrix in a commercially available fluoroethylene carbonate during fabrication, which drives the formation of an ion&#8208;enriched surface layer. The strategy simultaneously enhances interfacial and bulk ionic conductivity while effectively mitigating parasitic reactions. These advancements optimize Li+ flux at the lithium metal interphase, promoting a spherical Li growth with minimized surface area and leading to dense lithium deposition. Consequently, the engineered SPE achieves a remarkable cycling of 500&#160;h in Li||Li cells at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Solid&#8208;state Li||LiFePO4 cells exhibit a record stability for 20&#160;000 cycles at 1.12 A&#160;g&#8722;1 (2&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 LiFePO4 cathode), and a high capacity of 147&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 over 300 cycles at 0.84&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 under a high&#8208;loading 2&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 cathode. The strategy addresses interfacial limitations in SPEs and further introduces a paradigm shift by emphasizing the critical role of spatial salt&#8208;graded engineering at the surface over uniform ion distribution for stabilizing high&#8208;rate SSLBs.

         <title>Enhanced Deformability Through Distributed Buckling in Stiff Quasicrystalline Architected Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasi&#8208;periodic metamaterials combine stiffness and large&#8208;strain deformability, overcoming limitations of traditional stretching&#8208;dominated periodic designs that are prone to global buckling instabilities and catastrophic layer collapses. By leveraging non&#8208;uniform force chains, they achieve high isotropic stiffness, stable deformation, and remarkable failure resistance. Supported by numerical and experimental results, these advances open pathways for low&#8208;density applications in impact resistance and energy absorption.








Abstract
Architected materials achieve unique mechanical properties through precisely engineered microstructures that minimize material usage. However, a key challenge of low&#8208;density materials is balancing high stiffness with stable deformability up to large strains. Current microstructures, which employ slender elements such as thin beams and plates arranged in periodic patterns to optimize stiffness, are largely prone to instabilities, including buckling and brittle collapse at low strains. This challenge is here addressed by introducing a new class of aperiodic architected materials inspired by quasicrystalline lattices. Beam networks derived from canonical quasicrystalline patterns, such as the Penrose tiling in two dimensions and icosahedral quasicrystals (IQCs)&#160;in three dimensions, are shown to create stiff, stretching&#8208;dominated topologies with non&#8208;uniform force chain distributions, effectively mitigating the global instabilities observed in periodic designs through distributed localized buckling instabilities. Numerical and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of these designs in combining stiffness and stable deformability at large strains, representing a significant advancement in the development of low&#8208;density metamaterials for applications requiring high impact resistance and energy absorption. These results demonstrate the potential of deterministic quasi&#8208;periodic topologies to bridge the gap between periodic and random structures, while branching toward uncharted territory in the property space of architected&#160;materials.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Photonic Battery Enabling Dynamic Radiative Thermal Management and Power Supply</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;functional photonic battery is proposed for dynamic radiative cooling, energy storage and recycling. The dynamic thermal regulation properties significantly reduce building energy consumption and CO&#8322; emissions. Meanwhile, its efficient energy storage and recycling capacities can minimize or even eliminate household power outage durations. This innovative approach advances sustainable building practices and contributes to global carbon neutrality and sustainability efforts.








Abstract
Dynamic thermal management materials are pivotal for advancing energy&#8208;efficient buildings and promoting global sustainability. However, existing materials typically offer only a single&#8208;function of temperature regulation, lacking the integrated power supply capability essential for sustaining indoor activities and building sustainability, particularly in the face of frequent power outages. A photonic battery that combines all&#8208;season dynamic radiative thermoregulation with electrical power supply in a single silicon&#8208;based unit is demonstrated. This device delivers dual functionality with high infrared emissivity regulation (0.53 at 8&#8211;13&#160;&#181;m) and superior energy storage performance, featuring a high specific capacity (&#8776;3271 mAh g&#8722;1), areal capacity (&#8776;0.38 mAh cm&#8722;2), and efficient energy recycling (71.6%). A reversible ion&#8208;interaction&#8208;induced phase change mechanism, enabling continuous and non&#8208;volatile electro&#8208;optical&#8208;thermal transformation and significant infrared tunability, is proposed. Our simulations indicate that the implementation of these dynamic materials into buildings could significantly reduce energy consumption by up to 18.4%, equating to 544.8 GJ, and achieve an annual reduction in CO2 emissions of 124.1 tons. This work paves the way for the development of energy&#8208;saving electro&#8208;driven dynamic materials, marking a significant step forward in global sustainability initiatives.

         <title>Reprogrammable Mechanical Metamaterials via Passive and Active Magnetic Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of flexible matrices with embedded hard&#8208;magnetic nodes enables metastructures with reprogrammable mechanical properties, even in the absence of external magnetic fields. The evolving interaction between nodes during structural deformation allows mechanical tunability under quasi&#8208;static and dynamic loading, and bistable transitions. This approach enables engineered structural components with adaptable mechanical responses, reprogrammable via magnetic element redistribution or applied fields.








Abstract
This study experimentally demonstrates the reprogrammability of a rotating&#8208;squares&#8208;based mechanical metamaterial with an embedded array of permanent magnets. How the orientation, residual magnetization, and stiffness of the magnets influence both the static and dynamic responses of the metamaterial is systematically investigated. It is showed that by carefully tuning the magnet orientation within the metamaterial, notable tunability of the metamaterial response can be achieved across static and dynamic regimes. More complex magnetic node configurations can optimize specific structural responses by decoupling the tunability of quasi&#8208;static stress&#8211;strain behavior from energy absorption under impact loading. Additionally, reprogrammability can be further enhanced by an external magnetic field, which modulates magnetic interactions within the structure. This work paves the way for developing engineered structural components with adaptable mechanical responses, reprogrammable through either the redistribution of magnetic elements or the application of an external magnetic&#160;field.

         <title>Mechanically Enhanced, Environmentally Stable, and Bioinspired Charge&#8208;Gradient Hydrogel Membranes for Efficient Ion Gradient Power Generation and Linear Self&#8208;Powered Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the presence of an ion gradient, the constructed charge gradients in the ultrathin ion&#8208;selective hydrogel membranes of hydrogel solid&#8208;state electric organ accelerate ion transport while mitigating ion concentration polarization, achieving high electrical output performance. More interestingly, the prepared device can still be applied as a linear self&#8208;powered pressure sensor after the ion gradient is completely dissipated.








Abstract
The soft hydrogel power source is an interesting example of generating electricity from clean energy. However, ion&#8208;selective hydrogel membranes in the systems are often limited by low ion selectivity, high membrane resistance, insufficient mass transfer, and ion concentration polarization, resulting in a generally low power output. Inspired by the unique structure of the electric ray's electric organ, a vertically stacked hydrogel artificial electric organ is proposed, aiming to increase the output current to a greater extent. By constructing the charge gradient in ultrathin ion&#8208;selective hydrogel membranes, ion transport is accelerated while mitigating the ion concentration polarization.

&lt;p&gt;In the presence of an ion gradient, the constructed charge gradients in the ultrathin ion-selective hydrogel membranes of hydrogel solid-state electric organ accelerate ion transport while mitigating ion concentration polarization, achieving high electrical output performance. More interestingly, the prepared device can still be applied as a linear self-powered pressure sensor after the ion gradient is completely dissipated.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soft hydrogel power source is an interesting example of generating electricity from clean energy. However, ion-selective hydrogel membranes in the systems are often limited by low ion selectivity, high membrane resistance, insufficient mass transfer, and ion concentration polarization, resulting in a generally low power output. Inspired by the unique structure of the electric ray's electric organ, a vertically stacked hydrogel artificial electric organ is proposed, aiming to increase the output current to a greater extent. By constructing the charge gradient in ultrathin ion-selective hydrogel membranes, ion transport is accelerated while mitigating the ion concentration polarization. A single hydrogel artificial electric organ achieves high outputs of &#8776;290&#160;mV and &#8776;1.46&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with rechargeability, surpassing similar devices. Density functional theory further reveals that the energy barrier of ion transport in charge-gradient membranes is lower than that in nongradient membranes. More impressively, the device can still be applied as a linear self-powered pressure sensor for monitoring human activities after the ion gradient is completely dissipated. This study elucidates the key role of the structure and design of ion-selective membranes in the artificial gel power generation system, providing new insights into the further development and multifunctional application of flexible gel power source.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Buried Interface Regulation with a Supramolecular Assembled Template Enables High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells for Minimizing the VOC Deficit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled amphiphilic phosphonate&#8208;based supramolecule functions as a perovskite crystallization&#8208;driven template at SnO2/perovskite buried interface, which induces a highly preferred (100) orientation toward out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction, facilitates carrier extraction and transfer, passivates the intrinsic defects, and achieves a promising efficiency of 25.34%, with a maximum VOC of 1.23 V, corresponding to the lowest reported 0.306 V deficit.








Abstract
Despite the rapid development of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in the past decade, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of PSCs still lags behind the theoretical Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit. Energy&#8208;level mismatch and unwanted nonradiative recombination at key interfaces are the main factors detrimental to VOC. Herein, a perovskite crystallization&#8208;driven template is constructed at the SnO2/perovskite buried interface through a self&#8208;assembled amphiphilic phosphonate derivative. The highly oriented supramolecular template grows from an evolutionary selection growth via solid&#8211;solid phase transition. This strategy induces perovskite crystallization into a highly preferred (100) orientation toward out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction and facilitated carrier extraction and transfer due to the elimination of energy barrier. This self&#8208;assembly process positively passivates the intrinsic surface defects at the SnO2/perovskite interface through the functionalized moieties, a marked contrast to the passive effect achieved via incidental contacts in conventional passivation methods. As a result, PSCs with buried interface modification exhibit a promising PCE of 25.34%, with a maximum VOC of 1.23&#160;V, corresponding to a mere 0.306&#160;V deficit (for perovskite bandgap of 1.536&#160;eV), reaching 97.2% of the theoretical VOC limit. This strategy spontaneously improves the long&#8208;term operational stability of PSCs under thermal and moisture stress (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3: MPP, 65 &#176;C, 50% RH, T92 lifetime exceeding 1200&#160;h).

         <title>Ferromagnetic Atomic d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization for Promoting Al&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>

This research investigates the reasons for the different polysulfide conversion abilities of ferromagnetic single&#8208;atom catalysts with varying electronic structures, indicating that spin polarization caused by unpaired electrons in 3d orbitals affects polysulfide conversion. Combined with different characterizations, the PC&#8208;SAFe has a higher number of unpaired electrons, exhibits stronger catalytic activity, promoting the conversion of S and thereby enhancing electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum&#8208;sulfur batteries (Al&#8208;S) are emerging as a promising alternative energy storage system beyond lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their high energy density, abundant material resources, and economic efficiency. However, their practical application remains challenged by sluggish conversion kinetics, polysulfide shuttling, and low sulfur cathode utilization. While extensive studies have focused on enhancing polysulfide adsorption through catalytic strategies, the roles of electronic structure in dictating catalytic performance remain underexplored. Here, this work unveils the critical effect of unpaired electronic structure on the catalytic performance of single atom ferromagnetic transition metals through a systematic evaluation of three typical atomically dispersed ferromagnetic single atoms&#8212;Fe, Co, and Ni&#8212;supported on porous carbon (denoted as PC&#8208;SAFAs). Comprehensive characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the PC&#8208;SAFe catalysts, exhibiting the highest spin polarization arising from unpaired electrons, demonstrate the strongest interactions with polysulfide, thereby facilitating rapid and reversible polysulfide conversion reactions. Consequently, Al&#8208;S batteries incorporating the optimized PC&#8208;SAFe cathode achieve an impressive specific capacity of 508.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1.0 A g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles, along with much improved rate capability. This work provides a deeper understanding of the role of electronic structure in catalytic chemistry, and offers new insights for developing high&#8208;performance Al&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>On&#8208;Chip Active Supercoupled Topological Cavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The on&#8208;chip supercoupled cavity device is demonstrated realizing a record cavity excitation distance exceeding three wavelengths, leveraging the valley&#8208;conserved supercoupling mechanism in the valley Hall topological system. This optothermal tunable design enables new degrees of freedom for supercoupled photonic cavities in mux&#8208;demux, lasers, sensors, spectrometers, and on&#8208;chip communication systems.








Abstract
On&#8208;chip photonic resonant cavity plays a critical role in widespread applications including lasing, sensing, and spectroscopy. However, the excitation of these cavities typically relies on evanescent coupling within sub&#8208;wavelength distances, limiting flexible and precise chip integration. Here, an on&#8208;chip supercoupled topological cavity is demonstrated which is critically coupled at 2.3&#8208;wavelength distance from a bus waveguide and remains excited even at 3.2 wavelengths, based on the supercoupling mechanism enabled by the valley vortex flow. Optothermal heating facilitates tunable quality factors and dynamic control of the supercoupling condition, allowing transitions from overcoupling to undercoupling through the critical point. The discovery extends the waveguide&#8208;cavity excitation distance to multiple wavelengths, unlocking new possibilities for designing and controlling on&#8208;chip resonant devices, including supercoupled lasers, sensors, and modulators.

         <title>Engineering Lattice Distortion in Ruthenium Oxide Enables Robust Acidic Water Oxidation via Direct O&#8211;O Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to significantly enhance both the stability and activity of RuO2 by switching the catalytic mechanism from AEM to OPM, is introduced. This is achieved through lattice distortion engineering using a co&#8208;doping strategy involving large&#8208;radius ions (Na&#8314; and Hf&#8201;4+). The as&#8208;prepared Na/Hf&#8208;RuO2 is stable at 0.5&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 over 85 h in a PEM water electrolyzer.








Abstract
Ruthenium is considered one of the most promising alternatives to iridium as an anode electrocatalyst for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). However, Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts suffer from poor stability, primarily due to structural collapse under the harsh acidic conditions of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, a design strategy is introduced that significantly enhances both the stability and activity of RuO2 by switching the catalytic mechanism from the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to the oxide pathway mechanism (OPM). This is achieved through lattice distortion engineering using a co&#8208;doping strategy involving large&#8208;radius ions (Na&#8314; and Hf&#8201;4+). The incorporation of Na+ and Hf&#8201;4+ into RuO2 induces significant lattice distortion, shortening partial Ru&#9472;Ru bond distance and optimizing the electronic structure. This modification facilitates direct O&#8211;O radical coupling, as confirmed by in situ vibrational measurements and theoretical calculations. It can drive a current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 in a PEMWE device at 60&#160;&#176;C with 1.646&#160;V and operates stably for 85 h at 0.5&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. The present study highlights that optimizing the synergistic interaction between two adjacent Ru sites to promote direct O&#8211;O coupling is an effective strategy for enhancing the acidic OER performance of RuO2.

The as-prepared Na/Hf-RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is stable at 0.5&#160;A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over 85 h in a PEM water electrolyzer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruthenium is considered one of the most promising alternatives to iridium as an anode electrocatalyst for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). However, Ru-based electrocatalysts suffer from poor stability, primarily due to structural collapse under the harsh acidic conditions of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, a design strategy is introduced that significantly enhances both the stability and activity of RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by switching the catalytic mechanism from the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) to the oxide pathway mechanism (OPM). This is achieved through lattice distortion engineering using a co-doping strategy involving large-radius ions (Na&#8314; and Hf&#8201;&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;). The incorporation of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Hf&#8201;&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; into RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; induces significant lattice distortion, shortening partial Ru&#9472;Ru bond distance and optimizing the electronic structure. This modification facilitates direct O&#8211;O radical coupling, as confirmed by in situ vibrational measurements and theoretical calculations. It can drive a current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a PEMWE device at 60&#160;&#176;C with 1.646&#160;V and operates stably for 85 h at 0.5&#160;A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The present study highlights that optimizing the synergistic interaction between two adjacent Ru sites to promote direct O&#8211;O coupling is an effective strategy for enhancing the acidic OER performance of RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic GelMA/DNA Dual&#8208;Network Hydrogels Promote Woven Bone Organoid Formation and Enhance Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic, dual&#8208;network CGDE hydrogel, combining covalent and noncovalent crosslinking mimics the biochemical and mechanical cues of bone extracellular matrix. This viscoelastic matrix promotes 3D cellular self&#8208;organization and drives the development of functional woven bone organoids (WBOs) through intramembranous ossification, reaching peak bioactivity at 21 days. This approach offers a robust and scalable platform for bone organoid engineering.








Abstract
Bone organoids, in vitro models mimicking native bone structure and function, rely on 3D stem cell culture for self&#8208;organization, differentiation, ECM secretion, and biomineralization, ultimately forming mineralized collagen hierarchies. However, their development is often limited by the lack of suitable matrices with optimal mechanical properties for sustained cell growth and differentiation. To address this, a dynamic DNA/Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel (CGDE) is developed to recapitulate key biochemical and mechanical features of the bone ECM, providing a supportive microenvironment for bone organoid formation. This dual&#8208;network hydrogel is engineered through hydrogen bonding between DNA and GelMA, combined with GelMA network crosslinking, resulting in appropriate mechanical strength and enhanced viscoelasticity. During a 21&#8208;day 3D culture, the CGDE hydrogel facilitates cellular migration and self&#8208;organization, promoting woven bone organoid (WBO) formation via intramembranous ossification. These WBOs exhibit spatiotemporal architectures supporting dynamic mineralization and tissue remodeling. In vivo studies demonstrate that CGDE&#8208;derived WBOs exhibit self&#8208;adaptive properties, enabling rapid osseointegration within 4 weeks. This work highlights the CGDE hydrogel as a robust and scalable platform for bone organoid development, offering new insights into bone biology and innovative strategies for bone tissue regeneration.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive CuInS2/ZnS Quantum Dot&#8208;Embedded Polymer Scaffolds for Photon Upconversion Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CuInS&#8322;/ZnS quantum dots (nCIS QDs) are developed via template&#8208;assisted cation exchange, enabling photon upconversion (UC) with NIR&#8208;I emission, a large Stokes shift (&#8776;650 meV), and high PLQY (&#8776;0.95). The QDs are incorporated into a 3D&#8208;printed polymer matrix, forming a scaffold with strong optical contrast under UC imaging. This system enables high&#8208;contrast NIR imaging for surgical guidance, even under interference layers.








Abstract
A facile synthesis and application of photon upconversion (UC) probes, CuInS&#8322;/ZnS quantum dots (nCIS QDs) is presented, which exhibits&#160;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral emission. The nCIS QDs are synthesized via a template&#8208;assisted cation&#8208;exchange reaction during a heating process, resulting in NIR&#8208;I emission with a large Stokes shift (&#8776;650 meV) and a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY, &#8776;0.95). This behavior is attributed to a template&#8208;assisted cation&#8208;exchange mechanism that produces a wurtzite crystal structure and deep defect states, leading to a relatively long fluorescence lifetime (&#8776;5 &#181;s). The quantum confinement effect allows for the emission of light at different wavelengths by adjusting the size of the nanocrystals. Moreover, their deep defect states facilitate photon UC via a self&#8208;trapping triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation mechanism. The promising potential of the nCIS QDs is explored in UC imaging, demonstrating high&#8208;contrast NIR imaging under IR vision modules, even in the presence of interference layers. It suggests potential applications in surgical guidance and future biomedical imaging.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Switchable Gas&#8208;Humidity Difunctional Flexible Chemosensors Based on Smart Adaptable Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research proposes self&#8208;powered difunctional flexible chemosensors by using a specially designed smart adaptable ion&#8208;introduced hydrogel to address the issue of single perception function in wearable devices, which can be highly sensitive and crosstalk&#8208;free to accurately assess oxygen and humidity levels in different states, and is expected to be widely used in the fields of safety, health and non&#8208;contact human&#8208;machine interaction.








Abstract
The development of self&#8208;powered, flexible, and multi&#8208;function sensors is highly anticipated in wearable electronics, however, it remains a daunting challenge to identify different signals based on a single device with singular sensing material without algorithmic support. Here, a smart adaptable hydrogel is developed by co&#8208;introducing two ions with vastly different hydrophilicity for the construction of an electrochemically self&#8208;powered, flexible, and reversibly switchable difunctional chemosensor with a metal&#8208;air battery structure. The prepared hydrogel can readily switch between water&#8208;rich and water&#8208;deficient states for crosstalk&#8208;free detection of oxygen and humidity respectively, since O2 gas and water molecules can directly participate in the oxygen reduction reaction in the device and act alone as limiting reactants and catalysts to affect the reaction rate under different hydrogel states. The resulting sensor demonstrates breakthrough O2 and humidity sensing performance with sensitivities as high as 4170.5%/% and 380.2%/% RH in water&#8208;rich and water&#8208;deficient states, respectively, and ultrawide detection ranges. Thanks to these, the devices can be applied for real&#8208;time and remote monitoring of ambient oxygen, transcutaneous oxygen pressure changes, respiration, and skin moisture by combining with wireless communication technology, and therefore have important application prospects in the fields of safety, health management, and non&#8208;contact human&#8208;machine interaction.

         <title>Simultaneous Heavy&#8208;Metal Ion Adsorption and Electricity Generation From Wastewater via &#8220;Heavy&#8208;Metal Removal Batteries&#8221;</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heavy&#8208;metal removal battery is designed, which displays the capacity of simultaneous heavy&#8208;metal ion adsorption and electricity generation. In such battery, the heavy&#8208;metal ion adsorption is driven by the potential difference between adsorption electrodes and metal electrodes. Furthermore, a chemical oxidation strategy is developed to desorb heavy&#8208;metal ions from adsorption electrodes, achieving the recycling of the electrodes.








Abstract
The heavy&#8208;metal ion in wastewater is a great threat to the health of both humans and ecosystems. The common heavy&#8208;metal ion removal strategies usually suffer from energy consumption and poor recyclability. Herein, a heavy&#8208;metal removal battery is designed by constructing a two&#8208;chamber configuration. Such battery displays the capacity of simultaneous heavy&#8208;metal ion adsorption and electricity output, where heavy&#8208;metal ion adsorption is driven by the potential difference between adsorption electrodes and metal electrodes, and electricity is generated continuously during the adsorption process. Significantly, various heavy&#8208;metal ions (e.g., Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Cr3+ and Pb2+ ions) can be removed due to the large lattice spacing of active materials in adsorption electrodes, displaying the universality of adsorbing heavy&#8208;metal ions from wastewater. In addition, an environmental&#8208;friendly chemical oxidation strategy is developed to desorb heavy&#8208;metal ions from adsorption electrodes, which not only produces high&#8208;quality metal salts, but also reduces the toxicity of sludge in the case of secondary pollution. Impressively, these heavy&#8208;metal removal batteries can be easily scaled up and integrated to extend the heavy&#8208;metal ion adsorption ability and voltage/current output. This work proves a creative approach for simultaneous heavy&#8208;metal ion removal and electricity generation from wastewater.

In addition, an environmental-friendly chemical oxidation strategy is developed to desorb heavy-metal ions from adsorption electrodes, which not only produces high-quality metal salts, but also reduces the toxicity of sludge in the case of secondary pollution. Impressively, these heavy-metal removal batteries can be easily scaled up and integrated to extend the heavy-metal ion adsorption ability and voltage/current output. This work proves a creative approach for simultaneous heavy-metal ion removal and electricity generation from wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Entropy Alloy Formation Derived from High Entropy Oxide: Unlocking the Active Sites for Green Methanol Production from CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 24, June 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a high&#8208;entropy&#8208;based material for CO2 reduction to methanol, offering scalability and simplicity. Fe facilitates high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) formation, leading to a high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) with enhanced CO2 conversion efficiency. Spectroscopic studies and Theoretical calculations identify active sites, while in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) reveals mechanistic changes. Life&#8208;cycle assessment confirms a carbon&#8208;negative footprint.








Abstract
In pursuit of novel materials for CO2&#160;conversion to value&#8208;added chemicals, previous research has predominantly focused on copper&#8208;based, indium oxide (In2O3)&#8208;based, and alloy or intermetallic materials. However, a groundbreaking approach is presented by introducing a high&#8208;entropy&#8208;based material for CO2&#160;reduction to methanol (CH3OH). This method offers scalability and simplicity, making it feasible for large&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloys (HEAs). The formation of HEA is facilitated by the presence of Fe, leads to the creation of a high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) during calcination. Through X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), comprehensively analyzed the oxidation states and coordination environments of all metals in both HEO and HEA. The formation of Fe3O4&#160;within the HEO structure is evident, with each metal occupying either tetrahedral (Td) or octahedral (Oh) sites. The HEA formed shows exceptional CO2&#160;conversion efficiency and higher CH3OH selectivity. Isolated sites of Co, Ni with Fe, Cu, and Zn, along with CuZn pair, are considered as the active sites for CO2 to CH3OH and further determined by DFT calculations. The altered reaction mechanism upon HEA formation compared to individual metals is investigated using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). Finally, Life&#8208;cycle assessment (LCA) indicates the carbon&#8208;negative footprint.

         <title>Promotion of C&#9472;C Coupling in the CO2 Electrochemical Reduction to Valuable C2+ Products: From Micro&#8208;Foundation to Macro&#8208;Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promotion of C&#9472;C Coupling in electrochemical reduction of CO2 to valuable C2+ products is reviewed from microcosmic to macroscopic. The discussed advances and outstanding challenges in the strategies of efficient catalyst design, the influence of local environment in electrolyte, and the design of potential industrial flow cells provided the guidelines for future research in promoted C&#9472;C coupling from foundation to application.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to valuable C2+ products emerges as a promising strategy for converting intermittent renewable energy into high&#8208;energy&#8208;density fuels and feedstock. Leveraging its substantial commercial potential and compatibility with existing energy infrastructure, the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into multicarbon hydrocarbons and oxygenates (C2+) holds great industrial promise. However, the process is hampered by complex multielectron&#8208;proton transfer reactions and difficulties in reactant activation, posing significant thermodynamic and kinetic barriers to the commercialization of C2+ production. Addressing these barriers necessitates a comprehensive approach encompassing multiple facets, including the effective control of C&#9472;C coupling in industrial electrolyzers using efficient catalysts in optimized local environments. This review delves into the advancements and outstanding challenges spanning from the microcosmic to macroscopic scales, including the design of nanocatalysts, optimization of the microenvironment, and the development of macroscopic electrolyzers. By elucidating the influence of the local electrolyte environment, and exploring the design of potential industrial flow cells, guidelines are provided for future research aimed at promoting C&#9472;C coupling, thereby bridging microscopic insights and macroscopic applications in the field of CO2 electroreduction.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Quantum Wires and Nanorods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on low&#8208;dimensional perovskite materials and discusses their applications in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Special attention is given to the introduction of perovskite quantum wires and nanorods, two unique types of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) materials, and their interesting optoelectronic properties. Moreover, the applications of low&#8208;dimensional perovskite materials can extend beyond LEDs to others, such as photodetectors and memristors.








Abstract
Perovskite materials, celebrated for their exceptional optoelectronic properties, have seen extensive application in the field of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), where research is as abundant as the proverbial &#8220;carloads of books.&#8221; In this review, the research of perovskite materials is delved into from a dimensional perspective, with a focus on the exemplary performance of low&#8208;dimensional perovskite materials in LEDs. This discussion predominantly revolves around perovskite quantum wires and perovskite nanorods. Perovskite quantum wires are versatile in their growth, compatible with both solution&#8208;based and vapor&#8208;phase growth, and can be deposited over large areas&#8212;even on spherical substrates&#8212;to achieve commendable electroluminescence (EL). Perovskite nanorods, on the other hand, boast a suite of superior characteristics, such as polarization properties and tunability of the transition dipole moment, endowing them with the great potential to enhance light extraction efficiency. Furthermore, zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) perovskite materials like nanocrystals (NCs) are also the subject of widespread research and application. This review reflects on and synthesizes the unique qualities of the aforementioned materials while exploring their vital roles in the development of high&#8208;efficiency perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs).

This review addresses gaps in current research, particularly in sound field analysis and energy efficiency optimization. It proposes an energy flow diagram, discusses development stages, and explores the potential advancements in ultrasound&#8208;based healthcare solutions.








Abstract
Implantable medical devices (IMDs), like pacemakers regulating heart rhythm or deep brain stimulators treating neurological disorders, revolutionize healthcare. However, limited battery life necessitates frequent surgeries for replacements. Ultrasound power transfer (UPT) emerges as a promising solution for sustainable IMD operation. Current research prioritizes implantable materials, with less emphasis on sound field analysis and maximizing energy transfer during wireless power delivery. This review addresses this gap. A comprehensive analysis of UPT technology, examining cutting&#8208;edge system designs, particularly in power supply and efficiency is provided. The review critically examines existing efficiency models, summarizing the key parameters influencing energy transmission in UPT systems. For the first time, an energy flow diagram of a general UPT system is proposed to offer insights into the overall functioning. Additionally, the review explores the development stages of UPT technology, showcasing representative designs and applications. The remaining challenges, future directions, and exciting opportunities associated with UPT are discussed. By highlighting the importance of sustainable IMDs with advanced functions like biosensing and closed&#8208;loop drug delivery, as well as UPT's potential, this review aims to inspire further research and advancements in this promising field.

The development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries offers higher specific energies and lower costs compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, a lack of mechanistic understanding hinders advancement. This review analyzes key electrode parameters, evaluates progress in enhancing ion/electron percolation, and addresses electrochemical&#8208;mechanical degradation, offering future research directions.








Abstract
The development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) toward large&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage is driven by the higher specific energies and lower cost in comparison with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ion batteries. Yet, insufficient mechanistic understanding and quantitative parameters of the key components in sulfur&#8208;based cathode hinders the advancement of the ASSLSB technologies. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of electrode parameters, including specific capacity, voltage, S mass loading and S content toward establishing the specific energy (Wh kg&#8722;1) and energy density (Wh L&#8722;1) of the ASSLSBs. Additionally, this work critically evaluates the progress in enhancing lithium ion and electron percolation and mitigating electrochemical&#8208;mechanical degradation in sulfur&#8208;based cathodes. Last, a critical outlook on potential future research directions is provided to guide the rational design of high&#8208;performance sulfur&#8208;based cathodes toward practical ASSLSBs.

         <title>Materials, Structure, and Interface of Stretchable Interconnects for Wearable Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretchable interconnects are one of the fundamental components in achieving robust wearable devices, but their importance is often overlooked. This review highlights their importance and provides insightful information on various materials, configurations, and manufacturing approaches being studied for interconnects. Their practical potentials for wearable bioelectronics are also discussed for future research opportunities.








Abstract
Since wearable technologies for telemedicine have emerged to tackle global health concerns, the demand for well&#8208;attested wearable healthcare devices with high user comfort also arises. Skin&#8208;wearables for health monitoring require mechanical flexibility and stretchability for not only high compatibility with the skin's dynamic nature but also a robust collection of fine health signals from within. Stretchable electrical interconnects, which determine the device's overall integrity, are one of the fundamental units being understated in wearable bioelectronics. In this review, a broad class of materials and engineering methodologies recently researched and developed are presented, and their respective attributes, limitations, and opportunities in designing stretchable interconnects for wearable bioelectronics are offered. Specifically, the electrical and mechanical characteristics of various materials (metals, polymers, carbons, and their composites) are highlighted, along with their compatibility with diverse geometric configurations. Detailed insights into fabrication techniques that are compatible with soft substrates are also provided. Importantly, successful examples of establishing reliable interfacial connections between soft and rigid elements using novel interconnects are reviewed. Lastly, some perspectives and prospects of remaining research challenges and potential pathways for practical utilization of interconnects in wearables are laid out.

         <title>Rational Modulation of Interface Microenvironment and Design of the Flow Electrolyzer for COx Electroreduction to Alcohol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the current status of microenvironment regulation of catalytic reaction interface, flow electrolyzers design, and the flow electrolyzers derived stepwise approaches for COxRR to alcohol, aiming to provide new insights into the production of alcohols via COxRR.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction of COx (including CO2 and CO) into value&#8208;added fuels and chemicals, particularly multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) alcohols, presents a significant opportunity to close the manmade carbon cycle and support sustainable energy systems. The catalytic performance of electrochemical reduction reactions of CO2 and CO (COxRR)&#160;is strongly correlated with the local microenvironments, the flow electrolyzer, and the catalysis approaches with flow electrolyzers, which contribute to the kinetic and thermodynamic landscape of the reaction, ultimately determining the efficiency and selectivity of the COxRR toward desired reduction products. However, controllable microenvironment construction, rationally designed flow electrolyzers, and matchable flow electrolyzers derived catalysis approaches chosen for improving COxRR&#8208;to&#8208;alcohol performance still face challenges. Building upon the foundation laid by previous research, this review article will provide an in&#8208;depth summary of the regulation of the catalytic reaction interface microenvironment, the design of flow electrolyzers, and the development of derived stepwise catalysis approaches with the flow electrolyzers, which provide a comprehensive and strategic approach to enhancing the COxRR process for alcohol production, offering valuable insights and innovative solutions that can significantly impact the field of COxRR conversion to alcohol and contribute to the development of more sustainable chemical production methods.

         <title>Pushing Radiative Cooling Technology to Real Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiative cooling controls surface optical properties for solar and thermal radiation, offering solutions for global warming and energy savings. Despite significant advances, key challenges remain: optimizing optical efficiency, maintaining aesthetics, preventing overcooling, enhancing durability, and enabling scalable production. This review explores advanced solutions in material design and fabrication to guide future research and industrial applications.








Abstract
Radiative cooling is achieved by controlling surface optical behavior toward solar and thermal radiation, offering promising solutions for mitigating global warming, promoting energy saving, and enhancing environmental protection. Despite significant efforts to develop optical surfaces in various forms, five primary challenges remain for practical applications: enhancing optical efficiency, maintaining appearance, managing overcooling, improving durability, and enabling scalable manufacturing. However, a comprehensive review bridging these gaps is currently lacking. This work begins by introducing the optical fundamentals of radiative cooling and its potential applications. It then explores the challenges and discusses advanced solutions through structural design, material selection, and fabrication processes. It aims to provide guidance for future research and industrial development of radiative cooling technology.

This review comprehensively explores recent advancements in these polymeric materials, while also delving into the remaining challenges and proposing practical design strategies for their future optimization.








Abstract
Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) hold exceptional promise as next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technology, where both perovskite absorbers and charge&#8208;transporting materials (CTMs) play critical roles in cell performance. In recent years, polymeric CTMs have played an important role in developing efficient, stable, and large&#8208;area inverted PSCs due to their unique properties of high conductivity, tunable structures, and mechanical flexibility. This review provides a comprehensive overview of polymeric CTMs used in inverted PSCs, encompassing polymeric hole transport materials (HTMs) and electron transport materials (ETMs). the relationship between their molecular structures, modification strategies are systematically summarized and analyzed for adjusting energy levels, and improving charge extraction, enabling a deep understanding of these widely used materials. The review also explores effective strategies for designing even more efficient polymeric CTMs. Finally, an outlook is proposed on the exciting research of novel polymeric CTMs, paving the way for their commercialized applications in PSCs.

         <title>Engineering CAR&#8208;T Therapeutics for Enhanced Solid Tumor Targeting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CART cell therapy has proven effective for blood cancers but struggles with solid tumors due to diverse antigens and complex environments. Recent efforts focus on improving CAR design and validation platforms. Advances in protein engineering, machine learning, and organoid systems aim to enhance CAR&#8208;T therapy against solid tumors. Some solid tumors, like neuroblastoma, have responded well in trials.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy, specifically Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)&#8208;T cell therapy, represents a significant breakthrough in treating cancers. Despite its success in hematological cancers, CAR&#8208;T exhibits limited efficacy in solid tumors, which account for more than 90% of all cancers. Solid tumors commonly present unique challenges, including antigen heterogeneity and complex tumor microenvironment (TME). To address these, efforts are being made through improvements in CAR design and the development of advanced validation platforms. While efficacy is limited, some solid tumor types, such as neuroblastoma and gastrointestinal cancers, have shown responsiveness to CAR&#8208;T therapy in recent clinical trials. In this review, it is first examined both experimental and computational strategies, such as protein engineering coupled with machine learning, developed to enhance T cell specificity. The challenges and methods associated with T cell delivery and in vivo reprogramming in solid tumors is discussed. It is also explored the advancements in engineered organoid systems, which are emerging as high&#8208;fidelity in vitro models that closely mimic the complex human TME and serve as a validation platform for CAR discovery. Collectively, these innovative engineering strategies offer the potential to revolutionize the next generation of CAR&#8208;T therapy, ultimately paving the way for more effective treatments in solid tumors.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Charging Solid&#8208;State Li Batteries: Materials, Strategies, and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review addresses challenges and recent advances in fast&#8208;charging solid&#8208;state batteries, focusing on solid electrolyte and electrode materials, as well as interfacial chemistries. The role of multiscale modeling and simulation in understanding Li+ transport and interfacial phenomena is emphasized, providing insights into materials, strategies, and future prospects for high&#8208;performance, fast&#8208;charging solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
The ability to rapidly charge batteries is crucial for widespread electrification across a number of key sectors, including transportation, grid storage, and portable electronics. Nevertheless, conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries with organic liquid electrolytes face significant technical challenges in achieving rapid charging rates without sacrificing electrochemical efficiency and safety. Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) offer intrinsic stability and safety over their liquid counterparts, which can potentially bring exciting opportunities for fast charging applications. Yet realizing fast&#8208;charging SSBs remains challenging due to several fundamental obstacles, including slow Li+ transport within solid electrolytes, sluggish kinetics with the electrodes, poor electrode/electrolyte interfacial contact, as well as the growth of Li dendrites. This article examines fast&#8208;charging SSB challenges through a comprehensive review of materials and strategies for solid electrolytes (ceramics, polymers, and composites), electrodes, and their composites. In particular, methods to enhance ion transport through crystal structure engineering, compositional control, and microstructure optimization are analyzed. The review also addresses interface/interphase chemistry and Li+ transport mechanisms, providing insights to guide material design and interface optimization for next&#8208;generation fast&#8208;charging SSBs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advanced catalysts applied in thermal catalysis, microwave&#8208;assisted catalysis, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and enzymatic catalysis reaction systems for the chemical recycling of plastic waste into valuable feedstocks.








Abstract
Plastic products bring convenience to various aspects of the daily lives due to their lightweight, durability and versatility, but the massive accumulation of post&#8208;consumer plastic waste is posing significant environmental challenges. Catalytic methods can effectively convert plastic waste into value&#8208;added feedstocks, with catalysts playing an important role in regulating the yield and selectivity of products. This review explores the latest advancements in advanced catalysts applied in thermal catalysis, microwave&#8208;assisted catalysis, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and enzymatic catalysis reaction systems for the chemical recycling of plastic waste into valuable feedstocks. Specifically, the pathways and mechanisms involved in the plastics recycling process are analyzed and presented, and the strengths and weaknesses of various catalysts employed across different reaction systems are described. In addition, the structure&#8208;function relationship of these catalysts is discussed. Herein, it is provided insights into the design of novel catalysts applied for the chemical recycling of plastic waste and outline challenges and future opportunities in terms of developing advanced catalysts to tackle the &#8220;white pollution&#8221; crisis.

Abstract
In this review, the recent development of blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLED) are summarized. On deep&#8208;blue (&#8804;465&#160;nm) perovskite nanomaterials of different structural forms are mainly focused, including nanocrystals (NCs), quantum dots (QDs), nanoplatelets (NPLs), quasi&#8208;2D thin film, 3D bulk thin film, as well as lead&#8208;free perovskite nanomaterials. The current challenges are also examined in producing efficient deep&#8208;blue PeLED, such as material and spectral instability, imbalance charge transport, Joule heat impact, and poor optoelectronic performance. Several strategies are further discussed to overcome these challenges and achieve efficient deep&#8208;blue PeLED for next&#8208;generation display technology.

         <dc:description>
Incorporating tris(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;based additives, this work addresses the elimination reaction of methyl trifluoroethyl carbonate (FEMC) to contrast a homogeneous robust polymer&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase. Using the optimized electrolyte, the LiCoO2 cathode can maintain 95% after 500 cycles with a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6 V. This study establishes a foundational framework for employing linear fluorocarbonates in high voltage systems and provides innovative insights into CEI design and construction.








Abstract
Stabilizing LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode at high voltages is still challenging in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Although fluorinated solvents are utilized in high&#8208;voltage systems for their superior oxidation resistance, linear fluorinated carbonates still undergo elimination reactions at high voltages, producing corrosive substances that compromise electrode materials. This study addresses the elimination reaction of methyl trifluoroethyl carbonate (FEMC) by incorporating tris(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;based additives, thereby constructing a homogeneous and robust polymer&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI). With the incorporation of tris(trimethylsilyl)phosphite in the optimized electrolyte, the capacity of the coin cell with LCO as the cathode can maintain 95% after 500 cycles with a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6 V. This study establishes a foundational framework for employing linear fluorocarbonates in high&#8208;voltage systems and provides innovative insights into CEI design and construction.

         <title>Integrated Pristine van der Waals Homojunctions for Self&#8208;Powered Image Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pristine van der Waals homojunctions consisting of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 layers with asymmetric thickness are constructed to eliminate heterogenous interfaces and obtain clean boundaries. The layer&#8208;engineered energy bands of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 layers induce a built&#8208;in electric field at the interface, enabling self&#8208;powered photodetection. Furthermore, a 10 &#215; 10 array based on 2H&#8208;MoTe2 homojunction devices realize zero&#8208;power consumption imaging functions.








Abstract
Van der Waals junctions hold significant potentials for various applications in multifunctional and low&#8208;power electronics and optoelectronics. The multistep device fabrication process usually introduces lattice mismatch and defects at the junction interfaces, which deteriorate device performance. Here the layer engineering synthesis of van der Waals homojunctions consisting of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 with asymmetric thickness to eliminate heterogenous interfaces and thus obtain clean interfaces is reported. Experimental results confirm that the homostructure nature gives rise to the formation of pristine van der Waals junctions, avoiding chemical disorders and defects. The ability to tune the energy bands of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 continuously through layer engineering enables the creation of adjustable built&#8208;in electric field at the homojunction boundaries, which leads to the achievement of self&#8208;powered photodetection based on the obtained 2H&#8208;MoTe2 films. Furthermore, the successful integration of 2H&#8208;MoTe2 homojunctions into an image sensor with 10 &#215; 10 pixels, brings about zero&#8208;power consumption and near&#8208;infrared imaging functions. The pristine van der Waals homojunctions and effective integration strategies shed new insights into the development of large&#8208;scale application for two&#8208;dimensional&#160;materials in advanced electronics and optoelectronics.

         <title>All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries of High Cycling Stability and Rate Capability Enabled by a Self&#8208;Lithiated Sn&#8208;C Interlayer</title>

A self&#8208;lithiated tin (Sn)&#8208;carbon (C)&#160;composite interlayer (LSCI) capable of enhancing electrochemical/structural stability and homogenizing lithium (Li)&#8208;ion transport across the Li/solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) interfaces enables an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur battery (ASSLSBs) with high cycling stability and rate capability.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) have attracted intense interest due to their high theoretical energy density and intrinsic safety. However, constructing durable lithium (Li) metal anodes with high cycling efficiency in ASSLSBs remains challenging due to poor interface stability. Here, a compositionally stable, self&#8208;lithiated tin (Sn)&#8208;carbon (C) composite interlayer (LSCI) between Li anode and solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE), capable of homogenizing Li&#8208;ion transport across the interlayer, mitigating decomposition of SSE, and enhancing electrochemical/structural stability of interface, is developed for ASSLSBs. The LSCI&#8208;mediated Li metal anode enables stable Li plating/stripping over 7000&#160;h without Li dendrite penetration. The ASSLSBs equipped with LSCI thus exhibit excellent cycling stability of over 300 cycles (capacity retention of &#8776;80%) under low applied pressure (&lt;8&#160;MPa) and demonstrate improved rate capability even at 3C. The enhanced electrochemical performance and corresponding insights of the designed LSCI broaden the spectrum of advanced interlayers for interface manipulation, advancing the practical application of ASSLSBs.

         <title>Heterogeneous NASICON&#8208;Type Cathode With Reversible Multielectron Reaction for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel heterogeneous Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/Na2VTi(PO4)3 material achieves high purity and high crystallization by the mutual promotion of intergrowth structures. Benefiting from the interfacial charge redistribution effect between the heterogeneous phases, the electronic conductivity and ion diffusion are greatly improved. The optimized Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/Na2VTi(PO4)3 cathode, with a reversible three&#8208;electron redox reaction, exhibits high specific capacity and long cycling life.








Abstract
Na superionic conductor (NASICON)&#8208;structured compounds demonstrate great application potential by their robust framework and compositional diversity. However, they are blamed for the mediocre energy density, and achieving both multielectron reaction and good cycling stability simultaneously is challenging. Herein, a novel heterogeneous Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/Na2VTi(PO4)3 (NFPP/NVTP) material with stable multielectron reaction is constructed by spray drying technology. The mutual promotion effect of intergrowth structures effectively improves the purity and the crystallization of NFPP/NVTP during the fabrication process, which is beneficial to the high capacity and cycling stability. As a result, the optimized NFPP/NVTP demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 155.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and outstanding cycling stability with 82.9% capacity retention over 2500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1, which are much superior to those of NFPP and NVTP individually. Even in full cell configuration, the energy density remains high at &#8776;380&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 based on the cathode mass. The high capacity of NFPP/NVTP is also attributed to the successive reduction/oxidation mechanism involving the introduction of Ti3+ and interfacial charge redistribution effect between the heterogeneous phases, which greatly improve the electronic and ionic conductivity. Moreover, high reversible structural evolution during the multisodium storage process further guarantees excellent cycling stability.

         <title>Molecular Control of the Donor/Acceptor Interface Suppresses Charge Recombination Enabling High&#8208;Efficiency Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outstanding double&#8208;cable&#8208;based single&#8208;component material, DCPY2, exhibits a suppressed charge recombination process alongside efficient charge generation. This results in a high fill factor and short&#8208;circuit current, yielding an efficiency to 13.85%. The slow recombination process in DCPY2 compared to binary systems is attributed to the reduced wavefunction overlap between donor and acceptor from inherent alkyl linker and enhanced acceptor aggregation.








Abstract
Single&#8208;component organic solar cells based on double cable polymers have achieved remarkable performance, with DCPY2 reaching a high efficiency of over 13%. In this study, DCPY2 is further optimized with an efficiency of 13.85%, maintaining a high fill factor (FF) without compromising the short circuit current. Despite its intermixed morphology, DCPY2 shows a reduced recombination rate compared to their binary counterpart (PBDB&#8208;T:Y&#8208;O6). This slower recombination in DCPY2 is attributed to the reduced wavefunction overlap of delocalized charges, achieved by spatially separating the donor and acceptor units with an alkyl linker, thereby restricting the recombination pathways. Adding 1,8&#8208;diiodooctane (DIO) into DCPY2 further reduced the recombination rate by facilitating acceptor aggregation, allowing free charges to become more delocalized. The DIO&#8208;assisted aggregation in DCPY2 (5% DIO) is evidenced by an increased pseudo&#8208;pure domain size of Y&#8208;O6. Fine molecular control at the donor/acceptor interface in the double&#8208;cable polymer achieves reduced non&#8208;geminate recombination under efficient charge generation, increased mobility, and charge carrier lifetime, thereby achieving superior performance. Nevertheless, the FF is still limited by relatively low mobility compared to the blend, suggesting the potential for further mobility improvement through enhanced higher&#8208;dimensional packing of the double&#8208;cable material.

         <title>Clickable, Thermally Responsive Hydrogels Enabled by Recombinant Spider Silk Protein and Spy Chemistry for Sustained Neurotrophin Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable hydrogel comprising recombinant spider silk proteins is formed through ultrasound and thermally induced phase transition. Thanks to SpyTag/SpyCatcher chemistry, neurotrophins such as CNTF are covalently immobilized onto the hydrogels, enabling sustained protein delivery, prolonged neuroprotection, and enhanced axon regrowth following optic nerve injury. This system serves as a safe and versatile platform for the delivery of therapeutic proteins.









Abstract
The ability to deliver protein therapeutics in a minimally invasive, safe, and sustained manner, without resorting to viral delivery systems, will be crucial for treating a wide range of chronic injuries and diseases. Among these challenges, achieving axon regeneration and functional recovery post&#8208;injury or disease in the central nervous system remains elusive to most clinical interventions, constantly calling for innovative solutions. Here, a thermally responsive hydrogel system utilizing recombinant spider silk protein (spidroin) is developed. The protein solution undergoes rapid sol&#8208;gel transition at an elevated temperature (37&#160;&#176;C) following brief sonication. This thermally triggered gelation confers injectability to the system. Leveraging SpyTag/SpyCatcher chemistry, the hydrogel, composed of SpyTag&#8208;fusion spidroin, can be functionalized with diverse SpyCatcher&#8208;fusion bioactive motifs, such as neurotrophic factors (e.g., ciliary neurotrophic factor) and cell&#8208;binding ligands (e.g., laminin), rendering it well&#8208;suited for neuronal culturing. More importantly, the intravitreous injection of the protein materials decorated with SpyCatcher&#8208;fusion CNTF into the vitreous body after optic nerve injury leads to prolonged JAK/STAT3 signaling, increased neuronal survival, and enhanced axon regeneration. This study illustrates a generalizable material system for injectable and sustained delivery of protein therapeutics for neuroprotection and regeneration, with the potential for extension to other chronic diseases and injuries.

         <title>Perspectives on Devices for Integrated Phononic Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phononic devices offer unique advantages in RF applications due to their shorter wavelengths compared to photons. This perspective explores functional phononic devices that can enable integrated phononic circuits. These circuits promise to enable miniaturized communication systems with improved SWaP&#8208;C characteristics, while also finding applications in quantum information science, sensing, and biomedical engineering.








Abstract
The phonon wavelength, being much shorter than that of photons at the same frequency, offers phononic devices a unique niche in radio frequency (RF)&#160;applications. However, the current limitations of these devices, particularly their restricted functionality, hinder their broader integration and application. Currently, many functions are achieved using alternative signal forms like electric and photonic signals, requiring bulky converters to transform between phonon signals and other forms. The development of functional phononic devices paves the way for integrated phononic circuits, which aim to minimize the need for signal conversion while accomplishing all necessary functions. In this perspective, a brief overview of several types of functional phononic devices is provided that hold promise for integration, such as phononic modulators, amplifiers, lasers, nonreciprocal devices, and those inspired by topological physics. It is envisioned that through continued developments in materials, fabrication techniques, and designs, it's possible to realize integrated phononic circuits which will be applied in miniaturized communication devices with reduced size, weight, power consumption, and cost (SWaP&#8208;C), as well as in other fields including quantum information science, sensing, biomedical engineering, and beyond.

         <title>Optoelectronic Devices for In&#8208;Sensor Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The raw data obtained directly from sensors in the noisy analogue domain is often unstructured, which lacks a predefined format or organization and does not conform to a specific data model. Optoelectronic devices for in&#8208;sensor visual processing can integrate perception, memory, and processing functions in the same physical units, which can compress and structure vision without extra optoelectronic conversion.








Abstract
The demand for accurate perception of the physical world leads to a dramatic increase in sensory nodes. However, the transmission of massive and unstructured sensory data from sensors to computing units poses great challenges in terms of power&#8208;efficiency, transmission bandwidth, data storage, time latency, and security. To efficiently process massive sensory data, it is crucial to achieve data compression and structuring at the sensory terminals. In&#8208;sensor computing integrates perception, memory, and processing functions within sensors, enabling sensory terminals to perform data compression and data structuring. Here, vision sensors are adopted as an example and discuss the functions of electronic, optical, and optoelectronic hardware for visual processing. Particularly, hardware implementations of optoelectronic devices for in&#8208;sensor visual processing that can compress and structure multidimensional vision information are examined. The underlying resistive switching mechanisms of volatile/nonvolatile optoelectronic devices and their processing operations are explored. Finally, a perspective on the future development of optoelectronic devices for in&#8208;sensor computing is provided.

         <title>Mastering Proton Activities in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 23, June 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced aqueous batteries are promising alternatives for grid energy storage. Understanding and mastering the proton activities in aqueous electrolytes will guide the design of sustainable and long&#8208;lasting aqueous batteries. This Perspective comments on the current understanding of the thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives of proton activities and highlights future research directions for aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Advanced aqueous batteries are promising solutions for grid energy storage. Compared with their organic counterparts, water&#8208;based electrolytes enable fast transport kinetics, high safety, low cost, and enhanced environmental sustainability. However, the presence of protons in the electrolyte, generated by the spontaneous ionization of water, may compete with the main charge&#8208;storage mechanism, trigger unwanted side reactions, and accelerate the deterioration of the cell performance. Therefore, it is of pivotal importance to understand and master the proton activities in aqueous batteries. This Perspective comments&#160;on the following scientific questions: Why are proton activities relevant? What are proton activities? What do&#160;we&#160;know about proton activities in aqueous batteries? How do&#160;we&#160;better understand, control, and utilize proton activities?

Abstract
High&#8208;voltage cathodes (HVCs) have emerged as a paramount role for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the pursuit of HVCs comes with inherent challenges related to defective structures, which significantly impact the electrochemical performance of LIBs. The current obstacle lies in the lack of a comprehensive understanding of defects and their precise effects. This perspective aims to provide insights into defect chemistry for governing HVCs. The classifications, formation mechanisms, and evolution of defects are outlined to explore the intricate relationship between defects and electrochemical behavior. The pressing need for cutting&#8208;edge characterization techniques that comprehensively investigate defects across various temporal and spatial scales is emphasized. Building on these fundamental understandings, engineering strategies such as composition tailoring, morphology design, interface modification, and structural control to mitigate or utilize defects are thoroughly discussed for enhanced HVCs performance. These insights are expected to provide vital guidelines for developing high&#8208;performance HVCs for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Data Readout Techniques for DNA&#8208;Based Information Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a universal genetic material, DNA can inherently encode and transmit information. Various DNA data storage systems are reported as attractive alternatives to current digital data storage media. This review provides a detailed analysis of the characteristics and evolution of readout techniques of DNA storage systems, and discusses challenges and opportunities in readout techniques of DNA data storage systems.








Abstract
DNA is a natural chemical substrate that carries genetic information, which also serves as a powerful toolkit for storing digital data. Compared to traditional&#160;storage media, DNA molecules offer higher storage density, longer lifespan, and lower maintenance energy consumption. In DNA storage process, data readout is a critical step that bridges the gap between DNA molecular/structures with stored digital information. With the continued development of strategies in DNA data storage technology, the readout techniques have evolved. However, there is a lack of systematic introduction and discussion on the readout techniques for reported DNA data storage systems, especially the correlation between the design of the data storage system and the corresponding selection of readout techniques. This review first introduces two main categories of DNA data storage units (i.e., sequence and structure) and their corresponding readout techniques (i.e., sequencing and nonsequencing methods), and then reviewed representative examples of notable advancements in DNA data storage technology, focusing on data storage unit design, and readout technique selection. It also introduces emerging approaches to assist data readout techniques, such as implementation of microfluidic and fluorescent probes. Finally, the paper discusses the limitations, challenges, and potential of DNA data readout approaches.

         <dc:description>
This review provides a holistic overview of biopolymers&#8208;derived electronic skins (Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins), highlighting their exceptional attributes, nature&#8208;inspired engineering constructions, promising applications, and remaining fundamental and technical challenges. These insights provide a design framework to provoke the advancement of e&#8208;skins with high adaptivity, mechanical robustness, and sustainability that contribute to the development of high&#8208;performance wearable electronic systems.








Abstract
The past few years have witnessed the rapid exploration of natural and synthetic materials to construct electronic skins (e&#8208;skins) to emulate the multisensory functions of human skins driven by promising applications. Among various materials employed in functional e&#8208;skins, biopolymers are particularly notable for their exceptional biocompatibility and abundant resources. Despite remarkable progress in engineering biopolymeric materials, a timely and holistic review focusing on the design, synthesis, and modification of biopolymers tailored for biopolymers&#8208;derived e&#8208;skins (Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins) is lacking. In this review, the key attributes of biopolymers are introduced&#160;to establish a fundamental understanding fordeveloping functional Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins. Next, the recent progress in harnessing various natural and synthetic biopolymers as building blocks for constructing Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins is systematically discussed, providing insights into maximizing the distinctive attributes of biopolymers. Subsequently, the benefits of nature&#8208;inspired Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins achieved through heterogeneous composite and structural engineering are highlighted, infusing fresh momentum into the advancement of e&#8208;skins. Then, the promising applications of Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins in multisensory functions are summarized, including both local monitoring and remote teleoperation, as well as sustainable energy harvesting that empowers e&#8208;skins. Finally, the remaining fundamental and technical challenges in advancing Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins are presented to provoke future designs that emulate and even go beyond human skins.

         <title>Functional Biomaterials Derived from Protein Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation and Liquid&#8208;to&#8208;Solid Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein can undergo liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition to form liquid condensates and solid aggregates. These phase transitions can be influenced by post&#8208;translational modifications, mutations, and various environmental factors. Effective modulation of protein phase behavior offers promising applications in drug discovery, delivery, and fabrication of multifunctional protein&#8208;based liquid and solid materials.








Abstract
Protein phase transitions play a vital role in both cellular functions and pathogenesis. Dispersed proteins can undergo liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation to form condensates, a process that is reversible and highly regulated within cells. The formation and physicochemical properties of these condensates, such as composition, viscosity, and multiphase miscibility, are precisely modulated to fulfill specific biological functions. However, protein condensates can undergo a further liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid state, forming &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich aggregates that may disrupt cellular function and lead to diseases. While this phenomenon is crucial for biological processes and has significant implications for neurodegenerative diseases, the phase behavior of naturally derived or engineered proteins and polypeptides also presents opportunities for developing high&#8208;performance, multifunctional materials at various scales. Additionally, the unique molecular recruitment capabilities of condensates inspire innovative advancements in biomaterial design for applications in drug discovery, delivery, and biosynthesis. This work highlights recent progress in understanding the mechanisms underlying protein phase behavior, particularly how it responds to internal molecular changes and external physical stimuli. Furthermore, the fabrication of multifunctional materials derived from diverse protein sources through controlled phase transitions is demonstrated.

         <title>Artificial Intelligence and Multiscale Modeling for Sustainable Biopolymers and Bioinspired Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the multiscale architectures and functional mechanisms of biopolymers and bioinspired materials, from hierarchical structures to AI&#8208;powered methodologies. It covers sustainable configurations, multiscale modeling techniques, and AI applications for enhancing functionality, biodegradability, and design. The work concludes with a forward&#8208;looking perspective on biopolymer advancements and potential for broad lifecycle impacts in advanced material manufacturing.








Abstract
Biopolymers and bioinspired materials contribute to the construction of intricate hierarchical structures that exhibit advanced properties. The remarkable toughness and damage tolerance of such multilevel materials are conferred through the hierarchical assembly of their multiscale (i.e., atomistic to macroscale) components and architectures. Here, the functionality and mechanisms of biopolymers and bio&#8208;inspired materials at multilength scales are explored and summarized, focusing on biopolymer nanofibril configurations, biocompatible synthetic biopolymers, and bio&#8208;inspired composites. Their modeling methods with theoretical basis at multiple lengths and time scales are reviewed for biopolymer applications. Additionally, the exploration of artificial intelligence&#8208;powered methodologies is emphasized to realize improvements in these biopolymers from functionality, biodegradability, and sustainability to their characterization, fabrication process, and superior designs. Ultimately, a promising future for these versatile materials in the manufacturing of advanced materials across wider applications and greater lifecycle impacts is foreseen.

         <title>Autonomous Bioelectronic Devices Based on Silk Fibroin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the unique autonomous features of silk fibroin (SF), including self&#8208;healing, shape&#8208;morphing, and biodegradability, which enable its integration into bioelectronics. Key applications such as smart textiles, epidermal sensors, and adaptable implants are explored. The discussion addresses challenges in scalability, reproducibility, and bio&#8208;integration while presenting future directions for sustainable and multifunctional silk&#8208;based technologies.








Abstract
The development of autonomous bioelectronic devices capable of dynamically adapting to changing biological environments represents a significant advancement in healthcare and wearable technologies. Such systems draw inspiration from the precision, adaptability, and self&#8208;regulation of biological processes, requiring materials with intrinsic versatility and seamless bio&#8208;integration to ensure biocompatibility and functionality over time. Silk fibroin (SF) derived from Bombyx mori cocoons, has emerged as an ideal biomaterial with a unique combination of biocompatibility, mechanical flexibility, and tunable biodegradability. Adding autonomous features into SF, including self&#8208;healing, shape&#8208;morphing, and controllable degradation, enables dynamic interactions with living tissues while minimizing immune responses and mechanical mismatches. Additionally, structural tunability and environmental sustainability of SF further reinforce its potential as a platform for adaptive implants, epidermal electronics, and intelligent textiles. This review explores recent progress in understanding the structure&#8211;property relationships of SF, its modification strategies, and its great potential for integration into advanced autonomous bioelectronic systems while addressing challenges related to scalability, reproducibility, and multifunctionality. Future opportunities, such as AI&#8208;assisted material design, scalable fabrication techniques, and the incorporation of wireless and personalized technologies, are also discussed, positioning SF as a key material in bridging the gap between biological systems and artificial technologies.

         <title>Designing for Degradation: Transient Devices Enabled by (Nano)Cellulose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in transient devices enabled by (nano)cellulosic materials is reviewed. Transiency mechanisms, advantages of nanocelluloses, and a suite of applications are discussed. A circular thinking approach coupled with life cycle assessment is applied to critically revisit the potential, advantages, and challenges of nanocellulose&#8208;enabled transient devices for future materials innovation.








Abstract
Transient technology involves materials and devices that undergo controlled degradation after a reliable operation period. This groundbreaking strategy offers significant advantages over conventional devices based on non&#8208;renewable materials by limiting environmental exposure to potentially hazardous components after disposal, and by increasing material circularity. As the most abundant naturally occurring polymer on Earth, cellulose is an attractive material for this purpose. Besides, (nano)celluloses are inherently biodegradable and have competitive mechanical, optical, thermal, and ionic conductivity properties that can be exploited to develop sustainable devices and avoid the end&#8208;of&#8208;life issues associated with conventional systems. Despite its potential, few efforts have been made to review current advances in cellulose&#8208;based transient technology. Therefore, this review catalogs the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in transient devices enabled by cellulosic materials. To provide a wide perspective, the various degradation mechanisms involved in cellulosic transient devices are introduced. The advanced capabilities of transient cellulosic systems in sensing, photonics, energy storage, electronics, and biomedicine are also highlighted. Current bottlenecks toward successful implementation are discussed, with material circularity and environmental impact metrics at the center. It is believed that this review will serve as a valuable resource for the proliferation of cellulose&#8208;based transient technology and its implementation into fully integrated, circular, and environmentally sustainable devices.

Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) play a crucial role in attaining sustainable energy for various wearable devices. Polymer materials are essential components of TENGs. Biopolymers are suitable materials for TENGs because of their degradability, natural sourcing, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, the latest progress in commonly used biopolymers and well&#8208;designed biomimetic techniques for TENG is summarized. The applications of natural rubber, polysaccharides, protein&#8208;based biopolymers, and other common synthetic biopolymers in TENG technology are summarized in detail. Each biopolymer is discussed based on its electrification capability, polarity variations, and specific functionalities as active and functional layers of TENGs. Important biomimetic strategies and related applications of specific biopolymers are also summarized to guide the structural and functional design of TENG. In the future, the study of triboelectric biopolymers may focus on exploring alternative candidates, enhancing charge density, and expanding functionality. Various possible applications of biopolymer&#8208;based TENGs are proposed in this review. By applying biopolymers and related biomimetic methods to TENG devices, the applications of TENG in the fields of healthcare, environmental monitoring, and wearable/implantable electronics can be further promoted.

Moreover, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art examples of high&#8208;performance PLA&#8208;based materials within an array of applications (packaging, fibers textiles, biomedicine, healthcare, and electronic devices) are highlighted.








Abstract
Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a representative biobased and biodegradable aliphatic polyester and a front&#8208;runner among sustainable materials. As a semicrystalline thermoplastic, PLA exhibits excellent mechanical and physical properties, attracting considerable attention in commodity and medical fields. Stereochemistry is a key factor affecting PLA's properties, and to this end, the engineering of PLA's microstructure for tailored material properties has been an active area of research over the decade. This Review first covers the basic structural variety of PLA. A perspective on the current states of stereocontrolled synthesis as well as the relationships between the structures and properties of PLA stereosequences are included, with an emphasis on record regularity and properties. At last, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art examples of high&#8208;performance PLA&#8208;based materials within an array of applications are given, including packaging, fibers, and textiles, healthcare and electronic devices. Among various stereo&#8208;regular sequences of PLA, poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) (PLLA) is the most prominent category and has myriad unique properties and applications. In this regard, cutting&#8208;edge applications of PLLA are mainly overviewed in this review. At the same time, new materials developed based on other PLA stereosequences are highlighted, which holds the potential to a wide variety of PLA&#8208;based sustainable materials.

Stereochemistry is a key factor affecting PLA's properties, and to this end, the engineering of PLA's microstructure for tailored material properties has been an active area of research over the decade. This Review first covers the basic structural variety of PLA. A perspective on the current states of stereocontrolled synthesis as well as the relationships between the structures and properties of PLA stereosequences are included, with an emphasis on record regularity and properties. At last, state-of-the-art examples of high-performance PLA-based materials within an array of applications are given, including packaging, fibers, and textiles, healthcare and electronic devices. Among various stereo-regular sequences of PLA, poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) is the most prominent category and has myriad unique properties and applications. In this regard, cutting-edge applications of PLLA are mainly overviewed in this review. At the same time, new materials developed based on other PLA stereosequences are highlighted, which holds the potential to a wide variety of PLA-based sustainable materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Energy crisis inspires the development of renewable and clean energy sources, along with related applications such as nanogenerators and self&#8208;powered devices. Balancing high performance and environmental sustainability in advanced material innovation is a challenging task. Addressing the global challenges of sustainable development and carbon neutrality lead to increased&#160;interest in biopolymer research. Nanocellulose materials, derived from biopolymers, demonstrate potential as template candidates for advanced materials, due to their unique properties, including high strength, high surface area, controllable pore structures and high&#8208;water retention. In recent years, cellulose&#8208;templated nanomaterials enable delicate nano&#8208;/microscale structural construction, thus promoting developments in the field of nanogenerators and self&#8208;powered sensors. However, there is still a limited number of reviews focused on cellulose&#8208;templated nanomaterials for applications in nanogenerators and self&#8208;powered sensors. This review aims to fill this research gap by introducing various cellulose&#8208;templated nanomaterials and providing a detailed analysis of their fashionable applications in nanogenerators and self&#8208;powered sensors. The goal is to present cellulose&#8208;templated nanomaterials as highly promising template and guest materials for templating technologies, offering sustainable nano&#8208;/microscale control over advanced materials for the foreseeable future. This potential is promising for new applications in the fields of nanogenerators and self&#8208;powered sensors.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically examines biopolymers and their protective mechanisms for Li and Zn metal anodes. It covers key biopolymer types, structures, and properties, and explores their applications as artificial SEIs, electrolyte additives, separators, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes. The review highlights how these biopolymers enhance electrochemical performance and discusses current challenges and future research directions in this evolving field.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) and zinc (Zn) metals are emerging as promising anode materials for next&#8208;generation rechargeable metal batteries due to their excellent electronic conductivity and high theoretical capacities. However, issues such as uneven metal ion deposition and uncontrolled dendrite growth result in poor electrochemical stability, limited cycle life, and rapid capacity decay. Biopolymers, recognized for their abundance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, biodegradability, tunable structures, and adjustable properties, offer a compelling solution to these challenges. This review systematically and comprehensively examines biopolymers and their protective mechanisms for Li and Zn metal anodes. It begins with an overview of biopolymers, detailing key types, their structures, and properties. The review then explores recent advancements in the application of biopolymers as artificial solid electrolyte interphases, electrolyte additives, separators, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes, emphasizing how their structural properties enhance protection mechanisms and improve electrochemical performance. Finally, perspectives on current challenges and future research directions in this evolving field are provided.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) has unique intrinsic physical properties, showing great potential for constructing sustainable materials. This review introduces emerging CNF&#8208;based structural materials, including challenges in their assembly process and their exceptional mechanical and thermal properties. Based on the structural designability and functionalization characteristics of CNF&#8208;based structural materials, the potential applications and future trends are discussed.








Abstract
Under the guidance of the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, the urgency for green ecological construction and the depletion of nonrenewable resources highlight the importance of the research and development of sustainable new materials. Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) is the most abundant natural nanoscale building block widely existing on Earth. CNF has unique intrinsic physical properties, such as low density, low coefficient of thermal expansion, high strength, and high modulus, which is an ideal candidate with outstanding potential for constructing sustainable materials. In recent years, CNF&#8208;based structural material has emerged as a sustainable lightweight material with properties very different from traditional structural materials. Here, to comprehensively introduce the assembly of structural materials based on CNF, it starts with an overview of different forms of CNF&#8208;based materials, including fibers, films, hydrogels, aerogels, and structural materials. Next, the challenges that need to be overcome in preparing CNF&#8208;based structural materials are discussed, their assembly methods are introduced, and an in&#8208;depth analysis of the advantages of the CNF&#8208;based hydrogel assembly strategy to fabricate structural materials is conducted. Finally, the unique properties of emerging CNF&#8208;based structural materials are summarized and concluded with an outlook on their design and functionalization, potentially paving the way toward new opportunities.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wearable electronics utilizing advanced carbon materials from fossil origins face issues like non&#8208;renewability, high energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions. Biopolymers present a sustainable alternative for carbon&#8208;based wearables. This review highlights the carbonization of key biopolymers&#8212;cellulose, lignin, chitin, and silk fibroin&#8212;discussing mechanisms, techniques, and applications of biopolymer&#8208;derived carbon materials in wearable technology.








Abstract
Advanced carbon materials are widely utilized in wearable electronics. Nevertheless, the production of carbon materials from fossil&#8208;based sources raised concerns regarding their non&#8208;renewability, high energy consumption, and the consequent greenhouse gas emissions. Biopolymers, readily available in nature, offer a promising and eco&#8208;friendly alternative as a carbon source, enabling the sustainable production of carbon materials for wearable electronics. This review aims to discuss the carbonization mechanisms, carbonization techniques, and processes, as well as the diverse applications of biopolymer&#8208;derived carbon materials (BioCMs) in wearable electronics. First, the characteristics of four representative biopolymers, including cellulose, lignin, chitin, and silk fibroin, and their carbonization processes are discussed. Then, typical carbonization techniques, including pyrolysis carbonization, laser&#8208;induced carbonization, Joule heating carbonization, hydrothermal transformation, and salt encapsulation carbonization are discussed. The influence of the processes on the morphology and properties of the resultant BioCMs are summarized. Subsequently, applications of BioCMs in wearable devices, including physical sensors, chemical sensors, energy devices, and display devices are discussed. Finally, the challenges currently facing the field and the future opportunities are discussed.

         <title>Biopolymer&#8208;Based Flame Retardants and Flame&#8208;Retardant Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents recent advancements in producing sustainable flame&#8208;retardant materials using biopolymers as additive agents, functional coatings, and structural matrices. The focus is on advanced applications for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, thermal insulation, and fire warning devices. Most of these applications utilize biopolymers derived from non&#8208;food sources such as cellulose, lignin, chitosan, and alginates obtained from plants and marine organisms.








Abstract
Polymeric materials featuring excellent flame retardancy are essential for applications requiring high levels of fire safety, while those based on biopolymers are highly favored due to their eco&#8208;friendly nature, sustainable characteristics, and abundant availability. This review first outlines the pyrolysis behaviors of biopolymers, with particular emphasis on naturally occurring ones derived from non&#8208;food sources such as cellulose, chitin/chitosan, alginate, and lignin. Then, the strategies for chemical modifications of biopolymers for flame&#8208;retardant purposes through covalent, ionic, and coordination bonds are presented and compared. The emphasis is placed on advanced methods for introducing biopolymer&#8208;based flame retardants into polymeric matrices and fabricating biopolymer&#8208;based flame&#8208;retardant materials. Finally, the challenges for sustaining the current momentum in the utilization of biopolymers for flame&#8208;retardant purposes are further discussed.

         <title>Hierarchical Engineering for Biopolymer&#8208;based Hydrogels with Tailored Property and Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, key strategies for designing biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels from the molecular to the macroscopic scale are summarized. Emphasis is placed on how molecular architecture, processing methods, and fabrication technologies converge to yield materials with tunable mechanical properties, dynamic responsiveness, and enhanced transport behaviors for diverse biomedical and technological applications. The unified approach guides future hydrogel developments.









Abstract
Biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels offer versatility in biomedical engineering due to their abundance, biocompatibility, tailorable properties, and environmental responsiveness. Realizing their full potential requires understanding the molecular&#8208;level design principles that govern their macroscopic behavior. This review analyzes recent advances in the molecular engineering of biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels, emphasizing innovative network design strategies and processing methods for precise control over material properties and functions. How molecular design influences hydrogel behavior across multiple length scales are explored, focusing on: 1) network design strategies: approaches like double networks, interpenetrating networks, and supramolecular assemblies to tailor mechanical and responsive properties; 2) processing techniques: methods such as Hofmeister effect&#8208;induced chain aggregating, cononsolvency&#8208;based porous structure controlling, and directional freezing&#8208;induced network alignment to achieve hierarchical and anisotropic structures. How these design principles and processing methods influence critical hydrogel properties like mechanical strength, inner mass transportation, and degradation are discussed. The review also covers advanced fabrication techniques that leverage these molecular engineering approaches to create complex, functional hydrogels. By elucidating the relationships between molecular architecture, processing methods, and resulting material properties, this work aims to provide a framework for designing next&#8208;generation biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels with enhanced performance and functionality across various applications.

         <title>An Implantable and Degradable Silk Sericin Protein Film Energy Harvester for Next&#8208;Generation Cardiovascular Electronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A piezoelectric film is created using structural engineered silk sericin, presenting satisfactory output performance, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. This piezoelectric film&#8208;based energy&#8208;harvester can illuminate LED or operate a portable electronic device through converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. It holds promise as a power source for delivering effective electrical stimulation to restore cardiac activity in asystole or normalize an AV block.








Abstract
Current cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) face a pressing clinical need for the development of battery&#8208;free, biodegradable, and biocompatible devices to mitigate the risk of adverse in vivo responses. To address this demand, it is proposed utilizing a natural biomaterial, silk sericin (SS), which exhibits valuable biological activities and contains abundant asymmetric amino acids with adjustable structures, to create an implantable self&#8208;powered system based on the piezoelectric principle. The functionalized SS&#8208;based (F&#8208;SS&#8208;based) piezoelectric film demonstrates a high longitudinal piezoelectric tensor (d33) of 12&#160;pC&#160;N&#8722;1. An energy&#8208;generating device (EG device) utilizing this piezoelectric film can generate electric energy under mechanical force both in vitro and in vivo. By manually tapping the EG&#8208;device for a few minutes, the accumulated electricity in a commercial capacitor (1.1&#160;&#181;F) could illuminate LEDs or operate a timer. Furthermore, the instantaneous energy power density (218.5&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;2) achieved by manual pressing the EG device is sufficient to deliver effective pacing to restart a non&#8208;beating heart or normalize an atrioventricular block in a preclinical model. Owing to its high biocompatibility and biodegradability in physiological environments, the F&#8208;SS&#8208;based EG device holds significant promise for the advancement of self&#8208;powered power systems for next&#8208;generation CIEDs and other implantable and degradable electronic devices.

         <title>Biopolymeric Ionotronics Based on Biodegradable Wool Keratin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pH&#8208;responsive wool keratin serves as the sole biopolymer matrix for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance ionotronic devices, without the use of toxic chemicals, complex synthesis, or grafting processes. Furthermore, the innate biodegradability of wool keratin makes it an environmentally friendly option, furthering the advancement of sustainable devices based on natural polymers.








Abstract
The advent of ionotronics has revealed significant potential in flexible transistors, energy harvesting, and unconventional circuits. However, most ionotronic devices, often centered around synthetic polymers, involve complex grafting or synthesis that raise legitimate concerns about their environmental sustainability. Herein, a simple yet versatile approach for developing single&#8208;composition ionotronic devices using wool keratin (WK), a biodegradable and pH&#8208;responsive natural polymer is presented. By employing facile pH regulation processes, WK molecules with opposing polarities are successfully modified, which are combined to form an ionic heterojunction through entropically driven depletion. This ionic heterojunction functions as an ionic diode, enabling efficient rectification of alternating current signals (with a rectification ratio of up to 199). Furthermore, the application of this biopolymeric ionotronic device is extended to mechanical energy harvesting, self&#8208;powered sensing, and ionic logic circuit. The biodegradability and renewability of WK offer a viable alternative to synthetic materials, highlighting its potential for sustainable applications.

         <title>Expanded Nanofibrous Cellulose Electrode Binder: Declustering Lithium Polysulfides for Lean&#8208;Electrolyte Li&#8210;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,2,6,6&#8208;Tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl radical (TEMPO)&#8208;oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN) is presented as a class of expanded nanofibrous electrode binders for lean&#8208;electrolyte lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Owing to the increased active sites for intermolecular interaction with Li polysulfides (LiPS), the TOCN binder promotes the declustering of LiPS, thereby achieving a high cell&#8208;level energy density of 503 Wh kg&#8722;1 at a low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio of 2.0 &#181;L mgsulfur&#8722;1.








Abstract
Despite their potential as an alternative to commercial lithium (Li)&#8210;ion batteries, Li&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries face challenges related to energy density limitations caused by the considerable amount of electrolyte required. Lean electrolytes have proven effective in mitigating this issue. However, they tend to exacerbate Li polysulfides (LiPS) clustering, resulting in incomplete S utilization and sluggish conversion kinetics. Here, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl radical (TEMPO)&#8208;oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN) is presented as an expanded nanofibrous electrode binder for lean&#8208;electrolyte Li&#8210;S batteries. Owing to its 1D fibrous structure and expanded inter&#8208;glucose chain distance, the TOCN binder offers more accessible active sites for intermolecular interactions with LiPS. Consequently, LiPS cluster formation is effectively suppressed even at a low TOCN binder content of 1 wt%, while a high S loading of 72 wt% is achieved. The resulting S cathode with the TOCN binder enables Li&#8210;S cells to exhibit a remarkable specific capacity of 1221 mAh gsulfur&#8722;1 under constrained electrolyte conditions (low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio of 2.0&#160;&#181;L mgsulfur&#8722;1 and low density of 0.927&#160;g mL&#8722;1), yielding a high cell&#8208;level energy density of 503&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 that surpasses those of previously reported S cathodes based on conventional synthetic polymer binders.

         <title>The Structure&#8208;Mechanics Relationship of Bamboo&#8208;Epidermis and Inspired Composite Design by Artificial Intelligence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article investigates the micromechanics of bamboo epidermis, focusing on how anisotropic silica particle distributions enhance toughness. By integrating experimental imaging, 3D printing, and generative AI, the study develops bio&#8208;inspired particle&#8208;reinforced composites with mechanical properties akin to bamboo. The findings expand design possibilities for composites, offering innovative solutions for applications demanding high toughness and mechanical reliability.








Abstract
Bamboo culm has been widely used in engineering for its high strength, lightweight, and low cost. Its outermost epidermis is a smooth and dense layer that contains cellulose, silica particles, and stomata and acts as a water and mechanical barrier. Recent experimental studies have shown that the layer has a higher mechanical strength than other inside regions. Still, the mechanism is unclear, especially for how the low silica concentration (&lt;10%) can effectively reinforce the layer and prevent the inner fibers from splitting. Here, theoretical analysis is combined with experimental imaging and 3D printing to investigate the effect of the distribution of silica particles on composite mechanics. The anisotropic partial distribution function of silica particles in bamboo skin yields higher toughness (&gt;10%) than randomly distributed particles. A generative artificial intelligence (AI) model inspired by bamboo epidermis is developed to generate particle&#8208;reinforced composites. Besides the visual similarity, it is found that the samples by the generative model show failure processes and fracture toughness identical to the actual bamboo epidermis. This work reveals the micromechanics of the bamboo epidermis. It illustrates that generative AI can help design bio&#8208;inspired composites of a complex structure that cannot be uniformly represented by a simple building block or optimized around local boundaries. It expands the design space of particle&#8208;reinforced composites for enhanced toughness modulus, offering advantages in industries where mechanical reliability is critical.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Dependent Vibrational Dynamics and Phonon Transport in Nanocellulose Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uptake of water in cellulose play an important role in modulating the structure and phonon transport. This study reports how moisture&#8208;dependent structural modification relates to the vibrational dynamics and phonon transport and scattering of nanocellulose using inelastic neutron scattering and wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering. Phonon transport is controlled by the moisture&#8208;induced increase of the coherence length and swelling of the foam walls.








Abstract
Superinsulating nanofibrillar cellulose foams have the potential to replace fossil&#8208;based insulating materials, but the development is hampered by the moisture&#8208;dependent heat transport and the lack of direct measurements of phonon transport. Here, inelastic neutron scattering is used together with wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering (WAXS) and small angle neutron scattering to relate the moisture&#8208;dependent structural modifications to the vibrational dynamics and phonon transport and scattering of cellulose nanofibrils from wood and tunicate, and wood cellulose nanocrystals (W&#8208;CNC). The moisture interacted primarily with the disordered regions in nanocellulose, and WAXS showed that the crystallinity and coherence length increased as the moisture content increased. The phonon population derived from directional&#8208;dependent phonon density of states (GDOS) increased along the cellulose chains in W&#8208;CNC between 5 and 8 wt% D2O, while the phonon population perpendicular to the chains remained&#160;relatively unaffected, suggesting that the effect of increased crystallinity and coherence length on phonon transport is compensated by the moisture&#8208;induced swelling of the foam walls. Frequency scaling in the low&#8208;energy GDOS showed that materials based on hygroscopic and semicrystalline nanocellulose falls in between the predicted behavior for solids and liquids. Phonon&#8208;engineering of hygroscopic biopolymer&#8208;based insulation materials is promoted by the insights on the moisture&#8208;dependent phonon&#160;transport.

         <title>Biomimetic Intrafibrillar Mineralization of Hierarchically Structured Amyloid&#8208;Like Fibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Hierarchically Structured Amyloid&#8208;like Fibrils (HSAF), prepared through a mechanically directed two&#8208;step transformation of a protein nanofilm, exhibit an ordered, dynamic layered structure with adaptive gaps that facilitate intrafibrillar mineralization. The mineralized HSAF mimics biological hard tissues with ordered protein&#8208;hydroxyapatite organization, and demonstrates exceptional bioactivity in promoting native bone growth and further intrafibrillar mineralization.









Abstract
Intrafibrillar mineralization is essential not only as a fundamental process in forming biological hard tissues but also as a foundation for developing advanced composite fibril&#8208;based materials for innovative applications. Traditionally, only natural collagen fibrils have been shown to enable intrafibrillar mineralization, presenting a challenge in designing ordered hierarchical fibrils from common protein aggregation that exhibit similar high intrafibrillar mineralization activity. In this study, a mechanically directed two&#8208;step transformation method is developed that converts phase&#8208;transitioned protein nanofilms into crystalline, hierarchical amyloid&#8208;like fibrils with multilayer structures, which effectively control the growth and lateral organization of hydroxyapatite within adaptive gaps. The resulting mineralized HSAF achieves a hardness of 0.616 &#177;&#160;0.007&#160;GPa and a modulus of 19.06 &#177;&#160;3.54 GPa&#8212;properties closely resembling native hard tissues&#8212;and exhibits exceptionally high bioactivity in promoting both native bone tissue growth and further intrafibrillar mineralization, achieving 76.9% repair in a mice cranial defect model after 8 weeks and outperforming other regenerative materials. This remarkable performance, stemming from the unique structure and composition of the fibers, positions HSAF as a promising candidate for biomedical and engineering applications. These findings advance the understanding of biomineralization mechanisms and establish a foundation for developing high&#8208;bioactivity materials for hard tissue regeneration.

         <title>Living Fiber Dispersions from Mycelium as a New Sustainable Platform for Advanced Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living fiber dispersions (LFD) from mycelium and their extracellular materials are prepared by a facile three&#8208;roll milling process. These dispersions can be easily converted into a wide array of multifunctional living materials. These living materials display increased emulsion stability, enhanced mechanical properties, superhydrophobicity, and instantaneous proximity sensing as a result of fungal growth.








Abstract
Functional biopolymeric fibers are key building blocks for developing sustainable materials within the growing bioeconomy. However, their flexible use in emerging advanced materials with smart properties typically requires processing methods that may compromise sustainability. Here, a sustainable route to generate living fiber dispersions (LFD) from mycelium that combines the excellent material&#8208;forming properties of biopolymeric fibers, and the highly dynamic properties of living materials is proposed. This is showcased by using industrially available liquid culture and mechanical defibrillation methods to generate well&#8208;dispersed living mycelium fibers. These fibers can form materials where precursors with good dispersibility and network formation properties are paramount and can harness dynamic properties through growth even in the absence of added nutrients. This is demonstrated in unique living emulsions with 3.6x slower phase separation and in living films with 2.5x higher tensile strength upon growth, the latter vastly outperforming the strongest pure mycelium materials to date. Further, humidity can be used to modulate mechanical properties and to trigger the superhydrophobic patterning of substrates, mechanical actuation, and degradation of lignocellulosic consumer goods at their end of life. In the future, combining synthetic biology with this promising platform for smart materials can expand the horizons for sustainable material manufacturing.

         <title>Molecularly Functionalized Biomass Hydrogels for Sustainable Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalizable molecular engineering methodology is developed to transform diverse biomass feedstocks, such as cellulose, starch, and chitosan, into efficient hydrogel sorbents for atmospheric water harvesting (AWH). Outdoor tests reveal a water production rate of up to 14.19&#160;kg kg&#8315;&#185; day&#8315;&#185;, demonstrating significant potential for sustainable water solutions. This approach advances scalable AWH technologies by leveraging abundant, environmentally friendly resources.








Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) offers a promising pathway to alleviate global water scarcity, highlighting the need for environmentally responsible sorbent materials. In this context, this research introduces a universal strategy for transforming natural polysaccharides into effective hydrogel sorbents, demonstrated with cellulose, starch, and chitosan. The methodology unites alkylation to graft thermoresponsive groups, thereby enhancing water processability and enabling energy&#8208;efficient water release at lower temperatures, with the integration of zwitterionic groups to ensure stable and effective water sorption. The molecularly functionalized cellulose hydrogel, exemplifying our approach, shows favorable water uptake of 0.86&#8211;1.32&#160;g g&#8722;1 at 15&#8211;30% relative humidity (RH), along with efficient desorption, releasing 95% of captured water at 60 &#176;C. Outdoor tests highlight the water production rate of up to 14.19&#160;kg kg&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 by electrical heating.

&lt;p&gt;A generalizable molecular engineering methodology is developed to transform diverse biomass feedstocks, such as cellulose, starch, and chitosan, into efficient hydrogel sorbents for atmospheric water harvesting (AWH). Outdoor tests reveal a water production rate of up to 14.19&#160;kg kg&#8315;&#185; day&#8315;&#185;, demonstrating significant potential for sustainable water solutions. This approach advances scalable AWH technologies by leveraging abundant, environmentally friendly resources.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) offers a promising pathway to alleviate global water scarcity, highlighting the need for environmentally responsible sorbent materials. In this context, this research introduces a universal strategy for transforming natural polysaccharides into effective hydrogel sorbents, demonstrated with cellulose, starch, and chitosan. The methodology unites alkylation to graft thermoresponsive groups, thereby enhancing water processability and enabling energy-efficient water release at lower temperatures, with the integration of zwitterionic groups to ensure stable and effective water sorption. The molecularly functionalized cellulose hydrogel, exemplifying our approach, shows favorable water uptake of 0.86&#8211;1.32&#160;g g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 15&#8211;30% relative humidity (RH), along with efficient desorption, releasing 95% of captured water at 60 &#176;C. Outdoor tests highlight the water production rate of up to 14.19&#160;kg kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; by electrical heating. The proposed molecular engineering methodology, which expands the range of raw materials by leveraging abundant biomass feedstock, has the potential to advance sorbent production and scalable AWH technologies, contributing to sustainable solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sustainable Silk Fibroin Ionic Touch Screens for Flexible Biodegradable Electronics with Integrated AI and IoT Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silk fibroin ionic touchscreen platform with high elasticity, high environmental tolerance, and biodegradability, is introduced for sustainable flexible electronics. This study showcases the platform's environmental stability, reusability, and advanced applications in IoT and AI&#8208;enhanced interfaces, such as real&#8208;time touch sensing, handwriting recognition, and virtual reality, paving the way for greener next&#8208;generation devices.








Abstract
The increasing prevalence of electronic devices has led to a significant rise in electronic waste (e&#8208;waste), necessitating the development of sustainable materials for flexible electronics. In this study, silk fibroin ionic touch screen (SFITS) is introduced, a new platform integrating natural silk fibroin (SF) with ionic conductors to create highly elastic, environmentally stable, and multifunctional touch interfaces. Through a humidity&#8208;induced crystallization strategy, the molecular structure of SF is precisely controlled to achieve a balanced combination of mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and biodegradability. The assembly and operational reliability of SFITS are demonstrated under various environmental conditions, along with their reusability through green recycling methods. Additionally, the intelligent design and application of SFITS are explored by incorporating Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. This integration enables real&#8208;time touch sensing, handwriting recognition, and advanced human&#8208;computer interactions. The versatility of SFITS is further exemplified through applications in remote control systems, molecular model generation, and virtual reality interfaces. The findings highlight the potential of sustainable ionic conductors in next&#8208;generation flexible electronics, offering a path toward greener and more intelligent device designs.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Shearing Chemistry Directed Closed&#8208;Pore Regeneration in Biomass&#8208;Derived Hard Carbons for Ultrafast Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an innovative DES cell&#8208;shearing strategy to tailor the closed&#8208;pore structure in bamboo&#8208;derived hard carbons. The optimized structure with appropriate closed&#8208;pore size (&#8764;2nm) and ultra&#8208;thin (1&#8211;3 layers) walls exhibits abundant active sites and delivers rapid ion diffusion kinetics and high reaction reversibility. This work significantly advances the applications of biomass materials for energy storage.








Abstract
The closed&#8208;pore structure of hard carbons holds the key to high plateau capacity and rapid diffusion kinetics when applied as sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) anodes. However, understanding and establishing the structure&#8208;electrochemistry relationship still remains a significant challenge. This work, for the first time, introduces an innovative deep eutectic solvent (DES) cell&#8208;shearing strategy to precisely tailor the cell structure of natural bamboo and consequently the closed&#8208;pore in its derived hard carbons. The DES shearing force effectively modifies the pore architecture by simultaneously shearing and dissolving amorphous components to form closed pore cores with adjustable sizes, as well as disintegrating crystalline cellulose through generation of competing hydrogen bonds to elaborately tune the pore wall thickness and ordering. The optimized closed&#8208;pore structure featuring appropriate pore size (&#8764;2 nm) and ultra&#8208;thin (1&#8211;3 layers) disordered pore walls, exhibits abundant active sites and delivers rapid ion diffusion kinetics and high reaction reversibility. Consequently, a high reversible capacity of 422 mAh g&#8722;1 at 30 mA g&#8722;1 along with an exceptional rate capability (318.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 6 A g&#8722;1) are achieved, outperforming almost all previous reported hard carbons. The new concept of cell&#8208;shearing chemistry for closed&#8208;pore regeneration significantly advances the applications of biomass materials for energy storage.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reinforcing Ionogel Bioadhesive Interface for Robust Integration and Monitoring of Bioelectronic Devices with Hard Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silk&#8208;based self&#8208;reinforcing ionogel shows good adhesion performance on biological hard tissues, common bioelectrode materials, and hard biomaterials. It can be assembled with the gold resonant circuit to form a wireless sensor to monitor the wound&#8208;healing process of biological hard tissues.








Abstract
Integrating bioelectronic devices with hard tissues, such as bones and teeth, is essential for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. However, stable and durable adhesion in dynamic, moist environments remains challenging. Traditional bioadhesives often fail to maintain strong bonds, especially when interfacing with metal electrodes and hard tissues. This study introduces a self&#8208;reinforcing ionogel bioadhesive interface (IGBI) combining silk fibroin and calcium ions, designed to provide robust and conductive integration of bioelectronic devices with hard tissues. The IGBI exhibits strong adhesion (up to 186&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2) and undergoes mechanical self&#8208;reinforcement through a structural transition in silk fibroin under physiological conditions. In vivo experiments demonstrate the IGBI's effectiveness in repairing bone defects and reimplanting teeth, with the added capability of wireless, real&#8208;time monitoring of bone healing. This approach allows for continuous tracking of tissue regeneration without a second invasive surgery for device removal. The IGBI represents a significant advancement in bioelectronic integration, offering a durable and versatile solution for challenging environments. Such unique self&#8208;reinforcing properties make the IGBI a promising material for biomedical applications where traditional adhesives are insufficient.

         <title>Bioinspired Nanochitin&#8208;Based Porous Constructs for Light&#8208;Driven Whole&#8208;Cell Biotransformations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetically cross&#8208;linked nanochitin cryogels are used for immobilization matrix for a solid&#8208;state cell factory. The resulting cryogels with hierarchical porosity manage to overcome the conventional limitations of mass transfer and light transmittance, as demonstrated by a number of light&#8208;driven biotransformation reactions.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state photosynthetic cell factories (SSPCFs) are a new production concept that leverages the innate photosynthetic abilities of microbes to drive the production of valuable chemicals. It addresses practical challenges such as high energy and water demand and improper light distribution associated with suspension&#8208;based culturing; however, these systems often face significant challenges related to mass transfer. The approach focuses on overcoming these limitations by carefully engineering the microstructure of the immobilization matrix through freeze&#8208;induced assembly of nanochitin building blocks. The use of nanochitins with optimized size distribution enabled the formation of macropores with lamellar spatial organization, which significantly improves light transmittance and distribution, crucial for maximizing the efficiency of photosynthetic reactions. The biomimetic crosslinking strategy, leveraging specific interactions between polyphosphate anions and primary amine groups featured on chitin fibers, produced mechanically robust and wet&#8208;resilient cryogels that maintained their functionality under operational conditions. Various model biotransformation reactions leading to value&#8208;added chemicals are performed in chitin&#8208;based matrix. It demonstrates superior or comparable performance to existing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art matrices and suspension&#8208;based systems. The findings suggest that chitin&#8208;based cryogel approach holds significant promise for advancing the development of solid&#8208;state photosynthetic cell factories, offering a scalable solution to improve the efficiency and productivity of light&#8208;driven biotransformation.

         <title>SciAgents: Automating Scientific Discovery Through Bioinspired Multi&#8208;Agent Intelligent Graph Reasoning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SciAgents AI model drives hypothesis generation by harnessing multi&#8208;agent graph reasoning, extracting insights from knowledge graphs constructed from scientific papers. Each agent plays a specific role: the Ontologist defines concepts, the Scientists draft and refine proposals, and the Critic reviews. Together, these agents create data&#8208;driven, innovative research ideas, advancing beyond traditional, human&#8208;led approaches.








Abstract
A key challenge in artificial intelligence (AI) is the creation of systems capable of autonomously advancing scientific understanding by exploring novel domains, identifying complex patterns, and uncovering previously unseen connections in vast scientific data. In this work, SciAgents, an approach that leverages three core concepts is presented: (1) large&#8208;scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi&#8208;agent systems with in&#8208;situ learning capabilities. Applied to biologically inspired materials, SciAgents reveals hidden interdisciplinary relationships that were&#160;previously considered unrelated, achieving a scale, precision, and exploratory power that surpasses human research methods. The framework autonomously generates and refines research hypotheses, elucidating underlying mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material properties. By integrating these capabilities in a modular fashion, the system yields material discoveries, critiques and improves existing hypotheses, retrieves up&#8208;to&#8208;date data about existing research, and highlights strengths and limitations. This is achieved by harnessing a &#8220;swarm of intelligence&#8221; similar to biological systems, providing new avenues for discovery. How this model accelerates the development of advanced materials by unlocking Nature's design principles, resulting in a new biocomposite with enhanced mechanical properties and improved sustainability through energy&#8208;efficient production is shown.

         <title>Sustainable Smart Packaging from Protein Nanofibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart packaging can extend shelf life and improve food quality monitoring. This study introduces a novel smart packaging solution using amyloid fibrils and red radish anthocyanins to monitor seafood spoilage. These findings show that these films effectively indicate shrimp freshness and possess high antibacterial and antioxidant properties, offering a sustainable approach to food packaging.








Abstract
Smart packaging technologies are revolutionizing the food industry by extending shelf life and enhancing quality monitoring through environmental responsiveness. Here, a novel smart packaging concept is presented, based on amyloid fibrils (AM) and red radish anthocyanins (RRA), to effectively monitor food spoilage by color change. A protein nanofibrils biofilm is developed from whey protein, which is functionalized with RRA to endow the resulting films with advanced monitoring capabilities. A comprehensive characterization, including pH responsiveness, water vapor permeability, thermal and mechanical testing, and colorimetric responses, demonstrates the superiority of AM/RRA films compared to control films based on whey monomer building blocks. The findings indicate that the AM/RRA films can effectively monitor, for example, shrimp freshness, showing visible changes within one day at room temperature and significant alterations in color after two days. Furthermore, these films exhibit high antibacterial and antioxidant activities, reinforcing their suitability for efficient food packaging. By integrating bio&#8208;based materials from whey and natural anthocyanins, this research presents a biodegradable, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective smart packaging solution, contributing to eco&#8208;friendly innovations in food preservation.

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost Hyperelastic Fuller&#8208;Dome&#8208;Structured Nanocellulose Aerogels by Dual Templates for Personal Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost mechanically ultra&#8208;resilient cellulose&#8208;based aerogel with Fuller&#8208;dome&#8208;like structure is developed by a dual&#8208;template strategy. The aerogel shows a desired cost&#8208;performance combination of low density, hypereslaticity, superhydrophobicity, ultralow thermal conductivity, and low cost, making it hold great promise as a thermal retention material for personal thermal management.








Abstract
It is critically important to maintain the body's thermal comfort for human beings in extremely cold environments. Cellulose nanofibers (CNF)&#8208;based aerogels represent a promising sustainable material for body's heat retention because of their renewability and low thermal conductivity. However, CNF&#8208;based aerogels often suffer high production costs due to expensive CNF, poor elasticity and/or unsatisfactory thermal insulation owing to improper microstructure design. Here, a facile dual&#8208;template strategy is reported to prepare a low&#8208;cost, hyperelastic, superhydrophobic Fuller&#8208;dome&#8208;structured CNF aerogel (CNF@PU) with low thermal conductivity. The combination of air template by foaming process and ice template enables the formation of a dome&#8208;like microstructure of CNF@PU aerogel, in which CNF serves as rope bars while inexpensive polyurethane (PU) acts as joints. The aerogel combines ultra&#8208;elasticity, low thermal conductivity (24&#160;mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), and low costs. The as&#8208;prepared CNF@PU aerogel demonstrates much better heat retention than commercial thermal retention fillers (e.g., Flannelette and goose down), promising its great commercial potential for massively producing warming garments. This work provides a facile approach for creating high&#8208;performance aerogels with tailored microstructure for effective personal thermal management.

         <title>Spray&#8208;Assisted Fabrication of Cellulose Photonic Pigments on Superhydrophobic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to directly produce structurally colored microparticles by drying cholesteric cellulose nanocrystal microdroplets on a superhydrophobic surface is reported. This approach has several key advantages that can unlock large&#8208;scale fabrication of sustainable photonic pigments, including exploiting existing industrial techniques (e.g. aerosolization), reduction in chemicals required (e.g. surfactants), rapid production times (&#8776;40 min or less), and size&#8208;independent and robust color.









Abstract
Photonic pigments, especially those based on naturally&#8208;derived building blocks like cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), are emerging as a promising sustainable alternative to absorption&#8208;based colorants. However, the proposed manufacturing methods for CNC pigments, via either grinding films or emulsion&#8208;based production, usually require several processing steps. This limits their commercialization by increasing the costs, timescales, and environmental impacts of production. Toward addressing these challenges, it is reported that photonic pigments can be produced in a single process by drying microdroplets of aqueous CNC suspension on a superhydrophobic surface. Such liquid&#8208;repellent substrate ensures the microdroplets maintain a near&#8208;spherical shape, enabling the radial self&#8208;organization of the cholesteric phase. Upon drying under ambient conditions, the CNC mesophase becomes kinetically arrested, after which the strong capillary forces induced by water evaporation result in extensive buckling of the microparticle. This buckling, coupled with prior tuning of the CNC formulation, enables photonic pigments with adjustable color across the visible spectrum. Importantly, the elimination of an emulsifying oil phase to create microdroplets enables a much faster drying time (&#8776;40 min) and improved color stability (e.g., polar solvents, elevated temperatures), while the reduction in reagents (e.g., oils, surfactants) and post&#8208;processing steps (e.g., solvent, heat) improves the sustainability of the fabrication process.

         <title>Engineering Triboelectric Paper for Energy Harvesting and Smart Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering nano&#8208;graphite coated paper (NG@P) is produced to serve as triboelectric layers and electrodes for TENGs. Ultra&#8208;high power density above 14 kW&#160;m&#8722;2 is achieved due to the electrostatic discharge on the surface. Moreover, smart home sensors are fabricated using the NG@P for motion sensing and sleep monitoring, which could be used for security and healthcare applications.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) represent a promising technology for energy harvesting and self&#8208;powered sensing with a wide range of applications. Despite their potential, challenges such as the need for cost&#8208;effective, large&#8208;area electrodes and engineering sustainable triboelectric materials remain, especially given the impending restrictions on single&#8208;use engineering plastics in Europe. To address these challenges, engineering nano&#8208;graphite&#8208;coated paper is presented as a sustainable and high&#8208;performance alternative for triboelectric layers. Moreover, this material, which can be produced on an industrial scale, offers a viable replacement for metal electrodes. The combination of nano&#8208;graphite and paper, with its large contact area and inherent surface roughness, enables ultra&#8208;high power densities exceeding 14 kW&#160;m&#8722;2, driven by electrostatic discharge at the surface. Beyond energy harvesting, smart sensors are developed for floors and walls that detect movements for security purposes and smart sheets that monitor body movements and physiological activities during sleep. The findings highlight the potential of this engineering paper to serve as an eco&#8208;friendly alternative to engineering plastics in TENGs and electrodes, opening new avenues for future applications.

Moreover, smart home sensors are fabricated using the NG@P for motion sensing and sleep monitoring, which could be used for security and healthcare applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) represent a promising technology for energy harvesting and self-powered sensing with a wide range of applications. Despite their potential, challenges such as the need for cost-effective, large-area electrodes and engineering sustainable triboelectric materials remain, especially given the impending restrictions on single-use engineering plastics in Europe. To address these challenges, engineering nano-graphite-coated paper is presented as a sustainable and high-performance alternative for triboelectric layers. Moreover, this material, which can be produced on an industrial scale, offers a viable replacement for metal electrodes. The combination of nano-graphite and paper, with its large contact area and inherent surface roughness, enables ultra-high power densities exceeding 14 kW&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, driven by electrostatic discharge at the surface. Beyond energy harvesting, smart sensors are developed for floors and walls that detect movements for security purposes and smart sheets that monitor body movements and physiological activities during sleep. The findings highlight the potential of this engineering paper to serve as an eco-friendly alternative to engineering plastics in TENGs and electrodes, opening new avenues for future applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Environmental Sustainability of Natural Biopolymer&#8208;Based Electrolytes for Lithium Ion Battery Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twenty&#8208;one biopolymer electrolytes including membrane&#8208;liquid electrolytes, gel electrolytes, and solid electrolytes are synthesized to analyze their electrochemical properties and environmental impacts through life cycle assessment. This consistent and comparable study demonstrates the significant functional and environmental benefits of biopolymer electrolytes for batteries, guiding academia and industry in fundamental studies and applied implementation of sustainable bio&#8208;based polymers and biopolymer electrolytes.








Abstract
Biopolymer based electrolytes can overcome current performance limitations of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Biopolymers enable electrolytes with high ionic conductivities and wide electrochemical stability windows. While the biobased character of natural materials is claimed as an inherent advantage in meeting current environmental sustainability challenges, further research is required to quantify and compare their environmental impacts as electrolytes. The challenge is addressed by identifying the most promising biopolymer electrolytes for LIBs, measuring ionic conductivities and electrochemical stability windows, and quantifying environmental impacts using life cycle assessment. The environmental impacts of the cost to isolate cellulose derivatives, nanocelluloses, chitin/nanochitin, chitosan, lignin, agar, and silk are reported for climate change, acidification, freshwater ecotoxicity, marine eutrophication, human toxicity, and water use. Material criticality, circularity index, and material circularity indicator, emerging impact categories are prioritized to help integrate biopolymers into circular and sustainable materials. The electrochemical properties and environmental impacts of natural biopolymer membrane&#8208;liquid electrolyte pairs, gel electrolytes, and solid electrolytes are quantified and benchmarked against conventional fossil&#8208;based electrolytes, providing consistent and comparable electrochemical properties of the most relevant biopolymer electrolytes fabricated so far. This study highlights the significant functional and environmental benefits of biopolymer electrolytes and identifies the most electrochemically competitive biopolymer electrolytes in LIBs.

         <title>Nanocellulose&#8208;Derived Hierarchical Carbon Framework&#8208;Supported P&#8208;Doped MoO2 Nanoparticles for Optimizing Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using nanocellulose as a building block, P&#8208;doped MoO2&#8722;x nanoparticles anchored on N, P co&#8208;doped porous carbon are constructed by in situ polymerization and hydrothermal treatment combined with phosphorylation. When being used for modifying the commercial separator of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, the composite provides abundant catalytic active sites and rapid ion accessibility. The assembled cell achieves an initial specific capacity of 11.3 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a sulfur loading of 8.1 mg cm&#8722;2 under lean electrolyte conditions.








Abstract
The integration of nanocatalysts into the separators of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) boosts the polysulfide conversion efficiency. However, the aggregation of catalyst nanoparticles diminishes the active surface area. Moreover, densely packed catalyst&#8208;modified layers often hinder ion transport rates and impede access to the catalytic sites. To overcome these challenges, a strategy is reported for modifying commercial separators, using wood nanocellulose as a building block to construct hierarchical P&#8208;doped MoO2&#8722;x nanoparticles anchored on N, P co&#8208;doped porous carbon (P&#8208;MoO2&#8722;x/NPC). The web&#8208;like entangled nanocellulose forms a framework for the in situ polymerization of polyaniline, providing abundant anchoring sites for MoO2 nanoparticles. The addition of P atoms optimizes the d&#8208;band center of MoO2 and enhances the catalytic activity of polysulfide conversion. The LSBs assembled using a P&#8208;MoO2&#8722;x/NPC coated polypropylene separator display an initial discharge capacity of 1621 mAh g&#8722;1 and rate performance of 774 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 C. Even with a sulfur loading of 8.1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and lean electrolyte conditions, the cell achieves an initial areal capacity of 11.3 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.1 C. This work provides a biopolymer nanofiber solution for constructing LSB separators with advanced electrochemical reactivity.

         <dc:description>
Complex evolutionary pressures result in unique protein fiber designs for silks. This includes multi&#8208;domain features and novel amino acid content that accommodate aqueous processing environments with remarkable functional properties. Bioengineering approaches inform new material formats and functions realized with silks. These design features provide a blueprint for future polymer designs with robust functions and sustainability as guideposts.








Abstract
This is a Perspective on nature as a story&#8208;teller, where inputs of evolution drove the remarkable protein designs found in silks. This selection process has resulted in silk materials with novel chemistry and properties to support organism survival in nature, yet with newfound utility in everything from comic books and automobiles to medicine. With growing global concerns related to environmental health, silks also serve as an invaluable instructional guide to the future of sustainable material designs.

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Perspective on Materials Sustainability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective discusses natural materials as inspiration for sustainable engineering designs and the processing of materials. First, circularity, longevity, parsimony, and activity are presented as essential material paradigms. The perspective then uses many examples of natural and technical materials to introduce principles such as oligo&#8208;materiality, multifunctionality, modularity, defect tolerance, remodeling, healing, adaptivity, as well as controlled disintegration.








Abstract
The article explores materials sustainability through a bio&#8208;inspired lens and discusses paradigms that can reshape the understanding of material synthesis, processing, and usage. It addresses various technological fields, from structural engineering to healthcare, and emphasizes natural material cycles as a blueprint for efficient recycling and reuse. The study shows that material functionality depends on both chemical composition and structural modifications, which emphasizes the role of material processing. The article identifies strategies such as mono&#8208;materiality and multifunctionality, and explores how responsivity, adaptivity, modularity, and cellularity can simplify material assembly and disassembly. Bioinspired strategies for reusing materials, defect tolerance, maintenance, remodeling, and healing may extend product lifespans. The principles of circularity, longevity, and parsimony are reconsidered in the context of &#8220;active materiality&#8221;, a dynamic bio&#8208;inspired paradigm. This concept expands the traditional focus of material science from structure&#8208;function relationships to include the development of materials capable of responding or adapting to external stimuli. Concrete examples demonstrate how bio&#8208;inspired strategies are being applied in engineering and technology to enhance the sustainability of materials. The article concludes by emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration as a key factor for developing a sustainable and resilient materials economy in harmony with nature's material cycles.

Wood and cellulose are the most abundant and important sustainable materials on the planet at the disposal to solve major societal challenges. This perspective, written for all materials scientists, highlights how breakthroughs in cellulose nanotechnology combined with functional nanomaterials can revolutionize important areas like construction, electronics, recycling, and intelligent materials at scale, toward a sustainable future.








Abstract
Wood, with its constituent building block cellulose, is by far the most common biomaterial on the planet and has been the most important material used by humans to establish civilization. If there is one single biomaterial that should be studied and used by materials scientists across disciplines to achieve a sustainable future, it is cellulose. This perspective provides insights for the general materials science community about the unique properties of wood and cellulose and how they may be used in advanced sustainable materials to make a substantial societal impact. The focus is on sawn wood or cellulose fibers produced at scale by industry and the more recent cellulosic nanomaterials, highlighting the areas where these cellulose&#8208;based materials can be valorized into higher&#8208;order functions. Numerous articles have comprehensively reviewed different areas where cellulose is currently used in advanced materials science. The objective here is to provide general insight for all material scientists and to provide the opinions about the areas in which cellulose and wood have the largest potential to make a significant societal impact, especially to realize next&#8208;generation sustainable materials for construction, food, water, energy, and information. Discussing key areas where future research is needed to open avenues toward a more sustainable future is ended.
