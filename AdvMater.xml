         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Transient Unilateral Adhesive Recombinant Collagen&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Reversible Fibrosis Induction and Full&#8208;Cycle Management of Pancreatic Fistula</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;activated, injectable recombinant collagen&#8208;based hydrogel plug with targeted drug delivery is developed for full&#8208;cycle management of pancreatic fistula. Featuring enzyme resistance, transient unilateral adhesion, and reversible fibrosis induction, this hydrogel achieves 100% sealing efficiency and provides comprehensive therapeutic effects, including hemostasis, anti&#8208;inflammation, and reversible inhibition of exocrine function. This study pioneers the application of sequence&#8208;engineered recombinant collagen in pancreatic fistula treatment.








Abstract
Currently, no effective treatment for pancreatic fistula (PF) exists, which has a mortality rate &gt;40%. Existing protein&#8208;based physical barriers face the challenges of rapid degradation, lack of self&#8208;adhesiveness, and the inability to promote PF healing. To overcome this, a novel enzyme&#8208;resistant and highly bioactive hydrogel (CGO@Pg&#8208;Cu(II)) is developed using glycidyl methacrylate recombinant collagen (enzyme&#8208;cleavage&#8208;free) and oxidized pullulan as backbone molecules, which is further loaded with a penicillin G&#8208;Cu(II) infinite coordination polymer nanomedicine. This hydrogel can adapt to irregular PF wounds through injectable self&#8208;leveling and achieve transient unilateral adhesion via light&#8208;activated radical crosslinking with tissue&#8208;inherent molecules. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate its ability to provide full&#8208;cycle PF management by serving as a long&#8208;lasting physical barrier while offering antimicrobial properties, rapid hemostasis, anti&#8208;inflammatory effects, reversible fibrosis induction, and enhancing pancreatic tissue repair. The anti&#8208;PF efficacy of the CGO@Pg&#8208;Cu(II) hydrogel at day 7 is 100%, highlighting its strong potential for clinical postoperative PF prevention.

         <title>Photocatalytic Aqueous Reforming of Methyl Formate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3d&#8208;metal Cu&#8208;based atomically dispersed photocatalyst, supported on modified g&#8208;C&#8323;N&#8324;, facilitates the photocatalytic selective hydrogen (7.5 mmol gcat&#8722;1 of hydrogen; nothing else than H2 and CO2) generation from methyl formate. This diverse system functions under mild conditions, providing high hydrogen yield, selectivity, and enduring stability. Through characterization and mechanistic investigations uncover a radical approach, offering a sustainable foundation for the future advancement of liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) technologies utilizing earth&#8208;abundant metals.








Abstract
Green hydrogen is critical to establish a sustainable energy future as it offers a clean, renewable, and a versatile alternative for decarbonizing industries, transportation, and power generation. However, the limitations of current methods significantly restrict the scope and hinder many of the envisioned applications. This study aims to report on the first example of a 3d&#8208;metal&#8208;based (Cu) heterogeneous photocatalytic system to produce green hydrogen via dehydrogenation of methyl formate (MF), a reaction previously known to require 4d/5d transition metals. Employing a Cu&#8208;based atomically dispersed heterogeneous photocatalyst supported on aryl&#8208;amino&#8208;substituted graphitic carbon nitride (d&#8208;gC3N4), the protocol offers numerous key advantages, including the recyclability of the photocatalyst for &gt;10 cycles without significant activity loss, sustained hydrogen production (&gt;15 days!) with high hydrogen yield (19.8 mmol gcat&#8722;1) and negligible CO emission, following an operationally simple, sustainable, and efficient catalytic pathway. Furthermore, the photocatalyst is characterized (using HAADF&#8208;STEM, SS&#8208;NMR, XAS, EPR, and XPS), all of which clearly demonstrated the presence of single atomic Cu&#8208;site. Additionally, comprehensive mechanistic investigations together with DFT calculations allow for a thorough mechanistic rationale for this reaction. It is strongly believed that this atomically dispersed heterogeneous photocatalytic approach will open new avenues for establishing liquid organic hydrogen career (LOHC) technologies.

         <title>Tri&#8208;System Interlocking Top&#8208;Encased Structures Enabled Highly Stable Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Photodetection Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique tri&#8208;system interlocking top&#8208;encased structure is formed for tin&#8208;lead perovskites by the introduction of novel CGA additive. The fabricated tin&#8208;lead perovskite NIR photodetector shows an outstanding specific detectivity of 2 &#215; 1013 Jones at 940 nm, and the integrated 64 &#215; 64 array demonstrates clear and accurate imaging abilities.









Abstract
Tin&#8208;lead binary perovskites show a very broad spectral bandwidth from ultraviolet (UV) to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) and outstanding optoelectronic properties for photodetection applications. However, the oxidation tendency of the divalent tin easily causes severe vacancies and defects, deteriorating the efficiency and stability of the device. In this work, without involving any costly synthesis of additives, a natural reducing agent of chlorogenic acid is proposed to establish a unique top&#8208;encased tri&#8208;system interlocking structure in tin&#8208;lead perovskites. Benefiting from the synergetic closed&#8208;loop interactions among functional groups of the additive with perovskites, tin&#8208;lead perovskite photodetectors (PDs) are demonstrated with improvements in energy&#8208;level alignment, antioxidation, and defect suppression and passivation. Finally, the self&#8208;powered perovskite NIR PDs present a high external quantum efficiency of &#8776;76%, an outstanding specific detectivity of 2 &#215; 1013 Jones at 940&#160;nm, and a large linear dynamic range of 222&#160;dB, along with good stability maintaining 96% of initial photocurrent after 127 days for the unencapsulated PDs storing under N2 atmosphere. By integrating with a 64 &#215; 64 thin&#8208;film transistor array, the tin&#8208;lead perovskite image sensor exhibits clear and accurate imaging properties, paving the way for a wide range of high&#8208;detectivity and high&#8208;resolution imaging applications.

         <title>Designing the Next Generation of Biomaterials through Nanoengineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoengineering enables precise control over biomaterial interactions with living systems by tuning surface energy, defects, porosity, and crystallinity. This review highlights how these nanoscale design parameters drive advances in regenerative medicine, drug delivery, bioprinting, biosensing, and bioimaging, while outlining key translational challenges and future directions.








Abstract
Recent advances in biomaterials science have applied nanoengineering to develop biomaterials with superior properties and tailored functionalities. These unique attributes are achieved due to the ability of nanoengineering to provide precise control over material interactions with living systems at the molecular scale. Here, key nanotechnologies employed to develop the next generation of biomaterials are critically evaluated. A diverse range of nanomaterials, differing in base materials, shapes, sizes, or surface properties can be integrated into various fabrication processes to develop these advanced biomaterials. Further investigation is required into properties such as surface energy, defects, porosity, and crystallinity, as these critically influence the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of nanoengineered materials. Consequently, we explore diverse biomedical applications of nanoengineered biomaterials, including regenerative medicine, biomolecular delivery, additive manufacturing, immune engineering, cancer therapeutics, bioimaging, biosensing, antimicrobial devices, and tissue adhesives. Additionally, their current limitations are analyzed and emerging strategies for designing the next generation of nanoengineered biomaterials are highlighted.

         <title>Ordering Engineering among the Nanostructure Evolution Facilitates High&#8208;Performance Li Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordering engineering among the nanostructure evolution has emerged as a promising strategy to address the issues of lithium (Li) metal anode, which involves enhancing the structural ordering of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), managing the distribution and orientation of inorganic components within SEI, and optimizing the morphostructure and texture of Li deposition.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) with extremely high energy density have emerged as highly promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, the inferior lifespan and safety hazards hinder their practical applications, which arise from the disordered nanostructure at anodic interface, such as mosaic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and nonuniform Li deposition.

&lt;p&gt;Ordering engineering among the nanostructure evolution has emerged as a promising strategy to address the issues of lithium (Li) metal anode, which involves enhancing the structural ordering of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), managing the distribution and orientation of inorganic components within SEI, and optimizing the morphostructure and texture of Li deposition.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) with extremely high energy density have emerged as highly promising candidates for next-generation energy storage systems. However, the inferior lifespan and safety hazards hinder their practical applications, which arise from the disordered nanostructure at anodic interface, such as mosaic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and nonuniform Li deposition. Ordering engineering among the nanostructure evolution has emerged as a promising strategy to address these issues, which involves enhancing the structural ordering of SEI, managing the distribution and orientation of inorganic components within SEI, and optimizing the morphostructure and texture of Li deposition. Herein, recent advances in ordering engineering which effectively promote the interface ordering are systematically summarized. The importance of constructing a multilayer SEI with oriented inorganic components and achieving strong Li texture with preferred crystal plane is highlighted. Furthermore, advanced characterization techniques employed in ordering engineering are critically reviewed.

         <title>Turning Waste into Treasure: Pretreatment Strategy for Promoting Secondary Grain Growth by Reusing Excess Lead Iodide in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pretreatment strategy of spin&#8208;coated quantum dots during the perovskite annealing process can use PbI2 as a raw material to promote the secondary growth of perovskite. Compared with the post&#8208;treatment strategy of passivating the perovskite surface after annealing, this approach is more innovative and effective at suppressing the influence of excessive PbI2 on the PCE and stability of perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells have witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, yet several pivotal factors persistently impede their widespread commercial adoption. Among these, the behavior of excess lead iodide (PbI2) during perovskite synthesis is particularly concerning. Excess PbI2 that promotes perovskite growth will accumulate at grain boundaries during annealing, which restricts the device performance and hinders its long&#8208;term applicability. In this work, an innovative pretreatment strategy is developed by depositing the Cs3ErCl6 quantum dots (QDs) on the perovskite film during annealing, which is different from the traditional post&#8208;treatment strategy by depositing QDs after annealing. It is evident that PbI2 can react with Cs3ErCl6 QDs, enabling its secondary utilization and promoting the secondary growth of perovskite in the vicinity of grain boundaries to inhibit the formation of excess PbI2. The pretreated perovskite layer has a better&#160;fit grain, resulting in higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) and better stability of the device. The (FAPbI3) 0.95(MAPbBr3) 0.05 perovskite solar cell treated using the pretreatment method demonstrates a champion PCE of 26.01%. This work offers new perspectives for inhibiting excessive PbI2 growth and thus holds great promise for advancing the commercial viability of perovskite solar cells and contributing to the future landscape of renewable energy.

         <title>Solving Mazes of Organelle&#8208;Targeted Therapies with DNA Nanomachines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the evolution of DNA nanomachines as a transformative approach for organelle&#8208;specific cancer treatment. Their design principles, therapeutic mechanisms, and enhanced selectivity for precise drug delivery and activation of cell death pathways are examined. Key strategies for subcellular targeting, therapeutic advantages, and the integration of AI&#8208;driven research to accelerate innovation are discussed, providing a roadmap for future clinical translation in advanced cancer nanomedicine.








Abstract
Despite decades of research, cancer remains a growing global health challenge. Nanomaterials&#8208;based therapeutics have shown promise, but their clinical applications are often limited by poor selectivity and undesirable side effects. Recently, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) based nanomachines have gained attention as intelligent drug carriers due to their ability to precisely target specific organelles. By leveraging rationally designed DNA nanomachines, it is possible to directly attack subcellular structures or deliver therapeutic agents to precise locations, triggering organelle&#8208;mediated cell death. This innovative approach offers several advantages, including enhanced efficacy, lower dosages, minimized off&#8208;target effects, reduced multidrug resistance, and improved therapeutic durability. This review explores the history and advancements of organelle&#8208;targeting strategies, providing new insights into targeting the nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes using DNA nanomachines. The review also discusses the structures, design principles, and therapeutic mechanisms of these nanomachines, along with the integration of artificial intelligence&#8208;driven self&#8208;driving laboratories to enhance research growth, efficiency, and competitiveness. Finally, the current challenges, opportunities, and future directions in this evolving field are addressed, offering a roadmap for solving the intricate maze of organelle&#8208;targeted cancer therapies.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework and Nanocellulose Composites for Multifunctional Environmental Remediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and nanocellulose composites have significant potential for the multi&#8208;functional remediation of the environment. This review focused on the synthesis strategies (in situ growth, ex situ growth, and other approaches), typical forms (aerogel, hydrogel, beads, and membrane), and applications in the removal of common pollutants (dye, pharmaceuticals, heavy metal ions, VOCs, CO2, PM, and others) in the environment by MOFs&#8208;nanocellulose (MOFs&#8208;NC) composites. The future perspectives and current challenges of MOFs&#8208;NC composites in environmental remediation applications are also pointed out.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are widely used in environmental remediation due to their unique properties. However, their practical applications are significantly limited by its powder crystal form. To address these limitations, MOFs can be integrated with abundant and sustainable biomass&#8208;derived nanocellulose (NC) to construct processable macroscopic architectures. Herein, this review discusses recent advances in the preparation of multi&#8208;dimensional macroscopic materials from MOFs&#8208;NC and their applications in environmental remediation, including dye adsorption and degradation, pharmaceutical removal, heavy metal ion capture, adsorption and degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), CO2 capture and separation, particulate matter (PM) separation, and others. A summary of two commonly used strategies for preparing MOFs&#8208;NC composites proposes a valuable insight on how processable macroscopic architectures can be effectively achieved. Furthermore, this review provides an overview of the structure&#8208;property&#8208;function relationship between multi&#8208;dimensional MOFs&#8208;NC composites and highlights their versatile applications in the remediation of polluted environments. The mechanisms, challenges, and future prospects of the material in removing environmental pollutants are also present in detail. This review aims to guide researchers in designing high&#8208;performance, multi&#8208;functional, sustainable, and scalable MOFs&#8208;NC composites for future environmental remediation.

To address these limitations, MOFs can be integrated with abundant and sustainable biomass-derived nanocellulose (NC) to construct processable macroscopic architectures. Herein, this review discusses recent advances in the preparation of multi-dimensional macroscopic materials from MOFs-NC and their applications in environmental remediation, including dye adsorption and degradation, pharmaceutical removal, heavy metal ion capture, adsorption and degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture and separation, particulate matter (PM) separation, and others. A summary of two commonly used strategies for preparing MOFs-NC composites proposes a valuable insight on how processable macroscopic architectures can be effectively achieved. Furthermore, this review provides an overview of the structure-property-function relationship between multi-dimensional MOFs-NC composites and highlights their versatile applications in the remediation of polluted environments. The mechanisms, challenges, and future prospects of the material in removing environmental pollutants are also present in detail. This review aims to guide researchers in designing high-performance, multi-functional, sustainable, and scalable MOFs-NC composites for future environmental remediation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Roles of Deep Eutectic Solvent in Polysulfide Redox and Catalysis for Intermediate&#8208;Temperature Potassium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;functional NiS&#8208;DES interfacial strategy enables highly reversible K2S2/K2S conversion in intermediate&#8208;temperature K&#8208;S batteries by balancing adsorption and activation of intermediates at the catalytic interface, achieving high capacity, long cycle life, and low&#8208;cost energy storage.








Abstract
Potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8208;S) batteries hold great promise for long&#8208;duration energy storage due to their low cost and high energy density. However, the irreversible deposition of K2S2/K2S severely hinders sulfur utilization and cycling stability. Herein, a NiS&#8211;DES interfacial regulation strategy is developed that leverages the dual functionality of a deep eutectic solvent (DES) to govern the adsorption and conversion behavior of K2S2/K2S at the catalytic interface, enabling their highly reversible transformation. Specifically, DES forms moderate electronic coupling with NiS to weaken the excessively strong adsorption of K2S and prevent catalyst deactivation. Simultaneously, strong electronic interactions between DES and K2S promote interfacial activation and conversion, thereby extending the reaction pathway and enhancing reduction depth. As a result, the intermediate&#8208;temperature K&#8208;S batteries deliver an initial capacity of 810 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with a minimal capacity decay of 0.02%/cycle over 1300 cycles at 6&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 sulfur loading. Even under lean catholyte (4.2 &#181;L&#160;mg[sulfur]&#8722;1) and higher sulfur loading (12&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2), they achieve 521 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 initially, retaining stability with 0.03%/cycle decay over 500 cycles. This NiS&#8208;30DES system achieves a cell&#8208;level energy density exceeding 150&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and a low levelized cost of storage (LCOS) of $140/MWh, demonstrating strong potential for scalable long&#8208;duration energy storage.

         <title>Sonodynamic and Bioorthogonal Sonocatalytic Thrombotic Therapy Based on AIE Cationic Tetranuclear Ir(III) Complex Nanoplatform Guided by NIR&#8208;Chemiluminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AIE&#8208;active tetranuclear Ir(III) complex Ir&#8208;4 as a sonosensitizer/sonocatalyst is formulated into a nanoplatform with an H2S donor. Ir&#8208;4@S&#8208;R NPs achieves combined endogenous NIR chemiluminescence imaging, sonodynamic therapy and release of H2S in situ by a bioorthogonal sonocatalytic reaction in vivo, achieving safe thrombolysis and anti&#8208;inflammatory therapy.








Abstract
Non&#8208;invasive thrombolytic strategies include photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT) and sonodynamic therapy (SDT). The development of PTT and PDT is impeded by the limited tissue penetration depth of the light source. SDT is a promising method due to the deeper tissue penetration and site&#8208;specific features of ultrasound; however, the scarcity of efficient sonosensitizers has constrained its clinical use. Herein, ultrasound&#8208;triggered nanoparticles (NPs), named Ir&#8208;4@S&#8208;R NPs, achieve a sonodynamic thrombolytic, bioorthogonal sonocatalytic reaction, with chemiluminescence (CL) imaging in the thrombus. An Ir(III) complex, named Ir&#8208;4, which has aggregation induced emission (AIE), combined with a hydrogen sulfide donor, named H2S&#8208;N3, provide the nanoplatform which is modified with the peptide c(RGDfC) to target the thrombus. This supramolecular assembly successfully integrates: i) thrombosis detection based on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminescence imaging, ii) sonodynamic thrombus therapy and iii) release of hydrogen sulfide for anti&#8208;inflammatory action. Ir&#8208;4@S&#8208;R NPs emit long&#8208;lasting NIR CL triggered by endogenous ONOO&#8722; and achieve 12&#160;mm deep tissue penetration. Blood clots are effectively removed and blood flow is almost fully restored in mouse carotid thrombus and rat femoral vein models. The work demonstrates a new integrated strategy for diagnosing and treating life&#8208;threatening diseases caused by thrombusotic disorders.

         <title>Cutting&#8208;Edge Developments at the Interface of Inorganic Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (ISEs) and their pivotal role in solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) development. It examines various ISE categories, interface characteristics, and commercialization challenges while highlighting advanced characterization techniques and the transformative impact of machine learning in enhancing ISE performance and addressing existing technological barriers.








Abstract
Inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (ISEs) are critical components of solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs), and their interfacial properties play a decisive role in battery performance. This paper systematically reviews the recent advances in the interfaces of ISEs. It begins by defining and classifying ISEs&#8212;encompassing oxides, sulfides, and halides&#8212;while highlighting their fundamental characteristics, potential applications, and existing interface challenges. The discussion extends to the composition, structure, and reaction phenomena at the interfaces of SSBs, focusing on how these factors influence internal resistance, cycling stability, and safety. We detail advanced microscopic and spectroscopic techniques employed to investigate interfacial microstructures and chemical properties, as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance for electrical and structural analysis, while also highlighting emerging modalities for interface characterization in SSBs. Additionally, we explore the role of informatics strategies, particularly high&#8208;throughput computing and machine learning, in predicting interfacial stability, calculating ionic transport properties, and screening new materials to optimize interface engineering. Despite noteworthy progress in understanding ISE interfaces, challenges remain that hinder the commercialization of SSBs. Future research efforts should prioritize the optimization of interfacial structures and properties through multi&#8208;scale and multi&#8208;technique approaches to further accelerate SSB development.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Chelating and ROS&#8208;Scavenging Polymers with Thioketal and Thioether Bonds Delivering Ferroptosis Inhibitor Lip&#8208;1 Provide a Triple Therapeutic Strategy for Retina Ganglion Cells in Acute Glaucoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employs polymer P1 and polymer P2 as drug carriers to encapsulate Lip&#8208;1 into NPsLip&#8208;1. This system provides triple protection: (1) ROS scavenging via thioether/thioketal bond cleavage, (2) iron ion chelation through exposed NOTA groups, and (3) GPX4 activity restoration by Lip&#8208;1. This synergistic strategy rescues RGCs, restores visual function in vivo, and demonstrates excellent ocular safety.








Abstract
Glaucoma is an irreversible blinding eye disease characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death with emerging evidence highlighting ferroptosis as a crucial mechanism. Herein, two iron&#8208;chelating and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging polymers with thioketal and thioester bonds delivering Lip&#8208;1 are designed and self&#8208;assembled into NPsLip&#8208;1, which pose a triple threat to RGC of Acute Glaucoma via ROS scavenging, iron ion chelation, and potent ferroptosis inhibition. Upon immediate cellular uptake of NPsLip1 by RGCs, the elevated intracellular ROS triggers the cleavage of thioether bonds and the oxidation of thioester bonds, resulting in ROS consumption and simultaneous release of Lip&#8208;1 and exposure of polymer chains with pendant 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triacetic acid (NOTA) groups. On the one hand, the NOTA groups can chelate with iron ions, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis in RGCs. On the other hand, the released Lip&#8208;1 can inhibit ferroptosis by upregulating glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Together, NPsLip&#8208;1 with a triple threat markedly reduced ferroptosis and oxidative stress, significantly enhancing the survival of R28 cells. Further, NPsLip&#8208;1 effectively inhibits the RGC ferroptosis and preserves the visual function. Overall, the findings indicated NPsLip&#8208;1 provides substantial protection for RGCs via suppressing oxidative stress and ferroptosis, representing a promising therapeutic avenue for glaucoma.

         <title>Tailored Heterogeneous Interphase Layer Promotes Low&#8208;Temperature Desolvation Toward Durable Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous artificial interphase is constructed to stabilize sodium metal anodes at subzero temperatures. The tailored sodiophilic interface facilitates Na+ desolvation and regulates uniform deposition, effectively suppressing dendrite formation even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. This work offers a practical strategy to enhance interfacial stability and electrochemical performance of low&#8208;temperature sodium metal batteries.









Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) represent a promising next&#8208;generation energy storage technology due to their low cost and high energy density. However, SMBs face significant challenges, including interfacial instability and the growth of sodium dendrites on the metal anode, particularly at low temperatures (LTs). Poor ion desolvation at LTs further exacerbates these issues, severely compromising battery performance. To address these problems, a heterogeneous artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) composed of Na3VO4 and metallic In (NVO&#8208;In@Na) is designed for LT SMBs. The sodiophilic Na3VO4 promotes sodium ion adsorption, while the Na2In phase formed during the initial plating enhances ion transport kinetics, resulting in uniform Na deposition behavior. Theory calculations indicate that the Na3VO4/Na2In interface accelerates charge transfer processes and desolvation. The engineered NVO&#8208;In@Na anode demonstrates exceptional stability: symmetric cells operate for over 2000 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2 under ambient conditions and exceed 1100 h at 0.1 mA cm&#8722;2/0.1 mAh cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;40 &#176;C. Full cells paired with Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode retain 97% capacity after 1150 cycles at 0.5 C and &#8722;40 &#176;C. This work highlights the potential of rational SEI design to overcome critical limitations of SMBs, advancing high&#8208;performance energy storage under extreme conditions.

Photoimmunotherapy
In article number 2501184, Yuqi Tang, Dan Xiang, and Quan Li report a novel near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;based nanomedicine, leveraging an in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly strategy to fabricate highly targeted nanoparticles. These nanomedicines trigger pyroptosis by generating type I reactive oxygen species, while simultaneously activating photoimmunotherapy. This unique structural transformation enhances the nanomedicine accumulation in tumor tissues, enabling robust NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and improving therapeutic efficacy even in hypoxic tumor microenvironments.

Friction Behavior of Hydrogels
In article number 2417177, Kai Zhang, Jiuling Wang, and co&#8208;workers reveal that water evaporation from hydrogel surfaces in open&#8208;air conditions reduces the hydrodynamic layer thickness and increases surface viscosity, leading to a gradual rise in friction. Optimizing pore size and water mobility within the hydrogel enhances water transport from the interior to the surface, mitigating evaporation and enabling consistently low friction. This work provides guidelines for designing hydrogel materials with excellent lubrication properties.

Sprayable Hydrogel
This study designs a sprayable hydrogel based on polypeptide&#8208;modified lipid nanoparticles (PLNs) to treat non&#8208;compressible hemorrhage. Functionalized with GFOGER and GGQQLK peptides, PLNs synergistically mimic natural hemostasis via platelet adherence and aggregation, Ca2+/DSPS&#8208;mediated prothrombin activation and fibrin network stabilization. The biomimetic system enables rapid clot formation by sequential coordinating primary hemostasis, coagulation amplification and fibrin reinforcement. More details can be found in article number 2500908 by Yang Li, Chenhui Zhu, Daidi Fan, and co&#8208;workers.

Multimodal Humidity Adaptive Optical Neuron
In article number 2417793 by Nazek El&#8208;Atab and co&#8208;workers, a multifunctional memristor is demonstrated for in&#8208;memory sensing and computing, leveraging a MoWS2/VOx heterojunction to enable high ON/OFF ratio up to 108 with ultralow operating voltages of &#177;0.2 V. This bio&#8208;inspired multimodal design exhibits tunable synaptic behavior across electrical, optical, and humidity stimuli, enabling in&#8208;situ modulation of conductance for low&#8208;power, real&#8208;time processing of multisensory signals. The reconfigurable humidity&#8208;adaptive neuron and humidity&#8208;mediated optical synaptic learning enable vision clarity control, paving the way for energy&#8208;efficient next&#8208;generation human&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>Engineering Magnetotactic Bacteria as Medical Microrobots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are living microorganisms that produce magnetosomes for navigation using the Earth's geomagnetic field. Their built&#8208;in magnetic components, along with their intrinsic and/or modified biological functions, make them one of the most promising platforms for making future living and programmable microrobots. This review highlights recent advances in MTB&#8208;based microrobotics, detailing their interactions with magnetic fields, propulsion mechanisms, motion control, and emerging strategies for engineering and functionalizing MTB for biomedical applications.








Abstract
Nature's ability to create complex and functionalized organisms has long inspired engineers and scientists to develop increasingly advanced machines. Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), a group of Gram&#8208;negative prokaryotes that biomineralize iron and thrive in aquatic environments, have garnered significant attention from the bioengineering community. These bacteria possess chains of magnetic nanocrystals known as magnetosomes, which allow them to align with Earth's geomagnetic field and navigate through aquatic environments via magnetotaxis, enabling localization to areas rich in nutrients and optimal oxygen concentration. Their built&#8208;in magnetic components, along with their intrinsic and/or modified biological functions, make them one of the most promising platforms for future medical microrobots. Leveraging an externally applied magnetic field, the motion of MTBs can be precisely controlled, rendering them suitable for use as a new type of biohybrid microrobotics with great promise in medicine for bioimaging, drug delivery, cancer therapy, antimicrobial treatment, and detoxification. This mini&#8208;review provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of recent advancements in MTB microrobots, delineates the interaction between MTB microrobots and magnetic fields, elucidates propulsion mechanisms and motion control, and reports state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies for modifying and functionalizing MTB for medical applications.

         <dc:description>
This review explores the integration of responsive materials and soft robotic actuators with implantable electronics to address key challenges in bioelectronic medicine. By enabling shape actuation, these technologies improve deployment, adaptability, and accuracy in minimally invasive procedures. The review discusses actuation mechanisms, device designs, and future opportunities for intelligent, responsive implants with enhanced therapeutic and diagnostic capabilities.








Abstract
Bioelectronic medicine uses implantable electronic devices to interface with electrically active tissues and transform the way disease is diagnosed and treated. One of the biggest challenges is the development of minimally invasive devices that can be deployed to patients at scale. Responsive materials and soft robotic actuators offer unique opportunities to make bioelectronic devices with shape actuation, promising to address the limitations of existing rigid and passive systems, including difficult deployment, mechanical mismatch with soft tissues, and limited adaptability in minimally invasive settings. In this review, an overview is provided of smart materials and soft robotic technologies that show promises for implantable use, discussing advantages and limitations of underlying actuation mechanisms. Examples are then presented where soft actuating mechanisms are combined with microelectrodes to create shape actuating bioelectronic devices. Opportunities and challenges for next&#8208;generation intelligent bioelectronic devices assisted by responsive materials and soft robotic actuators are then discussed. These innovations may allow electronic implants to safely navigate to target areas inside the body and establish large area and spatiotemporally controlled interfaces for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures that are minimally invasive.

         <title>Deactivation Mechanism and Mitigation Strategies of Single&#8208;Atom Site Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the single&#8208;atom site electrocatalysts (SACs) stability/durability, encompassing both deactivation mechanism at the atomic&#8208;, meso&#8208;, and nanoscale, and mitigation strategies by controlling the catalyst composition, structure, morphology and surface. Moreover, the challenges and prospects of efficient SACs for long&#8208;term use are proposed. This review can provide a unique perspective as well as rational guidelines, with emphasis on stability/durability issues, for future large&#8208;scale applications of SACs and beyond.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom site electrocatalysts (SACs), with maximum atom efficiency, fine&#8208;tuned coordination structure, and exceptional reactivity toward catalysis, energy, and environmental purification, have become the emerging frontier in recent decade. Along with significant breakthroughs in activity and selectivity, the limited stability and durability of SACs are often underemphasized, posing a grand challenge in meeting the practical requirements. One pivotal obstacle to the construction of highly stable SACs is the heavy reliance on empirical rather than rational design methods. A comprehensive review is urgently needed to offer a concise overview of the recent progress in SACs stability/durability, encompassing both deactivation mechanism and mitigation strategies. Herein, this review first critically summarizes the SACs degradation mechanism and induction factors at the atomic&#8208;, meso&#8208; and nanoscale, mainly based on but not limited to oxygen reduction reaction. Subsequently, potential stability/durability improvement strategies by tuning catalyst composition, structure, morphology and surface are delineated, including construction of robust substrate and metal&#8208;support interaction, optimization of active site stability, fabrication of porosity and surface modification. Finally, the challenges and prospects for robust SACs are discussed. This review facilitates the fundamental understanding of catalyst degradation mechanism and provides efficient design principles aimed at overcoming deactivation difficulties for SACs and beyond.

         <dc:description>
A contemporary and critical review on carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics. The common thermoplastic and carbon fiber applied in the manufacture of carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics are summarized, and the processing and postprocessing methods are reviewed, with emphasis on state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art welding techniques. The typical applications of carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics in industry are also highlighted.








Abstract
Carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics (CFRTs) have witnessed a resurgence in recent times since their first industrial use over five decades ago, with revitalized interest from aerospace companies and other key sectors including energy and automotive sectors. CFRTs are increasingly gaining footholds in high volume rapid manufacturing in aerospace and nonaerospace sectors owing to their inherent recyclability. However, there has been a lack of contemporary and critical review on this topic so far. This work aims to review the recent advances in CFRTs with emphasis on high performance thermoplastics. Both continuous and discontinuous fiber forms in tape, organosheet and short/long fiber architectures are discussed, their processing and postprocessing methods are reviewed, with emphasis on state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art welding techniques. Typical applications of CFRTs in industry are examined, including fuselage, pressure vessel, and automotive components. Finally, insights are provided into ongoing challenges, future development, and a roadmap for expediting the development of high&#8208;performance CFRTs.

         <title>Materials Advances in Devices for Heart Disease Interventions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the crucial role of materials in heart disease interventions, focusing on strategies for monitoring, managing, and repairing heart conditions. It discusses the material requirements for medical devices, highlighting recent innovations and their impact on cardiovascular health. It aims to provide insights into the challenges in cardiovascular interventions and the essential role of materials in developing effective solutions.








Abstract
Heart disease encompasses a range of conditions that affect the heart, including coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, congenital heart defects, heart valve disease, and conditions that affect the heart muscle. Intervention strategies can be categorized according to when they are administered and include: 1) Monitoring cardiac function using sensor technology to inform diagnosis and treatment, 2) Managing symptoms by restoring cardiac output, electrophysiology, and hemodynamics, and often serving as bridge&#8208;to&#8208;recovery or bridge&#8208;to&#8208;transplantation strategies, and 3) Repairing damaged tissue, including myocardium and heart valves, when management strategies are insufficient. Each intervention approach and technology require specific material properties to function optimally, relying on materials that support their action and interface with the body, with new technologies increasingly depending on advances in materials science and engineering. This review explores material properties and requirements driving innovation in advanced intervention strategies for heart disease and highlights key examples of recent progress in the field driven by advances in materials research.

         <title>Constructing Water&#8208;Retaining/Ion&#8208;Regulating Bi&#8208;Layers for Highly Durable, All&#8208;Climate, Efficient Moisture Electric Generators</title>

A high&#8208;performance moisture&#8208;electric generator is fabricated by integrating an ionic hydrogel layer with a graphene oxide film, where the designed ionic hydrogel offers ongoing power output under diverse environments while the intrinsic layering graphene oxide efficiently manages ion diffusion for enhanced electricity production. The developed device can be easily scaled up for powering various electronic devices.








Abstract
Moisture electric generators (MEGs), which can directly convert chemical energy in moisture into electricity have demonstrated great potential for powering wearable electronics and IoT devices. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MEGs suffer from transient power output and rely on high relative humidity (RH) as well as mild temperature, hampering their practical applications. Herein, a novel high&#8208;performance MEG is reported by designing ionic hydrogel and graphene oxide dual&#8208;layered devices, where the water&#8208;enriched hydrogel enables continuous power outputs under various conditions while the inherent layering nanochannels effectively regulate ion diffusion for stable and efficient performance improvement. The MEG can generate a maximum power density of 71.7&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 and continuously output 0.6&#160;V for more than 1400&#160;h at room condition without degradation. Most importantly, the developed generator can operate well from &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C to 50&#160;&#176;C, and an ultrahigh and stable voltage of 1.2&#160;V is realized at RH of 0% owing to the dynamic water equilibrium in the system. The MEG also displays excellent self&#8208;restoration capabilities, demonstrating high cyclic&#8208;performing potential. This work may provide important guidelines in designing long&#8208;life all climate applicable energy harvesting devices through designing synergistic bilayers architecture.

         <title>Wearable Photonic Device for Multiple Biomarker Sampling and Detection without Blood Draws</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable photonic device (PiED) is developed by integrating a microlens array (MLA) and an optic microneedle array (OMNA) functionalized with immunobinding for safe and needle&#8208;free biomarker sampling and multiple blood biomarker detection without blood draw. The MLA&#8208;integrated OMNA amplifies and transmits LED light at 595 nm into skin, evenly distributing it in the capillary&#8208;enriched dermis and inducing biomarker extravasation.








Abstract
Needle&#8208;based blood draws or phlebotomy practice in clinics for centuries, often causing pain, discomfort, and inconvenience. Here, a wearable photonic device is presented by integrating a microlens array (MLA) and an optic microneedle array (OMNA) functionalized with immunobinding for safe and needle&#8208;free biomarker sampling and detection. The MLA&#8208;integrated OMNA amplifies and transmits LED light at 595&#160;nm into skin through the OMNA, bypassing the light&#8208;absorbing melanin in the epidermal layer, and evenly distributing it in the capillary&#8208;enriched dermis independent of the skin colors. The 595&#160;nm light is absorbed by hemoglobin (Hb) and oxygen&#8208;Hb within the capillaries, triggering thermal dilation of capillaries without damaging them or causing petechiae. The light illumination remarkably increases in the concentrations of various blood biomarkers in the skin through biomarker extravasation. These biomarkers bound specifically to the capture antibodies on&#160;OMNA with each microneedle covalently immobilized with one specific antibody. The OMNA is extensively modified to amplify the immunobinding signals and achieve sensitivity superior to that of enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. As proof of concept, the functionality of the prototype for minimally invasive sampling and precise multiplexed blood biomarker detection in two mouse models is validated to quantify acute inflammation and specific antibody production.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Recyclable Polyester Elastomers Through Transient Strain&#8208;Stiffening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient strain&#8208;crystallization simultaneously strengthens and toughens block polyester elastomers while conserving recyclability. Using controlled polymerization catalysis and commercial monomers, block polyester elastomers outperform current commercial elastomers, entering a new region of tensile mechanical property space.








Abstract
Polyester thermoplastic elastomers are promising sustainable materials but their mechanical properties need improvement, in particular, attempts to increase strength often result in compromised elasticity. Strong and tough elastomers are known but require complex polymer formulations together with control over cross&#8208;linking or crystallinity, both of which challenge recycling. Here, the introduction of transient strain&#8208;stiffening approaches into fully amorphous structures show both strengthening and toughening of elastomers while conserving recyclability. The new amorphous block polyester elastomers are prepared by controlled polymerization methods using commercial monomers. The block polymers comprise a central poly(&#603;&#8208;caprolactone&#8208;co&#8208;&#603;&#8208;decalactone) block flanked by poly(cyclohexene oxide&#8208;alt&#8208;phthalate) blocks. Elastomer thermomechanical properties are tuned by varying ratios of &#603;&#8208;caprolactone to &#603;&#8208;decalactone within the mid&#8208;block to access materials with excellent mechanical properties. The best elastomers feature 30&#8211;50 wt.% polycaprolactone and exhibit tensile strengths up to 40&#160;MPa, elongations at break above 2000%, with excellent elastic recovery (&gt;90%). These materials exhibit strain&#8208;induced crystallization and outperform current commercial elastomers, entering a new region of tensile mechanical property space. They have service temperature ranges from &#8722;60 to 140&#160;&#176;C and high temperature stability (&#8805;300&#160;&#176;C), with wide thermal (re)processing windows. These new polyester elastomers also show high resistance to creep, humidity resistance, and excellent recyclability.

         <title>Lipid Nanoparticles Enhance mRNA Delivery to the Central Nervous System Upon Intrathecal Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research explores lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for enhancing mRNA delivery to the central nervous system via intrathecal injection. By chemically engineering brain&#8208;targeting small molecules into ionizable lipids (BLs), the developed BLNPs effectively facilitate mRNA delivery across the brain. Intrathecal administration of Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA using the lead BLNP achieves significant gene editing in the brain with minimal off&#8208;target effects.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticle&#8208;messenger RNA formulations have garnered significant attention for their therapeutic potential in infectious diseases, cancer and genetic disorders. However, effective mRNA delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) remains a formidable challenge. To overcome this limitation, a class of brain&#8208;targeting lipids (BLs) is developed by incorporating brain&#8208;targeting small molecules with amino lipids and formulated them with helper lipids to generate brain&#8208;targeting lipid nanoparticles (BLNPs) for mRNA delivery. Screening studies led to a lead formulation, TD5 BLNPs, outperforming FDA&#8208;approved DLin&#8208;MC3&#8208;DMA LNPs in delivering mRNA to the brain upon intrathecal injection. Specifically, a single intrathecal injection of TD5 BLNP&#8208;GFP mRNA led to GFP expression in 29.6% of neurons and 38.1% of astrocytes across the brain. In an Ai14 mouse model, TD5 BLNP&#8208;Cre recombinase mRNA treatment induced tdTomato expression in &#8776;30% of neurons and 40% of astrocytes across major brain regions. Notably, delivery of Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA complex using TD5 BLNPs achieved effective genome editing in the brain. Additionally, TD5 BLNPs showed comparable safety profiles to MC3 LNPs, indicating promising biocompatibility. Overall, this TD5 BLNP formulation effectively delivers mRNA to brain tissues via intrathecal injection and facilitates efficient expression in both neurons and astrocytes, presenting a potential strategy for treating CNS diseases.

The microscopic mechanisms governing the friction characteristics of hydrogels in open&#8208;air environments are revealed through experiments, theoretical analyses, and molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that larger pore sizes and enhanced internal water mobility improve the permeability of hydrogels, allowing them to maintain a low friction coefficient by mitigating surface water loss.









Abstract
Hydrogels composed of a solvent&#8208;saturated, cross&#8208;linked polymer network exhibit unique interfacial rheology and ultralow friction, making them valuable in biomedical applications. Despite their widespread use in open&#8208;air environments, the lubrication behaviors of hydrogels under these conditions remain poorly understood. Here, the microscopic mechanisms underlying the friction characteristics of hydrogels through a combination of experiments, theoretical analyses, and molecular dynamics simulations is explored. It is found that water evaporation from the hydrogel surface reduces the hydrodynamic layer thickness and increases surface viscosity, leading to a gradual rise in friction. On the other hand, optimizing pore size and water mobility within the hydrogel enhances water transport from the interior to the surface, mitigating evaporation and enabling consistently low friction. It is also explored how soaking time, water affinity, and applied normal load influence hydrogel lubrication. The findings elucidate the microscopic mechanisms governing the friction behaviors of hydrogels and provide guidelines for designing hydrogel systems with sustained exceptional lubrication properties in open&#8208;air applications.

         <title>Radical p&#8208;Doping Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD for Efficient, Stable and Self&#8208;Healing Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing nitroxide redical, DT&#8208;TEMPO, has been used to address slow oxidation and mechanical stability limitations of Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD in perovskite solar cells, achieving good power conversion efficiency of 25.69% (rigid, certified 25.30%), 21.23% (rigid mini&#8208;module), and 24.19% (flexible). Most impressively, the flexible devices with DT&#8208;TEMPO show remarkable machnical stability, maintaining &#8764;95% of initial efficiency after 20&#8201;000 bending cycles through a dynamic disulfide bond cleavage and reformation mechanism.








Abstract
Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD is the primary hole transport material (HTM) for high&#8208;efficiency and stable flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs). However, the slow oxidation rate and susceptibility to film cracking under stress in Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD lead to reduced device stability and efficiency. In this paper, a multi&#8208;functional novel self&#8208;healing nitroxide radical monomer, 4&#8208;[[5&#8208;(1,2&#8208;dithiolane&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1&#8208;oxopentyl]amino]&#8208;2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (DT&#8208;TEMPO), has been introduced to address these challenges. DT&#8208;TEMPO, on one side, enhances the hole mobility and conductivity by p&#8208;doping Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, while boosting the charge transfer process from perovskite to Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD with an optimized energy level alignment on the other side. Additionally, DT&#8208;TEMPO endows a self&#8208;healing capability to Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD through the introduction of dynamic breaking and reconstructing disulfide bond. The optimized perovskite solar cells achieve impressive power conversion efficiencies, 25.69% on rigid substrates (certified 25.30%), 21.23% on rigid mini&#8208;modules, and 24.19% on flexible substrates. Remarkably, the FPSCs with DT&#8208;TEMPO retain over 90% of their initial efficiency even after 20&#8201;000 bending cycles (r = 6&#160;mm) and recover to &#8776;95% of their initial value through the self&#8208;healing process.

         <title>Super&#8208;Wide Color Tunability from a Single Electrochromic Device through In Situ Reconstruction of Optical Cavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is proposed utilizing in situ, electrically driven reconstruction of optical cavities on an electrochromic electrode surface to fabricate electrochromic devices with super&#8208;wide color tunability. The device fabricated by this approach can create a wide variety of colors from yellow, orange, red, violet, blue, and cyan to green in a single electrochromic device that almost spans the entire visible region.








Abstract
Electrochromic (EC) displays, as non&#8208;emissive (passive) displays with low energy consumption, have garnered significant attention from both industry and academia in recent years. Nevertheless, traditional EC technology faces challenges in achieving full&#8208;color displays within a single device due to its limited color gamut, even though full&#8208;color capability is highly desirable for eliminating the need for complex RGB subpixel mosaics. Herein, a new strategy is proposed utilizing in situ, electrically driven reconstruction of optical cavities on an electrochromic electrode surface to fabricate EC devices with super&#8208;wide color tunability. The device fabricated by this approach can create a wide variety of colors from yellow, orange, red, violet, blue, and cyan to green in a single EC device that almost spans the entire visible region (&#916;hue approaches 360&#176;). Apart from the super&#8208;wide color tunability, the devices also have small working voltage window (0.2&#8208;1.8 V), outstanding bistability (&gt;8&#160;h), extremely low power consumption (&#8776;2.3 mW cm&#8722;2) and good cycling ability (&#8776;4.3% decay rate after 1,000 cycles). Moreover, the super&#8208;wide color tunability of these EC devices has been demonstrated in diverse applications, including shifting rainbow flower images, color palettes, and information displays.

         <title>Hybrid Formative&#8208;Additive Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid Formative&#8208;Additive Manufacturing (HyFAM) integrates formative processes into additive manufacturing. HyFAM 3D&#8208;prints exterior walls and complex geometries, then formatively fills interior material. By tuning rheological properties, the study can achieve both 3D&#8208;printable ink and self&#8208;leveling, moldable ink of the same material. HyFAM speeds up part production and eliminates internal defects by replacing interior 3D&#8208;printed sections with bulk&#8208;filled material.








Abstract
Material extrusion additive manufacturing (AM) provides extensive design flexibility and exceptional material versatility, enabling the fabrication of complex, multifunctional objects ranging from embedded electronics to soft robotics and vascularized tissues. The bottom&#8208;up creation of these objects typically requires discretization into layers and voxels. However, the voxel size, determined by the nozzle diameter, limits extrusion rate, creating a conflict between resolution and speed. To address these inherent scalability challenges, the study proposes a hybrid formative&#8208;additive manufacturing technology that combines the respective strengths of each method&#8212;speed and quality with complexity and flexibility. The approach involves 3D&#8208;printing complex geometries, multimaterial features, and bounding walls of bulky, lower&#8208;resolution volumes, which are rapidly filled via casting or molding. By precisely controlling the materials&#8217; rheological properties&#8212;while maintaining similar solidified properties and high interfacial strength&#8212;several typical AM flaws, such as bulging and internal voids, are eliminated, achieving exponentially faster production speeds for objects with varying feature sizes.

The unique architecture integrates the advantages of amorphous and crystalline phases, resulting in exceptional electrochemical performance, including a remarkable specific capacitance of 4804&#160;F&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, 82.2% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, and 100% Coulombic efficiency.








Abstract
Transition metal sulfur oxides have emerged as promising candidates for advanced energy storage due to their multi&#8208;electron redox activity and tunable nanostructures. Among them, Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;O&#8208;S composites are particularly attractive for supercapacitors owing to their high energy storage density. However, conventional synthesis methods often require prolonged processing times (&gt;10&#160;h) or high&#8208;temperature treatments (&gt;80&#160;&#176;C), which limit their practical applications. This work addresses these challenges by developing amorphous&#8208;nanocrystalline intertwined Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;O&#8208;S nanohybrid nanosheet arrays through a rapid alternating current (AC) electrodeposition method (1&#160;h) under ambient conditions. The unique architecture combines the advantages of amorphous phases (enhanced ion diffusion pathways) and nanocrystalline domains (efficient charge transport), leading to exceptional specific capacitance of 4804&#160;F&#160;g&#8315;&#185; (or 959&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, 2402&#160;C&#160;g&#8722;1) at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, 82.2% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles (5&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;), and a near 100% Coulombic efficiency (CE). The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor achieves an energy density of 199.4&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; at 754&#160;W&#160;kg&#8315;&#185;, bridging the performance gap between batteries and conventional capacitors.

     alt="One-Step Synthesis of Co-Ni-O-S Nanohybrid with Amorphous-Nanocrystalline Interwoven Architecture for High-Energy-Density Supercapacitor-Battery Hybrids"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amorphous-nanocrystalline intertwined Co-Ni-O-S nanohybridis developed through a rapid alternating current electrodeposition method under ambient conditions. The unique architecture integrates the advantages of amorphous and crystalline phases, resulting in exceptional electrochemical performance, including a remarkable specific capacitance of 4804&#160;F&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, 82.2% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, and 100% Coulombic efficiency.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal sulfur oxides have emerged as promising candidates for advanced energy storage due to their multi-electron redox activity and tunable nanostructures. Among them, Co-Ni-O-S composites are particularly attractive for supercapacitors owing to their high energy storage density. However, conventional synthesis methods often require prolonged processing times (&amp;gt;10&#160;h) or high-temperature treatments (&amp;gt;80&#160;&#176;C), which limit their practical applications. This work addresses these challenges by developing amorphous-nanocrystalline intertwined Co-Ni-O-S nanohybrid nanosheet arrays through a rapid alternating current (AC) electrodeposition method (1&#160;h) under ambient conditions. The unique architecture combines the advantages of amorphous phases (enhanced ion diffusion pathways) and nanocrystalline domains (efficient charge transport), leading to exceptional specific capacitance of 4804&#160;F&#160;g&#8315;&#185; (or 959&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 2402&#160;C&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, 82.2% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles (5&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;), and a near 100% Coulombic efficiency (CE). The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor achieves an energy density of 199.4&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; at 754&#160;W&#160;kg&#8315;&#185;, bridging the performance gap between batteries and conventional capacitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Multimodal Humidity Adaptive Optical Neuron Based on a MoWS2/VOx Heterojunction for Vision and Respiratory Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional memristor is demonstrated for in&#8208;memory sensing and computing, leveraging a MoWS&#8322;/VOx heterojunction to enable high ON/OFF ratio up to 10&#8312; with ultralow operating voltages of &#177;0.2&#160;V. This bio&#8208;inspired multimodal design exhibits tunable synaptic behavior across electrical, optical, and humidity stimuli, enabling in situ modulation of conductance for low&#8208;power, real&#8208;time processing of multisensory signals. The reconfigurable humidity&#8208;adaptive neuron and humidity&#8208;mediated optical synaptic learning enable non&#8208;contact respiratory sensing and vision clarity control, paving the way for energy&#8208;efficient next&#8208;generation human&#8211;machine interfaces.








Abstract
Advancements in computing have progressed from near&#8208;sensor to in&#8208;sensor computing, culminating in the development of multimodal in&#8208;memory computing, which enables faster, energy&#8208;efficient data processing by performing computations directly within the memory devices. A bio&#8208;inspired multimodal in&#8208;memory computing system capable of performing real&#8208;time low power processing of multisensory signals, lowering data conversion and transmission across several modules in conventional chips is introduced. A novel Cu/MoWS2/VOx/Pt based multimodal memristor is characterized by an ON/OFF ratio as high as 108 with consistent and ultralow operating voltages of &#177;0.2 surpassing conventional single&#8208;mode memory functions. Apart from observing electrical synaptic behavior, photonic depression and humidity mediated optical synaptic learning is also demonstrated. The heterojunction with MoWS2 also enables reconfigurable modulation in both memory and optical synaptic functionalities with changing humidity. This behavior provides tunable conductance modulation capabilities emulating synaptic transmission in biological neurons while showing potential in respiratory detection module for healthcare application. The humidity sensing capability is implemented to demonstrate vision clarity using a convolutional neural network (CNN), with different humidity levels applied as a data augmentation preprocessing method. This proposed multimodal functionality represents a novel platform for developing artificial sensory neurons, with significant implications for non&#8208;contact human&#8211;computer interaction in intelligent systems.

         <title>Legumain In Situ Engineering Promotes Efferocytosis of CAR Macrophage to Treat Cardiac Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research article, the authors found that the overwhelming apoptotic cells after myocardial infarction (MI) result in an overburdened efferocytosis in CAR&#8208;M&#934;, which compromises their antifibrotic potency. To address this challenge, an in situ engineered legumain (Lgmn) is developed to elevate the cargo degradation of phagolysosome for promoting the efferocytosis of CAR&#8208;M&#934;s, restoring their antifibrotic capability.








Abstract
Uncontrolled and excessive cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction (MI) is a primary contributor to mortality by heart failure. Chimeric antigen receptor macrophage (CAR&#8208;M&#934;) therapy shows great promise in cardiac fibrosis, however, the overwhelming apoptotic cells after MI results in an overburdened efferocytosis in CAR&#8208;M&#934;, which compromises their antifibrotic potency. This work here reports an in situ engineered legumain (Lgmn) to elevate the cargo degradation of phagolysosome for promoting the efferocytosis of CAR&#8208;M&#934;s, restoring their antifibrotic capability. Specifically, with the in&#8208;house customized macrophages&#8208;targeting lipid nanoparticles, this work first creates an efferocytosis&#8208;boosted fibrosis&#8208;specific CAR&#8208;M&#934;s by introducing dual mRNAs that encode Lgmn, an endolysosomal cysteine protease, along with an anti&#8208;fibroblast activation protein (FAP) CAR, respectively. This data demonstrate these CAR&#8208;M&#934;s displayed a significantly increased phagocytic capacity as well as improved efferocytosis and enhanced antifibrotic capability. Treatment with the in situ reprogrammed CAR&#8208;M&#934;s in MI mice obviously reduced the infarct size and mitigated cardiac fibrosis, leading to significant restoration of cardiac function. In sum, these findings establish that promoting efferocytosis through Lgmn engineering effectively relieved the overburdened efferocytosis of CAR&#8208;M&#934;s, and enhanced their treatment efficacy of cardiac fibrosis with broad application in other fibrotic diseases.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Like Polymers Targeting Keap1/Nrf2 as Therapeutics for Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a Keap1 targeting protein&#8208;like polymer (PLP) which activates Nrf2, an important&#160;cytoprotective transcription factor for&#160;relieving myocardial infarction&#8208;induced oxidative stress. This PLP increases cell survival in vitro in multiple relevant cardiac cell types and elicits pro&#8208;reparative responses, improving cardiac function in a preclinical model. Keap1 inhibiting PLPs&#160;show translational potential for ischemia reperfusion injury.









Abstract
Myocardial infarction (MI) results in oxidative stress to the myocardium and frequently leads to heart failure (HF). There is an unmet clinical need to develop therapeutics that address the inflammatory stress response and prevent negative left ventricular remodeling. Here, the Keap1/Nrf2 protein&#8211;protein interaction is specifically targeted, as Nrf2 activation is known to mitigate the inflammatory response following MI. This is achieved using a Nrf2&#8208;mimetic protein&#8208;like polymer (PLP) to inhibit the Keap1&#8208;Nrf2 interaction. The PLP platform technology provides stability in vivo, potent intracellular bioactivity, and multivalency leading to high avidity Keap1 binding. In vitro and in vivo assays to probe cellular activity and MI therapeutic utility are employed. These Keap1&#8208;inhibiting PLPs (Keap1i&#8208;PLPs) impart cytoprotection from oxidative stress via Nrf2 activation at sub&#8208;nanomolar concentrations in primary cardiomyocytes. Single&#8208;digit mg kg&#8722;1, single&#8208;dose, intravenous PLP administration significantly improves cardiac function in rats post&#8208;MI through immunomodulatory, anti&#8208;apoptotic, and angiogenic mechanisms. Thus Keap1i&#8208;PLPs disrupt key intracellular protein&#8211;protein interactions following intravenous, systemic administration in vivo. These results have broad implications not only for MI but also for other oxidative stress&#8208;driven diseases and conditions.

         <title>Orbital Topology of Chiral Crystals for Orbitronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and constitutional for life. In chiral materials the intrinsic handedness, defined by their crystal structure, becomes a main driver for a novel electronic topology that is based on the orbital angular momentum rather than the electron spin. The pivotal role of the orbital angular momentum makes chiral materials an ideal candidate for orbitronics applications.








Abstract
Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and manifests in a wide range of phenomena including chemical reactions, biological processes, and quantum transport of electrons. In quantum materials, the chirality of fermions, given by the relative directions between the electron spin and momentum, is connected to the band topology of electronic states. This study shows that in structurally chiral materials like CoSi, the orbital angular momentum (OAM) serves as the main driver of a nontrivial band topology in this new class of unconventional topological semimetals, even when spin&#8208;orbit coupling is negligible. A nontrivial orbital&#8208;momentum locking of multifold chiral fermions in the bulk leads to a pronounced OAM texture of the helicoid Fermi arcs at the surface.

     alt="Orbital Topology of Chiral Crystals for Orbitronics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and constitutional for life. In chiral materials the intrinsic handedness, defined by their crystal structure, becomes a main driver for a novel electronic topology that is based on the orbital angular momentum rather than the electron spin. The pivotal role of the orbital angular momentum makes chiral materials an ideal candidate for orbitronics applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and manifests in a wide range of phenomena including chemical reactions, biological processes, and quantum transport of electrons. In quantum materials, the chirality of fermions, given by the relative directions between the electron spin and momentum, is connected to the band topology of electronic states. This study shows that in structurally chiral materials like CoSi, the orbital angular momentum (OAM) serves as the main driver of a nontrivial band topology in this new class of unconventional topological semimetals, even when spin-orbit coupling is negligible. A nontrivial orbital-momentum locking of multifold chiral fermions in the bulk leads to a pronounced OAM texture of the helicoid Fermi arcs at the surface. The study highlights the pivotal role of the orbital degree of freedom for the chirality and topology of electron states, in general, and paves the way towards the application of topological chiral semimetals in orbitronic&#160;devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Observation of Conductive Interstitial Ga Line Defects in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using near&#8208;field infrared and atomic&#8208;resolution transmission electron imaging, a novel phenomenon is observed: the presence of conductive interstitial Ga line defects within &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanoflakes. These defects lead to an associated increase in conductivity, which in turn results in a broadband infrared response and the quenching of cathodoluminescence. Functioning as an antenna, these defects can excite phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride cladding layers, offering exciting prospects for applications in nanophotonic devices.








Abstract
Beta&#8208;phase gallium sesquioxide (&#946;&#8208;Ga2O3), possessing an ultrawide bandgap and high breakdown voltage, exhibits strong potential for deep&#8208;ultraviolet photodetection and high&#8208;power electronics. However, nanometer&#8208;scale line defects, prevalent in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 growth, degrade device performance by increasing leakage currents and reducing breakdown voltages, thus termed &#8220;killer defects&#8221;. Critically, the impact of these defects at the atomic scale remains unclear due to limited characterization and a lack of detailed understanding. Here, the observation of novel conductive atomic line defects is reported within &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanoflakes using near&#8208;field infrared imaging. Combining atomic&#8208;resolution imaging with density functional theory calculations, these defects are identified as interstitial Ga atoms migrating along the c&#8208;axis. These atomic line defects exhibit a broadband infrared response and quenched cathodoluminescence, indicative of significantly enhanced local conductivity. This elevated conductivity enables subsurface near&#8208;field detection of the defects and remote excitation of phonon polaritons in a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) capping layer. These findings underscore the distinct conductivity of atomic&#8208;scale line defects, emphasizing the need for their controlled management during material synthesis and device fabrication, while simultaneously suggesting opportunities for their exploitation in nanophotonic applications.

         <title>Nanoscale Inhomogeneity and Epitaxial Strain Control Metallicity in Single Crystalline Thin Films of High Entropy Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the complex interplay between local structure and physical properties is a key challenge in high entropy oxide (HEO) research, particularly concerning electronic transport. This work demonstrates the profound influence of local chemical inhomogeneity and underlying epitaxial strain on the electronic transport properties of HEO thin film with perovskite structure, paving pathways to tailor electronic properties in high&#8208;entropy regime.








Abstract
Understanding the electronic transport properties of thin films of high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO), having multiple elements at the same crystallographic site, is crucial for their potential electronic applications. However, very little is known about the metallic phase of HEOs even in bulk form. This work delves into the interplay between global and local structural distortion and electronic properties of single crystalline thin films of (La0.2Pr0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2Eu0.2)NiO3, which exhibit metal&#8208;insulator transition under tensile strain. Employing electron microscopy and elemental resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy, we provide direct evidence of nanoscale chemical inhomogeneities at the rare&#8208;earth site, leading to a broad distribution of Ni&#8211;O&#8211;Ni bond angles. However, the octahedral rotation pattern remains the same throughout. The metallic phase consists of insulating patches with more distorted Ni&#8211;O&#8211;Ni bond angles, responsible for higher resistance exponents with increased compositional complexity. Moreover, a rare, fully metallic state of HEO thin film is achieved under compressive strain. We further demonstrate a direct correlation between the suppression of the insulating behavior and increased electronic hopping. Our findings provide a foundation for exploring Mott&#8208;Anderson electron localization physics in the high&#8208;entropy&#160;regime.

         <title>Hybrid Lipoplex Boosts Neuron&#8208;Microglia Crosstalk for Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease through A&#946;&#8208;Targeted&#8208;Autophagy and ApoE2 Gene Supplementation</title>

A hybrid lipoplex (RMC/pApoE2) composed of guanidine&#8208;rich lipids (metformin&#8208;inspired MLS and arginine&#8208;contained RLS), oleic acid&#8208;modified cerium dioxide (OA@CeO2), and pApoE2 restores neuron&#8208;microglia crosstalk to eliminate A&#946; deposits from temporal and spatial multidimensions. It induces neuronal and microglial autophagy at the upstream and downstream of A&#946; metabolism, along with enhanced pApoE2 transfection for intra&#8208; and extra&#8208;cellular elimination of A&#946; aggregates.








Abstract
Efficient clearance of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) is vital but challenging in Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment due to its complicated regulation mechanisms during generation and metabolism. It necessitates a multidimensional synergistic strategy based on ingenious delivery system design. Herein, guanidine&#8208;rich lipids (metformin&#8208;inspired MLS and arginine&#8208;contained RLS) are devised to trigger selective chaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy for amyloid precursor protein degradation in neurons. They are further co&#8208;assembled with oleic acid&#8208;modified cerium dioxide (OA@CeO2) to form RMC assembly for pApoE2 delivery (RMC/pApoE2 lipoplex). The OA@CeO2 boosts macro&#8208;autophagy, alleviates oxidative stress and inflammatory microenvironment, and promotes the neurons&#8208;microglia crosstalk for A&#946; elimination. Concurrently, both guanidine&#8208;rich lipids and OA@CeO2 benefit pApoE2 transfection in neurons, enabling the transport of A&#946; into microglia, and facilitating enzymatic hydrolysis and cellular digestion of extracellular A&#946;. The lipoplex&#8208;boosted neuron&#8211;microglia interactions ultimately eliminate both intra&#8208; and extra&#8208;cellular A&#946; aggregates. Consequently, the RMC/pApoE2 lipoplex eliminates &#8776;86.9% of A&#946; plaques in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice and restored the synaptic function and neuronal connectivity. Moreover, it recovers the spatial memory of APP/PS1 mice to nearly the level of WT control. The presented hybrid lipoplex showcases an advanced gene delivery system, and offers a promising strategy for A&#946; clearance in AD treatment.

         <title>Phosphatidylcholine Liposome Accelerated Platinum Nanomachines (PLANEs) With Enhanced Penetration Capability for Thrombus Mechanotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposome coating strategy for nanomotors. The isotropic and lubricating PC liposome enhances the linear motion and reduces friction of platinum nanomotors, improving their performance in complex physiological environments. Besides enabling non&#8208;pharmacological thrombolysis, this approach can refine nanomotor delivery systems and boost drug therapy effectiveness.








Abstract
Thrombotic cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide. However, current thrombolytic therapeutics suffer from limited efficacy and a high risk of severe bleeding. Here, a phosphatidylcholine liposome accelerated platinum nanomachine (PLANE) for thrombus mechanotherapy is designed, constructed by encapsulating platinum nanomotors within isotropic, lubricating phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes. The precisely engineered PLANE exhibits superior lubricity and linear motion. Under laser irradiation and hydrogen peroxide treatment, PLANEs achieve significantly higher velocities than conventional platinum nanomotors, facilitating deep penetration into the thrombi. Further functionalization with thrombus&#8208;targeting peptides enables the cPLANEs to selectively accumulate at the thrombotic sites in vivo, demonstrating excellent thrombolytic efficacy.

&lt;p&gt;This work introduces a phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposome coating strategy for nanomotors. The isotropic and lubricating PC liposome enhances the linear motion and reduces friction of platinum nanomotors, improving their performance in complex physiological environments. Besides enabling non-pharmacological thrombolysis, this approach can refine nanomotor delivery systems and boost drug therapy effectiveness.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thrombotic cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide. However, current thrombolytic therapeutics suffer from limited efficacy and a high risk of severe bleeding. Here, a phosphatidylcholine liposome accelerated platinum nanomachine (PLANE) for thrombus mechanotherapy is designed, constructed by encapsulating platinum nanomotors within isotropic, lubricating phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes. The precisely engineered PLANE exhibits superior lubricity and linear motion. Under laser irradiation and hydrogen peroxide treatment, PLANEs achieve significantly higher velocities than conventional platinum nanomotors, facilitating deep penetration into the thrombi. Further functionalization with thrombus-targeting peptides enables the cPLANEs to selectively accumulate at the thrombotic sites in vivo, demonstrating excellent thrombolytic efficacy. This work presents a novel surface modification strategy for optimizing the motion behavior of platinum nanomotors, offering a promising non-pharmaceutic approach for thrombotic disease treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Polariton Interactions in Suspended WS2 Monolayer Microcavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayers of transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides exhibit strong exciton resonances for light&#8208;matter interactions at RT, though substrate effects limit performance. This work presents a planar microcavity with a suspended WS2 monolayer, eliminating substrate&#8208;induced losses. The system shows enhancement of strong coupling and preserves the spin&#8208;dependent polaritonic interactions, achieving a record exciton interaction constant close to theoretical predictions. This approach reveals the intrinsic optical and spintronic properties of 2D materials, paving the way for advanced polaritonic.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides monolayers exhibit strong exciton resonances that enable intense light&#8208;matter interactions. The sensitivity of these materials to the surrounding environment and their interactions with the substrate result in the enhancement of excitonic losses through scattering, dissociation and defects formation, hindering their full potential for the excitation of optical nonlinearities in exciton&#8208;polariton platforms. The use of suspended monolayers holds the potential to completely eliminate substrate&#8208;induced losses, offering unique advantages for the exploitation of intrinsic electronic, mechanical, and optical properties of 2D materials&#8208;based polaritonic systems, without any influence of proximity effects. In this work, we report a novel fabrication approach enabling the realization of a planar microcavity filled with a suspended tungsten disulfide (WS2) monolayer in its center. We experimentally demonstrate a 2&#8208;fold enhancement of the strong coupling at room temperature, due to the larger exciton binding energy and reduced overall losses as compared to similar systems based on dielectric&#8208;filled microcavities. As a result, spin&#8208;dependent polaritonic interactions are significantly amplified, leading to achievement of a record exciton interaction constant approaching the theoretically predicted value. This approach holds promises for pushing 2D materials&#8208;based polaritonic systems to their intrinsic limits, paving the way for the realization of novel polaritonic devices with superior performance.

         <title>Rational Ligand Design of Conjugated Coordination Polymers for Efficient and Selective Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated coordination polymer (CoN4&#8208;pyrr) of single&#8208;atom cobalt coordinated with the nitrogen atom of pyrrole ligand can work as an electrocatalyst for efficient and selective nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NH3), where a fast transfer of hydrogen (*H) radicals is induced to accelerate the hydrogenation kinetics of *NO intermediate on the cobalt active site of CoN4&#8208;pyrr at the rate&#8208;determining step.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NRA) offers an attractive route for converting nitrate pollutants to ammonia under mild conditions. Among other catalysts, single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with high metal&#8208;atom&#8208;utilization efficiency and low&#8208;coordinated metal sites hold immense potential to be extensively applied, which unfortunately encounter a formidable challenge to obtain simultaneous improvement of NRA activity and selectivity. Here, a novel and general strategy is reported to achieve efficient and selective NRA catalysis on conjugated coordination polymers featuring with high&#8208;density and well&#8208;defined nitrogen (N)&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;atom metal sites via precise regulation of N&#8209;heterocyclic ligands toward accelerating the hydrogenation kinetics necessitated in the NRA pathway. Taking cobalt (Co) as an example, two CoN4&#8208;centered conjugated coordination polymer electrocatalysts (CoN4&#8208;pyrr and CoN4&#8208;pyri) are synthesized with pyrrole and pyridine ligands are investigated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. As revealed, the CoN4&#8208;pyrr can markedly outperform the CoN4&#8208;pyri toward NRA electrocatalysis. Experimental and theoretical results suggest that, relative to the N atoms of pyridine ligand in CoN4&#8208;pyri, the N atoms of pyrrole ligand in CoN4&#8208;pyrr can enable a faster transfer of hydrogen radicals to the Co active sites for accelerating the hydrogenation kinetics of *NO intermediate at the rate&#8208;determining step of NRA pathway.

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Tunable Time&#8208;Dependent Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Self&#8208;Protective Carbonized Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color tunable time&#8208;dependent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) is achieved via a self&#8208;doping strategy for simultaneous modulation of their carbon core N&#8208;related and surface oxygen&#8208;related emissive centers. The broad emission color, long lifetime, and excellent luminescence stability of these dynamic afterglow materials promote their practical applications in multimodal anti&#8208;counterfeiting and advanced dynamic information encryption, as well as time&#8208;delay light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs).








Abstract
Achieving full&#8208;color time&#8208;dependent tunable phosphorescence (TDTP) in pure organic materials remains a significant challenge due to the nonradiative transition and modulation puzzle of triplet states. Herein, full&#8208;color TDTP has been realized in self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) under ambient conditions using a self&#8208;doping strategy. These CPDs are generated with dual emission centers of the high&#8208;energy N&#8208;related triplet state and the low&#8208;energy surface oxide triplet state, which are responsible for the slow&#8208;decaying blue afterglow (453&#160;nm) and the fast&#8208;decaying green to red afterglow (513&#8211;609&#160;nm), respectively. These luminescent centers can be activated simultaneously upon CPD aggregation due to the generated rigid networks by intra/intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;band interactions. The detailed experimental characterization and theoretical calculation confirm that the red&#8208;shifted afterglow color is attributed to a gradual reduction of their energy levels with the increasing surface C&#9552;O content and aggregation degree of CPDs. Thus, these matrix&#8208;free CPDs exhibit dynamic TDTP colors over the entire visible spectrum in the solid state after turning off 365&#160;nm UV light. Based on their unusual phosphorescent properties and excellent photostability, these CPDs have been tested for various applications such as multidimensional dynamic information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting, as well as time&#8208;delayed light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs).

         <title>Upcycling Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Constructing Bifunctional Catalysts Featuring Long&#8208;Range Order and Short&#8208;Range Disorder for Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, for the first time, an interesting strategy is proposed for upcycling Ni, Co, and Mn valuable metals from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries into a bifunctional catalyst for lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries by a rapid Joule&#8208;heated thermal shock method. This is a well&#8208;defined catalyst combining both features of long&#8208;range order L12 face&#8208;centered cubic structure and short&#8208;range disorder in M sites. Benefiting from the unique atomic arrangement, the long&#8208;range order L12 structure significantly enhances the long&#8208;term stability of the catalyst, while the short&#8208;range disorder character of the M site triggers the cocktail effect and further activates the Pt catalytic kinetics. Experiments and theoretical results disclose that the local coordination environment and electronic distribution of Pt are both fundamentally modulated via surrounding disordered Ni, Co, and Mn atoms, which greatly optimize the affinity toward oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and facilitate the deposition/decomposition kinetics of the thin&#8208;film Li2O2 discharge products. This distinctly lowers both the energy barriers of the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Upcycling of high&#8208;value metals (M = Ni, Co, Mn) from spent ternary lithium&#8208;ion batteries to the field of lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries is highly appealing, yet remains a huge challenge. In particular, the alloying of the recovered M components with Pt and applied as cathode catalysts have not yet been reported. Herein, a fresh L12&#8208;type Pt3&#160;M medium&#8208;entropy intermetallic nanoparticle is first proposed, confined on N&#8208;doped carbon matrix (L12&#8208;Pt3(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)@N&#8208;C) based on spent 111 typed LiNi1&#8208;x&#8208;yMnxCoyO2 cathode. This well&#8208;defined catalyst combines both features of long&#8208;range order L12 face&#8208;centered cubic structure and short&#8208;range disorder in M sites. The former contributes to enhancing the structural stability, and the latter further facilitates deeply activating the catalytic activity of Pt sites. Experiments and theoretical results demonstrate that the local coordination environment and electronic distribution of Pt are both fundamentally modulated via surrounding disordered Ni, Co, and Mn atoms, which greatly optimize the affinity toward oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and facilitate the deposition/decomposition kinetics of the thin&#8208;film Li2O2 discharge products. Specifically, the L12&#8208;Pt3(Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3)@N&#8208;C catalyst exhibits an ultra&#8208;low overpotential of 0.48&#160;V and achieves 220 cycles at 400&#160;mA g&#8722;1 under 1000 mAh g&#8722;1.

     alt="Upcycling Spent Lithium-Ion Batteries: Constructing Bifunctional Catalysts Featuring Long-Range Order and Short-Range Disorder for Lithium-Oxygen Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, for the first time, an interesting strategy is proposed for upcycling Ni, Co, and Mn valuable metals from spent lithium-ion batteries into a bifunctional catalyst for lithium-oxygen batteries by a rapid Joule-heated thermal shock method. This is a well-defined catalyst combining both features of long-range order L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; face-centered cubic structure and short-range disorder in M sites. Benefiting from the unique atomic arrangement, the long-range order L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure significantly enhances the long-term stability of the catalyst, while the short-range disorder character of the M site triggers the cocktail effect and further activates the Pt catalytic kinetics. Experiments and theoretical results disclose that the local coordination environment and electronic distribution of Pt are both fundamentally modulated via surrounding disordered Ni, Co, and Mn atoms, which greatly optimize the affinity toward oxygen-containing intermediates and facilitate the deposition/decomposition kinetics of the thin-film Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; discharge products. This distinctly lowers both the energy barriers of the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upcycling of high-value metals (M = Ni, Co, Mn) from spent ternary lithium-ion batteries to the field of lithium-oxygen batteries is highly appealing, yet remains a huge challenge. In particular, the alloying of the recovered M components with Pt and applied as cathode catalysts have not yet been reported. Herein, a fresh L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-type Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;M medium-entropy intermetallic nanoparticle is first proposed, confined on N-doped carbon matrix (L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(Ni&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;)@N-C) based on spent 111 typed LiNi&lt;sub&gt;1-x-y&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode. This well-defined catalyst combines both features of long-range order L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; face-centered cubic structure and short-range disorder in M sites. The former contributes to enhancing the structural stability, and the latter further facilitates deeply activating the catalytic activity of Pt sites. Experiments and theoretical results demonstrate that the local coordination environment and electronic distribution of Pt are both fundamentally modulated via surrounding disordered Ni, Co, and Mn atoms, which greatly optimize the affinity toward oxygen-containing intermediates and facilitate the deposition/decomposition kinetics of the thin-film Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; discharge products. Specifically, the L1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(Ni&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1/3)&lt;/sub&gt;@N-C catalyst exhibits an ultra-low overpotential of 0.48&#160;V and achieves 220 cycles at 400&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under 1000 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The work provides important insights for the recycling of spent lithium-ion batteries into advanced catalyst-related applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superhigh Magnetostriction in Non&#8208;Equilibrium Grown Fe&#8208;Ga Single&#8208;Crystals by Rapid&#8208;Directional&#8208;Solidification</title>

         <dc:description>
An innovative strategy of rapid&#8208;directional&#8208;solidification is developed to unexpectedly grow non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystals of Fe&#8208;Ga magnetostrictive material with the supersaturation of Tb, leading to an unprecedentedly giant magnetostriction of 489&#160;ppm in bulk Fe&#8208;Ga single&#8208;crystals. This study paves the way for realizing revolutionary material performance by innovating the concept and fabrication method of non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystals.








Abstract
The non&#8208;equilibrium microstructure characterized by Tb supersaturation within Fe&#8208;Ga single&#8208;crystals is deduced to induce a substantial enhancement in magnetostriction. However, the growth of the non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystal remains a formidable obstacle, as existing methods can only produce either non&#8208;equilibrium polycrystal or near&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystal, leading to the stagnation in magnetostriction. Herein, a rapid&#8208;directional&#8208;solidification (RDS) strategy is devised to grow non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystals. The RDS is realized through achieving an ultrahigh temperature gradient of &#8776;106 K&#160;m&#8722;1 at S&#8208;L interface front, accompanied by an ultrafast growth velocity. This results in single&#8208;crystal growth under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions with a giant cooling rate of 102&#8211;103 K&#160;s&#8722;1, which is &#8776;1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude greater than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of directional&#8208;solidification methods. A non&#8208;equilibrium Fe&#8208;Ga single&#8208;crystal, featured with traces of Tb supersaturation, is successfully grown with a significantly enhanced magnetostriction of 489&#160;ppm. This magnitude of magnetostriction sets a record in bulk Fe&#8208;Ga materials, surpassing the maximum value reported for Fe&#8208;Ga single&#8208;crystals by 60%. The advent of RDS strategy opens an avenue for fabricating non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystals with revolutionary performance, and paves the way for fabricating currently unattainable single&#8208;crystals for engineering applications.

         <title>Hybrid Additive Manufacturing of Shear&#8208;Stiffening Elastomer Composites for Enhanced Mechanical Properties and Intelligent Wearable Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve anisotropic structural design of shear stiffening materials, a novel hybrid additive manufacturing strategy is proposed to create a lattice&#8208;structured soft&#8208;hard phase elastomer composite (TPR&#8208;SSE composite) with enhanced mechanical properties. Based on this, an intelligent sports shoe is developed, demonstrating the potential application of the TPR&#8208;SSE composite material in wearable smart protective equipment.








Abstract
Shear&#8208;stiffening materials, renowned for their rate&#8208;dependent behavior, hold immense potential for impact&#8208;resistant applications but are often constrained by limited load&#8208;bearing capacity under extreme conditions. In this study, a novel hybrid additive manufacturing strategy that successfully achieves anisotropic structural design of shear&#8208;stiffening materials is proposed. In this strategy, fused deposition modeling (FDM) is synergistically combined with direct ink writing (DIW) to fabricate lattice&#8208;structured soft&#8208;hard phase elastomer composites (TPR&#8208;SSE composites) with enhanced mechanical properties. Through quasistatic characterization and dynamic impact experiments, complemented by noncontact optical measurement and finite element simulation, the mechanical enhancement mechanisms imparted by the lattice architecture are systematically uncovered. The resulting composites exhibit exceptional load&#8208;bearing capacity under quasistatic conditions and superior energy dissipation under dynamic impacts, making them ideal for advanced protective systems. Building on this, smart sports shoes featuring a deep&#8208;learning&#8208;based smart sensing module that integrates structural customizability, buffering capacity, and gait recognition, are developed. This work provides a transformative structure design approach to shear&#8208;stiffening materials systems, paving the way for next&#8208;generation intelligent wearable protection applications.

         <title>Enabling High Reversibility of Both Cationic and Anionic Redox in Layered Oxide Cathodes via NiMn6 Superlattice Topology for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The layered oxide cathode material (NNLMO) with the LiMn6 and NiMn6 dual&#8208;topology superlattice is constructed for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, realizing the reversible cationic and anionic redox. The Ni2+ electronic configuration serves as a redox buffer to tune the redox activity, while the NiMn6 topology provides topological protection to reinforce the superstructure stability.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage oxygen anionic redox provides a transformative opportunity to achieve high energy density of batteries. However, it is challenging to guarantee the reversibility of both cationic and anionic redox for layered transition metal (TM) oxide cathode materials due to the high oxygen&#8208;redox reactivity and the complex structural rearrangements. Herein, a honeycomb&#8208;layered Na0.78Ni0.12Li0.18Mn0.7O2 (NNLMO) cathode material with the NiMn6 and LiMn6 dual&#8208;topology superlattice is proposed for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the Ni2+ electronic configuration serves as a redox buffer to tune the cationic and anionic redox activity by enlarging the energy gap between O 2p and Mn 3d orbitals, while the NiMn6 topology renders the LiMn6 topology delocalized in the TM layers to reinforce the superstructure stability through suppressing the intralayer Mn migration and O2 formation. As a result, NNLMO delivers a highly reversible capacity of 224 mAh g&#8722;1 with the mitigated voltage hysteresis and exhibits remarkable capacity retention of 92.2% over 50 cycles within the wide voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5&#160;V. The findings suggest a new insight into the topological superstructure design of high&#8208;energy oxide cathode materials for sustainable batteries.

A cellular cell micro&#8208;vortex air filter constructed by 3D honeycomb&#8208;like structured nano&#8208;networks is created by a unique electro&#8208;netting&#8208;assembly technique. Due to the micro&#8208;vortex cascade filtration mode of cellular cells, 3D porous cell walls (average pore size &#8776;410 nm) consisting of nano&#8208;scaled fibers (diameter 45 nm), enhanced air slip effect, our filters achieve high&#8208;efficiency and low&#8208;resistance PM0.3 removal, desirable dust holding capacity and remarkable biodegradibility.








Abstract
Particulate matter (PM) pollution has posed a serious threat to public health, especially with the outbreak of respiratory infections. However, most existing fiber filters face an inevitable trade&#8208;off between removal efficiency and air resistance, due to their thick fibers and uncontrolled flat stacking structure. Herein, a unique high&#8208;performance integrated micro&#8208;vortex filter is created using honeycomb&#8208;like structured cellular nanofibrous networks via the innovative electro&#8208;netting&#8208;assembly nanotechnique for air filtration. Manipulation of the ejection, deformation, and self&#8208;assembly of the charged droplets from the Taylor cone enables the one&#8208;step construction of 3D cellular cells with 2D nano architectured networks consisted of 1D nanowires with a diameter of &#8776;45&#160;nm on a large&#8208;scale. The resultant micro&#8208;vortex air filter, functioned as an integrated filter system, achieved a remarkable air slip effect and striking micro&#8208;vortex cascade filtration mode, showing &gt;99.97% PM0.3 removal, &#8776;0.12% atmosphere pressure of air resistance, 27&#160;g m&#8722;2 dust holding, along with robust mechanical stability. This work may provide a promising avenue for the design and development of novel separation and purification materials.

         <title>Relaxor Antiferroelectric Dynamics for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel 2D relaxor antiferroelectric (AFE) material CuBiP2Se6 (CBPS)&#160;showcases unique AFE and optoelectronic properties. These properties enable CBPS devices to mimic synaptic plasticity through reversible polarization switching under electrical stimuli. Moreover, they can replicate key characteristics of biological synapses in response to optical stimuli, paving the way for in&#8208;sensor computing applications such as image restoration.








Abstract
Relaxor antiferroelectric (AFE) materials display a gradual polarization response and high energy storage density with polarization slowly reverting after removing an external field. This distinctive polarization&#8208;switching behavior closely resembles synaptic plasticity in biological nervous systems, presenting substantial potential for neuromorphic computing applications. Especially, its 2D scenario exhibits unique physical properties and maintains stability at atomic thickness due to their antipolar alignment, which effectively eliminates the depolarization field effect. Such stable 2D relaxor AFE materials offer significant advantages for integrating these materials into modern electronic devices for neuromorphic computing. In this study, the potential of a novel quaternary layered AFE material, CuBiP&#8322;Se&#8326; (CBPS), is explored for neuromorphic device applications. CBPS exhibits a broad range of light absorption and stable relaxor AFE behavior, rendering it an outstanding candidate for optoelectronic synaptic devices. High&#8208;quality CBPS is synthesized and its AFE properties through various characterization techniques are verified. CBPS&#8208;based synaptic devices demonstrate dual&#8208;mode tunable resistance plasticity stimulated by both electrical and optical inputs, demonstrating the capacity to perform in&#8208;sensor computing for image restoration tasks. These findings suggest that relaxor AFE materials like CBPS could provide a robust platform for various brain&#8208;inspired applications, particularly in neuromorphic computing, and artificial visual systems.

         <title>Neuromorphic Transistors Integrating Photo&#8208;Sensor, Optical Memory and Visual Synapses for Artificial Vision Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a neuromorphic transistor integrating sensing, memory, and computing in one device to address the challenges of commercial artificial vision system. By varying top gate voltages, it can operate as an ultrasensitive photo&#8208;sensor (&#8776;6.515 kA W&#8722;1), a non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;level optical memory (&gt;4 bits), and a neuromorphic visual synapse with 95.26% image recognition accuracy by combing artificial neural network model.








Abstract
In commercial artificial vision system (AVS), the sensing, storage, and computing units are usually physically separated due to their architecture and performance gaps, which thus increases the volume, complexity, and energy loss. This work develops a neuromorphic transistor integrating these different modules within one single device. Leveraging the gate&#8208;tunable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electric field, the device achieves the multi&#8208;mode integration of photo&#8208;sensor, optical memory, and visual synapse. When operating at negative top gate voltage (VTG), a strong photo&#8208;gating effect enables highly sensitive photo&#8208;response with responsivity of &#8776;6.515 kA W&#8722;1 and detectivity up to &#8776;3.92 &#215; 1014 Jones. Due to the charge storage effect, it can also act as a non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;level (&gt;4 bits) optical memory with a long endurance of over 10&#160;000 s and a high writing/erasing ratio of up to 106. At zero or positive VTG, the transistor switches to visual synapse mode with neuromorphic computing capability, providing a pathway for complex biological learning and flexible synaptic plasticity. By further combining the synaptic plasticity with an artificial neural network (ANN), it achieves precise image recognition and classification with an accuracy of up to 95.26%. This work develops a multi&#8208;mode transistor that integrates key components of an AVS, addressing the existing challenges of all&#8208;in&#8208;one integration and manufacturing complexity.

         <title>A Core&#8208;Shell Perovskite Composite Air Electrode With Thermal&#8208;Expansion Offset and Mechanical Support Functions for Highly Durable Reversible Protonic Ceramic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;shell perovskite composite with a highly durable electrochemical activity for oxygen catalysis is developed as an air electrode for reversible protonic ceramic cells (RPCCs) via a unique solid&#8208;state reaction. This work also demonstrates a new pathway to developing highly durable air electrode materials for RPCCs technology, accelerating RPCCs&#8217; commercialization.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic cells (RPCCs) offer a promising pathway to efficient and reversible energy conversion, accelerating the global shift to renewables. However, the RPCCs&#8217; commercialization faces limitations in air electrode materials. Traditional cobalt&#8208;based perovskite air electrodes, while effective, suffer from high cost and environmental concerns. Alternative materials, such as SrFeO3&#8208;&#948; (SF)&#8208;based perovskites, offer potential, yet durability issues, including thermal&#8208;expansion mismatch and mechanical instability, hinder their practical application. Here, a unique solid&#8208;state reaction between SF and negative&#8208;thermal&#8208;expansion (NTE) material is demonstrated to yield a core&#8208;shell perovskite composite as a highly durable RPCCs air electrode. Specifically, by calcining a mixture of SF and an NTE material, ZrW2O8 (ZWO), the in situ incorporation of ZWO into the SF lattice is achieved, resulting in a non&#8208;closed core&#8208;shell composite, comprising single perovskite SraFebZrcWdO3&#8208;&#948; (SP&#8208;SFZW) core and B&#8208;site cation ordered double perovskite SrxFeyZrmWnO6&#8208;&#948; (DP&#8208;SFZW) shell. Both SP&#8208;SFZW and DP&#8208;SFZW serve as oxygen catalysts, while DP&#8208;SFZW shell additionally acts as a thermal expansion suppressor and mechanical support structure, effectively mitigating electrode cracking and delamination from other cell components during RPCC operation. Consequently, the composite electrode demonstrates comparable catalytic activity to SF, coupled with significantly enhanced durability. This work illustrates a novel approach for developing robust RPCCs air electrode.

Zou et al propose a novel vertical bulk heterojunction neuromorphic transistor, integrating three functions of the synapse, artificial spiking neuron, and artificial self&#8208;activation neuron for the first time. By simply changing the program, it can switch between spiking neurons and self&#8208;activating neurons, which effectively facilitates seamless switching and fusion computation of artificial neural networks and spiking neural networks.








Abstract
The combination of artificial neural networks (ANN) and spiking neural networks (SNN) holds great promise for advancing artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, the reported ANN and SNN computational architectures are independent and require a large number of auxiliary circuits and external algorithms for fusion training. Here, a novel vertical bulk heterojunction neuromorphic transistor (VHNT) capable of emulating both ANN and SNN computational functions is presented. TaOx&#8208;based electrochemical reactions and PDVT&#8208;10/N2200&#8208;based bulk heterojunctions are used to realize spike coding and voltage coding, respectively. Notably, the device exhibits remarkable efficiency, consuming a mere 0.84 nJ of energy consumption for a single multiply accumulate (MAC) operation with excellent linearity. Moreover, the device can be switched to spiking neuron and self&#8208;activation neuron by simply changing the programming without auxiliary circuits. Finally, the VHNT&#8208;based artificial spiking neural network (ASNN) fusion simulation architecture is demonstrated, achieving 95% accuracy for Canadian&#8208;Institute&#8208;For&#8208;Advanced&#8208;ResearchResearch&#8208;10 (CIFARResearch&#8208;10) dataset while significantly enhancing training speed and efficiency. This work proposes a novel device strategy for developing high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;power, and environmentally adaptive AGI.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Lead&#8208;Free Ceramics With Simultaneously High Piezoelectricity and High Mechanical Quality Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric materials with high piezoelectric coefficient (d33) and high mechanical quality factor (Qm) are critical for advanced high&#8208;power applications. However, achieving this combination is challenging due to the inherent trade&#8208;off between d33 and Qm. This work reports a novel strategy involving the introduction of defect dipoles into quadruple point compositions to break the conventional trade&#8208;off and simultaneously enhance d33 to 710 pC/N and Qm to 929 in designed lead&#8208;free piezoelectric materials.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials with a high piezoelectric coefficient (d33) and high mechanical quality factor (Qm) are vital for advanced high&#8208;power applications. However, achieving this combination is challenging, particularly for lead&#8208;free piezoelectrics, because a high d33 value relies on mobile domain walls, which increase dissipative losses and reduce Qm. In this study, this longstanding trade&#8208;off is overcome by introducing defect dipoles (via Mn doping) into the quadruple point (QP) composition of the lead&#8208;free Ba(Sn, Ti)O3 system. The resultant 0.5%Mn&#8208;doped Ba(Sn0.11Ti0.89)O3 (BST&#8208;0.5%Mn) ceramic exhibits a high d33 value of 710 pC/N and high Qm value of 929, while the BST&#8208;1%Mn ceramic achieves a d33 value of 614 pC/N and Qm value of 1138. These values represent a 10&#8208;fold increase in Qm and 1.6&#8208;fold increase in d33 for BST&#8208;0.5%Mn, compared to those for undoped BST. High&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and phase&#8208;field simulations reveal that the enhanced d33 and Qm are attributable to the coexistence of multiple phases of QPs with symmetry&#8208;conforming defect dipoles, challenging the long&#8208;held notion of physical incompatibility between high d33 and high Qm. These findings offer a pathway for designing eco&#8208;friendly piezoelectric materials with unprecedented performance, paving the way for sustainable and efficient high&#8208;power applications.

         <title>Structured Light Projection Using Image Guide Fibers for In Situ Photo&#8208;biofabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;based biofabrication is typically performed with single wavelength light sources and within benchtop devices. This work demonstrates FaSt&#8208;Light (Fiber&#8208;assisted Structured Light) as a new approach to achieve multiwavelength image projection using flexible image guide fibers, which enables a variety of applications for in situ biofabrication.








Abstract
Light&#8208;based biofabrication techniques have revolutionized the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Specifically, the projection of structured light, where the spatial distribution of light is controlled at both macro and microscale, has enabled precise fabrication of complex three dimensional&#160;structures with high resolution and speed. However, despite tremendous progress, biofabrication processes are mostly limited to benchtop devices which limit the flexibility in terms of where the fabrication can occur. Here, a Fiber&#8208;assisted Structured Light (FaSt&#8208;Light) projection apparatus for rapid in situ crosslinking of photoresins is demonstrated. This approach uses image&#8208;guide fiber bundles which can project bespoke images at multiple wavelengths, enabling flexibility and spatial control of different photoinitiation systems and crosslinking chemistries and also the location of fabrication. Coupling of different sizes of fibers and different lenses attached to the fibers to project small (several mm) or large (several cm) images for material crosslinking is demonstrated. FaSt&#8208;Light allows control over the cross&#8208;section of the crosslinked resins and enables the introduction of microfilaments which can further guide cellular infiltration, differentiation, and anisotropic matrix production. The proposed approach can lead to a new range of in situ biofabrication techniques which improve the translational potential of photofabricated tissues and grafts.

         <title>Deep Learning Empowered Parallelized Metasurface Computed Tomography Snapshot Spectral Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Snapshot spectral imaging faces challenges in miniaturization due to cascading optics. Here, an ultracompact parallelized metasurface tomography spectral imaging system synergized with generative deep learning is presented. Parallel sub&#8208;metasurfaces capture multi&#8208;angle spectral projections, while a trained adversarial network reconstructs spectral images with high resolution in milliseconds. This sub&#8208;mm3&#8208;scale innovation enables endoscopic/microscopic integration, promising to transform real&#8208;time biomedical diagnostics.









Abstract
Snapshot spectral imaging is an emerging technology for fast data acquisition in dynamic environments, capturing high&#8208;volume spatial&#8208;spectral information in a single snapshot. However, it suffers from bulky cascading optics and cannot be directly used in space&#8208;restricted scenarios such as endoscope&#8208;assisted brain microsurgery and real&#8208;time cellular tissue imaging. In this work, an ultracompact strategy of parallelized metasurface computed tomography empowered by generative deep learning is proposed, which can effectively reduce the optics volume in snapshot spectral imaging from cm3 scale to sub&#8208;mm3 scale while retaining high resolution and speed of imaging so that the above&#8208;mentioned pain point problem is well addressed. The system comprises seven multifunctional sub&#8208;metasurfaces simultaneously acquiring multi&#8208;angle spectral projection and integration information of the target, uses the system&#8208;calibrated point spread functions as wavelength and spatial position distributions, and incorporates a generative adversarial deep neural network for fast reconstruction of spatial&#8208;spectral multiplexed images. Experimental results show that single snapshot imaging can be achieved in 38&#160;ms with a spectral resolution of 10&#160;nm in the spectral range of 450&#8211;650&#160;nm. This technique paves the way for snapshot spectral imaging integration into various highly miniaturized microscopy and endoscopic imaging systems in applications such as advanced medical diagnosis.

Practical high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;voltage thermal charging cells, incorporating heat&#8208;resistant Ca&#8211;Li salt, C4mimAOT&#8208;AmimCl co&#8208;solvent, and PEN@ZrBDC&#8208;F&#8208;4% separators, are successfully developed. These advancements are attributed to enhanced energy storage of dual carriers, improved diffusion kinetics facilitated by the AmimCl solvent and optimized carrier mobility enabled by the anionophilic properties of ZrBDC. The research holds significant promise for high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;performance waste heat harvesting.








Abstract
Thermoelectric technologies (TEs) offer immense potential for waste heat recovery and energy storage. However, the practical application of current TEs has been severely hampered by potential performance degradation in extreme environments, particularly at high temperatures, due to electrolyte flammability or poor carrier mobility. The development of high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;performance TEs is crucial for broadening their operational range and enabling diverse applications. Here, practical high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;voltage thermal charging cells (HHTCCs) are reported, facilitated by a heat&#8208;resistant trifluoromethanesulfonate&#8208;based Ca&#8211;Li dual&#8208;cationic ionic liquid electrolyte containing functionalized AmimCl solvent, together with a thermotolerant composite membrane, PEN(polyphenylene&#8208;ether&#8208;nitrile)@ZrBDC&#8208;F&#8208;4%. The dual&#8208;cation mechanism enables high thermal voltage through cooperative energy storage, while the functionalized AmimCl accelerates the mobility of Ca2+ and Li+ ions by weakening the surrounding shielding effect. Additionally, the anionophilic ZrBDC&#8208;F&#8208;4% nanoparticles in the composite membrane enhance carrier migration. As a result, the HHTCCs exhibit an impressive thermal voltage of 1.138 V, a remarkable thermopower of 15.3 mV K&#8722;1, and an outstanding Carnot&#8208;relative efficiency of 9.56% over an unprecedented temperature range from 328.15 to 393.15 K, demonstrating the excellent safety and feasibility of HHTCCs. This work expands the service&#8208;temperature range of i&#8208;TEs, holding significant promise for high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;performance waste heat harvesting.

         <title>Strut&#8208;Buckling Transformation Enabling Anomalous Density&#8208;Scaling Toughening Law in Ultralight Lattice Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uncovers an anomalous density&#8208;scaling toughening law in discrete lattices, where ultrahigh&#160;specific fracture toughness can be achieved at ultralow relative density, thereby filling gaps in material property space. This anomalous toughening law stems from crack&#8208;tip blunting triggered by delocalized strut&#8208;buckling transformation at ultralow densities, which is universal across various lattice metamaterials with varying sizes, topologies, and component properties.








Abstract
Lightweight lattice metamaterials attract considerable attention due to their exceptional and tunable mechanical properties. However, their practical application is ultimately limited by their tolerance to inevitable&#160;manufacturing defects. Traditional fracture mechanics of lattice metamaterials are confined to localized tensile failure of a crack&#8208;tip strut, overlooking the toughening effect of buckling instability in discrete struts around the crack front. Here, via a combination of additive manufacturing, numerical simulation, and theoretical analysis, this work identifies an anomalous power scaling law of specific fracture energy with relative density, where the scaling exponent shifts to negative values below a critical relative density. This anomalous toughening law stems from crack&#8208;tip blunting triggered by delocalized strut&#8208;buckling transformation at ultralow densities, which is universal across various lattice metamaterials with varying length scales, crack orientations, node connectivity, and component properties. By strategically harnessing strut buckling mechanisms, exceptionally high specific fracture toughness can be achieved at extremely low relative density, thereby addressing gaps in the material property design space. These findings not only provide physical insights into discrete lattice fracture but also offer design motifs for ultralight, ultra&#8208;tough lattice metamaterials.

         <title>Narrow&#8208;Linewidth Emission and Weak Exciton&#8208;Phonon Coupling in 2D Layered Germanium Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural and photophysical properties of the 2D layered metal halides (4F&#8208;PMA)2GeI4 and (4F&#8208;PMA)2PbI4 are reported. For the Ge composition, reduced exciton&#8208;phonon coupling is found and the absence of bound&#8208;exciton emission, present for the Pb composition. The narrowest reported emission linewidth from a Ge&#8208;based 2D metal halide is measured, to date, suggesting that Ge&#8208;based materials offer a promising, less&#8208;toxic alternative for light&#8208;emitting applications.








Abstract
The photophysical properties of low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide semiconductors and their tunability make them promising candidates for light&#8208;absorbing and emitting applications. Yet, the germanium&#8208;based halide perovskites to date lack desirable light&#8208;emitting properties, with so far only very broad, weak, and unstructured photoluminescence (PL) reported due to significant octahedral distortion. Here, the photophysical properties of the 2D layered Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper semiconductors (4F&#8208;PMA)2GeI4 and (4F&#8208;PMA)2PbI4 (4F&#8208;PMA: 4&#8208;F&#8208;phenylmethylammonium) are characterized and compared. Using a combination of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, variable temperature time&#8208;resolved PL, and density functional theory, structure&#8208;property relations are correlated. Specifically, the results indicate that (4F&#8208;PMA)2PbI4 features stronger coupling to longitudinal optical (LO) phonons, assisting emission from a broad bound&#8208;exciton state due to a soft, deformable lattice. In contrast, (4F&#8208;PMA)2GeI4, benefitting from intermolecular bonding to scaffold a rigid octahedral structure, shows weaker LO&#8208;phonon coupling, resulting in the longest PL lifetime and most narrow linewidth (&#8776;120 meV linewidth at 2 K) reported for a Ge&#8208;halide perovskite yet, without the occurrence of any additional bound&#8208;state emission at low temperatures. These results highlight the potential of germanium halide perovskite materials for optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Inhalable Ce Nanozyme&#8208;Backpacked Phage Aims at Ischemic Cerebral Injury by M1&#8208;Microglia Hitchhiking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study developed a bio&#8208;active, inhalable nanozyme&#8208;backpacked M13 phage (CZM) which specifically delivers to the ischemic core via the olfactory bulb pathway. Leveraging M1&#8208;microglia hitchhiking, CZM accumulates specifically at the lesion site, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) to mitigate neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, providing a safe and effective strategy for the precise treatment of neuroinflammatory disorders.








Abstract
There is a desperate need for precise nanomedications to treat ischemic cerebral injury. Yet, the drawbacks of poor delivery efficiency and off&#8208;target toxicity in pathologic parenchyma for traditional antioxidants against ischemic stroke result in inadequate brain accumulation. M13 bacteriophages are highly phagocytosed by M1&#8208;polarized microglia and can be carried toward the neuroinflammatory sites. Here, a bio&#8208;active, inhalable, Ce0.9Zr0.1O2&#8208;backpacked&#8208;M13 phage (abbreviated as CZM) is developed and demonstrates how M13 bacteriophages are taken up by different phenotypes&#8217; microglia. With the M1 microglia's proliferating and migrating, CZM can be extensively and specifically delivered to the site of the ischemic core and penumbra, where the surviving nerve cells need to be shielded from secondary oxidative stress and inflammatory cascade initiated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). With non&#8208;invasive administration, CZM effectively alleviates oxidative damage and apoptosis of neurons by eliminating ROS generated by hyperactive M1&#8208;polarized microglia. Here, a secure and effective strategy for the targeted therapy of neuroinflammatory maladies is offered by this research.

         <dc:description>

Abstract
The efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) against solid tumors is significantly limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Systemic administration of immunostimulants provides inadequate support to ACT cells and often elicits systemic toxicities. Here we present cell&#8208;surface&#8208;anchored nucleic acid therapeutics (NATs) to robustly enhance ACT through synergistic blockade of immunosuppressive adenosine and PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 pathways in tumors. Two distinct NATs&#8208;DNA aptamers targeting PD&#8208;L1 (aptPD&#8208;L1) and ATP (aptATP)&#8208;are engineered to form partially&#8208;hybridized duplexes (aptDual) that can efficiently anchor to cell surface before transfer. Backpacked aptDual spatial&#8208;temporally co&#8208;localize with ACT cells in vivo and jointly infiltrate the ATP&#8208;rich TME. Upon binding with ATP, aptDual dissociates to responsively release aptPD&#8208;L1. Concurrently, aptATP scavenges extracellular ATP and its metabolite adenosine to disrupt the inhibitory adenosinergic axis, thereby sensitizing ACT cells to immune checkpoint blockade by aptPD&#8208;L1. This dual inhibition elicited a remarkable 40&#8208;fold increase in functional tumor&#8208;infiltrating ACT cells, substantially boosting the efficacy of TCR&#8208;T and CAR&#8208;T cells in multiple solid tumor models, even in immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors. NAT backpacks provide a facile, versatile, and safe strategy to augment various ACTs against solid tumors.

         <title>An Optimized Aerogel&#8208;Based Apheresis Device for Targeted Lipid Clearance in Elderly Hyperlipidemia Patients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research introduces an aerogel apheresis device specifically designed for hyperlipidemia management in elderly patients. Leveraging the unique properties of aerogels, LipClean achieves selective lipid adsorption from plasma while maintaining efficiency and biocompatibility. The optimized hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic network ensures effective water permeability and reduces the unintended removal of essential plasma components.








Abstract
Elderly patients with hyperlipidemia often exhibit resistance to conventional hypolipidemic treatments, underscoring the need for more effective strategies to address lipid imbalances in this high&#8208;risk group. This study introduces LipClean, an aerogel&#8208;based apheresis device specifically designed to remove harmful plasma lipids. LipClean is constructed using hydrophilic cellulose fibers, which serve as a supramolecular platform for synthesizing hydrophobic conjugated polymers through a Sonogashira&#8208;Hagihara reaction. These conjugated polymers are then cross&#8208;linked with the cellulose fibers via phosphorylation, generating an aerogel monolith with an interpenetrating network of hydrophilic fibers and hydrophobic polymers. Unlike bilayer aerogels that separate hydrophilic and hydrophobic layers, LipClean's interpenetrating structure is precisely engineered through polymer design and gradient cross&#8208;linking. This optimization enhances both bodily fluid flow and lipid adsorption while minimizing the removal of essential plasma components and ensuring unobstructed cell passage. In preclinical testing, LipClean significantly reduced triglyceride and cholesterol levels in an elderly rat model of hyperlipidemia and normalized lipid levels in blood samples from hypertensive patients. Importantly, purified blood maintained normal levels of blood cells and physiological and biochemical indicators after apheresis, highlighting LipClean's potential for managing hyperlipidemia&#8208;related disorders. This study, therefore, underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in driving medical device innovation.

         <title>Inverse Opal Photonic Crystal Structured Bifacial&#8208;Iridescent Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bifacial&#8208;iridescent solar cell is developed using an inverse opal perovskite photonic crystal. It exhibited unique iridescent structural colors on both sides and achieved an impressive bifacial equivalent efficiency of 18.00% for small cells and 12.77% for mini&#8208;modules.








Abstract
Colorful perovskite solar cells exhibit excellent potential for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs), which increase the utilization of clean power. However, their efficiencies are lower than those of uncolored devices. Moreover, traditional mono&#8208;facial colored devices cannot satisfy diverse BIPV scenarios. Here a bifacial iridescent solar cell (BFI&#8208;SC) is developed,&#160;constructed by inverse opal (IO) perovskite photonic crystals and transparent front and rear electrodes. The developed BFI&#8208;SC exhibited bright vivid colors on both sides, which originate from the reflection at the photonic stop band of the IO perovskite photonic crystal. Moreover, this unique IO photonic crystal decreased the interfacial Fresnel reflection and generated a slow&#8208;photon effect, which increases the material light absorption and utilization to obtain high efficiency. Furthermore, the BFI&#8208;SC can harvest light from both sides, considerably enhancing the device efficiency. Thus, the BFI&#8208;SC achieved an impressive bifacial equivalent efficiency (&#951;eq) of 18.00%, which is the highest value achieved for the reported multicolored (or iridescent) solar cell. A larger&#8208;scale BFI&#8208;SC module is successfully assembled, achieving a champion &#951;eq of 12.77%. In addition, another perovskite material with an IO structure and wide&#8208;bandgap components exhibited vivid colors on both sides, indicating the universality of this coloring strategy and its independence of the perovskite components.

         <title>Electroadhesion Suction Cups</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroadhesion (EA) Suction Cups are electrically operated soft grippers that can pick up a wide range of objects from the top. A soft membrane, driven by electrostatic forces, conforms to surfaces, creating a passive vacuum when lifted. EA suction cups eliminate bulky vacuum systems, offering a compact, efficient, and portable alternative for industrial and service robotics.








Abstract
Suction cups are the light bulbs of robotics and automation. They are simple, reliable, yet energy&#8208;hungry, and require a bulky and noisy vacuum infrastructure. This work reports Electroadhesion (EA) Suction Cups: soft, silent, monolithic, electrically&#8208;driven grippers, with a power consumption of only 1.5&#160;W, that can grasp flat and curved objects, with smooth or rough surfaces, holding payloads up to 1.5&#160;kg. This performance is enabled by a deeper understanding of the contact mechanics of electroadhesion systems. A thin and soft membrane containing interdigitated electrodes zips onto the object driven by electrostatic forces, conforming to the object's shape and thus establishing large&#8208;area contact. The lifting force is transmitted to a robot arm through a small pillar connected at the center of the membrane. This design maximizes the peeling force and enables the formation of passive vacuum inside the conical chamber formed when the membrane stretches during lifting. Object release is obtained by turning off the voltage and optionally by opening a valve to quickly break the vacuum. EA suction cups address many shortcomings of widely used vacuum&#8208;driven grippers, offering a compact, fully electric, and energy&#8208;efficient solution that meets the needs for efficiency and portability in both industrial and service robotics.

         <title>Octopus Tentacle&#8208;Inspired In&#8208;Sensor Adaptive Integral for Edge&#8208;Intelligent Touch Intention Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the octopus cerebellum on its tentacles, a reconfigurable and adaptive intelligent touch sensor is proposed. It epitomizes touch strategic innovation by integrating a geometric progression structure that not only enhances deformability but also embeds an integral in&#8208;sensing mechanism. The work provides ground&#8208;breaking insight into the in&#8208;sensor computing and adaptive structure design strategies for advancing deformable multitouch electronics.








Abstract
Electronics continue to drive technological innovation and diversified applications. To ensure efficiency and effectiveness across various interactive contexts, the ability to adjust operating functions or parameters according to environmental shifts or user requirements is highly desirable. However, due to the inherent limitations of nonadaptive device structures and materials, the current development of touch electronics faces challenges, e.g., limited hardware resources, poor adaptability, weak deformation stability, and bottlenecks in sensing data processing. Here, a reconfigurable and adaptive intelligent (RAI) touch sensor is proposed, inspired by octopus's tentacle cognitive behavior. It realizes remarkable deformability and highly efficient multitouch interactions. The geometric progression structure of the sensing element equips the RAI touch sensor with a unique integrated&#8208;in&#8208;sensing mechanism and programmable logic. This greatly compresses sensing data dimensionality at the edge, yielding concise and undistorted interactive signals. By leveraging the advantages of hard&#8208;soft bonding and interface modulation of functional materials, the adaptability is achieved with a 200% strain range a 180&#176; twist tolerance, and exceptional deformation stability of &gt;10&#160;000 cycles. The diverse application&#8208;specific configurations of the RAI touch sensor, enable a dynamic intention recognition accuracy of over 99%, advancing next&#8208;generation Internet of Things and edge computing research and innovation.

         <title>Modulation of Magnetic Domain and the Occurrence of Antisymmetric Magnetoresistance in the Folded van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new methodology is demonstrated that leverages the flexible nature of van der Waals ferromagnet, specifically employing an origami technique to modulate magnetic domains. A previously rarely observed antisymmetric magnetoresistance effect is detected in folded vdW Fe3GaTe2 devices. The results highlight the potential for fabricating novel spintronic devices based on this origami&#8208;like domain structure engineering method.








Abstract
Emergent magnetism in 2D materials has attracted significant attention due to their intrinsic magnetic order, which persists down to the monolayer limit, and their potential applications in spintronic devices. In particular, domain structure modulation plays a crucial role in 2D magnet&#8208;based nano&#8208;spintronic devices. However, the fabrication and modulation of the desired domain structure, along with the establishment of reliable electrical write/read operations, remain significant challenges. Herein, a unique structure&#8208;shaping way to modulate domain structure is demonstrated via folding a continuous flat Fe3GaTe2 nanosheet. Accompanied by magnetic domain structure transformation, the symmetric butterfly&#8208;shaped magnetoresistance (MR) curve changes to an antisymmetric field&#8208;dependent magnetoresistance. Notably, the MR exhibits either the same or opposite sign at geometrically equivalent positions, depending on the relative angle of the current flow and domain wall direction. The MR behavior with respect to sweeping field and electrodes position is due to the circulating current in the vicinity of the domain wall. More importantly, this new concept of manipulating domain structure and its associated magneto&#8208;transport behavior can inspire novel spintronic devices fabrication and application.

         <title>A Simple Optical Convolution Strategy Based on Versatile Adjustable Optical Convolution Kernel for All&#8208;Optical Convolution Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel optical convolution strategy leveraging continuously adjustable photoluminescent device (CA&#8208;PLD) as convolution kernel is proposed for all&#8208;optical computing. Under ultraviolet illumination, the CA&#8208;PLD array successfully demonstrates parallel and highly efficient multiply&#8208;accumulate operations. The system achieves convolution computing in a non&#8208;von Neumann architecture, exhibiting structural simplicity, high computational efficiency, and powerful image processing and segmentation capabilities.








Abstract
Convolutional neural network (CNN) is currently one of the most important artificial neural networks. However, traditional CNN hardware architectures suffer from significant increases in energy consumption and processing time as the demand for artificial intelligence tasks grows. Here, a novel optical convolution computing strategy is proposed that leverages a continuously adjustable photoluminescent device (CA&#8208;PLD) as the optical convolution kernel, enabling parallel, all&#8208;optical convolution computing and greatly simplifying the traditional convolution process. Under ultraviolet illumination, the CA&#8208;PLD exhibits visible long&#8208;afterglow emission characteristics due to the charge trapping and retention effects. This allows for continuously adjustable light weights, facilitating arbitrary convolution operations. Building on this, parallel and efficient multiply&#8208;accumulate operations have been successfully demonstrated using CA&#8208;PLD arrays with different weight combinations. Moreover, space&#8208;transformable CA&#8208;PLD units enable applications in dilated convolution. In a semantic segmentation task with 20 categories, the CA&#8208;PLD units achieve higher Intersection over Union (IoU) values and accuracy. Therefore, the weight&#8208;adjustable and spatial transformable CA&#8208;PLD proposed in this work holds promise for future applications in intelligent optical computing systems and optical implementations of non&#8208;von Neumann architectures.

         <title>Uniaxiality&#8208;Induced Reduced&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Ultrahard Paracrystalline Diamond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paracrystalline diamond, a new&#8208;type sp3&#8208;bonded non&#8208;crystalline carbon, is synthesized at 16 GPa (vs. 30 GPa in previous reports) via uniaxial stress&#8208;induced collapse of C60 at lower pressures. By integrating experimental and computational insights, this work opens avenues for designing novel materials through controlled stress environments under pressure and offers a strategy for low&#8208;cost high&#8208;pressure material production.








Abstract
Synthesizing fully sp3&#8208;bonded non&#8208;crystalline carbon remains a long&#8208;standing challenge due to the intrinsic instability of the sp3 bond at ambient pressure. Recently, paracrystalline diamond, a new&#8208;form sp3&#8208;bonded non&#8208;crystalline carbon consisting of sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;sized paracrystallites, has been synthesized from face&#8208;centered cubic C60 at 30&#160;GPa, which has attracted attention due to its unique structural features and excellent physical properties. However, the ultrahigh synthesis pressure of paracrystalline diamond poses an obstacle to its large&#8208;scale production and applications. In this study, paracrystalline diamond is synthesized at an exceptionally low pressure (16 GPa) via inducing uniaxiality at high&#8208;pressure and high&#8208;temperature conditions, thereby breaking through the temperature&#8208;pressure phase diagram of C60. By combining structural characteristics and advanced molecular dynamics simulation, the remarkable reduction of synthesis pressure is attributed to the fact that the symmetry of the C60 cage is broken due to the uniaxiality, which further allows the C60 cage to collapse at much lower pressures. This work reveals the critical role of uniaxiality in the reduced&#8208;pressure synthesis of paracrystalline diamond, which may provide a potent methodological strategy for the development of novel low&#8208;cost high&#8208;pressure materials.

         <title>Pressure Induced Molecular&#8208;Arrangement and Charge&#8208;Density Perturbance in Doped Polymer for Intelligent Motion and Vocal Recognitions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sidechain doped polymer is investigated to have great potential for pressure detection due to the advantages including molecular rearrangement and charge&#8208;density perturbance induced by micro&#8208;mechanical deformation. This sensor displayed low&#8208;pressure detection limit of 0.7&#160;Pa as well as a rapid response time of 18.8&#160;ms, enabling multi&#8208;mode motion analysis and intelligent vocal recognitions.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) show great potential for pressure detection due to the amorphous polymer packing, but a lack of clarity regarding sensing mechanisms hampers the development of further applications. Herein, a sacrificial template&#8208;full solution method with both rough surface and high conductivity is described that can be applied to sandwich&#8208;structured resistive pressure sensors. Transient absorption measurements demonstrate the significant increase of carrier lifetime (from 1.44 to 2.54&#160;ns) induced by pressure, which directly evidenced the superior sensing mechanism of sidechain doped conjugated polymer. This sensor displayed low&#8208;pressure detection limit of 0.7&#160;Pa as well as a rapid response time of 18.8&#160;ms, enabling multi&#8208;mode motion analysis including wrist pulse, swallowing, finger bending, grabbing, and typing. Additionally, an intelligent vocal recognition system with convolutional neural networks is used which can achieve &gt;96% classification accuracy across diverse vocal profiles. This general approach is anticipated and enables a new direction for the development of pressure sensors.

         <title>Stable and Ultrasensitive X&#8208;Ray Detectors Based on Oriented Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskite Rods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large high&#8208;quality perovskite FAPbI3 SC single crystal rods (SCRs) with unique orientation are grown using a biomass&#8208;derived green solvent. The oriented FAPbI3 SCR shows high carrier mobility and large bulk resistivity. Therefore, the SC detectors realize record high X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity (2.16 &#215; 105 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging at a low dose rate of 12 nGy s&#8722;1.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;halide perovskite single crystals (SCs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detectors. X&#8208;ray detectors fabricated using perovskite FAPbI3 SCs exhibit high detection sensitivity. However, two pressing issues still need to be addressed for practical applications: the orientation&#8208;controlled growth and environmentally friendly acquisition of high&#8208;quality FAPbI3 SCs. In this study, large high&#8208;quality perovskite FAPbI3 SC rods (SCRs) with unique orientation are grown using a biomass&#8208;derived green solvent. Owing to the high carrier mobility and large bulk resistivity of the oriented FAPbI3 SCRs, the SC detectors realize a record high X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity (2.16 &#215; 105 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and high sensitivity to dark current density ratio (1.93 &#215; 109&#160;Gy&#8722;1 s). Furthermore, the detectors exhibit both ultralow dark and X&#8208;ray current drifts, as well as a detection limit of 2 nGy s&#8722;1. These characteristics enable the detectors to achieve high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging, even at dose rates as low as 12 nGy s&#8722;1. This study not only contributes a new technical solution for low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray detection, but also establishes a new approach for the low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly production of core materials for X&#8208;ray detectors.

         <title>Signal Converter&#8208;Based Therapy Platform Promoting Aging Bone Healing by Improving Permeability of the Mitochondrial Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
GelMA microspheres integrated with polydopamine&#8208;coated gold nanorods (GMPG) respond to ultrasound stimulation, converting it into biochemical signals that stimulate senescent bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to highly express HSP70, thereby improving mitochondrial membrane permeability by inhibiting BAX activation, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, and ultimately promoting aging bone regeneration.








Abstract
The aging microenvironment promotes persistent inflammation and loss of intrinsic regenerative capacity. These are major obstacles to effective bone tissue repair in older adults. This study aims to explore how physical thermal stimulation can effectively delay the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) aging process. Based on this, an implantable physical signal&#8208;converter platform is designed as a therapeutic system that enables stable heat signals at the bone injury site under ultrasound stimulation (US). It is found that the therapeutic platform controllably reduces the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization of aging BMSCs, bidirectionally inhibiting mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) leakage. The leakage ratio of mtDNA decreases by 22.7%. This effectively mitigates the activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and its downstream NF&#8208;&#954;B signaling induced by oxidative stress in aging BMSCs, thereby attenuating the pathological advancement of chronic inflammation. Thus, it effectively restores the metabolism and osteogenic differentiation of aging BMSCs in vitro, which is further confirmed in a rat model. In the GMPG/US group, the bone mineral density increases 2&#8211;3 times at 4 weeks in the rats femoral defect model. Therefore, this ultrasound&#8208;based signal&#8208;conversion platform provides a promising strategy for aging bone defect repair.

         <title>A Sprayable Hydrogel Based on Biomimetic Polypeptide&#8208;Modified Lipid Nanoparticles for Treating Non&#8208;Compressible Hemorrhaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a sprayable hydrogel based on polypeptide&#8208;modified lipid nanoparticles (PLNs) mimicking natural hemostasis. PLNs integrate platelet adhesion peptide (GFOGER) and platelet crosslinking peptide (GGQQLK), DSPS, and Ca2&#8314; to activate coagulation. Combined with Ca2&#8314;&#8208;sodium alginate hydrogels, they synergistically enhance rapid clot formation via platelet aggregation, prothrombin activation, and fibrin crosslinking, offering an efficient biomimetic strategy for hemorrhage.








Abstract
Non&#8208;compressible hemorrhaging is the main cause of death in modern warfare. A biomimetic peptide&#8208;modified lipid nanoparticle&#8208;based sprayable hydrogel is developed to mimic and amplify the blood coagulation process for effective hemostasis. A platelet adhesion peptide (PAP, sequence: GFOGER) and platelet crosslinking peptide (PCP, sequence: GGQQLK) are customized and conjugated to 1,2&#8208;distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoethanolamine&#8208;N[methoxy (polyethylene glycol) 2000] acid (DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;COOH) via amido bonds to form DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;PAP and DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;PCP, respectively. These compounds are mixed with distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine, cholesterol, and distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phospho&#8208;L&#8208;serine (DSPS) to construct the peptide&#8208;modified lipid nanoparticles via thin film rehydration. The nanoparticles are incorporated into a CaCl2&#8208;sodium alginate sprayable hydrogel crosslinked via ionic bonds. The application of the hydrogel solution quickly gels and seals the wound. The PAP activates and adheres platelets, the DSPS and Ca2+ amplify prothrombin activation, and PCP strengthens the fibrin network. The hydrogel achieves rapid hemostasis within 30 s in a liver hemorrhage model. This sprayable hydrogel has significant potential for managing non&#8208;compressible hemorrhaging.

         <title>In Situ Secondary Self&#8208;Assembly of Near&#8208;Infrared II J&#8208;Aggregates: A Novel Phototheranostic Strategy for Inducing Tumor Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel near&#8208;infrared II J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;based nanomedicine has been observed to target tumor tissue and achieve effective penetration and prolonged retention in tumor tissue using an in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly strategy. These nanomedicines induce tumor pyroptosis by generating type I reactive oxygen species (superoxide anions), facilitating robust NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and activating tumor photoimmunotherapy.








Abstract
Pyroptosis, a programmed cell death mechanism that bypasses apoptosis resistance and triggers tumor&#8208;specific immune responses, has gained much attention as a promising approach to cancer therapy. Despite enhancing tumor accumulation and extending the circulation of small&#8208;molecule drugs, nanomedicines still face significant challenges, including poor tissue penetration, tumor resistance, and hypoxic microenvironments. To overcome these challenges, a novel near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;based nanomedicine is designed, leveraging an in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly strategy to fabricate highly targeted nanoparticles (MSDP NPs). These nanomedicines trigger pyroptosis by generating type I reactive oxygen species, especially superoxide anions, while simultaneously activating photoimmunotherapy. In vivo studies demonstrate that MSDP NPs achieve efficient tumor penetration and prolong tumor&#160;retention, which is facilitated by the J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;driven formation of microscale spindle&#8208;shaped fibrillar bundles through in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly at the tumor site. This unique structural transformation enhances nanomedicine accumulation in tumor tissues, enabling robust NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and improving therapeutic efficacy even in hypoxic tumor microenvironments. This study provides an innovative phototheranostic strategy that utilizes the in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly of NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates to induce tumor pyroptosis, offering a potential solution to the limitations of current nanomedicines in cancer therapy.

         <title>Pushing the Limits: Maximizing Energy Density in Silicon Sulfide Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;energy silicon solid&#8208;state battery exceeding 400&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; is demonstrated using a 99.9&#160;wt% micro&#8208;Si anode, a thin sulfide electrolyte, and high&#8208;loading NMC811 cathode. Optimized dry/wet processing and interface engineering enable excellent cell cycling stability. Key degradation mechanisms are identified, providing strategies to enhance long&#8208;term performance of solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
For the first time, we demonstrate a silicon solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) architecture that achieves &gt;400 Wh kg&#8722;1, approaching the theoretical limit for silicon&#8208;based SSBs. This configuration features a 99.9 wt% micro&#8208;Si, a thin sulfide solid electrolyte (SSE), and a high&#8208;loading NMC811. Key to these results is strategically selecting and evaluating the processing techniques, whether wet or dry, for the negative electrode, positive electrode and thin sheet&#8208;type SSE. Excessive lithium incorporation into the silicon host, beyond the Li3.75+Si phase to form a LiSi composite, is essential to match the high capacity of the positive electrode. This SSB achieves over 1000 cycles for a 2 mAh cm&#8722;2 with &#8776;80% capacity retention and 94% capacity retention for 3 mAh cm&#8722;2 over 500 cycles at 25 &#176;C. Post analysis identifies the primary capacity decay mechanisms as oxidation at the NMC/SSE interface and structural disruptions within NMC. Meanwhile, the Si electrode maintains a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer, minimizing capacity decay. This study highlights the necessity for improved NMC coatings, lattice oxygen stabilization, and a durable positive electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface to improve the long&#8208;term stability of SSBs. Strategies leading to a single&#8208;layer pouch cell SSB exceeding 400 Wh kg&#8722;1 are developed.

         <title>Ultrahigh Conductive MXene Films for Broadband Electromagnetic Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of nitrogen&#8208;substituted MXene films, spanning the full composition range, achieves record&#8208;high conductivity (35&#8201;000 S cm&#8315;&#185;) and outstanding electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding across X, Ka, and W bands, even in ultrathin layers. These solution&#8208;processable, lightweight films outperform metals and open new possibilities for high&#8208;frequency electronics and wireless communication systems of the future.








Abstract
Broadband and ultrathin electromagnetic interference (EMI)&#8208;shielding materials are crucial for efficient high&#8208;frequency data transmission in emerging technologies. MXenes are renowned for their outstanding electrical conductivity and EMI&#8208;shielding capability. While substituting nitrogen (N) for carbon (C) atoms in the conventional MXene structure is theoretically expected to enhance these properties, synthesis challenges have hindered progress. Here, it is demonstrated that TixCyNx&#8208;y&#8208;1Tz MXene films with optimized N content achieve a record&#8208;high electrical conductivity of 35&#8201;000 S cm&#8722;1 and exceptional broadband EMI shielding across the X (8&#8211;12.4&#160;GHz), Ka (26.5&#8211;40&#160;GHz), and W (75&#8211;110&#160;GHz) bands&#8212;outperforming all previously reported materials even at reduced thicknesses. By synthesizing a full series of high&#8208;stoichiometric TixAlCyNx&#8208;y&#8208;1 MAX phases without intermediate phases, the impact of N substitution on the physical and electrical properties of TixCyNx&#8208;y&#8208;1Tz MXene flakes is systematically explored, achieving complete composition tunability in both dispersion and film forms. These findings position TixCyNx&#8208;y&#8208;1Tz MXenes as promising candidates for applications spanning from conventional lower&#8208;frequency domains to next&#8208;generation sub&#8208;THz electronics.

         <title>Reconstruction of the Buried Interface of Triple&#8208;Halide Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite for All&#8208;Perovskite Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By modifying the buried interface of the triple&#8208;halide wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite (WBG) with potassium trifluoromethanesulfonate (TfOK), a graded heterojunction is formed between the buried thin layer and the bulk, thereby improving the quality of the WBG perovskite film. Ultimately, an all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell with a PCE of 28.30% is achieved.








Abstract
All&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs) paired by wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites with narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskites holds the potential to overcome the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limitation. However, the severe phase segregation and non&#8208;radiative recombination of WBG perovskite put on a shadow for their power conversion efficiency and stability. Here, an interfacial engineering strategy is introduced into the triple&#8208;halide WBG perovskite. Potassium trifluoromethanesulfonate (TfOK) is utilized to reconstruct the buried interface of the triple&#8208;halide WBG perovskite. The distribution of (chlorine) Cl&#8722; changes from perovskite bulk toward the buried interface due to the TfOK addition. Therefore, a wider bandgap perovskite thin layer is formed at buried layer, which can form a graded heterojunction with bulk WBG perovskite to improve carrier separation and transfer. Meanwhile, the (potassium) K+ of TfOK diffuses into WBG perovskite bulk to suppress halide phase segregation. Consequently, the 1.78&#160;eV WBG PSCs deliver an impressive power conversion efficiency of 20.47% and an extremely high fill factor over 85%. Furthermore, the resultant two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite TSCs achieves a champion efficiency of 28.30%. This strategy provides a unique avenue to improve performance and photostability of WBG PSCs, a new function of Cl&#8722; in triple&#8208;halide is illustrated.

         <title>Spectrally Engineered Coatings for Steering the Solar Photons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectrum&#8208;splitting energy synergy: a spectrally engineered radiative cooling (RC) coating with photoluminescence is integrated with bifacial photovoltaic (biPV) panels to construct a hybrid biPV&#8208;RC system. By controlling solar photon conversion pathways and guiding light transport, the system enables synergistic power generation and daytime radiative cooling, offering a scalable solution for carbon&#8208;neutral buildings.








Abstract
The spectral properties of radiative cooling (RC) and photovoltaic (PV) govern their capacity to utilize solar photons at distinct energy levels. However, spectral mismatches with the solar spectrum result in significant inefficiencies: non&#8208;photovoltaic heat losses in PV panels and wasted energy from reflected solar radiation in RC systems. To address this, a photoluminescent RC coating with spectrally selective reflectivity is developed to be&#160;integrated it with bifacial photovoltaic (biPV) panels. The high reflectivity of the RC coating directs photons to the rear side of the PV panels, while its spectral selectivity optimizes the energy distribution of photons reaching the rear side, resulting in a 32% increase in the overall power output of the bifacial PV system. Additionally, the incorporation of photoluminescent materials enables the conversion of absorbed photons into luminescence rather than heat by suppressing non&#8208;radiative transitions. This reduces effective solar absorption by 14% and enhances radiative cooling performance. Simulated urban rooftop deployment demonstrates that this dual&#8208;harvesting system meet &#8776;18.1% of Hong Kong's annual electricity demand, offering a scalable pathway toward carbon&#8208;neutral cities.

Simulated urban rooftop deployment demonstrates that this dual-harvesting system meet &#8776;18.1% of Hong Kong's annual electricity demand, offering a scalable pathway toward carbon-neutral cities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aggregation Engineering of Toluene&#8208;Processed Acceptor Layer Enables Over 19% Efficiency of Air&#8208;Blade&#8208;Coated Organic Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
To elucidate the mechanism of morphology regulation in the blade&#8208;coated active layer to obtain high efficiency, three analogous acceptors (Y6, L8&#8208;BO, and L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl) are systematically compared. Benefiting from the unique molecular packing of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl and its weak molecule&#8208;interaction with toluene, the air&#8208;blade&#8208;coated D18/L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl&#8208;based device yields an outstanding power&#8208;conversion efficiency of 19.31%.








Abstract
Understanding the unique features of photovoltaic materials in high&#8208;performance blade&#8208;coated organic solar cells (OSCs) is critical to narrow the device performance difference between spin&#8208;coating and blade&#8208;coating methods. In this work, it is clarified that the molecular packing of acceptor and molecule&#8208;solvent interaction plays an essential role in determining the photovoltaic performance of blade&#8208;coated layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer OSCs. It is demonstrated that the unique dimer packing feature of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl can lead to lower excited energy (&#8710;ES1) and dominant J&#8208;aggregates in the blade&#8208;coated film compared to the analogs of Y6 and L8&#8208;BO. Meanwhile, the weaker molecule&#8208;solvent interaction between L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl and toluene is in favor of forming prominent J&#8208;aggregation in blade&#8208;coated film, contributing to a&#160;more compact &#960;&#8208;stacking than Y6 and L8&#8208;BO. Additionally, the blade&#8208;coated D18/L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl film shows more defined interpenetrating networks with clearer donor&#8208;acceptor interfaces than D18/Y6 and D18/L8&#8208;BO, facilitating improved charge extraction and suppressed charge recombination. As a result, the air&#8208;blade&#8208;coated layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer device based on D18/L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl yields a remarkable power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.31% without any additive and post&#8208;treatment, while much lower PCEs of 7.01% and 16.47% are obtained in the device based on D18/Y6 and D18/L8&#8208;BO, respectively. This work offers an effective approach to developing highly efficient air&#8208;blade&#8208;coated layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer OSCs.

         <title>Selective Lower&#8208;Occupied Through&#8208;Bond Interactions for Efficient Organic Phosphorescence Enabling High&#8208;Resolution Long&#8208;Wavelength Afterglow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective low&#8208;occupancy carbon&#8208;sulfur through&#8208;bond interactions enhance the organic red room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) to 46% yield with an emission lifetime of 0.43 s from materials without containing elements from the 4th period or higher. This significant improvement in organic red RTP yield enables high&#8208;resolution afterglow emission detection from individual nanoparticles even in the long wavelength region without relying on ambient autofluorescence. 








Abstract
Persistent organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) enables high&#8208;resolution afterglow bioimaging, independent of autofluorescence. However, the yield of organic RTP in the long&#8208;wavelength region is generally low, which limits the high&#8208;resolution information that can be obtained from the long&#8208;wavelength region. Moreover, this makes it impossible to obtain multicolor and high&#8208;resolution afterglow images. This report describes a molecule containing no atoms from the fourth or higher period that exhibits efficient red RTP in high yield. A molecule with red phosphorescent chromophores substituted with multiple phenylthio groups reached an RTP yield of 46.3% and an RTP lifetime of 0.43 s in an appropriate crystalline host medium. The selective lower&#8208;occupied through&#8208;bond or through&#8208;space interactions among molecules significantly enhance the phosphorescence in the long&#8208;wavelength region. The highly efficient and bright red persistent RTP induces a red afterglow from individual nanoparticles. Tuning the selective lower&#8208;occupied through&#8208;bond or through&#8208;space interactions allows for the design of high&#8208;performance RTP dyes and offers a novel approach to explore high&#8208;resolution full&#8208;color afterglow imaging.

         <title>Creation of Independently Controllable and Long Lifetime Polar Skyrmion Textures in Ferroelectric&#8208;Metallic Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that PTO/CCMO/SRO heterostructure can hold a broad family of skyrmion&#8208;like polar textures. One can write regular skyrmion bubble patterns with a high density &#8776;300 Gbit per inch2 by local tip field. The multiple &#960;&#8208;twist target skyrmions and skyrmion bags show significant topology&#8208;enhanced stability, verifying a topology strategy to encode robust information in ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Topological textures like vortices, labyrinths, and skyrmions formed in ferroic materials have attracted extensive interest during the past decade for their fundamental physics, intriguing topology, and technological prospects. So far, polar skyrmions remain scarce in ferroelectrics as they require a delicate balance between various dipolar interactions. Here, it is reported that PbTiO3 thin films in a metallic contact undergo a topological phase transition and hold a broad family of skyrmion&#8208;like textures including Q = &#177;1 skyrmions, multiple &#960;&#8208;twist target skyrmions, and skyrmion bags, with independent controllability, analogous to those reported in magnetic systems. Weakly&#8208;interacted skyrmion arrays with a density over 300 Gbit/inch2 are successfully written, erased, and read out by local electrical and mechanical stimuli of a scanning probe. Interestingly, in contrast to the relatively short lifetime (&lt;20 hours) of the normal skyrmions, the multiple &#960;&#8208;twist target skyrmions and skyrmion bags show topology&#8208;enhanced stability with a lifetime of over two weeks. Experimental and theoretical analysis implies the heterostructures carry electric Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction mediated by oxygen octahedral tiltings. The results demonstrate ferroelectric&#8208;metallic heterostructures as fertile playgrounds for topological states and emergent phenomena.

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective Symmetric PbSe&#8208;Based Device for Thermoelectric Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;effective symmetric PbSe&#8208;based device constructed from seven pairs of Pb0.988Cu0.002Se (p&#8208;type) and Pb1.02Cu0.002Se (n&#8208;type), which demonstrates impressive cooling temperature difference (&#916;TC) of 32.8, 36.9, and 41.0 K with the hot side maintained at 303, 323, and 343 K, respectively.








Abstract
Thermoelectric cooling technology has broad applications but is limited by the high cost of tellurium (Te) in commercially available Bi2Te3&#8208;based thermoelectric materials. Herein, a cost&#8208;effective symmetric PbSe&#8208;based device constructed from 7 pairs of Pb0.988Cu0.002Se (p&#8208;type) and Pb1.02Cu0.002Se (n&#8208;type) is presented, which demonstrates impressive cooling temperature difference (&#916;TC) of 32.8 and 41.0 K with the hot side maintained at 303 and 343 K, respectively. This low&#8208;cost symmetric PbSe&#8208;based device exhibits superior cost&#8208;effectiveness (&#916;T/cost) for near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature thermoelectric cooling compared to other Bi2Te3&#8208;based devices. Its high cooling performance primarily stems from an advanced carrier and phonon transport properties in p&#8208;type Pb0.988Cu0.002Se. Specifically, Pb vacancy and Cu substitution in Pb0.988Cu0.002Se act as strong p&#8208;type dopants that effectively optimize carrier density, resulting in a maximum power factor of 28.69 &#181;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 at room temperature. Moreover, the mobile Cu atoms within the lattice significantly impede phonon propagation, leading to a low room&#8208;temperature lattice thermal conductivity of 1.10&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. Finally, the room&#8208;temperature figure of merit (ZT) and average ZT value in p&#8208;type Pb0.988Cu0.002Se can reach 0.6 and 0.68 at 300&#8211;573 K, surpassing previous p&#8208;type PbSe&#8208;based polycrystals. This work emphasizes the significant potential of a cost&#8208;effective PbSe compound for near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature cooling applications.

Herein, a cost-effective symmetric PbSe-based device constructed from 7 pairs of Pb&lt;sub&gt;0.988&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.002&lt;/sub&gt;Se (p-type) and Pb&lt;sub&gt;1.02&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.002&lt;/sub&gt;Se (n-type) is presented, which demonstrates impressive cooling temperature difference (&#916;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;) of 32.8 and 41.0 K with the hot side maintained at 303 and 343 K, respectively. This low-cost symmetric PbSe-based device exhibits superior cost-effectiveness (&#916;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;/cost) for near-room-temperature thermoelectric cooling compared to other Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based devices. Its high cooling performance primarily stems from an advanced carrier and phonon transport properties in p-type Pb&lt;sub&gt;0.988&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.002&lt;/sub&gt;Se. Specifically, Pb vacancy and Cu substitution in Pb&lt;sub&gt;0.988&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.002&lt;/sub&gt;Se act as strong p-type dopants that effectively optimize carrier density, resulting in a maximum power factor of 28.69 &#181;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature. Moreover, the mobile Cu atoms within the lattice significantly impede phonon propagation, leading to a low room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity of 1.10&#160;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Finally, the room-temperature figure of merit (&lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt;) and average &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; value in p-type Pb&lt;sub&gt;0.988&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.002&lt;/sub&gt;Se can reach 0.6 and 0.68 at 300&#8211;573 K, surpassing previous p-type PbSe-based polycrystals. This work emphasizes the significant potential of a cost-effective PbSe compound for near-room-temperature cooling applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrahigh Piezoelectric Coefficients Achieved by Tailoring the Sequence and Nano&#8208;Domain Structure of P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)</title>

Here, the study reports morphotropic phase boundary like behavior in a relaxor ferroelectric polymer with a unique head&#8208;to&#8208;head/tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail chain structure by the complete hydrogenation of poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene), achieving an outstanding piezoelectric coefficient of &#8722;107 pC/N, over five times higher than commercial polyvinylidene difluoride. This breakthrough enables next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance flexible devices.








Abstract
During past decades, the construction of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) behavior in ceramic&#8208;based relaxor ferroelectrics has successfully led to a significant enhancement in the piezoelectric coefficient for actuators, transducers, and sensors application. However, MPB&#8208;like behavior is achieved only in the ferroelectric state in flexible ferroelectric polymers such as poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) with the highest piezoelectric coefficients of &#8776;&#8722;63.5 pC/N, due to the lack of a rational design in polymer chain structure and composition. Here, the study reports the first MPB&#8208;like behavior observed in a relaxor ferroelectric polymer synthesized by fully hydrogenating poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene), which are primarily linked in a head&#8208;to&#8208;head/tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner, and trifluoroethylene units are randomly dispersed along the molecular chain. The unique polymer chain structure is found to be responsible for the formation of conformations disorder, thus strong relaxor behavior, and phase transition from an all&#8208;trans conformation to 3/1 helix, thus inducing phase boundary behavior. As a result, an outstanding longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient of &#8722;107 pC/N, more than five times higher than that of commercial poly(vinylidene fluoride) (&#8722;20 pC/N), is observed. This work opens up a new gate for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance flexible devices.

         <title>Modulating Crystal Growth with Sacrificial Coordination for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells via Intense Pulsed Light Annealing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DodecylMSO, a sacrificial Lewis base additive, modulates perovskite crystallization during intense pulsed light annealing by strongly binding PbI&#8322; and volatilizing at high temperatures. This results in larger grains, lower defect density, and minimum trace residues, achieving the highest efficiency in its class.








Abstract
Intense pulsed light (IPL) annealing has emerged as a transformative technology for the high&#8208;throughput, low&#8208;cost fabrication of perovskite films, enabling the rapid conversion of precursor wet films into perovskite films within milliseconds. Despite their potential, the efficiencies of IPL&#8208;processed devices have yet to match those achieved through conventional thermal annealing (TA), primarily due to the challenges of uncontrolled crystallization and defect formation during the IPL process. In this study, a solid Lewis base additive, dodecyl methyl sulfoxide (DodecylMSO) is introduced, to modulate perovskite crystal growth and improve film morphology and uniformity under IPL conditions. DodecylMSO acts as a sacrificial additive, with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirming the majority of it is removed in the final films. Compared to the control films, DodecylMSO&#8208;modified films exhibited significantly reduced defect densities and enhanced carrier extraction and transport properties. Leveraging this approach, p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is demonstrated with a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.5% fabricated via IPL. This sacrificial coordination strategy not only addresses key challenges in IPL processing but also opens new avenues for advancing the manufacturability and scalability of high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Bifunctional Compound Induced Dual Back Surface Fields for Efficient Hole Transport Layer&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;based hole&#8208;transport&#8208;layer&#8208;free perovskite solar cells present a cost&#8208;effective and stable photovoltaic alternative but suffer from low efficiency due to the absence of back surface field (BSF). In this work,&#160;trityl tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate&#160;is utilized to engineer&#160;dual BSFs, significantly enhancing open&#8208;circuit voltage and leading to a&#160;champion efficiency of 20.79%&#8212;marking a substantial improvement in device performance.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based hole transport layer&#8208;free (C&#8208;HTL&#8208;free) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising for low&#8208;cost and stable photovoltaics, but the HTL absence deteriorates their power conversion efficiency (PCE) due to the lack of back surface field (BSF). In this work, the benefits of forming dual BSFs in improving the PCE of C&#8208;HTL&#8208;free PSCs are first investigated by simulation. Then, trityl tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (Tr+TPFB&#8722;) is introduced into the C&#8208;HTL&#8208;free PSCs by post&#8208;treatment for the first time, which enables the formation of dual BSFs. TPFB&#8722; passivates n&#8208;doping defects in perovskite and leads to the formation of perovskite n&#8208;p homojunction, while Tr+ extracts electrons from carbon and lowers its work function, which succeeds realizing dual BSFs. This improves the separation and extraction of photocarriers within the device, which is evidenced by the photoluminescence lifetime imaging of the device cross&#8208;section for the first time. As a result, the average open&#8208;circuit voltage increases significantly by about 70&#160;mV, which largely contributes to the improvement of PCE with a champion value of 20.79% obtained.

         <title>Functional Group Engineering Stabilizing Precursor Solution and Passivating Defects for Operationally Stable and Highly Reproducible Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degradation of perovskite precursors is suppressed by modulating the position and type of functional groups in stabilizers. 4&#8208;hydrazinobenzenesulfonic acid (4&#8208;HBSA), with the lowest pKa, effectively improved stability, passivated grain boundary defects, and increased carrier lifetime, leading to a maximum PCE of 26.79% in inverted PSCs fabricated by vacuum flash technology under ambient conditions.








Abstract
The instability of perovskite precursor solution induced by deprotonation of organic cations and oxidation of iodide ions substantially deteriorates the reproducibility and reliability of the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The above decomposition reactions can be conquered via the synergistic engineering of organic functional groups. However, how spatial conformation and type of weak acid functional groups impact the stability of perovskite precursor solution remains to be investigated. Herein, it is uncovered that the position of functional groups on the benzene and the type of weak acid functional groups remarkably influence the acid dissociation constant (pKa) and thus the stability of perovskite inks. The pKa plays a decisive role in suppressing the deprotonation of organic cations and following the amine&#8208;cation addition&#8208;elimination reaction. The 4&#8208;hydrazinobenzenesulfonic acid (4&#8208;HBSA) with the lowest pKa is optimal in stabilizing perovskite inks and mitigating nonradiative recombination through defect passivation. This breakthrough enables the inverted PSCs to deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.79% (certified 26.36%, the highest PCE value for PSCs prepared in ambient conditions) using vacuum flash evaporation technology. The modulated PSC could maintain 92% of its initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of continuous maximum power point tracking.

&lt;p&gt;The instability of perovskite precursor solution induced by deprotonation of organic cations and oxidation of iodide ions substantially deteriorates the reproducibility and reliability of the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The above decomposition reactions can be conquered via the synergistic engineering of organic functional groups. However, how spatial conformation and type of weak acid functional groups impact the stability of perovskite precursor solution remains to be investigated. Herein, it is uncovered that the position of functional groups on the benzene and the type of weak acid functional groups remarkably influence the acid dissociation constant (p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) and thus the stability of perovskite inks. The p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; plays a decisive role in suppressing the deprotonation of organic cations and following the amine-cation addition-elimination reaction. The 4-hydrazinobenzenesulfonic acid (4-HBSA) with the lowest p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is optimal in stabilizing perovskite inks and mitigating nonradiative recombination through defect passivation. This breakthrough enables the inverted PSCs to deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.79% (certified 26.36%, the highest PCE value for PSCs prepared in ambient conditions) using vacuum flash evaporation technology. The modulated PSC could maintain 92% of its initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of continuous maximum power point tracking.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superior Energy Storage Performance in a Self&#8208;Organized Trirelaxor&#8208;Antiferroelectric Nanocomposite Over a Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;organized nanocomposite addresses the challenge of energy storage materials degrading at high temperatures. The nanocomposite maintains exceptional performance from room temperature to 200&#160;&#176;C, with enhanced energy density and efficiency. Through the trirelaxor matrix and nanointerface with antiferroelectric nanoparticles, it offers a promising strategy for high&#8208;temperature dielectric energy storage, overcoming polarization and breakdown degradation at elevated temperatures.








Abstract
A fundamental paradox in energy storage dielectrics lies in the challenge of achieving superior performance consistently across both room and elevated temperatures. This is addressed by designing a self&#8208;organized nanocomposite (1&#8722;x)(Ba,Sr)(Ti,Sn)O3&#8208;xBi1.5ZnNb1.5O7 composed of nano&#8208;sized antiferroelectric(AFE) particles embedded into a trirelaxor(TRE) matrix through nanoscale phase separation process. The optimal composition at x = 0.11 exhibits outstanding energy storage performance from room temperature (energy density = 8.5 J&#160;cm&#8722;3, efficiency = 94.8%, and figure of merit of 167 J&#160;cm&#8722;3) up to 200&#160;&#176;C (energy density = 4.85 J&#160;cm&#8722;3, efficiency &gt;90% and figure of merit of 49 J&#160;cm&#8722;3), outperforming existing Pb&#8208;free dielectrics. High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron x&#8208;ray diffractometry reveal that the coexisting nanometric antiferroelectric particles and the trirelaxor nanodomains sustain over a wide temperature range. Piezoresponse force microscopy and phase&#8208;field simulation show that hysteresis&#8208;free switching of trirelaxor nanodomains enables enhanced polarization and low hysteretic loss. Resistivity shows a 2&#8211;3 order of magnitude increases accompanying significant increase in breakdown strength up to high temperatures, attributable to deep charge trapping effect at high&#8208;density TRE/AFE interfaces as evidenced by thermally stimulated depolarization current. These favorable effects in the nano&#8208;composite are responsible for its high energy storage performance up to high temperatures.

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Pixel with Only a Single Perovskite Photodiode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full&#8208;color pixel with only a single perovskite photodiode is presented. By integrating multiple photoresponse mechanisms into one device, spectral information is encoded directly into its impedance characteristics. Machine learning&#8208;based reconstruction enables accurate color retrieval without the need for additional optical components or modulation. The RGB reconstruction error is kept below 2%.








Abstract
Photodetectors typically provide only 1D information about light intensity. Even the most basic color sensing requires external optical components, such as integrated filters. This limitation of information richness has only been overcome in recent years at the cost of spatial inefficiencies in multidetector integration designs or challenges in precisely controlling in situ modulation in single&#8208;detector designs. Acquiring high&#8208;dimensional color information with a single photodetector without external components, integration, or modulation remains a significant challenge that is aimed to resolve in this work. Due to the differences in carrier excitation by photons of varying energies, the simultaneous introduction of both electronic and ionic photoconductivity mechanisms enables the spectral characteristics of the unknown exciting light to be embedded within the impedance features of the device. By extracting impedance spectra and using machine learning&#8208;based reconstruction, a full&#8208;color pixel is achieved for the first time with just a single photodetector.

         <title>Assembling Octahedral Pt2Ag4 Clusters for High&#8208;Efficiency Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two enantiomeric pairs of alloy clusters composed of two Pt2Ag4 monomer are synthesized. Chiral structural transformations occurred in response to solvent stimuli, concomitant with high&#8208;contrast chiroptical switching. By manipulation of such chiral clusters, a chiral cubic lattice with high&#8208;efficiency circularly polarized luminescence is achieved. Further, the application in the information encryptions is explored.








Abstract
Establishing atom&#8208;precise and controllable self&#8208;assembly of metal clusters to achieve high&#8208;efficiency circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is especially fascinating, yet it creates considerable challenges. Here, two enantiomeric pairs of dimer clusters R/S&#8208;Pt4Ag8&#8208;green and R/S&#8208;Pt4Ag8&#8208;orange composed of two octahedral Pt2Ag4 monomers through Pt&#8211;Pt bonds are constructed, which show a 28&#8208;fold increase in photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) compared with the reported monomer in solution. The solid&#8208;state chiral dimer R/S&#8208;Pt4Ag8&#8208;orange shows a PLQY of 87% without an aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect. The intercluster distances and arrangements of the chiral cluster can be modulated through the ligand configuration and solvent stimuli, giving rise to the reversible transformations between chiral single crystals, concomitant with high&#8208;contrast optical/chiroptical switching. Additionally, by further assembling chiral Pt&#8208;Ag clusters with Ag+, a chiral 3D cubic lattice with high&#8208;efficiency red&#8208;emitting CPL is achieved. Furthermore, high&#8208;efficiency luminescence, intrinsic chirality, and the adjustable assembly behaviors of these chiral cluster assemblies bestow them with excellent smart CPL switching properties. This work opens a new avenue for high&#8208;efficiency CPL&#8208;active metal clusters by regulating metal&#8208;metal interactions.

         <title>Tunable Bipolar Photothermoelectric Response from Mott Activation for In&#8208;Sensor Image Preprocessing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a gate&#8208;tunable bipolar photothermoelectric detector using a vanadium dioxide film transistor. The device offers broadband photoresponse, linear light&#8208;intensity dependence, adjustable responsivities, low energy use (8 pJ&#160;per spike), and high stability (over 5000 cycles). An integrated convolutional network excels in broadband image classification, medical image denoising, and retinal vessel segmentation, highlighting its potential for future smart edge sensors.








Abstract
In&#8208;sensor image preprocessing, a subset of edge computing, offers a solution to mitigate frequent analog&#8208;digital conversions and the von Neumann bottleneck in conventional digital hardware. However, an efficient in&#8208;sensor device array with large&#8208;scale integration capability for high&#8208;density and low&#8208;power sensory processing is still lacking and highly desirable. This work introduces an adjustable broadband photothermoelectric detector based on a phase&#8208;change vanadium dioxide thin&#8208;film transistor. This transistor employs a vanadium dioxide/gallium nitride three&#8208;terminal structure with a gate&#8208;tunable phase transition at the gate&#8208;source junctions. This design allows for modulable photothermoelectric responsivities and alteration of the short&#8208;circuit photocurrent's polarities. The devices exhibit linear gate dependence for the broadband photoresponse and linear light&#8208;intensity dependence for both positive and negative photoresponsivities. The device's energy consumption is as low as 8 pJ per spike, which is one order of magnitude lower than that of previous Mott materials&#8208;based in&#8208;sensor preprocessing devices. A wafer&#8208;scale bipolar phototransistor array has also been fabricated by standard micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;fabrication techniques, exhibiting excellent stability and endurance (over 5000 cycles). More importantly, an integrated in&#8208;sensor convolutional network is successfully designed for simultaneous broadband image classification, medical image denoising, and retinal vessel segmentation, delivering exceptional performance and paving the way for future smart edge sensors.

More importantly, an integrated in-sensor convolutional network is successfully designed for simultaneous broadband image classification, medical image denoising, and retinal vessel segmentation, delivering exceptional performance and paving the way for future smart edge sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The combination of metal single atoms and heterojunctions creates a ladder&#8208;like built&#8208;in electric field, providing a novel and innovative photocatalyst structure for improving photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Semiconductor heterojunctions can significantly enhance the separation of photogenerated charge carriers, among which Z&#8208;type heterojunctions are more conducive to photocatalysis due to their special transfer paths and strong oxidizing and reducing properties. However, introducing efficient active sites has always been a significant challenge in the improvement of heterogeneous photocatalysts. Herein, through in&#8208;depth analysis of the reaction mechanism and structural characteristics, single atom catalysts and heterojunctions are ingeniously integrated using built&#8208;in electric fields. For the first time, the suitable metal single atom active sites are successfully designed under the special electronic structure at the N&#8208;terminal, utilizing low electronegativity non&#8208;metallic element doping to counteract local electron migration from heterojunctions. Ladder&#8208;like built&#8208;in electric field composed of the divergent and parallel built&#8208;in electric fields from single atom catalysts and heterojunctions respectively, which introduces a new carrier separation path. AgPCN/BCN heterojunction reaches a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) yield 559.5&#160;&#181;M&#8729;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of 17.8% through 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction. Photoelectrochemical tests indicate the importance of 4e&#8722; water oxidation reaction as an auxiliary reaction. This novel and innovative photocatalyst structure brings new approaches for photocatalysts improvement, and new insights into the role of built&#8208;in electric fields in photocatalytic reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Cellular Glycocalyx Affects Nanoparticle Access to Cell Membranes and Uptake</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cellular glycocalyx is a dense and negatively charged layer of carbohydrates that ubiquitously coats cells. Nanoparticles must permeate through the glycocalyx to access receptors on the cell surface. The glycocalyx layer regulates cellular access to nanoparticles via charge&#8208;charge interactions. By varying nanoparticle surface charges, researchers can control nanoparticle uptake to enhance the specificity of targeted drug delivery systems.









Abstract
Understanding nanoparticle interactions with cells is fundamental to designing them for medical applications. Nanoparticles must interface with the cell surface to be bound and taken up. The glycocalyx is a carbohydrate layer coating the cell surface, rendering it negatively charged. Many researchers have noted that the glycocalyx affects nanoparticle uptake, but the mechanism remains unknown,&#160;Here, we investigate the interaction between the glycocalyx and nanoparticles at the cell surface in different cell types. The glycocalyx reduced the interactions between the nanoparticles and cells, thereby reducing cellular access, binding, and uptake. The magnitude of the effect is dependent on the nanoparticle charge. Fine&#8208;tuning the charge of nanoparticles can enhance the specificity of nanoparticle targeting. Understanding the role of the glycocalyx in nano&#8208;bio interactions will allow researchers to control the interactions of nanoparticles with the cell surface.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Rare Earth Oxides Anchoring Tunable Cu&#948;+ Nanochimneys for Self&#8208;Tandem C&#8208;C Coupling Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic protocol for 2D high&#8208;entropy rare earth oxides (HE&#8208;REOs) featuring lattice distortions and oxygen vacancies is developed, representing an emerging platform for anchoring Cu&#948;+ nano&#8208;domains with tunable oxidation states. The HE&#8208;REOs&#8208;Cu&#948;+ self&#8208;tandem catalysts exhibit largely exposed synergistic sites that facilitate *CO spillover, while stabilized optimal Cu&#948;+ chimneys promote C&#9472;C couplings and interfacial channels that delocalize electrons, thereby lowering the energy barrier.








Abstract
Copper (Cu)&#8208;based materials are promising for carbon&#8208;carbon bond (C&#9472;C) coupling catalysis, but they are limited to poor structural stability, high activation energy, and low selectivity toward C2+ products. Here a customized synthetic protocol is defined for the fabrication of 2D ultrathin high&#8208;entropy rare earth (RE) oxides (HE&#8208;REOs) with rich lattice distortions and oxygen vacancies, which act as robust supports for anchoring Cu&#948;+ serial domains with tunable oxidation states. The rationally integrated HE&#8208;REOs&#8208;Cu&#948;+ heterostructures feature largely exposed synergistic multi&#8208;site driving rapid *CO spillover, and multiple stabilized Cu&#948;+ chimneys promoting cascade *CO coupling, together with intrinsic electron activation channels enabling RE 4f electron delocalization to lower the energy barrier. The optimal CeZrZnAgPbO&#8208;Cu0.44+ self&#8208;tandem catalysts achieve a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 51.7% for C2+ gaseous products at a low potential of &#8208;0.9&#160;V versus (vs) reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in H&#8208;type cell. The study proposes an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; design principle for advanced RE&#8208;based catalysts through integrating advantageous individuals in a predictable manner.

         <title>Modular Design of T Cell Nanoengagers for Tumor Immunotherapy via Genetically Engineered Lipid&#8208;Tagged Antibody Fragments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;display&#8221; strategy for constructing T cell nanoengagers by directly embedding genetically engineered lipid&#8208;tagged antibodies into lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles. This versatile approach enables the design of both bi&#8208; and tri&#8208;specific nanoengagers, which effectively recruit T cells to tumor cells, enhance T cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity, and mitigate T cell exhaustion.









Abstract
T cell engagers, which bind tumor&#8208;associated antigens and T cell specific molecules, represent a promising class of immunotherapies for enhancing targeted immune responses. Here, a &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;display&#8221; platform is introduced for engineering T cell nanoengagers by anchoring antibody fragments into lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles. This approach utilizes a genetically engineered lipoprotein fused with single&#8208;chain variable fragments (scFv) and nanobodies, which spontaneously integrate into lipid bilayer of the nanoparticles, achieving a high surface density of at least 0.102&#160;scFv&#160;nm&#8722;2 (&#8776;3200&#160;scFv per particle). Modular bi&#8208;specific (Lipo&#8208;BiTE) and tri&#8208;specific (Lipo&#8208;TriTE) immunoliposomes are designed to enhance anti&#8208;tumor T cell immune responses. The Lipo&#8208;BiTE, integrating anti&#8208;CD3 and anti&#8208;HER2 scFv at an optimized surface density of 1.28&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;scFv&#160;nm&#8722;2, exhibits enhanced CD8+ T cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity in HER2&#8208;positive tumor models by simultaneously engaging tumor cells and T cells. Incorporating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 nanobodies to create Lipo&#8208;TriTE further addresses T cell exhaustion. This modular platform provides a robust foundation for designing immune cell engagers, with broad applications in targeted immunotherapy.

         <title>Fluorine Engineering Induces Phase Transformation in NiCo2O4 for Enhanced Active Motifs Formation in Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely manipulating the reconstruction process to generate specific active motifs remains challenging during the alkaline OER. NiCo2O4&#8208;Fn, structured with NiCo2O4 cores and (NH4)NixCo1&#8722;xF3 shells, facilitate the dual&#8208;metal NiCoOOH active phase with Ov forming at a lower voltage than the single&#8208;metal NiOOH in NiCo2O4, which is demonstrated by in situ Raman and XAFS. The NiCoOOH generation is attributed to the transformation of (NH4)NixCo1&#8722;xF3 into NixCo1&#8722;x(OH)2 hydroxide in electrolyte without bias. Consequently, NiCo2O4&#8208;Fn exhibits enhanced OER intrinsic activities compared to NiCo2O4.









Abstract
Dynamic reconstruction of catalysts is key to active site formation in alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but precise control over this process remains challenging. Herein, F&#8208;doped NiCo2O4 (NiCo2O4&#8208;Fn), consisting of a NiCo2O4 core and a (NH4)NixCo1&#8722;xF3 shell is reported, which promotes the formation of a dual&#8208;metal NiCoOOH active phase. In situ Raman and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analyses reveal that the NiCoOOH, rich in oxygen vacancies (Ov), forms at 1.2&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for NiCo2O4&#8208;F1, in contrast to the NiOOH phase formation at 1.4&#160;V versus RHE for undoped NiCo2O4. This is facilitated by the transformation of (NH4)NixCo1&#8722;xF3 into amorphous NixCo1&#8722;x(OH)2 in the KOH electrolyte without bias. Electrochemical tests show that NiCo2O4&#8208;F1 exhibits a 14&#8208;fold increase in intrinsic activity compared to NiCo2O4. Theoretical calculations suggest that Ov&#8208;induced unsaturated Co and Ni sites enhance electroactivity by promoting *OH intermediates adsorption and conversion, lowering the OER energy barrier. The oriented control of NiCoOOH active motifs in NiCo2O4 spinel, achieved through fluorine engineering, paves a new avenue for designing efficient OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>High&#8208;Oriented SnO2 Nanocrystals for Air&#8208;Processed Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with an Efficiency of 23.87%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DAC&#8208;AA into SnO2 colloids favors the crystalline phase and preferential orientation along high&#8208;oriented (101) and (200) crystal planes by reducing surface absorption energy and modulating crystal thermodynamics, promoting heating transfer rate in the flexible PEN substrate and favoring perovskite/SnO2 lattice matching. The f&#8208;PSCs fabricated in full&#8208;air conditions produce an efficiency of 23.87% and exceptional mechanical stability.








Abstract
Tin (IV) oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer (ETL) emerges as the most promising n&#8208;type semiconductor material for flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs). The (110) facet&#8208;dominated SnO2 colloids are readily created, whereas other best&#8208;performing (101) and (200) facets&#8208;dominated ones with superior potential in interface modulation and lattice matching remain insufficiently explored. Here water&#8208;soluble acryloyloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride&#8208;acrylamine (DAC&#8208;AA) doping into SnO2 colloids produces more (101)&#8208; and (200)&#8208;oriented crystal domains through lowering surface absorption energy and offering additional thermodynamic driving force. Theoretical and experimental analyses corroborate that the grain preference orientation induced by DAC&#8208;AA modification strengthens heating transfer rate on the flexible substrate and favors lattice matching of perovskite (100) plane on SnO2 (101) and (200) facets. Accordingly, the champion f&#8208;PSCs on high&#8208;oriented SnO2&#8208;DAC&#8208;AA ETLs fabricated fully in ambient air conditions achieve the efficiencies of 23.87% and 22.41% with aperture areas of 0.092 and 1 cm2. In parallel, the propitious interfacial lattice arrangement attenuates the formation of micro&#8208;strain inside perovskite films, maintaining 92.5% of their initial performance after 10&#160;000 bending cycles with a curvature radius of 6&#160;mm.

         <title>Scalable Lithium Niobate Nanoimprinting for Nonlinear Metalenses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A broadband polycrystalline lithium niobate platform is developed for highly versatile and scalable fabrication of nonlinear metasurfaces. This work demonstrates simultaneous second harmonic generation and wavefront&#8208;shaping via a metalens on this platform. The high effective optical nonlinearity enables broadband frequency doubled light focusing for power density enhancement from near&#8208;ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared spectral range.








Abstract
Miniaturizing nonlinear optical components is essential for integrating advanced light manipulation into compact photonic devices, enabling scalable and cost&#8208;effective applications. While monocrystalline lithium niobate thin films advance nonlinear nanophotonics, their high inertness limits the design of top&#8208;down fabricated nanostructures. A versatile bottom&#8208;up fabrication method based on nanoimprint lithography is presented for achieving polycrystalline lithium niobate nanostructures and demonstrate its significant potential for nonlinear metasurfaces. The fabrication enables nearly vertical features and aspect ratios of up to 6 combined, which we combine with a novel solution&#8208;derived material with high effective second&#8208;order nonlinearity deff of 5&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1. On this platform, second&#8208;harmonic focusing is demonstrated over a broad spectral range from near&#8208;ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared, increasing the nonlinear signal intensity by up to 34 times. This method enables the first lithium niobate metalens and expands the field of nonlinear metasurfaces by providing a low&#8208;cost, highly scalable fabrication method for engineered nonlinear&#160;nanostructures.

         <title>Screening Natural Cholesterol Analogs to Assemble Self&#8208;Adjuvant Lipid Nanoparticles for Antigens Tagging Guided Therapeutic Tumor Vaccine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 27, July 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cholesterol analogs ginsenosides&#8208;Rg3 are screened to assemble lipid nanoparticles, which can deliver nucleic acid antigens to tumors and lymph nodes for antigens tagging tumor cells and dendritic cells activation, thus guiding CTL to accurately recognize and kill tumor cells. Besides, ginsenosides&#8208;Rg3 can reshape tumor microenvironment by inhibiting STAT3. Collectively, this work has great clinical value for immune&#8208;escaping tumors.








Abstract
The clinical progress of tumor nucleotide vaccines is limited due to insufficient recognition and killing of tumor cells with low antigen expression by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Here, natural cholesterol analogs are screened to assemble self&#8208;adjuvant lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for antigens tagging tumor cells and dendritic cells (DC) activation. First, a library of ginsenosides are collected, and then screened according to their anti&#8208;tumor immunity. Then, ginsenoside&#8208;Rg3 based&#8208;LNPs loaded with antigens (Rg3&#8208;LNPs) are identified as the optimal formulation by investigating the physicochemical and biological properties. Finally, Rg3&#8208;LNPs and granulocyte&#8208;macrophage colony&#8208;stimulating factor (GM&#8208;CSF) are co&#8208;loaded into a macroporous hydrogel for long&#8208;term immune response. Rg3&#8208;LNPs could accumulate into both tumors and LNs. Rg3&#8208;LNPs targeted tumor cells with high glucose transporter&#8208;1 expression via the targeting ligand Rg3, and anchored antigens on the tumor cell surface, thus promoting the recognition of CTL to tumor cells; Rg3&#8208;LNPs can accumulate into the LNs to promote DC activation and antigen presentation, thus stimulating CTL activation. Besides, Rg3, as an adjuvant, cooperated with GM&#8208;CSF to remodel the tumor microenvironment, thus promoting the killing of CTL to tumor cells. Collectively, this work highlights the importance of tagging antigens to tumor cells in tumor vaccine and has great clinical value for immune&#8208;escaping tumors.

Rg3-LNPs targeted tumor cells with high glucose transporter-1 expression via the targeting ligand Rg3, and anchored antigens on the tumor cell surface, thus promoting the recognition of CTL to tumor cells; Rg3-LNPs can accumulate into the LNs to promote DC activation and antigen presentation, thus stimulating CTL activation. Besides, Rg3, as an adjuvant, cooperated with GM-CSF to remodel the tumor microenvironment, thus promoting the killing of CTL to tumor cells. Collectively, this work highlights the importance of tagging antigens to tumor cells in tumor vaccine and has great clinical value for immune-escaping tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Granular Hydrogels as Brittle Yield Stress Fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the Kamani&#8208;Donley&#8208;Rogers yield stress fluid model can describe granular hydrogel deformation. The model robustly captures transient rheology and self&#8208;healing behavior for granular gels of varying composition using only six parameters. This framework provides new insight regarding the effect of material parameters on granular yielding and informs advanced applications such as extrusion&#8208;based granular (hydrogel) printing and material ageing/remodeling.








Abstract
While granular hydrogels are increasingly used in biomedical applications, methods to capture their rheological behavior generally consider shear&#8208;thinning and self&#8208;healing properties or produce ensemble metrics (e.g., dynamic moduli) while neglecting transient yielding and unyielding processes. Combining oscillatory shear testing with Brittility (Bt) via the Kamani&#8208;Donley&#8208;Rogers (KDR) model, this work shows that granular hydrogels behave as brittle yield stress fluids. This work quantifies steady and transient rheology as a function of microgel properties and granular composition for polyethylene glycol and gelatin microgels. The KDR model with Bt captures granular hydrogel behavior for a wide range of design parameters, reducing the complex rheology to a determination of model parameters. In granular mixtures, this work observes monotonic dependencies of the elastic modulus, structural viscosity, and brittility upon granular composition, while the yield stress is lower for mixtures. Microgel size distribution and polymer fraction are the most influential parameters in monolithic granular hydrogels, while microgel size and packing density are less impactful. The model robustly captures self&#8208;healing behavior and reveals that granular hydrogel relaxation accelerates with an increased small&#8208;amplitude strain rate. This quantitative framework is an important step toward rational design of granular hydrogels for applications ranging from injection and in situ stabilization to 3D bioprinting.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological materials offer a novel platform for thermoelectric energy conversion through unique band features, including band inversion, linear Dirac bands, surface states, and Berry curvature. These quantum characteristics enable enhanced longitudinal and transverse thermoelectric effects, establishing topological thermoelectrics as a promising frontier for both fundamental research and advanced energy technologies.








Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) effect, which enables the direct conversion of heat into electricity or vice versa, has great importance for condensed matter physics and material science due to its great potential for sustainable energy applications. Topological materials, with their topologically nontrivial band structures and rich physical phenomena, offer exciting opportunities for achieving efficient TE energy conversion. Here, an overview of the recent theoretical is provided and experimental advances at the intersection of topology and thermoelectricity. The unique features of topological materials are examined, such as band inversion, topological surface/edge states, linear Dirac/Weyl bands, and Berry curvature, affect their TE transport properties. Additionally, the potential of band topology to enhance both longitudinal and transverse TE performance is discussed. The current challenges and prospects for further advancing topological TE materials and devices are identified, aiming to develop high&#8208;performance TE materials and devices.

         <title>Revisiting the Impact of Anion Selection on Sulfur Redox Reaction Kinetics for High Sulfur Loading Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur redox reactions are systematically evaluated with nine commercial lithium salts and developed a new LiTFSI&#8208;free, PFAS&#8208;free electrolyte for Li&#8211;S batteries. LiBOB, once considered incompatible, forms a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase, suppressing the shuttle effect and delivering excellent performance in high&#8208;loading Li&#8211;S cells, offering a more sustainable electrolyte strategy.








Abstract
Lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) is widely used in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery electrolytes due to its stability with lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and moderate compatibility with lithium metal anodes. However, LiTFSI presents environmental concerns due to its association with per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are environmentally persistent and potentially toxic, raises sustainability concerns. This research also reveals that LiTFSI limits sulfur redox reactions (SRRs), making it less effective than other lithium salts.&#160;Additionally, some salts previously considered incompatible with Li&#8208;S systems due to their reactivity with LiPSs are demonstrated to perform effectively. For the first time, a protective, porous cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) formed in situ through reactions between salt anions and LiPS is reported. The cells delivered a high specific capacity of 1230.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 C with a sulfur loading of &#8776;6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, limited lithium anode, maintaining a capacity retention of 76.2% after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. Under harsh conditions, such as high sulfur loading, lean electrolyte conditions (3 &#181;L mg&#8722;1), and in anode&#8208;free cells, the cells continued to deliver outstanding capacity. This work provides valuable guidelines for understanding and selecting lithium salts to advance electrolyte design for Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Direct Laser Writing of Polymer Nanocomposites for Tunable Structural Color</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, direct laser writing is used to polymerize self&#8208;assembled nanocomposite materials. Using fabrication parameters, the interparticle spacing is finely tuned beyond the thermodynamically stable state. This is exploited to generate wide gamut structural color in water. Numerical simulations are used to support this, to enable the use of scattering spectra to predict volume fraction and interparticle spacing on the nanoscale.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled colloidal particles offer a means of manipulating light, giving rise to some of the most brilliant structural colors. Conventionally, changing the reflection band of colloidal crystal assemblies has required the synthesis of different&#8208;sized nanoparticles or multiple fabrication steps. This is not a means conducive to fine&#8208;tuning structural color. Herein, it is shown that, by combining nanocomposite photoresists, self&#8208;assembly, and direct laser writing, it is possible to achieve high&#8208;resolution fabrication and precise placement of nanoparticles, combined with highly tunable structural color using one composition and one particle size. Confinement of polymerization brought by direct laser writing allows for fine control over a series of fabrication parameters, such as slicing and hatching distances, thereby enabling control of the inter&#8208;particle distance in a nanocomposite. This is key to generating microstructures that exhibit a wide gamut of color that traverses the visible spectrum. Finite&#8208;difference time&#8208;domain simulations are further used as a means of understanding the structural modifications that control color variation. The method described herein is suitable for fine&#8208;tuning of structural color in self&#8208;assembled systems, and is applicable to a wide range of materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Speed Raman Readout of Single Polypeptides via Plasmonic Nanopores</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A label&#8208;free method is presented for single&#8208;protein investigation using plasmonic nanopores that enable stable, cost&#8208;effective Raman detection of polypeptides in real time. An average of 6 photons is measured during a dwell time of 7 microseconds per amino acid. The linear correlations are observed between dwell time, molecular length, and signal, suggesting the feasibility of sequential Raman readout.









Abstract
The ability to identify individual protein molecules using Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) spectroscopy, without the need for labelling, is a significant advancement in biomedical diagnostics. However, the inherently small Raman scattering cross&#8208;section of most (bio) molecules necessitates significant signal amplification for successful detection, particularly at the single&#8208;molecule level. A novel approach is introduced for fabricating plasmonic nanopores suitable for sequential Raman readout, namely the recording of Raman spectra from portions of molecules, which are progressively flowing into plasmonic hot spots. The method is based on Capillary&#8208;Assisted Particle Assembly (CAPA)of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), thus ensuring high stability and cost&#8208;effectiveness. By electrophoretically driving polypeptides through these nanopores, real&#8208;time Raman detection is achieved with a Single&#8208;Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) camera, attaining single&#8208;molecule detection at 1&#160;nm concentration with 100 microsecond resolution. Statistical analysis of translocation times, photon scattering rates, and spectral data confirms a linear correlation between dwell time, molecular length, and Raman signal intensity. On average, a photon scattering of 6 photons/amino acid and a translocation time of 7 &#181;s per amino acid is recorded. These results demonstrate the feasibility of sequential Raman readout, overcoming key limitations of SERS. This method represents a significant step toward label&#8208;free, high&#8208;resolution molecular identification, with future potential applications in protein identification.

By electrophoretically driving polypeptides through these nanopores, real-time Raman detection is achieved with a Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) camera, attaining single-molecule detection at 1&#160;n&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; concentration with 100 microsecond resolution. Statistical analysis of translocation times, photon scattering rates, and spectral data confirms a linear correlation between dwell time, molecular length, and Raman signal intensity. On average, a photon scattering of 6 photons/amino acid and a translocation time of 7 &#181;s per amino acid is recorded. These results demonstrate the feasibility of sequential Raman readout, overcoming key limitations of SERS. This method represents a significant step toward label-free, high-resolution molecular identification, with future potential applications in protein identification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough Poly(Urea&#8208;Urethane) Plastics With Superior Impact Resistance for Cryogenic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;tough and impact&#8208;resistant poly(urea&#8208;urethane) plastics are fabricated by cross&#8208;linking soft polymer chains with multiple types of hydrogen bonds and hydrogen&#8208;bond aggregates with diverse binding energies and relaxation timescales. At &#8722;50 &#176;C, the plastic exhibits mechanical performance comparable to ultra&#8208;tough engineering plastics at ambient temperatures. The dynamic dissociation of hydrogen bonds endows PUU plastics with excellent low&#8208;temperature impact resistance.








Abstract
Traditional impact&#8208;resistant plastics become brittle at low temperatures due to restricted polymer chain mobility, rendering them unsuitable for cryogenic applications. Developing ultra&#8208;tough plastics with superior impact resistance under extreme low&#8208;temperature conditions remains a significant challenge. Here, this study reports the fabrication of ultra&#8208;tough, impact&#8208;resistant poly(urea&#8208;urethane) (PUU) plastics by cross&#8208;linking soft poly(tetramethylene ether glycol) (PTMEG) chains through multiple types of hydrogen bonds and hydrogen&#8208;bond aggregates with varying binding energies. The PUU plastic features a bicontinuous phase&#8208;separated nanostructure, where hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;cross&#8208;linked, rigid yet deformable domains are interpenetrated with soft PTMEG chains. At &#8722;50 &#176;C, the plastic exhibits mechanical properties comparable to those of ultra&#8208;tough, high&#8208;strength plastics at ambient temperature, with yield strength of 81.1&#160;MPa, breaking strength of 133.0&#160;MPa, Young's modulus of 1.5&#160;GPa, and breaking strain of 220.9%. A 0.3&#8208;mm&#8208;thick sample achieves a maximum impact force of 667.8 N and an impact energy of 3.8 J at &#8722;50 &#176;C, while maintaining exceptional mechanical robustness and flexibility even at &#8722;196 &#176;C. The low&#8208;temperature toughness and impact resistance of the PUU plastics surpass those of existing impact&#8208;resistant plastics. This study demonstrates that hydrogen bonds with a broad spectrum of binding energies serve as ideal cross&#8208;links for fabricating ultra&#8208;tough, impact&#8208;resistant plastics suitable for cryogenic applications.

         <title>Nanoporous Hydrogels with Tunable Pore Size for Efficient Hydrovoltaic Electricity Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous hydrogels with tunable pore sizes ranging from 78 to 161&#160;nm are developed using a hydrogen&#8208;bonding crosslinking strategy. The structural integrity of the hydrogel nanochannels under hydrated conditions is confirmed via cryo&#8208;electron microscopy. This work establishes a direct correlation between reduced pore size and enhanced streaming potential, providing new insights into the design of efficient hydrovoltaic materials.








Abstract
Hydrovoltaic electricity generators represent an emerging technology for converting low&#8208;grade water&#8208;based energy into electricity, and hydrogels are favored for their water absorption and ion&#8208;responsive properties. However, the controllable fabrication and precise micromorphological characterization of nanoporous hydrogels remain challenging, hindering the understanding of ion transport within confined water channels. In this work, a nanoporous hydrogel with tunable pore sizes is presented, developed through a multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding crosslinking strategy using &#947;&#8208;polyglutamic acid and hydroxylated carbon nanotubes. The pore size can be systematically tuned from 78 to 161&#160;nm, and cryo&#8208;electron microscopy confirms the presence of hydrated nanochannels. The results highlight the critical role of streaming potential in electricity generation, with the device achieving a threefold increase in voltage by reducing the pore size. The optimized device delivers an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.05&#160;V and a short&#8208;circuit current of 100&#160;&#181;A with a 0.1&#160;m NaCl droplet. Moreover,a practical application is demonstrated through a sweat&#8208;monitoring patch that visually responds to ion concentration changes. This work advances the design of high&#8208;efficiency hydrovoltaic systems by establishing a clear link between tunable nanoscale architecture and device performance, paving the way for scalable energy harvesting and sensing technologies.

         <title>Sub&#8208;1000&#160;&#176;C Sintering of Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells via Microwave&#8208;Driven Vapor Phase Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transformative microwave&#8208;driven vapor&#8208;phase sintering strategy enables densification of proton&#8208;conducting electrolytes at 980&#160;&#176;C, reducing the sintering temperature by over 500&#160;&#176;C and addressing a major bottleneck toward PCEC manufacturing.








Abstract
Protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) hold significant promise for efficient power generation and sustainable hydrogen production. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by the extreme sintering conditions required for electrolyte densification, often causing performance degradation due to Ba evaporation. Herein, microwave&#8208;driven vapor&#8208;phase diffusion sintering (MV&#8208;sintering) is introduced as an innovative approach for fabricating fully dense, stoichiometric electrolytes at a significantly reduced sintering temperature of 980&#160;&#176;C. This method demonstrates broad applicability across proton&#8208;conducting oxide electrolytes. The MV&#8208;sintered PCEC (MV&#8208;PCEC)&#160;achieves exceptional power densities of &#8776;2&#160;W cm&#8722;2 (600&#160;&#176;C) in fuel cell mode, alongside a remarkably high current density of 3.65 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.3&#160;V (650&#160;&#176;C) in electrolysis mode. Digital twin analysis underscores the MV&#8208;PCEC's enhanced microstructural features, including finer phase morphology, increased active sites, and improved gas transport. These findings provide critical insights into advancing sintering strategies for high&#8208;performance PCECs while mitigating challenges associated with conventional high&#8208;temperature processing.

         <title>Gel&#8208;Gel Interface Engineering for the Synthesis of Anisotropic Hydrogels with Designable Polymer Orientations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports that when a gel&#8208;gel interface is intentionally introduced into a hydrogel via two&#8208;step polymerization, the polymer networks near the interface spontaneously align perpendicular to it. By employing a photo&#8208;initiator system to spatially control the gel&#8208;gel interface, anisotropic hydrogels with programmable orientations of polymer networks can be synthesized, thereby demonstrating the utility of the gel&#8208;gel interface.








Abstract
Anisotropic hydrogels with designable structural complexity can exhibit sophisticated properties reminiscent of those found in living organisms. However, conventional synthetic methods typically require specific anisotropic additives and complicated processes, limiting design flexibility. Here, a simple and versatile strategy to synthesize anisotropic hydrogels with photo&#8208;designable orientations of polymer networks is developed by harnessing a &#8220;gel&#8208;gel interface,&#8221; which can be generated through the intentional adhesion between hydrogels. This strategy originates from the serendipitous discovery: when a gel&#8208;gel interface is intentionally introduced into a hydrogel through a two&#8208;step polymerization, the polymer networks near the interface are spontaneously aligned perpendicular to the interface, as a result of the simultaneous swelling and fixation process during gel&#8208;to&#8208;gel adhesion. By employing a photo&#8208;initiator system to control the gel&#8208;gel interface, anisotropic hydrogels with both 2D and 3D designed polymer orientations, as well as anisotropic hydrogels with thermally switchable polymer orientations, are successfully synthesized. The gel&#8208;gel interface has long been regarded as merely an undesirable byproduct of gel adhesion, while the complementary bulk region of hydrogels has been the primary focus in constructing anisotropic hydrogels. In contrast, this work demonstrates the utility of the gel&#8208;gel interface, expanding design possibilities for next&#8208;generation hydrogels with designable structural complexity.

This work presents electro&#8208;thermal cooperative cholesteric heliconical photonic architectures that achieve unprecedented control over thermochromic behavior, enabling linear and programmable temperature sensitivity, full&#8208;visible range structural color modulation, and customizable operating ranges. By harnessing these advanced capabilities into intelligent sensing and high&#8208;dimensional information encryption, this study paves the way for multi&#8208;functional soft matter systems and next&#8208;generation photonic technologies.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive structural color materials hold immense promise for environmental monitoring, adaptive camouflage, and advanced photonic technologies. However, conventional systems suffer from fixed temperature sensitivity, nonlinear responses, and limited tunability due to intrinsic physicochemical properties. Herein, cholesteric heliconical architectures are established to achieve unprecedented control over thermochromic behaviors. The system demonstrates impressive temperature sensitivity with near&#8208;linear correlation, characterized by a reflection wavelength shift of 5&#160;nm per 0.05&#160;&#176;C across the entire visible spectrum. Remarkably, the sensitivity can be dynamically programmed from 100 to 50&#160;nm&#160;&#176;C&#8722;1 via electric field modulation, offering unparalleled flexibility in designing application&#8208;specific responsive profiles. The electro&#8208;thermal synergy originates from the interplay between temperature&#8208;dependent bend elastic effect and field&#8208;induced dielectric torque within LC dimer&#8208;based material systems, which collectively regulate heliconical pitch and cone angle. By integrating digital photolithography, spatially heliconical microdomains with distinct thermal responsive behaviors, enabling cutting&#8208;edge multiplexed temperature visualization and dynamic information encryption are further fabricated. This work establishes a versatile and scalable platform for multifunctional photonic materials, opening new avenues for soft matter photonics, adaptive optics, and next&#8208;generation photonic devices.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Sensitive Implantable NIR Phototransistor for One&#8208;Click Pain Relief Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic near&#8208;inflared phototransistors with IDTBT/Y6 heterojunction are developed as implantable controllers for alternating voltages triggering, and shows 99.4% suppression rate within 20&#160;ms on rat, enabling real&#8208;time pain relief for medical application advancing.








Abstract
The increasing prevalence of chronic neuralgic pain in expanding populations has created urgent demands for robust pain relief technology. Their sporadic and unpredictable nature, however, presents significant challenge for on&#8208;demand inhibition of nerve transduction. Here, implantable near&#8208;infrared pain relief controllers are reported that leverage stretchable organic phototransistors with IDTBT/Y6 bulk&#8208;heterojunction, offering high responsiveness and reduce charge trapping to trigger detectivity of up to 9.4 &#215; 1013 Jones. By integrating the device with an oscillating circuit, the 808&#160;nm NIR irradiation with varying light intensities can trigger inhibiting voltage ranging from 1&#160;kHz to 50&#160;kHz. This allows for one&#8208;click precise manipulation of neural activity in rat sciatic nerves, achieving up to 99.4% signal suppression within just 20 milliseconds. Furthermore, the nearly real&#8208;time elimination of pain sensation is confirmed by measuring the amplitude of hind paw reflex movements of rats. These findings pave a novel way for the development of advanced pain relief systems for medical applications.

         <title>Realizing Multicolor, 3D&#8208;Printable Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence PLA Materials via Regulating the &#960;&#8208;System of Aryl&#8208;Annulated Carbazoles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the &#960;&#8208; system of aryl&#8208;annulated carbazoles, full&#8208;color (440 &#8211; 628 nm) is achieved, ultralong lifetimes (251 &#8211; 3841 ms), and bright (&#934;pmax = 19%) RTP emission in PLA matrix, representing the best performance among reported PLA&#8208;based RTP materials. Leveraging the unique thermoplasticity of polymers, versatile RTP filaments are fabricated through extrusion processing and create intricate RTP objects via FDM printing or 3D printing pens.








Abstract
Bio&#8208;based degradable organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (URTP) polymers should become a mainstream research topic in the future. Meanwhile, shaping URTP polymers into 3D&#8208;printable materials is of great significance for applications in optical and optoelectronic fields. Nevertheless, the fabrication of full&#8208;color, ultralong, bright, and 3D printable bio&#8208;based RTP polymer materials using a single&#8208;dopant component still faces significant challenges. Here, by regulating the &#960;&#8208;system of aryl&#8208;annulated carbazoles, the triplet energy levels are successfully regulated which enabled wavelength&#8208;tunable RTP emissions spanning from blue to red afterglow (440 &#8211; 628 nm) in PLA matrix. Non&#8208;radiative decay of dopant triplet excitons are effectively suppressed by the rigid environment of polymer matrix and dopant&#8208;polymer interactions. This enables the prepared PLA&#8208;based RTP materials exhibited ultralong lifetimes of 3.84 s and the naked&#8208;eye&#8208;visible afterglow duration up to 48 s. Recyclable and reprocessable RTP objects are fabricated via 3D printing and are successfully applied in the fields of artworks, monitoring and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This successfully expands the application of polymer&#8208;based RTP materials in 3D fields, and will promote the commercialization of RTP materials and the development of environmentally friendly ultralong RTP materials.

         <title>Contact Transfer Epitaxy of Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bringing a halide perovskite thin film (donor) into contact with a self&#8208;assembled monolayer of oriented perovskite nanocrystals (acceptor) at elevated temperature leads to epitaxial transfer of halide perovskite from the donor to the acceptor substrate. The acceptor substrate controls the crystal orientation and grain size, while the donor substrate controls the composition.








Abstract
Halide perovskite materials are very exciting because of their excellent optoelectronic properties and simple deposition with both solution and vapor&#8208;phase methods. Until now, solution deposition has received more attention, but there are growing indications that residual solvent may limit performance and in particular long&#8208;term stability. Evaporation is a promising alternative, but is more complicated to implement; it requires vacuum, multiple sources at different temperatures, is difficult to switch between different materials due to cross&#8208;contamination and typically leads to films with very small grain size. Here a novel contact transfer method is presented for fabricating single crystalline perovskites that maintains the simplicity and flexibility of solution deposition while avoiding the use of solvent. This contact transfer epitaxy method uses an acceptor substrate consisting of self&#8208;assembled perovskite nanocubes to control crystal orientation and a donor substrate of the desired perovskite film to determine the ultimate composition. By heating the two substrates under close contact in atmospheric conditions, the perovskite film is transferred from the donor to the acceptor substrate, showing cubic phase (100) orientation even with hexagonal donor films. It is shown that contact transfer epitaxy is compatible with a variety of compositions and does not require specialized evaporators or vacuum conditions.

         <title>A Novel Time&#8208;Division Multiplexing Architecture Revealed by Reconfigurable Synapse for Deep Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel double gate&#8208;controlled synapse transistor featuring a graphene/2D perovskite/carbon nanotubes heterostructure is developed, enabling reconfigurable synaptic memory to support Time&#8208;Division Multiplexing (TDM)&#8208;based neural networks. More surprisingly, as the scale of the neural network model gradually increases, the benefits of TDM become more pronounced.








Abstract
Deep learning's growing complexity demands advanced AI chips, increasing hardware costs. Time&#8208;division multiplexing (TDM) neural networks offer a promising solution to simplify integration. However, it is difficult for current synapse transistors to physically implement TDM networks due to inherent device limitations, hindering their practical deployment in modern systems. Here, a novel graphene/2D perovskite/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) synapse transistor featuring a sandwich structure is presented. This transistor enables the realization of TDM neural networks at the hardware level. In this structure, the 2D perovskite layer, characterized by high ion concentration, serves as a neurotransmitter, thereby enhancing synaptic transmission efficiency. Additionally, the CNTs' field&#8208;effect transistors, with their large on&#8208;off ratio, demonstrate a wider range of synaptic current changes. The device mechanism is theoretically analyzed using molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, the impact of TDM on the scale, power, and latency of neural network hardware implementation is investigated. Qualitative analysis is performed to elucidate the advantages of TDM in the hardware implementation of larger deep learning models. This study offers a new approach to reducing the integration complexity of neural networks hardware implementation, holding significant promise for the development of intelligent nanoelectronic devices in the future.

         <title>Initiating Strain Field for Mitigating Lead Leakage in Perovskite Solar Cells with Built&#8208;in Encapsulating Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that chemical sealing networks and strain field regulation enhance the stability of perovskite film and inhibit Pb leakage, achieving a 96.98% suppression of Pb leakage. The small&#8208;area device (0.10 cm&#178;) and module (100 cm&#178;) exhibit the efficiencies of 26.11% and 20.41%, respectively. Unencapsulated devices retain 97.05% of their initial efficiency after 2160&#160;hours under the&#160;ambient humidity.








Abstract
Despite the remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their unsatisfactory operational stability and lead (Pb) leakage remain major obstacles to commercialization. Nevertheless, with the Pb precipitation mechanism remaining elusive, the community has long been under the impression that preventing Pb leakage mainly lies in the out&#8208;film encapsulation. Here, that in&#8208;film reinforcement is demonstrated through the synergy of built&#8208;in chemical sealing networks encapsulating and balanced compressive strain field plays a pivotal role in elevating the thermodynamic barrier for structural dissociation, thereby preventing Pb leakage from severely damaged devices exposed to external stimuli. Through in situ planar&#8208;resolved cathodoluminescence and depth&#8208;resolved grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle scattering, the spatial evolution of secondary Pb phases is further elucidated within the perovskite films. Consequently, a remarkable 96.98% inhibition rate for Pb leakage from damaged PSCs is achieved. Furthermore, the impressive PCEs of 26.11% in a cell (0.10&#160;cm2) and 20.41% in a module (100&#160;cm2) are achieved. More importantly, the unencapsulated PSCs maintain 97.05% of their initial PCE over 2160&#160;h under humidity ambient. This work highlights the conceptual insights into mitigating Pb leakage by controlling in&#8208;film structural rigidity, thus paving the way for the environmental sustainability of PSCs.

         <title>Borate&#8208;Water&#8208;Based 3D&#8208;Slime Interface Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolytes for Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This advanced material, composed of lithium borate, lithium salt, and water, is a quasi&#8208;solid that can be handled in air and has a 3D&#8208;conducting&#8208;interface network (3D&#8208;Slime&#8208;Interface Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolytes: 3D&#8208;SLISE). The 3D&#8208;SLISE is nonflammable and can be used in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, and its water solubility allows direct recycling of active materials. This technology can contribute to the creation of a battery&#8208;recycling society.








Abstract
The development of solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) that do not use hazardous materials as electrolytes and are not flammable is progressing rapidly, however the production of sulfide&#8208;based SSBs requires strict low&#8208;dew&#8208;point control due to their high reactivity with atmospheric moisture and the concern of generating hydrogen sulfide, and several issues remain in terms of the cost and recyclability. Thus, low&#8208;cost facile materials and low&#8208;CO2&#8208;emission processes are necessary. With regard to oxide&#8208;type SSBs, which are attracting attention for their safety, there are issues with manufacturing suitability, as high&#8208;temperature sintering of oxide solid electrolyte particles is required. A new quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state (QSS) electrolyte with 3D&#8208;ionic conduction and adhesive interfaces by combining amorphous Li2B4O7 and water (3D&#8208;Slime Interface Solid Electrolyte: 3D&#8208;SLISE) is synthesized without stringent dew point control and sintering. Electrode and electrolyte slurries containing 3D&#8208;SLISE are applied to current&#8208;collecting foils in air, naturally dried, and used to construct battery laminates. 3D&#8208;SLISE&#8208;QSSBs (LiCoO2 cathode/3D&#8208;SLISE with 7 wt.% bound&#8208;water/Li4Ti5O12 or TiNb2O7 anodes) maintain several hundred cycles of charge/discharge as a 2.35&#160;V lithium&#8208;ion battery. The 3D&#8208;SLISE&#8208;QSSB technology can promote the use of safe and low&#8208;cost batteries, eliminate the need for a dry room during manufacturing, and enable direct recycling of active materials.

         <title>In Situ Formation of Luminescent Perovskite Quantum Dot/Polymer Composites: Scalable Synthesis, Continuous Processing and Functional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free &#8220;raw material selection&#8208;synthesis design&#8208;product process (RSP)&#8221; strategy is proposed to in situ synthesize perovskite QD/polymer composites, which is conductive to scaling up perovskite QDs production from laboratory research to the market. This work establishes a comprehensive synthesis&#8208;process&#8208;application framework for perovskite QDs, paving the way for industrial production.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have been considered as new&#8208;generation emitters for light conversion fields, including X&#8208;ray imaging, displays, and wearable luminescent textiles. Especially when combined with polymers, perovskite QDs not only maintain superior luminance properties and exhibit exceptional stability, but also demonstrate remarkable processability. However, there is still a lack of feasible strategies to achieve large&#8208;scale production of perovskite QD&#8208;based polymer composites. In this study, a solvent&#8208;free &#8220;raw material selection&#8208;synthesis design&#8208;product process (RSP)&#8221; strategy is proposed enable to continuously production of perovskite QD/polymer composites using a screw extruder. Rational raw material selection allows QDs to be uniformly dispersed within the polymer matrix, resulting in efficient luminescent features (e.g., the green CsPbBr3 QD/PS composites with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of &#8776;90%). Meanwhile, polymer encapsulation obviously enhances the stability of QDs against the external environment. Importantly, the strategy is a continuous process (only raw material loading is required), which is conductive to scaling up perovskite QDs production from laboratory research to the market. Furthermore, the potential applications of as&#8208;prepared QD&#8208;based polymer composites is demonstrated in various light conversion fields, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), scintillators, displays, and luminescent textiles. This work establishes a comprehensive synthesis&#8208;process&#8208;application framework for perovskite QDs, paving the way for industrial production.

         <title>Accompanying Structural Transformations in Polarity Switching of Heavily Doped Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polarity switching of heavily doped p&#8208;type conjugated polymers (CPs) toward environmentally stable electron&#8208;rich thin films is demonstrated. Multiscale analyses, incorporating spectroscopic, electrochemical, and scattering techniques, reveal structural and chemical transformations induced by excessive doping with AuCl3. Leveraging this polarity switching behavior, a flexible homojunction p&#8208;n diode is fabricated using a single CP&#8208;dopant system with a record&#8208;high rectification ratio of &#8776;105.








Abstract
Despite significant recent advancements in highly functional organic semiconductors (OSCs), the n&#8208;type OSCs reported to date lag behind their p&#8208;type counterparts in terms of long&#8208;term environmental stability. As an alternative approach to n&#8208;type materials, a few p&#8208;type polymers have been shown to undergo dramatic transitions in their charge carrier polarity to n&#8208;type through transition metal&#8208;incorporated Lewis acid doping. Although the concept of polarity switching is promising, its unclear chemical origin&#8212;particularly from a materials science perspective&#8212;limits its potential as an n&#8208;type counterpart. In this work, the chemical and structural mechanisms underlying the p&#8208;to&#8208;n polarity switching in a heavily doped conjugated polymer are elucidated. Using gold(III) chloride&#8208;doped indacenodithiophene&#8208;co&#8208;benzothiadiazole (IDTBT) as a model system, doping&#8208;induced thin&#8208;film structural changes are investigated. Quantitative X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of doped IDTBT films provides direct evidence of oxidation state changes in Au and Cl ions and confirms the covalent chlorination of the polymer backbone, establishing a direct correlation between the chemical doping mechanism and polarity switching. Finally, leveraging this polarity switching behavior, a p&#8208;n homojunction organic diode is demonstrated with a rectification ratio of 104&#8211;105, highlighting the versatility and potential of this excessively p&#8208;doped n&#8208;type OSC system for tailoring charge transport properties.

         <title>Bulk&#8208;Rashba Effect with Suppressed Spin Relaxation in a Polar Phase of Bi1&#8208;xIn1+xO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the bulk&#8208;Rashba effect with enhanced spin&#8208;relaxation time in a new polar phase of Bi1&#8208;xIn1+xO3 (x &#8776; 0.15&#8211;0.34). Unlike typical Rashba systems, which suffer from rapid spin relaxation, this polar phase of Bi1&#8208;xIn1+xO3 exhibits both high Rashba strength and long spin&#8208;relaxation time due to a polar&#8208;crystal symmetry with a unidirectional spin texture. This work expands Rashba physics to 3D systems, with potential for spintronic devices.








Abstract
The Rashba effect enables control over the spin degree of freedom, particularly in polar materials where the polar symmetry couples to Rashba&#8208;type spin splitting. The exploration of this effect, however, has been hindered by the scarcity of polar materials exhibiting the bulk&#8208;Rashba effect and rapid spin&#8208;relaxation effects dictated by the D'yakonov&#8211;Perel mechanism. Here, a polar LiNbO3&#8208;type R3c phase of Bi1&#8208;xIn1+xO3 with x &#8776;0.15&#8211;0.24 is stabilized via epitaxial growth, which exhibits a bulk&#8208;Rashba effect with suppressed spin relaxation as a result of its unidirectional spin texture. As compared to the previously observed non&#8208;polar Pnma phase, this polar phase exhibits higher conductivity, reduced bandgap, and enhanced dielectric and piezoelectric responses. Combining first&#8208;principles calculations and multimodal magnetotransport measurements, which reveal weak (anti)localization, anisotropic magnetoresistance, planar&#8208;Hall effect, and nonreciprocal charge transport, a bulk&#8208;Rashba effect without rapid spin relaxation is demonstrated. These findings offer insights into spin&#8208;orbit coupling physics within polar oxides and suggest potential spintronic applications.

         <title>Transparent Anti&#8208;Icing Moir&#233;&#8208;Film Enhancing Photovoltaic Stability in Extreme Cold Climates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving effective de&#8208;icing without sacrificing photovoltaic efficiency remains challenging. A scalable, transparent photothermal film is developed with moir&#233; structures that enable efficient ice removal and restore winter solar output. Under snow&#8208;covered conditions, it achieves up to a 7.5&#8208;fold increase in daily power generation.








Abstract
Accelerated degradation and power loss of solar cells in cold climates remain major challenges to renewable energy deployment. The photothermal film offers a promising solution by converting sunlight into heat to remove ice and snow from solar panels. However, enhancing photothermal performance often entails reduced visible (VIS) light transmittance of films, thereby compromising solar cell efficiency. Tailoring optical designs to balance the optimal light absorption between the device and the film is essential for photovoltaic anti&#8208;icing/snow. Herein, we present outdoor data from grid&#8208;connected photovoltaic modules, revealing a 58% electricity loss caused by ice/snow shading effects. To address this, we developed transparent photothermal films featuring a moir&#233; light&#8208;trapping structure, achieving high VIS transmittance (&#8764;93.0%) and enhanced near&#8208;infrared absorption (&#8764;65.8%). We confirmed that the meter&#8208;scale photothermal film ensures that operational modules remain ice&#8208;free in &#8722;20 &#176;C outdoor conditions, and the ice&#8208;melting phase diagram indicates its effective anti&#8208;icing range down to &#8722;30 &#176;C under AM 1.5G, one&#8208;sun illumination. Day&#8208;night cycling tests on perovskite cells demonstrated sustained anti&#8208;icing performance, yielding a 7.5&#8208;fold increase in daily power output during winter conditions. The film's long&#8208;term stability and robust de&#8208;icing performance under weak&#8208;light scenarios demonstrate the its feasibility for extreme cold applications.

         <title>3D Printing&#8211;In Situ Curing of Soft Organogels Using Frontal Polymerizable Inks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A frontal polymerization&#8211;3D printing&#8211;in situ&#8208;curing strategy is developed to construct soft organogel materials with various architectures. The printed patterns are produced with high fidelity and integrity while saving energy.








Abstract
3D printing has gained immense recognition owing to its fascinating ability for rapid prototyping and customization. However, the current methods usually require post&#8208;processing (direct ink writing) or continuous energy input (stereolithography) for polymer gel curing. The former lowers the fidelity and integrity of the printed layers, whereas the latter suffers from high energy consumption. To address these issues, a frontal polymerization (FP)&#8211;3D printing&#8211;in situ&#8208;curing method is developed to construct printable and polymerizable inks for acrylate&#8208;based monomers and soft organogel materials. Once initiated, no external energy supply is required, which allows for real&#8208;time conversion of monomers into polymers within seconds. Thus, the energy requirements are reduced by several orders of magnitude. More importantly, the printed structure is closely bonded, effectively avoiding the collapse and deformation of soft materials. The as&#8208;printed organogel is used as an evaporator and achieves a high water&#8208;evaporation rate of 3.77&#160;kg m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1. This FP&#8211;3D printing&#8211;in situ&#8208;curing strategy is an alternative, energy&#8208;saving method for fabricating soft materials, enabling high fidelity and integrity of printed patterns with wide applicability.

         <title>Carbon Doped Boron Nitride Nano&#8208;Coatings for Durable, Low Emissivity Glass Windows</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room temperature carbon doped boron nitride nano&#8208;coated glass shows low&#8208;emissivity, excellent environmental stability and scratch protection, important for durable and energy&#8208;efficient low&#8208;E glass window technology.








Abstract
Energy&#8208;efficient, durable low&#8208;emissivity (low&#8208;E) glass windows are in demand for reducing energy consumption and comfortable living environments. However, commercial low&#8208;E coating materials are expensive, prone to abrasion, and hence coated only on the interior side of windows, limiting their energy efficiency. Here, a new material is introduced, namely chemically inert and transparent carbon (C) doped boron nitride (BN) nano&#8208;coatings on glass surfaces at room temperature using pulsed laser deposition, that shows promising long&#8208;wave infrared emissivity (&#949;LWIR &#8776;0.42). The hydrophilic C&#8208;BN coatings on glass show excellent environmental stability including high temperature&#8208;high humidity degradation resistance, UV&#8208;light, thermal cycling, freezing condition, and saltwater resilience. Furthermore, the coating shows promising adhesion on the glass surface with full scratch protection. In an actual&#8208;sized building energy simulation for cold&#8208;climates, the intended exterior&#8208;side C&#8208;BN coated low&#8208;E glass shows 2.9% energy savings compared to the interior&#8208;side coated commercial low&#8208;E glass. C&#8208;BN would be a useful coating material for durable and energy&#8208;efficient low&#8208;E glass window technology.

         <title>Biomimetic Mineralization Nucleation with Polymer Template Enabled High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells by Anti&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Free Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;solvent&#8208;free preparation craft of perovskite is expected to promote its scale&#8208;up production, however, the poor nucleation in this process constrains the quality of perovskite films. Here, a biomimetic mineralization strategy is employed that introduces a polymer template as a buried interfacial modification layer to enhance the performance and stability of the device. 








Abstract
Nucleation regulation in the perovskite film&#8208;forming process has been widely studied to optimize crystal quality and enable high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) by an anti&#8208;solvent&#8208;free method. However, the vertical nucleation process is often difficult to control in anti&#8208;solvent&#8208;free preparation, due to the heterogeneous metal ion distribution and subsequent non&#8208;uniform nucleation. Inspired by natural biomineralization mechanisms, this is pioneered that the introduction of a functional biopolymer carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) at the buried interface of the perovskite layer, which would promote homogeneous vertical nucleation. Furthermore, CMC can improve perovskite film quality, passivate interfacial defects, and mitigate residual stresses.

&lt;p&gt;Anti-solvent-free preparation craft of perovskite is expected to promote its scale-up production, however, the poor nucleation in this process constrains the quality of perovskite films. Here, a biomimetic mineralization strategy is employed that introduces a polymer template as a buried interfacial modification layer to enhance the performance and stability of the device. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nucleation regulation in the perovskite film-forming process has been widely studied to optimize crystal quality and enable high-efficiency perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) by an anti-solvent-free method. However, the vertical nucleation process is often difficult to control in anti-solvent-free preparation, due to the heterogeneous metal ion distribution and subsequent non-uniform nucleation. Inspired by natural biomineralization mechanisms, this is pioneered that the introduction of a functional biopolymer carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) at the buried interface of the perovskite layer, which would promote homogeneous vertical nucleation. Furthermore, CMC can improve perovskite film quality, passivate interfacial defects, and mitigate residual stresses. Finally, PVSCs with CMC prepared by anti-solvent-free method exhibit a remarkable PCE of 25.12%, ranking among the highest devices fabricated without anti-solvent, while also exhibiting significantly improved stability. Encouragingly, the large-area PVSCs (1&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) achieved an excellent PCE of 24%. This is believed that this work offers a robust strategy for optimizing anti-solvent-free fabrication processes for scalable and printable PVSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dielectric Aggregation&#8208;Mediated Dual&#8208;Band Robust Optical Performance for Low&#8208;Cost Radiative Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via a gravity&#8208;induced particle aggregation strategy, the distribution of merely 4 vol% packed dielectric silica in the porous skeleton is tuned to yield a decoupled spectral response spanning two orders of magnitude. This strategy allows for on&#8208;demand manufacture of other types of metamaterials and integrates robust weather resistance properties.








Abstract
Radiative cooling belongs to passively enhanced heat dissipation that reflects sunlight and emits infrared radiation. However, conflicting reflectivity and emissivity across the two bands present challenges to reach 95% performance simultaneously, while a few available photonic reports have shortcomings in terms of scalability and environmental stability. The decoupling optimization of scattering and absorption is demonstrated by modulating the aggregation state of merely 4 vol% dielectrics in the porous skeleton. It allows Mie scattering and resonant absorption to function in their respective bands, resulting in a double 95% optical performance. Such a broad spectral response enables high&#8208;throughput heat dissipation of 8&#160;&#176;C and supports subambient cooling of 5&#160;&#176;C outdoors. This one&#8208;step strategy extends to the manufacture of a range of metamaterials as required for strength, heat resistance, and degradation, combined with robust environmental stability, including resistance to fouling and peeling.

         <title>A Tri&#8208;Mode Photothermal, Phase&#8208;Change, and Radiative&#8208;Cooling Film for All&#8208;Day Thermoelectric Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microencapsulated phase change materials (MPCMs) with Ti2O3/TiO2 composite shells are designed for LSPR modulation. MPCMs have full&#8208;spectrum absorption, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and thermal storage capacity. Based on MPCMs, a multifunctional tri&#8208;mode photothermal, phase&#8208;change, and radiative&#8208;cooling film is developed for efficient solar&#8208;thermal&#8208;electric (STE) energy conversion. The MPCMs and composite films provide a promising strategy for solar energy utilization and advanced STE conversion applications.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;thermal&#8208;electric conversion shows great promise, especially in off&#8208;grid aerospace and navigation. However, low output density and intermittency of solar energy limit its application. Herein, a microencapsulated phase change material (MPCMs) is designed with a n&#8208;Tetracosane core and TiO2/Ti2O3 composite shell to address the above issue. The MPCM exhibits a latent heat of 144.5 J&#160;g&#8722;1, a photothermal conversion efficiency of 93.7% and 100% energy storage capacity. The thermoelectric system resulting from coupling the multifunctional film composed of polydimethylsiloxane and MPCMs with the thermoelectric module is capable of successfully achieving adaptive 24&#160;h uninterrupted power generation on account of its functions of photothermal conversion, energy storage, and radiative cooling. The output power density of the TES ranged from 6.1 to 21.1&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 at light intensities of 1000&#8211;5000&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2. The material design innovatively endows a single material with the functions of photothermal conversion, phase change energy storage, and radiative cooling, making it can adaptively harvest energy from both the sun and cold space. This multifunctional material offers new insights into the repeatable storage and high&#8208;quality utilization of solar energy, holding significant scientific implications for the development of all&#8208;day solar&#8208;thermal&#8208;electric power generation technology.

         <title>Remote&#8208;Controlled Magnetic Stimulation of Cell&#8208;Based Bioengineered Tissues for In Situ Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic nanoparticles and magnetic fields enable the construction of 3D tissues from individual cells and their stimulation, activating signaling pathways that influence tissue function. Herein, cyclic magnetic fields induce mechanical perturbations in magnetically responsive tissue implants, promoting osteodifferentiation of human adipose&#8208;derived stem cells without biochemical supplementation, enhancing implant integration in vivo, highlighting potential for minimally invasive bone repair strategies.








Abstract
The native cell microenvironment activates signaling pathways through mechanotransduction mechanisms, influencing cells&#8217; physiological and functional outcomes. Magnetic fields are explored to manipulate these environments, and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are highlighted as nano&#8208;instructive agents capable of activating key signaling pathways, presenting exciting possibilities in tissue engineering. Still, the ability to precisely control the assembly and differentiation of stem cells within a dynamically responsive microenvironment, crucial for effective tissue regeneration, remains unexplored. This study showcases a novel method wherein MNPs facilitate the precise assembly of magnetically responsive cells into complex 3D tissue structures upon internalization and exposure to temporally defined cyclic magnetic fields. By remotely stimulating these constructs, it is demonstrated for the first time the possibility of remote&#8208;controlled modulation of stem cell fate in vivo without biochemical supplementation. Notably, this approach led to ectopic bone formation, highlighting the ability of magnetic actuation to drive osteogenesis in non&#8208;bone environments. MNP&#8208;driven mechanical stimulation of implanted tissues functions as a bioresponsive system guiding osteogenic differentiation of human adipose&#8208;derived stem cells. The in vivo model further illustrates accelerated construct integration, enhanced osteogenic differentiation, and minimal local inflammation, underscoring the potential of this less invasive, remotely controllable platform to advance regenerative strategies for bone engineering.

         <title>Scalable Production of 24&#8208;Hour&#8208;Long Afterglow Plastics Through Molecular Doping Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
24&#8208;H&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) plastics are fabricated at a large scale through a molecular doping strategy compatible with industrial engineering processes. The resulting doped plastics demonstrated green afterglow persisting for 24 h under ambient conditions, setting a new benchmark for polymeric materials. Remarkably, these materials can be activated by natural sunlight, highlighting their practical utility for engineering applications.








Abstract
The development of polymeric afterglow materials has garnered significant interest due to their promising applications in sensing technologies, smart devices, and optoelectronic systems. However, conventional engineering plastics typically exhibit limited afterglow properties owing to rapid nonradiative decay processes under ambient conditions. This study presents a breakthrough in the fabrication of plastics with 24&#8208;h&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) properties through a molecular doping strategy compatible with industrial engineering processes. By utilizing aromatic plastics as electron acceptor and the matrix, spirofluorene derivatives are incorporated as electron donors and chromophore dopants via a melt blending technique, a widely established method in polymer manufacturing. The resulting doped plastics demonstrated green afterglow persisting for 24 h under ambient conditions. At 4&#160;&#176;C, the HLA lasted for up to 100 h after ceasing photoexcitation, setting a new benchmark for polymeric materials. Remarkably, these materials could be activated by natural sunlight and maintain a visible green afterglow for 5 h in ambient air. Mechanism studies revealed that the HLA phenomenon is associated with the formation of donor/acceptor exciplexes upon photoexcitation. Additionally, the HLA plastics exhibited exceptional mechanical flexibility and optical transparency, making them highly suitable for advanced applications in flexible displays and next&#8208;generation wearable technologies.

This work has developed a dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking and ultrasound&#8208;responsive Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG nanozyme. ROS&#8208;eliminating and anti&#173;inflammatory capability of Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG under US irradiation are demonstrated on macrophages and endothelial cells in vitro. Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG&#8208;mediated sonocatalytic therapy exerts an outstanding anti&#8208;atherosclerosis efficacy by regulating intraplaque redox homeostasis, contributing to lesional shrinkage and a more stable plaque phenotype in plaque&#8208;bearing mice.








Abstract
Atherosclerosis is an oxidative stress&#8208;induced chronic inflammatory condition underpinning the progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), ultimately resulting in leading mortality rate globally. Ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered catalysis offers localized treatment for deep&#8208;seated plaques effectively and safely, with demand for targeted delivery and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties of sonosensitizers. 2D MXene&#8208;based nanomedicine is garnering attention because of their intriguing catalytic properties of scavenging excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), yet MXene&#8208;assisted sonocatalytic therapy (SCT) for treating CVDs remains scarce. Here, this study reports a dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking and US&#8208;responsive MXene termed Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG for alleviating atherosclerosis. US irradiation enhances the capability of Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG nanozymes in eliminating broad&#8208;spectrum ROS and resolving vascular inflammation. Besides, actively targeting lesional macrophages improves their systemic delivery to plaque and further boosts anti&#8208;atherosclerotic efficacy, contributing to &#8776;30% plaque size reduction and a more stabilized plaque phenotype. Notably, etching without hydrofluoric acid renders this nanozyme highly biocompatible. In long&#8208;term biosafety studies, Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG is pronouncedly cleared from major organs and no severe changes of liver and kidney functions are observed. Consequently, this work demonstrates that Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG&#8208;mediated SCT effectively ameliorates advanced atherosclerosis without inducing severe cytotoxicity, offering promising translational potential of MXene&#8208;based nanomedicine. Besides, it broadens application prospects of MXenes to the biomedical field of treating CVDs.

         <title>Ionically Conductive Elastic Polymer Binder for Ultrahigh Loading Electrode in High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionically conductive elastic polymer (ICEP) binder is introduced for fabricating ultrahigh mass&#8208;loading NCM811 cathodes, offering enhanced elasticity, adhesion, and ionic conductivity for improved structural and interfacial stability. The ICEP&#8208;based ultrahigh loading cathode delivers 377.6&#160;Wh&#160;kgcell&#8722;1/1016.8&#160;Wh&#160;Lcell&#8722;1 (including packaging) when paired with Li metal anodes, demonstrating excellent electrochemical stability.








Abstract
Despite the increasing demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries, the development of high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading electrodes remains challenged by structural instability and poor charge transfer. Herein, an ionically conductive elastic polymer (ICEP) binder, designed to enable the fabrication of ultrahigh mass&#8208;loading Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, NCM811), is introduced. The ICEP binder integrates mechanical elasticity, strong adhesion, and ionic conductivity through diverse functional groups, addressing challenges in high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading electrode fabrication. Hydrogen bonding between the ICEP binder and NCM811 particles ensures uniform electrode morphology, forming a stable cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI). This stable interface mitigates surface side reactions, suppresses phase transitions in NCM811, and improves long&#8208;term electrochemical stability. Additionally, the ICEP binder enhances Li&#8208;ion diffusivity, reduces interphase resistance, and promotes faster electrochemical kinetics, while preventing solvent&#8208;drying&#8208;induced cracking. As a result, high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading electrodes (62.4&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8315;2, 12.5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8315;2) are successfully fabricated with the ICEP binder and demonstrate 94.6% capacity retention. Furthermore, a double&#8208;stacked pouch&#8208;type lithium metal full cell incorporating ICEP&#8208;based cathodes achieves energy densities of 377.6&#160;Wh&#160;kgcell&#8315;1 and 1016.8&#160;Wh&#160;Lcell&#8315;1 (including package materials), setting new benchmarks for lithium metal batteries. These findings establish ICEP as a highly effective binder for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, offering a scalable and commercially viable solution for ultrahigh&#8208;loading cathodes.

         <title>Towards Differentiation in Untethered Microactuators: A Soft Fabrication Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces a fabrication strategy for developing soft microactuators with orthogonally programmed shape, texture, and molecular anisotropy. Using microfluidics to generate liquid crystal droplets encased in hydrogel fibers enables the shaping of droplets into various geometries, which are then magnetically aligned and polymerized to give rise to a diverse library of soft microactuators.








Abstract
This work describes a microfluidic high&#8208;throughput fabrication method for untethered soft microactuators which, while initially unspecific, develop distinct shapes, surface textures, and actuation modes based on various environmental cues. Analogous to the core concept of cell differentiation, the central idea of this technique is to apply controlled mechanical and chemical stimuli to a deformable hydrogel fiber and transmit the induced geometrical and textural changes to embedded droplets. Using liquid crystal (LC) monomer droplets as a core allows&#160;us to orthogonally program the geometric, textural, and molecular architecture of the resulting microactuators upon droplet polymerization. Fine&#8208;tuning of the microfluidic parameters yields microdroplets that dry and transform into microparticles with a variety of shapes, including spindle, rod, pancake, dumbbell, pyramid, and worm&#8208;like assemblies with a range of aspect ratios. Leveraging mechanical instability via rapid dehydration of hydrogel fibers allows us to generate and impart stable 3D patterns to the core, resulting in microparticles that vary both in global shape and surface texture. After polymerizing these precursor droplets in a magnetic field to encode the mesogenic orientation, LCE microactuators are realized with a rich library of shapes, surface patterns, and molecular structures, each displaying distinct deformations upon heating, validated via finite element analysis.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Enhancing Triboelectric Nanogenerator Based on Antioxidant Liquid Crystalline Polyarylate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;temperature enhancing triboelectric nanogenerator (HTE&#8208;TENG) based on antioxidant liquid crystalline polyarylate (LCP), the highly rigid main chain of which endows TENG with excellent heat resistance. The resultant HTE&#8208;TENG provides a sustainable route for reliable energy devices and electronics to save lives in potential applications, such as rescue work, personal protection, and extreme environments.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a prospective energy harvesting technology, especially polymer&#8208;based TENG has achieved remarkable achievements. However, most polymer&#8208;based triboelectric layers suffer serious structural degradation and rapid decrease of charge density at high temperatures, which severely lowers the power supply capacity of TENG and definitely limits their applications in extreme environments. Herein, the antioxidants are introduced into liquid crystalline polyarylate (LCP) to fabricate thermally stable TENG and enhance its thermal oxidation resistance. The peak voltage of the resultant TENG is boosted to 73.6 V at 200&#160;&#176;C, which is 144.1% higher than the value at 25&#160;&#176;C, indicating the remarkably high&#8208;temperature enhancing effect on electrical output performance. Meanwhile, the high&#8208;temperature enhancing TENG (HTE&#8208;TENG) exhibited a peak output electrical power density of 1071.3 mW&#183;m&#8722;2 under a 109 &#937; load. This work provides a sustainable route for reliable energy devices and electronics to serve in potential applications, such as rescue work, personal protection, and extreme environments.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Elastomer with High Luminescent and Mechanical Performances Enabled by Multiple Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent elastomer is prepared by incorporating ureide phosphorescent chromophore into hard segments of polyurethane. Due to the multiple hydrogen bonding and microphase separation, the elastomer exhibits robust luminescent and mechanical properties. It is expected to find applications in flexible electronics and information storage.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent elastomer is promising for flexible electronics. However, preparation of such elastomer with high luminescent and mechanical performances remains a challenge. In this study, a room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) elastomer is prepared by incorporating ureides as luminophores into hard segments of polyurethane forming multiple hydrogen bonds. Upon ultraviolet activation, the RTP elastomer shows a recorded absolute quantum yield of 72.1% and a phosphorescence lifetime of 1079&#160;ms. It also has high mechanical properties with reprocessability. Its tensile strength and elongation at break as high as 58.3&#160;MPa and 1160%, respectively, and its toughness reaches 299.9&#160;MJ m&#8722;3. Particularly, it withstands extreme strain of 1100% or 100 cycles of elongation recovery without any change in luminescent properties. The microphase separation structure with multiple hydrogen bonded hard segment phase is thought to be responsible for its high performances. Given its robust phosphorescence efficiency alongside exceptional toughness, this RTP elastomer holds promise for innovative applications in flexible electronics, information encryption, and data storage.

&lt;p&gt;A room-temperature phosphorescent elastomer is prepared by incorporating ureide phosphorescent chromophore into hard segments of polyurethane. Due to the multiple hydrogen bonding and microphase separation, the elastomer exhibits robust luminescent and mechanical properties. It is expected to find applications in flexible electronics and information storage.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room-temperature phosphorescent elastomer is promising for flexible electronics. However, preparation of such elastomer with high luminescent and mechanical performances remains a challenge. In this study, a room-temperature phosphorescent (RTP) elastomer is prepared by incorporating ureides as luminophores into hard segments of polyurethane forming multiple hydrogen bonds. Upon ultraviolet activation, the RTP elastomer shows a recorded absolute quantum yield of 72.1% and a phosphorescence lifetime of 1079&#160;ms. It also has high mechanical properties with reprocessability. Its tensile strength and elongation at break as high as 58.3&#160;MPa and 1160%, respectively, and its toughness reaches 299.9&#160;MJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Particularly, it withstands extreme strain of 1100% or 100 cycles of elongation recovery without any change in luminescent properties. The microphase separation structure with multiple hydrogen bonded hard segment phase is thought to be responsible for its high performances. Given its robust phosphorescence efficiency alongside exceptional toughness, this RTP elastomer holds promise for innovative applications in flexible electronics, information encryption, and data storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enabling Photostable Perovskite Solar Cells via Sustainable Operando Defect&#8208;Passivation Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochromic spiro&#8208;oxazine enables sustainable operando passivation via dual&#8208;mode isomerization, achieving 24.72% efficiency in small&#8208;area perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and 19.07% in 61.6&#160;cm2 modules with exceptional light/UV stability.








Abstract
The amount of passivator is usually optimized for freshly prepared devices, which is static and short&#8208;term. However, photoinduced defects and the movement of halogen ions are dynamically generated in real time. Long&#8208;term operational passivation, designed to address the dynamic characteristics of defect generation, is largely overlooked but is critically important. In this work, a classical photochromic compound, Spiro&#8208;oxazine (SO), is introduced to develop a sustainable operando passivation strategy. The two configurations of this isomer fulfill different requirements: the normal form addresses the needs of freshly prepared devices with fewer defect passivation requirements, while the post&#8208;isomeric form in situ operando captures light&#8208;induced defects during operation, enabling sustainable passivation. As a result, the perovskite solar cell (PSC) fabricated using this operando strategy achieved an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.72%, with an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.215&#160;V, and demonstrated remarkable stability, retaining 82% of its initial PCE after 1580 h under simulated sunlight and 80% after 144 h under UV light. Large&#8208;area PSC modules fabricated using the proposed strategy achieved a PCE of 19.07% over an active area of 61.6 cm2. This work provides valuable guidance for designing self&#8208;healing perovskite films and highlights the urgent need for improved passivation durability.

         <title>A Dendritic Cell&#8208;Nanogel Conjugate for Tumor&#8208;Draining Lymph Node&#8208;Specific PD&#8208;L1 Blockade</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based strategy for the targeted delivery of ICB antibodies to tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). The platform is fabricated by conjugating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody nanogels with tumor antigen&#8208;pulsed DCs. Subcutaneous administration of the platform enables TDLN&#8208;tropic migration and antibody release under reductive conditions. The platform mobilizes T cell immunity while blocking PD&#8208;L1 on DCs and myeloid cells within TDLNs, augmenting systemic antitumor immunity to suppress tumor growth. This study presents a novel strategy for TDLN&#8208;targeted PD&#8208;L1 blockade, unveiling new translational opportunities of combining DC&#8208;based vaccination with ICB therapy.








Abstract
Targeted blockade of immune checkpoints within tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) represents a promising strategy to potentiate immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. However, the limited delivery of checkpoint inhibitors to TDLNs and inadequate T cell priming persist as major challenges. In this study, an innovative dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based strategy is developed for the targeted delivery of ICB antibodies to TDLNs. The platform is fabricated by conjugating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody nanogels with DCs, which are further enhanced by pre&#8208;treating DCs with tumor antigens. Subcutaneous administration enabled DCs to execute their intrinsic TDLN&#8208;tropic migration, thus facilitating antibody delivery and release under reductive conditions. The antigen&#8208;loaded DCs mobilized T cell immunity, while the anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibodies block PD&#8208;L1 on dendritic cells and myeloid cells within TDLNs, thereby augmenting systemic antitumor immunity. This approach significantly suppresses breast cancer growth, leading to 83.3% of treated mice being tumor&#8208;free. This study presents a novel strategy for TDLN&#8208;targeted PD&#8208;L1 blockade by harnessing the intrinsic TDLN tropism of DCs, unveiling new translational opportunities of combining DC&#8208;based vaccination with ICB therapy.

         <title>Revealing the Catalysis Modes for Sulfur Conversion Kinetics in Molten Salt Aluminum&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) loaded with various metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is constructed as a sulfur host for molten salt Al&#8208;S batteries, and the effects of different SACs on the reaction kinetics of the sulfur positive electrodes are examined. Based on strong anchoring of polysulfides and regulation of the conversion rate kinetics at different stages, the CoNC@S positive electrode achieves stable cycling up to 6000 cycles.








Abstract
Molten salt aluminum&#8208;sulfur (MSAS) batteries operated at a sub&#8208;water&#8208;boiling temperature are attractive for large&#8208;scale energy storage because of the low costs along with moderate energy density. However, the sulfur positive electrode is plagued by the sluggish reaction kinetics of polysulfides, which hampers the rate and cycling performance. Herein, carbon materials integrated with single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are utilized as the model sulfur hosts for MSAS batteries and comprehensively investigate the active modes of these SACs on cell performance. Results show that the cell utilizing cobalt&#8208;SACs shows an initial specific capacity of 1064&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.5C, retaining 88.5% capacity after 100 cycles. Even at 3C, the cell achieves a specific capacity of 533&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 and demonstrates record&#8208;long cycle performance with an ultralow capacity decay rate of only 0.0014% per cycle over 6000 cycles. By combining theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations, a new mechanism is undercovered wherein &#8211; owed to differentiated binding toward varied Al&#8208;polysulfides &#8211; the cobalt&#8208;SAC tunes down the conversion of long&#8208;chain to short&#8208;chain polysulfides while accelerating that from short&#8208;chain polysulfides to solid Al2S3. This mechanism alleviates polysulfide accumulation in the molten salt electrolyte, mitigates the shuttle effect, and enhances the overall sulfur reaction kinetics.

         <title>Rare&#8208;Earth Ion Intercalation in Graphene via Thermal and Electrostatic Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Europium ions reversibly intercalate into the van der Waals gap of bilayer graphene when heat and electrostatic gate act together, switching the stacking order and electronic response on demand. Real&#8208;time transport, simulations, and device tests expose a hidden 2D Eu sheet and its temperature&#8208;tuned diffusion, showing a versatile electrochemical route toward reconfigurable 2D heterostructures with rare&#8208;earth functionality.








Abstract
Atomic&#8208;scale control and understanding the controlling strategy of ion intercalation are pivotal for advancing energy storage, quantum technologies, and adaptive electronics. While intercalation &#8211; the insertion of ions into layered materials &#8211; has transformative potential, the mechanisms driving it, particularly for rare&#8208;earth ions, remain poorly understood. Here, a thermal&#8208;electrostatic strategy is developed to achieve reversible and tunable europium ion intercalation that enables precise control over intercalation dynamics. This study investigates how temperature and voltage influence the intercalation of europium ions into bilayer graphene. Our results reveal the formation of a 2D europium layer and ionic state of intercalation europium within the graphene structure, providing fundamental insights into intercalation energetics. This work establishes a versatile platform for designing adaptive 2D heterostructure, engineering advanced materials and devices with unique electronic and optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Breaking the Selectivity Barrier of Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes Through Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Ligand Coordination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, Ru SAzyme with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane chlorine ligands is reported as a monofunctional, high&#8208;performance peroxidase&#8208;like nanozyme. Incorporating out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ligand coordination emulates enzyme selectivity and regulates reaction pathways for an identical substrate. The optimized Ru SAzyme exhibits exceptional peroxidase&#8208;selective activity (38&#8208;fold higher than its catalase&#8208;like activity) and demonstrates practical applicability for simultaneous biomarker quantification under near&#8208;neutral conditions.








Abstract
Peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like nanozymes have emerged as effective alternatives to natural enzymes owing to their stability and cost&#8208;effectiveness in biosensors. In particular, single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) featuring Fe&#8211;N4 active sites have attracted significant attention for their high catalytic performance. However, their 2D exposed active sites result in limited reaction selectivity and strong pH dependence, restricting their functionality under neutral conditions. This study introduces Ru&#8208;centered SAzymes coordinated out&#8208;of&#8208;plane with chlorine ligands (RuNC_Cl), achieving monofunctional POD&#8208;like activity. RuNC_Cl exhibited remarkable POD&#8208;like activity, which is 38&#8208;fold greater than its catalase (CAT)&#8208;like activity, indicating strong suppression of the competing CAT&#8208;like reaction. Density functional theory calculations and Bader charge analysis of RuNC_Cl reveal that repulsive forces preventing secondary H2O2 adsorption contribute to an increased energy barrier for the CAT&#8208;like reaction. This selective POD&#8208;like activity enables the precise detection of multiple biomarkers through a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction under near&#8208;neutral conditions. This advancement paves the way for the precise regulation of reaction pathways, enhancing the practicality of nanozymes for biosensing and related applications.

         <title>Multifunctional Hollow Carbon Microspheres Enable Superior Electromagnetic Wave Response and Corrosion Barrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow carbon microspheres with superior EM wave absorption and anti&#8208;corrosion capability have been produced. As results, a minimum reflection loss of &#8722;57.5 dB and an absorption bandwidth of 5.67 GHz are achieved. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that dual passivation effects provide a barrier to hinder the access of corrosive species to the substrate surface.








Abstract
Electromagnetic (EM) wave absorbing materials with corrosion barrier exhibit immense potential in meeting the requirements of electronic defense technology in the complex marine environments, but still confront conflicts in disentangling the trade&#8208;off of multifunctional applications. Herein, hollow carbon microspheres (HCMs) that simultaneously possess superior EM wave absorption and anti&#8208;corrosion capability have been produced with the aid of self&#8208;sacrificing templates. During the pyrolysis, the reductive characteristic of Zn microspheres and thermal driving force promote magnetic domain evolution, which enables optimized hetero&#8208;interface resonance and strong magnetic interactions, facilitating a minimum reflection loss lower than &#8722;40 dB and a wide absorption bandwidth greater than 5 GHz. Furthermore, HCMs&#8208;900 with both anion&#8208;repulsion characteristics and better resistance can partially reduce the adsorption/accumulation of corrosive species and decrease the charge&#8208;carrying ability, and the inevitably generated by&#8208;products of layered double hydroxides with strong anion&#8208;capture ability can hinder the access of corrosive species to the substrate surface, resulting in superior anti&#8208;corrosion capability. This innovative strategy inspires us with a motivated pathway for the rational design of advanced multifunctional anti&#8208;corrosive EM absorbing materials.

         <title>Van Der Waals Integration of 4&#8208;Inch Single&#8208;Crystalline III&#8208;Nitride Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polarization&#8208;engineered van der Waals (vdW) integration facilitates the growth of 4&#8208;inch single&#8208;crystalline GaN, revealing polarization&#8208;regulated vdW gaps and substantially reduced dislocation densities. This method achieves an exceptionally low dislocation density, thereby enabling the fabrication of high&#8208;performance HEMTs with enhanced saturation current density and effectively mitigating off&#8208;state leakage current.








Abstract
Heteroepitaxy III&#8208;nitride semiconductors on 2D materials, characterized by a van der Waals (vdW) interface, enables strain relaxation, reduction in dislocation density, and facile release from substrate. However, the limited wettability of 2D materials and weak interfacial interactions pose significant challenges in achieving ordered crystallographic orientation of III&#8208;nitride semiconductors at the wafer scale. Here, this study has been successfully developed a polarization&#8208;engineered vdW integration strategy (PEVIS) for the growth of wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystalline III&#8208;nitride semiconductors. By engineering robust electronic polarization in epitaxial substrates, the growth of 4&#8208;inch single&#8208;crystalline GaN layers is successfully achieved on wafers coated with 2D materials using PEVIS. Additionally, this approach exhibits a remarkably low threading dislocations density of 3.49&#160;&#215;&#160;108 cm&#8722;2 on the vdW surface, even when the GaN epitaxial layer thickness is reduced to 400&#160;nm. Furthermore, the fabricated GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) achieve an average high mobility of 2080.7 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, a high saturation current density of 790&#160;mA&#160;mm&#8722;1, and effectively mitigates the off&#8208;state leakage current to 1.11 &#215; 10&#8722;6&#160;mA&#160;mm&#8722;1. This work signifies a significant advancement in the theoretical comprehension of heteroepitaxy on 2D materials and introduces a novel methodology for fabricating wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystalline high&#8208;quality III&#8208;nitride semiconductors.

The optimal device achieves a remarkable PCE of 17.76%, ranking among the highest PCE values reported so far in ASM&#8208;OSCs.








Abstract
All&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs) hold great potential for commercialization owing to their well&#8208;defined molecular structures and minimal batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variations. Nevertheless, the inherent challenges in precise control of blend morphology of the active layer restrict exciton utilization efficiency, resulting in the restricted power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in ASM&#8208;OSC compared with polymer&#8208;based OSCs. Herein, small molecule donor Por&#8208;BR is incorporated into the acceptor layer of the DAPor&#8208;DPP/6TIC system utilizing a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) deposition strategy to construct high&#8208;performance ASM&#8208;OSCs. The LbL deposition strategy facilitates the formation of a more pronounced vertical phase distribution in the active layer. Besides, dual&#8208;channel FRET from Por&#8208;BR to both DAPor&#8208;DPP and 6TIC occurs in the active layer. Benefiting from the combined advantages of the LbL deposition strategy and dual&#8208;channel FRET, a broader spatial distribution of exciton generation sites is achieved, accompanied by significantly improved exciton utilization efficiency, enhanced carrier mobility, and reduced charge recombination. The optimal device delivers a remarkable PCE of 17.76%, representing one of the highest PCE values reported so far in ASM&#8208;OSCs. This work offers an effective strategy for device performance enhancement, which in turn facilitates the industrialization of OSCs.

         <title>Textile Encoding Inspired by Langer Lines via Elastically Graded Embroidered Tessellations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A standard embroidery machine can encode skin&#8208;like directional mechanics into stretchable fabrics that, when worn, augment the wearer's skin. Zigzag stitch patterns, inspired by skin collagen structure, pack extra slack in threads that, when tessellated, mimic Langer lines. Pneumatic fingers with multiple bending modes and feet&#8208;conforming footwear, designed using intuitive color coding, illustrate uses in robotics.








Abstract
Morphological anisotropies and nonlinear mechanical properties shape the kinematic agility of organisms and engineered structures. Tissues, such as skin, act as biological metamaterials whose internal structures, such as packed collagen fibers, produce nonlinear and directional responses. Similarly, hierarchical thread packing governs the mechanical response of textiles. However, the capability of encoding textiles at the fabric level and at a sufficient resolution remains limited. Embroidering triangularly tiled zigzag patterns of inextensible thread on a stretchable fabric is demonstrated to encode distributed, directional stress&#8211;strain behavior at subcentimeter resolution, sufficient to mimic complex physiological characteristics such as Langer lines of the skin. The triangular unit cells solved the K&#246;nigsberg bridge problem of filling a plane with a continuous thread pair. The encoding maps directionality, directional contrast, and magnitude, three parameters that define unit cells' compliance, into hue&#8208;saturation&#8208;value color space for rapid qualitative design. Cross&#8208;talk&#8208;free arrays of embroidered restrictors enable scalable augmentation of textile mechanics. The transition threshold from the matrix&#8208; to fiber&#8208;defined behavior is achieved with 85% fidelity, enabling customizable shape&#8208;morphing structures such as restrictor bladder actuators and feet&#8208;conforming shoes. Industry&#8208;standard machine embroidery scales biomechanics&#8208;inspired structures for wearable and environmental robotics and promises future biohybrid&#160;technologies.

&lt;p&gt;A standard embroidery machine can encode skin-like directional mechanics into stretchable fabrics that, when worn, augment the wearer's skin. Zigzag stitch patterns, inspired by skin collagen structure, pack extra slack in threads that, when tessellated, mimic Langer lines. Pneumatic fingers with multiple bending modes and feet-conforming footwear, designed using intuitive color coding, illustrate uses in robotics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morphological anisotropies and nonlinear mechanical properties shape the kinematic agility of organisms and engineered structures. Tissues, such as skin, act as biological metamaterials whose internal structures, such as packed collagen fibers, produce nonlinear and directional responses. Similarly, hierarchical thread packing governs the mechanical response of textiles. However, the capability of encoding textiles at the fabric level and at a sufficient resolution remains limited. Embroidering triangularly tiled zigzag patterns of inextensible thread on a stretchable fabric is demonstrated to encode distributed, directional stress&#8211;strain behavior at subcentimeter resolution, sufficient to mimic complex physiological characteristics such as Langer lines of the skin. The triangular unit cells solved the K&#246;nigsberg bridge problem of filling a plane with a continuous thread pair. The encoding maps directionality, directional contrast, and magnitude, three parameters that define unit cells' compliance, into hue-saturation-value color space for rapid qualitative design. Cross-talk-free arrays of embroidered restrictors enable scalable augmentation of textile mechanics. The transition threshold from the matrix- to fiber-defined behavior is achieved with 85% fidelity, enabling customizable shape-morphing structures such as restrictor bladder actuators and feet-conforming shoes. Industry-standard machine embroidery scales biomechanics-inspired structures for wearable and environmental robotics and promises future biohybrid&#160;technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Evolution in Hard Carbon Synthesis via Electrothermal Coupling Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional hard carbon synthesis suffers from structural degradation like amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;graphitic transitions and pore collapse due to prolonged sintering, impairing sodium storage. Researchers report an ultrafast (30&#8208;s) electrothermal coupling strategy using joule heating for carbonization, effectively preventing this structural damage. This method preserves abundant micropores and expanded interlayer spacing, leading to superior sodium storage performance.








Abstract
Conventional hard carbon synthesis through prolonged sintering suffers from structural degradation, including amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;graphitic transitions and pore collapse, critically impairing sodium storage performance. Here, a spatiotemporally controlled electrothermal coupling strategy is proposed that revolutionizes carbonization via in situ joule heating, achieving ultrafast synthesis (30 s) with preserved structural integrity. By precisely regulating current density distribution, this method enables defect&#8208;selective graphitization while maintaining abundant micropores and expanded interlayer spacing (0.39 nm). The optimized hard carbon synthesized at 1000&#160;&#176;C demonstrates exceptional sodium storage capacity (306.83 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) and record&#8208;high initial Coulombic efficiency (91.99%), outperforming furnace sample by 16.7% in capacity. During the spatiotemporal evolution process, localized electric field can induce directional charge redistribution and lower C&#9472;C bond dissociation barriers, enabling rapid formation of microporous structure with enhanced Na&#8314; diffusion kinetics and stable interfacial properties. Temporal superiority of this method is evidenced by 79.45% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. This work establishes a paradigm for energy&#8208;efficient carbon material synthesis via spatiotemporal electrothermal control, providing fundamental insights into field&#8208;assisted reaction kinetics for next&#8208;generation battery manufacturing.

         <title>Bioinspired Flame&#8208;Retardant and Impact&#8208;Resistant Aramid Composites via Nacre&#8208;Mimetic Self&#8208;Assembly for Firefighting Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nacre&#8208;mimetic shear&#8208;stiffening aramid composites, featuring both rigidity and flexibility through interfacial hydrogen bonding and internal boron&#8208;oxygen bonding, are developed using a bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly strategy. The strength and modulus of the composite after combustion are 4006% and 2519% higher than those of shear&#8208;stiffening&#8208;gel&#8208;based Kevlar, respectively, highlighting its mechanical&#8208;thermal coupling protection. Consequently, composite&#8208;based firefighter uniforms absorbing 190.04&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1 ballistic impacts are designed.








Abstract
Frequent fire accidents pose serious threats to firefighter security, necessitating progressively stringent demands on the performance of protective materials for firefighting clothing. This work proposes an advanced nacre&#8208;mimetic shear&#8208;stiffening gel (SSG)&#8208;magnesium hydroxide (MH) coating engineered aramid Kevlar composite, which exhibits exceptional anti&#8208;impact and flame&#8208;retardant properties. The SSG&#8208;MH&#8208;Kevlar (SMK) composite is fabricated via a facile vacuum&#8208;assisted evaporation&#8208;induced cross&#8208;linking method, facilitating the self&#8208;assembly of SMK into a highly oriented and long&#8208;range lamellar structure. The hydrogen bonding and dynamic boron&#8208;oxygen crosslinking further enhance the interface interaction, thereby contributing to extraordinary mechanical properties superior to many commercially available fabrics. After combustion, SMK composite maintains its outstanding thermal and mechanical properties, demonstrating a 46% reduction in thermal radiation temperature and a 4006% increase in tensile strength compared to the unmodified SSG&#8208;Kevlar (SK) fabric. Post&#8208;fire SMK composite can withstand projectile impacts, maintaining shape integrity upon the 100&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1 loading, whereas both Kevlar and SK composites are penetrated. Ultimately, an SMK&#8208;integrated firefighter uniform is manufactured, providing desirable defense efficiency during continuous 1&#8208;h burning and blast impact excitations. Furthermore, SMK cloth demonstrates exceptional thermal protection and stability in accordance with the GA10&#8208;2014 standard, outperforming conventional commercial firefighting uniforms.

         <title>Rational Molecular Design of &#960;&#8208;Extended Thiazolothiazole for High&#8208;Performance UV&#8208;OPDs Seamlessly Integrated with CMOS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance, semi&#8208;transparent UV&#8208;selective photodiodes are developed by elucidating how the backbone planarity and conjugation length of Tz molecules influence film morphology and charge transport within the device. These vacuum&#8208;deposited organic photodetectors are monolithically integrated with CMOS image sensors, showcasing multifunctional imaging capabilities and advancing the commercialization of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based photodetectors.








Abstract
Vacuum&#8208;deposited organic photodiodes (OPDs) offer unique advantages&#8212;including narrowband selectivity and compatibility with standard fabrication processes&#8212;but achieving ultraviolet (UV) selectivity in such devices remains a key challenge. This is due to the need to reconcile two competing design requirements: 1) strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking for efficient charge transport, and 2) limited &#960;&#8208;conjugation to retain a wide bandgap suitable for UV absorption and vacuum deposition. Here, we report a molecular design strategy for UV&#8208;selective OPDs based on thiazolothiazole (Tz)&#8208;based small molecules with tailored backbone planarity and conjugation length. The resulting vacuum&#8208;deposited active layers simultaneously exhibit wide bandgaps and robust &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. The optimized devices achieve outstanding UV selectivity (full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum: 60 nm), high specific detectivity (1.06 &#215; 1012 Jones), and fast dynamic response (cutoff frequency of 50,100 Hz)&#8212;representing the highest performance for vacuum&#8208;deposited UV&#8208;OPDs reported to date. Furthermore, it is demonstrated the seamless integration of these semi&#8208;transparent OPDs with complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors (CIS), underscoring their potential for multifunctional imaging applications. The findings provide key molecular insights for advancing UV&#8208;selective organic photodetectors.

         <title>Carbon Quantum Dots Assisted Virus Tracking: From Skin to Brain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel carbon quantum dots&#8208;dissolvable microneedle, CQDs&#8208;dMN system, enables painless delivery and real&#8208;time tracking of HSV&#8208;1. The HSV&#8208;1 is labeled with fluorescent CQDs and delivered to the skin dermis, minimizing damage compared to traditional methods. Real&#8208;time imaging shows that the dMN swells with interstitial fluid, releasing HSV&#8208;1, which rapidly infects peripheral nerves and spreads from the spinal cord to brain.








Abstract
Incurable infection by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV&#8208;1) can cause severe encephalitis and neurodegenerative diseases, e.g., Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. How HSV&#8208;1 reaches the brain from the initial infection site remains inconclusive. Here, an innovative approach combining carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with dissolving microneedles (dMN) for real&#8208;time tracking of HSV&#8208;1 from skin to brain is presented. Upon application, CQDs&#8208;HSV&#8208;1 is released from the dMN through the swelling of interstitial fluid (ISF) in skin and subsequently monitored by living imaging. Remarkably, it is observed that HSV&#8208;1 preferentially infects peripheral skin nerves, almost all viruses directly enter to brain via the spinal cord within 10&#8211;30&#160;min, while few viruses enter the brain through the bloodstream via tail vein injection at the same time. Spinal cord injury (SCI) significantly delays the HSV&#8208;1 transport from skin to brain but has no effect on the virus's travel from blood to brain. In a microfluid system, HSV&#8208;1 shows preferential neurite infection, then transports to the cell body of differentiated SH&#8208;SY5Y cells, highlighting the viral traffic process in neurons. The integration of CQDs&#8208;virus labelling technology and dMN delivery model presents a promising tool for investigating the in vivo transport routes of neurotropic viruses with initial skin infections.

Electron Release via Internal Polarization Fields
The internal polarization field at the W&#8211;graphene heterointerface induces sulfur vacancy formation under ion bombardment, modulating the electronic structure via excess electron transfer. This enhances valence state filling of W and S atoms. This study highlights the relationship between the WS2 basal plane's electronic structure and electrocatalytic activity, focusing on optimizing S&#8211;H bonding. More details can be found in article number 2411211 by Hyeong&#8208;U Kim, Pil J. Yoo, Taesung Kim, and co&#8208;workers.

All&#8208;Iron Redox Flow Batteries
Aqueous redox flow batteries are limited by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at their negative electrodes. In article number 2414596 by Emre B. Boz, Ameya Bondre, Ronald de Bruijne, and Antoni Forner&#8208;Cuenca, conductive polymers are conformally coated on porous carbonaceous electrodes to improve the reaction selectivity of hybrid all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries. Poly(pyrrole)/PSS coating inhibits HER in acidic media and increases the battery lifetime, while PEDOT/PSS electrode improves the roundtrip efficiency.

Spontaneous Twist of Ferroelectric Smectic Blocks
The ferroelectric nematic (NF) phase in achiral rod&#8208;shape mesogens is known to exhibit chiral ground state (CGS) due to the polarization escape. In this study, Hiroya Nishikawa, Fumito Araoka, and co&#8208;workers found such CGS as twisting of bulky smectic blocks in a ferroelectric smectic phase transited directly from the NF phase. More details can be found in article number 2501946.

Flame Treatment
A rapid and scalable high&#8208;temperature flame technique is developed to enable surface reconstruction of sulfide semiconductor photoelectrode for enhanced photoelectrochemical(PEC) performances. In article number 2403164, Sung Sik Shin, Xiaolin Zheng, Sun Cho, and their team demonstrate rapid surface reconstruction of Indium sulfide (In2S3) photoanode using the flame process. The flame process transforms the In2S3 surface into a 5 nm&#8208;thin In2O3 layer and generates bulk sulfur vacancies simultaneously, leading to a remarkable PEC water oxidation photocurrent density of 8.5 mA cm&#8722;2 and iodide oxidation photocurrent density of 7.3 mA cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Polyphenol&#8208;Derived Carbonaceous Frameworks with Multiscale Porosity for High&#8208;Power Electrochemical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the fluid dynamic behavior within carbonaceous porous structures, linking structural characteristics to electrolyte transport and electrochemical performance. Specifically, it quantitatively assesses the effect of polyphenol derivatives&#8208;harnessed multiscale pore structures on active surface utilization and electrochemical activity for advancements in high&#8208;power electrochemical applications.








Abstract
With the escalating global demand for electric vehicles and sustainable energy solutions, increasing focus is placed on developing electrochemical systems that offer fast charging and high&#8208;power output, primarily governed by mass transport. Accordingly, porous carbons have emerged as highly promising electrochemically active or supporting materials due to expansive surface areas, tunable pore structures, and superior electrical conductivity, accelerating surface reaction. Yet, while substantial research has been devoted to crafting various porous carbons to increase specific surface areas, the optimal utilization of the surfaces remains underexplored. This review emphasizes the critical role of the fluid dynamics within multiscale porous carbonaceous electrodes, leading to substantially enhanced pore utilization in electrochemical systems. It elaborates on strategies of using sacrificial templates for incorporating meso/macropores into microporous carbon matrix, while exploiting the unique properties of polyphenol moieties such as sustainable carbons derived from biomass, inherent adhesive/cohesive interactions with template materials, and facile complexation capabilities with diverse materials, thereby enabling adaptive structural modulations. Furthermore, it explores how multiscale pore configurations influence pore&#8208;utilization efficiency, demonstrating advantages of incorporating multiscale pores. Finally, synergistic impact on the high&#8208;power electrochemical systems is examined, attributed to improved fluid&#8208;dynamic behavior within the carbonaceous frameworks, providing insights for advancing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;power electrochemical applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review surveys natural biomaterials and nature&#8208;inspired artificial materials as additives for metal halide perovskite films in optoelectronics, including solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, photodetectors, and X&#8208;ray detectors. It discusses how these biomaterials differ from conventional materials in terms of their impact on device performance from both mechanistic and functional viewpoints. Although solar cell applications dominate, reports on other applications are rapidly increasing.








Abstract
This comprehensive review meticulously categorizes and discusses the applications of diverse biomaterials, specifically natural and nature&#8208;inspired synthetic materials in metal halide perovskite optoelectronics. Applications range from solar cells to light&#8208;emitting diodes, photodetectors, and X&#8208;ray detectors. Emphasis is placed on the intricate interactions between bio&#8208;additives and perovskite crystals, highlighting their influence on the grain size, crystal orientation, grain boundaries, and surface passivation. This review also explores the advantages and disadvantages of each natural or nature&#8208;inspired material and their unique properties compared with conventional additives. Special attention is given to the mechanistic and functional viewpoints, showing how these biomaterials enhance device performance. Through additive engineering with ecofriendly biomaterials, defects in metal halide perovskite thin films can be effectively passivated, thus extending the photostability or in some cases mechanical flexibility of devices. This review provides valuable insights for selecting and designing next&#8208;generation biomaterial additives, offering new prospects for achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite layers and advancing the field of peorvskite&#8208; based optoelectronics.

         <title>Aerosol CVD Carbon Nanotube Thin Films: From Synthesis to Advanced Applications: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aerosol chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a cutting&#8208;edge method for producing carbon nanotube (CNT) thin films through gas&#8208;phase synthesis and filtration collection. The films exhibit exceptional electrical, optical, and mechanical properties. This review provides comprehensive guidelines from synthesis to applications, emphasizing how precise control of aerosol CVD parameters enables scalability and enhances commercial viability across diverse technological applications.








Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) produced by the floating&#8208;catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD) method are among the most promising nanomaterials of today, attracting interest from both academic and industrial sectors. These CNTs exhibit exceptional electrical conductivity, optical properties, and mechanical resilience due to their binder&#8208;free and low&#8208;defect structure, while the FCCVD method enables their continuous and scalable synthesis. Among the methodological FCCVD variations, aerosol CVD&#8217; is distinguished by its production of freestanding thin films comprising macroscale CNT networks, which exhibit superior performance and practical applicability. This review elucidates the complex interrelations between aerosol CVD reactor synthesis conditions and the resulting properties of the CNTs. A unified approach connecting all stages of the synthesis process is proposed as a comprehensive guide. This review examines the correlations between CNT structural parameters (length and diameter) and resultant film properties (conductivity, optical, and mechanical characteristics) to establish a comprehensive framework for optimizing CNT thin film synthesis. The analysis encompasses characterization methodologies specific to aerosol CVD&#8208;synthesized CNTs and evaluates how their properties influence applications across diverse domains, from energy devices to optoelectronics. The review concludes by addressing current challenges and prospects in this field.

         <title>Material Selection and Device Design of Scalable Flexible Brain&#8208;Computer Interfaces: A Balance Between Electrical and Mechanical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the balance between electrical and mechanical performance of flexible BCIs through the careful selection of electronic materials and probe design to achieve long&#8208;term stable neural recordings with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios.








Abstract
Brain&#8208;computer interfaces (BCIs) hold the potential to revolutionize brain function restoration, enhance human capability, and advance our understanding of cognitive mechanisms by directly linking neural signals with hardware. However, the mechanical mismatch between conventional rigid BCIs and soft brain tissue limits long&#8208;term interface stability. Next&#8208;generation BCIs must achieve long&#8208;term biocompatibility while maintaining high performance, enabling the integration of millions of sensors within tissue&#8208;level flexible and soft, stable neural interfaces. Lithographic fabrication techniques provide scalable thin&#8208;film flexible electronics, but traditional electronic materials often fail to meet the unique requirements of BCIs. This review examines the selection of materials and device design for flexible BCIs, starting with an analysis of intrinsic material properties&#8212;Young's modulus, electrical conductivity and dielectric constant. It then explores the integration of material selection with electrode design to optimize electrical circuits and assess key mechanical factors. Next, the correlation between electrical and mechanical performance is analyzed to guide material selection and device design. Finally, recent advances in neural probes are reviewed, highlighting improvements in signal quality, recording stability, and scalability. This review focuses on scalable, lithography&#8208;based BCIs, aiming to identify optimal materials and designs for long&#8208;term, reliable neural recordings.

         <title>One&#8208;Shot Remote Integration of Macromolecular Synaptic Elements on a Chip for Ultrathin Flexible Neural Network System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel one&#8208;shot integration electropolymerization (OSIEP) method is developed as a breakthrough on the intricate photolithographic steps, enabling to compress all processes from synthesis to channel integration in one&#8208;shot manufacturing. The specially designed dual bipolar electrodes provide the targeted depositions of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) on 6 &#215; 5 channel array. A multi&#8208;gate synaptic circuit mimicking operant conditioning constructed by OSIEP is successfully evaluated.








Abstract
The field of biomimetic electronics that mimic&#160;synaptic&#160;functions&#160;has expanded significantly to overcome the limitations&#160;of&#160;the&#160;von Neumann bottleneck. However, the scaling down of the technology has led to an increasingly intricate manufacturing process. To address the issue, this work presents a one&#8208;shot integrable electropolymerization (OSIEP) method with remote controllability for the deposition of synaptic elements on a chip by exploiting bipolar electrochemistry. Condensing synthesis, deposition, and patterning into a single fabrication step is achieved by combining alternating&#8208;current voltage superimposed on direct&#8208;current voltage&#8208;bipolar electropolymerization and a specially designed dual source/drain bipolar electrodes. As a result, uniform 6 &#215; 5 arrays of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) channels are successfully&#160;fabricated&#160;on flexible ultrathin parylene substrates in one&#8208;shot process. The channels exhibited highly uniform characteristics and are directly used as electrochemical synaptic transistor with synaptic plasticity over 100 s. The synaptic transistors have demonstrated promising performance in an artificial neural network (NN) simulation, achieving a high recognition accuracy of 95.20%. Additionally, the array of synaptic transistor is easily reconfigured to a multi&#8208;gate synaptic circuit to implement the principles of operant conditioning. These results provide a compelling fabrication strategy for realizing cost&#8208;effective and disposable NN systems with high integration density.

As a result, uniform 6 &#215; 5 arrays of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) channels are successfully&#160;fabricated&#160;on flexible ultrathin parylene substrates in one-shot process. The channels exhibited highly uniform characteristics and are directly used as electrochemical synaptic transistor with synaptic plasticity over 100 s. The synaptic transistors have demonstrated promising performance in an artificial neural network (NN) simulation, achieving a high recognition accuracy of 95.20%. Additionally, the array of synaptic transistor is easily reconfigured to a multi-gate synaptic circuit to implement the principles of operant conditioning. These results provide a compelling fabrication strategy for realizing cost-effective and disposable NN systems with high integration density.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Charged Black&#8208;Hole&#8208;Like Electronic Structure Driven by Geometric Potential of 2D Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that curvature in 2D semiconductors triggers the modified geometric potential with curvature&#8208;induced bandgap change, resembling the effective potential of black holes. The atomic&#8208;scale observation of bound states in the modified geometric potential shows an analog of the stable orbits near black holes. The modified geometric potential is related to curvature&#8208;induced variations in both band gap and spin&#8208;orbit interaction.








Abstract
One of the exotic expectations in the 2D curved spacetime is the geometric potential from the curvature of the 2D space, still possessing unsolved fundamental questions through Dirac quantization. The atomically thin 2D materials are promising for the realization of the geometric potential, but the geometric potential in 2D materials is not identified experimentally. Here, the curvature&#8208;induced ring&#8208;patterned bound states are observed in structurally deformed 2D semiconductors and formulated the modified geometric potential for the curvature effect, which demonstrates the ring&#8208;shape bound states with angular momentum. The formulated modified geometric potential is analogous to the effective potential of a rotating charged black hole. Density functional theory and tight&#8208;binding calculations are performed, which quantitatively agree well with the results of the modified geometric potential. The modified geometric potential is described by modified Gaussian and mean curvatures, corresponding to the curvature&#8208;induced changes in spin&#8208;orbit interaction and band gap, respectively. Even for complex structural deformation, the geometric potential solves the complexity, which aligns well with experimental results. The understanding of the modified geometric potential provides us with an intuitive clue for quantum transport and a key factor for new quantum applications such as valleytronics, spintronics, and straintronics in 2D semiconductors.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Engineering of Thermodynamically Enhanced SaCas9 for Improved Gene Suppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermostable Cas9 (CRISPR&#8208;associated protein 9) variant is developed using a structure&#8208;guided protein engineering approach. By thermodynamic analysis, deletable domains are identified to enhance stability while preserving function. Also, a 3D&#160;structure with novel conformation of nontarget&#8208;stranded DNA is confirmed through cryo&#8208;electron microscopy. Fusion with functional elements for CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) interference applications enables gene suppression efficiency, demonstrating the potential of tailored CRISPR systems.








Abstract
Proteins with multiple domains play pivotal roles in various biological processes, necessitating a thorough understanding of their structural stability and functional interplay. Here, a structure&#8208;guided protein engineering approach is proposed to develop thermostable Cas9 (CRISPR&#8208;associated protein 9)&#160;variant for CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)&#160;interference applications. By employing thermodynamic analysis, combining distance mapping and molecular dynamics simulations, deletable domains are identified to enhance stability while preserving the DNA recognition function of Cas9. The resulting engineered Cas9, termed small and dead form Cas9, exhibits improved thermostability and maintains target DNA recognition function. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy analysis reveals structural integrity with reduced atomic density in the deleted domain. Fusion with functional elements enables intracellular delivery and nuclear localization, demonstrating efficient gene suppression in diverse cell types. Direct delivery in the mouse brain shows enhanced knockdown efficiency, highlighting the potential of structure&#8208;guided engineering to develop functional CRISPR systems tailored for specific applications. This study underscores the significance of integrating computational and experimental approaches for protein engineering, offering insights into designing tailored molecular tools for precise biological interventions.

         <title>Responsive Ordered Assembly of Magnetic Nanoparticles for ROS Activatable Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive ordered assembly of magnetic nanoparticles (RMNAs) achieve a ROS&#8208;dependent off/on MPI signal regulation through the ordered assembly/disassembly&#8208;mediated MPI tuning strategy. Remarkably, the activatable MPI probe, RMNA, demonstrates a 3.98&#8208;fold recovery of MPI signals in response to ROS conditions, enabling ultra&#8208;sensitive monitoring of acute liver injury at a low dosage of 0.05 mg&#160;kg&#8722;1, with a 27&#8208;fold increase in MPI signals compared to the non&#8208;responsive group.








Abstract
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) has emerged as a versatile biomedical imaging modality, yet a significant challenge persists in the absence of activatable MPI probes for targeted imaging of disease biomarkers. In this study, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive ordered assembly of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is reported, engineered through the meticulous design of magnetic nanoparticle building blocks and ROS&#8208;responsive polymeric ligands, enabling precise control over the assembly structure. This ordered configuration amplifies magnetic dipole&#8208;dipole interactions, raising the energy barrier during nonequilibrium dynamic magnetization and effectively quenching the MPI signal. By modulating the assembly and disassembly of these ordered structures in response to ROS, this nanoprobe achieves ROS&#8208;dependent off/on MPI signal regulation. Consequently, the probe enables the monitoring of early pathological ROS change in a mice model of early acute liver injury, facilitating highly sensitive monitoring of the ROS level&#8208;dependent severity of the disease. This work represents the inaugural application of microenvironment&#8208;responsive MPI probes for the early diagnosis of ROS&#8208;associated diseases. The introduction of ordered assembly structures for MPI signal tuning offers a promising translational approach in the development of next&#8208;generation activatable MPI probes.

         <title>Near Infrared Light&#8208;Based Non&#8208;Contact Sensing System for Robotics Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;contact intelligent sensing system that can accurately recognize patterns formed by NIR light is reported. Black phosphate (BP)&#8208;based organogel with anti&#8208;freezing and water retention properties as non&#8208;contact sensor can be used in extremely cold or hot environments. The designed non&#8208;contact sensing system shows good robustness by maintaining high sensitivity over a wide temperature range, long working distances, different current intensities, and dark conditions.








Abstract
With the development of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, non&#8208;contact sensors are expected to realize complex human&#8208;computer interaction. However, current non&#8208;contact sensors are mainly limited by accuracy and stability. Herein, an intelligent infrared photothermal non&#8208;contact sensing system is developed that provides long&#8208;distance and high&#8208;accuracy non&#8208;contact sensing. A black phosphorus (BP)&#8208;based composite organogel is designed, which exhibits excellent photothermal properties and environmental stability, as the active material. This material can detect patterns created by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light through various patterned masks monitored by an infrared thermal imager. The constructed non&#8208;contact sensing system is capable of accurately recognizing 26 letters with an impressive accuracy rate of 99.4%. Furthermore, even small size non&#8208;contact sensors can maintain high sensitivity and stability across a wide temperature range, at long working distances, and under different current intensities and dark conditions, demonstrating exceptional robustness. Combined with machine learning method, it is demonstrated that the non&#8208;contact sensing system excels in pattern recognition and human&#8208;computer interaction. These features highlight its potential applications in intelligent robotics and remote control systems.

         <title>Conductive Polymer Coatings Control Reaction Selectivity in All&#8208;Iron Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous redox flow batteries are limited by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at their negative electrodes. In this work, conductive polymers are conformally coated on porous carbonaceous electrodes to improve the reaction selectivity of hybrid all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries. Poly(pyrrole)/PSS coating inhibits HER in acidic media and increases the battery lifetime, while PEDOT/PSS electrode improves the roundtrip efficiency.








Abstract
Aqueous all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries are an attractive and economic technology for grid&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their use of abundant and environmentally benign iron as the redox active material and water as solvent. However, the battery operation is challenged by the plating/stripping reactions of iron and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction at the negative electrode, which hinder performance and durability. Here, the reaction selectivity of the negative electrode is tailored by introducing conductive polymer coatings onto porous carbonaceous electrodes. Two conductive polymers, poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and poly(pyrrole) (PPy) are conformally coated with the dopant poly(4&#8208;styrenesulfonate) (PSS) and the resulting electrochemistry is studied on model electroanalytical platforms and redox flow batteries. Both polymers decrease the hydrogen evolution current on rotating disc electrodes, with PPy/PSS strongly inhibiting the reaction at high overpotentials. In full all&#8208;iron redox flow cells, PPy/PSS coating extends cyclability and significantly reduces hydrogen evolution, while PEDOT/PSS coating improves the round&#8208;trip efficiency, possibly acting as a redox shuttle for the iron stripping reaction. These findings motivate broader investigation and implementation of conductive polymers to engineer reaction selectivity for flow batteries and other electrochemical technologies.

         <title>When Graphitic Nitrogen Meets Pentagons: Selective Construction and Spectroscopic Evidence for Improved Four&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exclusive construction of graphitic nitrogen coordinated with pentagon defects is achieved by pyrolysis of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 under unusually high temperatures. The graphitic nitrogen model electrocatalyst enables highly efficient four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction in both alkaline and acidic conditions, as evidenced by in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon materials have emerged as promising metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. However, the structural inhomogeneity, particularly the coexistence of four nitrogen doping structures&#8211;pyridinic, graphitic, pyrrolic, and oxidized nitrogen&#8211;makes assessing their respective contributions challenging and controversial. The current understanding of the four nitrogen doping structures may be also oversimplified and even problematic. The development of a distinctive graphitic&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon electrocatalyst is presented in which graphitic nitrogen coordinated with pentagon defects is selectively constructed. Contrary to the previously held belief that graphitic nitrogen has little effect on ORR electrocatalysis, the unique graphitic N configuration exhibited significantly enhanced four&#8208;electron ORR activity in both alkaline and acidic media. In situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations further revealed that graphitic nitrogen, when coordinated with pentagon defects, optimized the density of states near the Fermi level, leading to optimized binding energies with oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. The results rationalize the long&#8208;standing controversy over the role of different nitrogen dopants in ORR electrocatalysis and suggest that there is considerable potential to precisely construct new nitrogen doping configurations to achieve superior electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Boosted Hydrogen Evolution via Photoinduced Hole Transfer in Molecular&#8208;Level Organic Heterojunction under NIR Photon Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brand&#8208;new A&#8208;D1&#8208;D2&#8208;D1&#8208;A type electron acceptor BTPT&#8208;IC4F is designed, synthesized and integrated with donor polymer PBDB&#8208;T to achieve full&#8208;spectrum light harvesting. PBDB&#8208;T:BTPT&#8208;IC4F nanoparticles exhibit a promising external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 6.3% at 730&#160;nm, which is attributed to efficient hole extraction from BTPT&#8208;IC4F* (excited BTPT&#8208;IC4F) to PBDB&#8208;T phase in the molecular&#8208;level heterojunction under pure near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photon excitation.









Abstract
The energy of sunlight is predominantly concentrated in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, posing a paramount limitation for practical application of conventional photocatalysts. Organic semiconductors can offer NIR absorption and tunable energy levels simultaneously through molecular engineering, which presents great potential in solar&#8208;driven catalysis. However, an individual organic semiconductor typically generates Frenkel excitons with large binding energy, hindering efficient electron&#8208;hole separation. Herein, we develop molecular&#8208;level heterojunction to suppress electron&#8208;hole recombination, thereby achieving a boosted hydrogen (H2) evolution reaction rate of 25.54&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 (12.77&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1) under visible&#8211;near&#8208;infrared (Vis&#8211;NIR) light. Surprisingly, heterojunction nanoparticles (NPs) comprising donor polymer PBDB&#8208;T matched with an A&#8208;D1&#8208;D2&#8208;D1&#8208;A type acceptor BTPT&#8208;IC4F exhibit a promising external quantum efficiency of 6.3% at 730&#160;nm. Transient absorption spectroscopy monitors effective extraction of photogenerated holes from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of BTPT&#8208;IC4F to the HOMO of PBDB&#8208;T, while first&#8208;principle calculations confirm the prolonged lifetime of excited BTPT&#8208;IC4F due to efficient hole capture by the PBDB&#8208;T phase. The outstanding performance of heterojunction NPs under NIR light is ascribed to strong hole transfer within the nanoparticle. This study provides valuable insights for designing molecular&#8208;level organic heterojunction photocatalysts toward NIR light&#8208;driven H2 evolution and other potential reactions.

         <title>PSMA&#8208;Targeted Nanoparticles with PI3K/mTOR Dual Inhibitor Downregulate P&#8208;Glycoprotein and Inactivate Myeloid&#8208;Derived Suppressor Cells for Enhanced Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy in Prostate Cancer</title>

This study presents glutathione&#8208;responsive nanoparticles (PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ) targeting prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen to deliver a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor. The system simultaneously suppresses P&#8208;glycoprotein&#8208;mediated drug resistance, enhances chemotherapy sensitivity, and reprograms immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments by inactivating myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells, offering a dual chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic strategy against advanced prostate cancer.








Abstract
Acquired drug resistance and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment significantly limit the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in advanced prostate cancer. Blocking the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway has been recently proved as a new strategy to improve sensitivity to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Herein, glutathione (GSH)&#8208;sensitive nanoparticles (PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ) are developed that can target prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA), loaded with PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor prodrug BEZ235. BEZ235 can be released from PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ in response to elevated GSH levels in prostate cancer tissues, inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and impairing downstream cellular functions such as cell proliferation, DNA repair, and protein synthesis. When combined with paclitaxel, PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ could reduce drug efflux by downregulating P&#8208;glycoprotein expression in cancer cells, thus enhancing the sensitivity to chemotherapy. Furthermore, PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ could impair the immunosuppressive functions of myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells and reshape the &#8220;cold&#8221; immune microenvironment in prostate cancer, enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy and including long&#8208;term immune memory against tumor recurrence. PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ serves a safe and promising strategy to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in advanced prostate cancer.

         <title>Supramolecular Conductive Hydrogels With Homogeneous Ionic and Electronic Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) based conductive hydrogels have received great attention in bioelectronics on account of their tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties. However, inhomogeneous morphologies of the conducting PEDOT phase limits their electrical and mechanical properties.

Mechanically resilient hydrogels with ion&#8208;electron mixed transport properties effectively bridge biology with electronics. An ideal bioelectronic interface can be realized through introducing electronically conductive polymers into supramolecular hydrogels. However, inhomogeneous morphologies of conducting polymers, such as poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), have limited mechanical properties and ion&#8208;electron interactions. Here, supramolecular conductive hydrogels that possess homogeneous ionic and electronic transport are achieved. The materials demonstrate high toughness (620&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3), stretchability (&gt;1000%), softness (10.5&#160;kPa), and conductivity (5.8&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1), which surpasses commonly used inhomogeneous PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based hydrogels. The homogeneous network leads to higher charge injection capacitance and lower skin impedance compared to commercial electrodes or commonly used inhomogeneous PEDOT:PSS conducting networks. This significant advance arises from the homogeneous incorporation of the hydrophilic self&#8208;doped conducting polymer S&#8208;PEDOT, which has polymerized within a supramolecular polymer network template mediated by high&#8208;binding affinity host&#8208;guest crosslinks. Furthermore, the compatibility of S&#8208;PEDOT with hydrophilic secondary networks enables the realization of fully dryable and reswellable electronic devices, facilitating reusability and improving their ease of handling. It is anticipated that achieving such material architectures will offer a promising new direction in future synthesis and implementation of conductive hydrogels in the field of&#160;bioelectronics.

&lt;p&gt;Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) based conductive hydrogels have received great attention in bioelectronics on account of their tissue-like mechanical properties. However, inhomogeneous morphologies of the conducting PEDOT phase limits their electrical and mechanical properties. Here, supramolecular hydrogels with self-doped PEDOT (S-PEDOT) homogeneously distributed are reported, which simultaneously exhibit high toughness (620 kJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;), softness (10.5 kPa) and conductivity (5.8 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Single&#8208;Layer Spin&#8208;Orbit&#8208;Torque Magnetization Switching Due to Spin Berry Curvature Generated by Minute Spontaneous Atomic Displacement in a Weyl Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;layer magnetization switching with a small critical current density of &#8776;106&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 is demonstrated. The strong intrinsic spin Hall effect, causing the switching, is induced by the synergy of the inherent spin&#8208;orbit coupling and the spontaneous oxygen octahedral rotation in SrRuO3.The findings highlight the immense potential for realizing efficient material systems for spin&#8208;orbitronics applications by precise atom positioning.








Abstract
Spin Berry curvature characterizes the band topology as the spin counterpart of Berry curvature and is crucial in generating novel spintronics functionalities. By breaking the crystalline inversion symmetry, the spin Berry curvature is expected to be significantly enhanced; this enhancement will increase the intrinsic spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic materials and, thus, the spin&#8211;orbit torques (SOTs). However, this intriguing approach is not applied to devices; generally, the spin Hall effect in ferromagnet/heavy&#8208;metal bilayer is used for SOT magnetization switching. Here, SOT&#8208;induced partial magnetization switching is demonstrated in a single layer of a single&#8208;crystalline Weyl oxide SrRuO3 (SRO) with a small current density of &#8776;3.1&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. Detailed analysis of the crystal structure in the seemingly perfect periodic lattice of the SRO film reveals barely discernible oxygen octahedral rotations with angles of &#8776;5&#176; near the interface with a substrate. Tight&#8208;binding calculations indicate that a large spin Hall conductivity is induced around small gaps generated at band crossings by the synergy of inherent spin&#8210;orbit coupling and band inversion due to the rotations, causing magnetization reversal. The results indicate that a minute atomic displacement in single&#8208;crystal films can induce strong intrinsic SOTs that are useful for spin&#8208;orbitronics devices.

         <title>Cardiac Organoid Model Inspired Micro&#8208;Robot Smart Patch to Treat Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heart organoid model exhibits the acidic microenvironment characteristic of myocardial infarction, which emerges as a pivotal force propelling the movement of micro&#8208;robots. These micro&#8208;robots, administered through microneedles, can penetrate deep into the tissue, effectively delivering therapeutic payloads to facilitate heart repair.








Abstract
Post&#8208;myocardial infarction (MI), the rapid decrease in pH triggers myocardial cell acidosis, which compromises the therapeutic efficacy of exosomes in MI. The groundbreaking research in the human cardiac organoid MI model suggests that exosomes, when paired with pH adjustment, dramatically reduce cardiomyocyte mortality while maintaining their proliferative potential, underscoring the importance of pH regulation in myocardial preservation. Micro&#8208;robot mounted micro&#8208;needle (MN) patch is thus proposed, targeting MI&#8208;acidic microenvironmet, to deliver exosomes into deep injured tissue. Upon injection, the patch base releases VEGF&#8208;laden nanoparticles adhering to the infarcted myocardium. The smart patch is found not only 3D reconstructs the vascular network in MI regions but also effectively saves cardiomyocytes in rats. Furthermore, the minimally invasive delivery of MN patches are also verified to hearts of rabbits and pigs via thoracoscopic surgery underscores. These findings suggest that precise regulation of the microenvironment is a key to improving treatment outcomes.

         <title>Designing Supported Nanoparticles via Synergistic Ex&#8208;Solution and Phosphorization for Tailored Active Site Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot process synchronizing nanoparticle ex&#8208;solution and phosphorization is developed for simultaneous phosphide nanoparticle synthesis and host oxide functionalization. The resulting IrRuP/WO2.9 catalyst achieves exceptional mass activity and low onset potential for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C and offering a promising alternative for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysis.









Abstract
Supported nanoparticles incorporating catalytically attractive nonmetal elements have gained significant attention as a promising strategy for enhancing catalytic activity in various industrial applications. This study presents an innovative one&#8208;pot synthesis method for fabricating hybrid catalysts, which simultaneously modifies surface properties through the precipitation of nanoparticles with the concurrent incorporation of nonmetal elements. The underlying concept is to synchronize the temperature required for particle formation with that of nonmetal incorporation by adjusting the oxygen chemical potential of the host oxide. As a case study, Ir&#8208; and Ru&#8208;doped WO3 are selected as the starting material, with phosphorus (P) as the representative nonmetal for surface functionalization. Notably, the hybrid catalyst, composed of amorphous (Ir,Ru)Px particles dispersed on P&#8208;rich WO2.9 sheets, is synthesized through a single heat treatment at 500&#160;&#176;C, avoiding undesirable sintering of the host material. When used as a hydrogen evolution catalyst, this material exhibits outstanding mass activity, durability, compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C catalysts. Density functional theory calculations further reveal that the superior performance of the hybrid catalysts attributes to improved water dissociation and favorable adsorption and desorption of key reaction intermediates. This novel synthesis strategy offers considerable potential for advancing diverse areas of heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Molecular Domino Toppling for Directed Self&#8208;Erasing Information Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An azobenzene&#8208;based material with unprecedented light&#8208;pumped directional charge&#8208;transfer reminiscent of toppling dominoes is presented. After light&#8208;induced trans&#8594;cis forward isomerization, electron hopping occurs in a sequential and propagating manner between the cis isomers along with an electrocatalytic cis&#8594;trans backward isomerization. This repeatable, self&#8208;erasing domino information transfer is a groundbreaking new mechanism, suitable to process information on the molecular level.








Abstract
In the pursuit of more secure information transfer, advanced nanoelectronic technologies and nanomaterials must be developed. Here, a material is presented able to undergo an unprecedented light&#8208;pumped directional charge&#8208;transfer process reminiscent of toppling dominoes. The material is based on ortho&#8208;fluorinated azobenzene molecules which are organized in molecular rows by the regular array of a metal&#8211;organic framework. The azobenzene molecules undergo light&#8208;induced trans&#8594;cis forward as well as electrocatalytic cis&#8594;trans backward isomerization. The findings reveal that electron hopping occurs in a sequential and propagating manner between the light&#8208;generated cis isomers along with an isomerization of the sample to the trans&#8208;state. Thus, light can be used to locally write information, which subsequently can be read out by the transferred charge with simultaneous deletion of the information. This freely repeatable, self&#8208;erasing domino information transfer is a groundbreaking new mechanism to process information on the molecular level that may find application in encryption.

After light-induced &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8594;&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; forward isomerization, electron hopping occurs in a sequential and propagating manner between the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; isomers along with an electrocatalytic &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;&#8594;&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; backward isomerization. This repeatable, self-erasing domino information transfer is a groundbreaking new mechanism, suitable to process information on the molecular level.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pursuit of more secure information transfer, advanced nanoelectronic technologies and nanomaterials must be developed. Here, a material is presented able to undergo an unprecedented light-pumped directional charge-transfer process reminiscent of toppling dominoes. The material is based on &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-fluorinated azobenzene molecules which are organized in molecular rows by the regular array of a metal&#8211;organic framework. The azobenzene molecules undergo light-induced &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8594;&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; forward as well as electrocatalytic &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;&#8594;&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; backward isomerization. The findings reveal that electron hopping occurs in a sequential and propagating manner between the light-generated &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; isomers along with an isomerization of the sample to the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-state. Thus, light can be used to locally write information, which subsequently can be read out by the transferred charge with simultaneous deletion of the information. This freely repeatable, self-erasing domino information transfer is a groundbreaking new mechanism to process information on the molecular level that may find application in encryption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetically Switchable Adhesive Millirobots for Universal Manipulation in both Air and Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a series of millirobots with magnetically switchable adhesion, enabled by soft, double&#8208;reentrant micropillar arrays with side liquid&#8208;repellency. These millirobots can universally manipulate a wide range of targets in both air and water. Beyond transportation, they are capable of performing various complex tasks, such as circuit repair, precision assembly, and high&#8208;speed actuation in amphibious environments.








Abstract
Magnetic soft robots with multimodal locomotion have demonstrated significant potential for target manipulation tasks in hard&#8208;to&#8208;reach spaces in recent years. Achieving universal manipulation between robots and their targets requires a nondestructive and easily switchable interaction with broad applicability across diverse targets. However, establishing versatile and dynamic interactions between diverse targets and robotic systems remains a significant challenge. Herein, a series of magnetic millirobots capable of universal target manipulation with magnetically switchable adhesion is reported. Through two&#8208;photon lithography&#8208;assisted molding, magnetic soft double&#8208;reentrant micropillar arrays with liquid repellency are fabricated on the robots. These micropillar arrays can serve as switchable adhesion units for the millirobots to effectively manipulate targets of various geometries (0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D) in both air and water. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstrations, these adhesive robots can perform various complex tasks, including circuit repair, mini&#8208;turbine assembly, and high&#8208;speed underwater rotation of the turbine machine. This work may offer a versatile approach to magnetic manipulation of non&#8208;magnetic objects through amphibious adhesion, emerging as a new paradigm in robotic manipulation.

         <title>Electric&#8208;Field Regulation of Adhesion/De&#8208;Adhesion/Release Capacity of Transparent and Electrochromic Adhesive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conductive hydrogel with surface adhesion and electric field&#8208;triggered de&#8208;adhesion and release is fabricated from thioctic acid and L&#8208;arginine. The non&#8208;covalent intermolecular attractions not only endow the hydrogel with useful bulk&#8208;state properties and strong adhesion but also generate electric responsiveness for on&#8208;demand de&#8208;adhesion and release.








Abstract
Removing adhesive nondestructively and intact from the adhered surface is a difficult challenge for advanced adhesive materials. Compared with the commonly used thermal or chemical release, the controlled adhesive release via electric&#8208;field offers practical application advantages. However, a noninvasive release mode such as this has not been available for the de&#8208;bonding of supramolecular adhesives that originate from small organic molecules. Herein, a conductive hydrogel with surface adhesion and electric field&#8208;triggered de&#8208;adhesion and release is fabricated from thioctic acid (TA) and L&#8208;arginine (LA). The non&#8208;covalent intermolecular attractions of poly[TA&#8208;LA], especially its electrostatic interactions, not only endow it with useful bulk&#8208;state properties and strong adhesion (up to 363.3&#160;kPa) but also generate electric responsiveness for on&#8208;demand de&#8208;adhesion and release. The poly[TA&#8208;LA] adhesive layer can be easily released within a short time (&lt;60 s) under a mild voltage (5&#8776;10&#160;V). After a combined experimental and theoretical investigation, It is concluded that the adhesive&#8208;layer morphological and mechanical changes, activated by a weak current (1.1&#8776;3.2&#160;mA), are responsible for the adhesion failure, which takes place primarily at the anode. Importantly, rapid electric release of poly[TA&#8208;LA] is applicable at low temperatures (5 V, 60 s, &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C) or underwater (5 V, 60 s, 25&#160;&#176;C).

         <title>In Situ Impurity Phase Repair Strategy Enables Highly&#8208;Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells with Periodic Photovoltaic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite, ideal for high&#8208;efficiency solar cells, suffers from impurity phases causing defects and instability. Using FAI/MASCN vapors repairs impurities into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, enhancing charge transport and morphology. This achieves 26.05% efficiency, with large&#8208;area devices (24.52% for 1 cm2, 22.35% for 17.1 cm2). Cyclic repair retains 94.3% efficiency after two cycles, significantly boosting device durability.








Abstract
The photoactive &#945;&#8208;phase of formamidinium lead iodide perovskite (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) is regarded as one of the ideal materials for high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to its superior optoelectronic properties. However, during the deposition of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films, the presence of impurity phases, such as PbI2 and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3, can cause the formation of inherent defects, which leads to suboptimal charge transport and extraction properties, as well as inadequate long&#8208;term stability in the film's morphology and structure. To address these issues, an impurity phase repair strategy is employed using FAI/MASCN mixed vapors to convert the impurity phases into light&#8208;absorbing &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Meanwhile, this recrystallization process also facilitates the recovery of its characteristic morphology, thereby improving efficiency and enhancing the durability of PSCs. This approach promotes the PSCs to obtain an efficiency of 26.05% (with a certified efficiency of 25.67%, and steady&#8208;state PCE of 25.41%). Additionally, this approach is suitable for the fabrication of large&#8208;area devices, obtaining a 1 cm2 device with a PCE of 24.52% and a mini&#8208;module (with an area of 17.1 cm2) with a PCE of 22.35%. Furthermore, it is found that this strategy enables cyclic repair of aged perovskite films, with the perovskite solar cells retaining &#8776; 94.3% of their initial efficiency after two cycles of repair, significantly enhancing the lifetime of the perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Engineered Polar Topological Domains in Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative interfacial engineering strategy has been proposed to construct and modulate polar topological domains within ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals. These ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, featuring diverse and adjustable polar topological structures including vortex, centrifugal vortex, and center&#8208;divergent domains, hold significant potential for applications in the field of topological photonics.








Abstract
Polar topological domains, distinguished by their inherent topological protection and diverse optoelectronic functionalities, have recently attracted significant interest across scientific disciplines. However, the realization of these structures in inorganic materials is often impeded by crystal symmetry constraints. In this context, ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, characterized by spontaneous polarization and flexible polarization orientation, provide an exceptional platform for the development of polar topological domains. Despite their potential, a considerable challenge lies in identifying a straightforward yet versatile approach for engineering polar topological domains within liquid crystals. Here, this study presents an interfacial engineering strategy that effectively stabilizes a range of polar topological domains in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, including vortex, centrifugal vortex, and center&#8208;divergent configurations, by synergistically modulating the surface tension and interfacial tension. Utilizing a combination of experimental characterization and simulation, the role of anchoring energy is systematically investigated in the molecular alignment of liquid crystals and facilitates transitions between diverse topological structures. This research not only extends the horizons for constructing and manipulating polar topological domains but also enhances their prospective applications in topological photonics.

Utilizing a combination of experimental characterization and simulation, the role of anchoring energy is systematically investigated in the molecular alignment of liquid crystals and facilitates transitions between diverse topological structures. This research not only extends the horizons for constructing and manipulating polar topological domains but also enhances their prospective applications in topological photonics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Cancer metastasis begins with intravasation, a complex process involving cancer&#8208;endothelial interactions. INVADE (Intravasation&#8208;on&#8208;&#181;Device), a biomimetic microfluidic platform enables high&#8208;throughput analysis of intravasation under controlled conditions. This system reveals distinct invasion modes, an epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) &#8208; mesenchymal&#8208;epithelial transition (MET) switch, and endothelial suppression of mesenchymal traits. It also uncovers bilateral signaling, highlighting dynamic cancer&#8208;endothelial crosstalk with implications for metastasis research.

Abstract
Cancer metastasis begins with intravasation, where cancer cells enter blood vessels through complex interactions with the endothelial barrier. Understanding this process remains challenging due to the lack of physiologically relevant models. Here, INVADE (Intravasation&#8208;on&#8208;&#181;Device), a biomimetic microfluidic platform, is presented, enabling high&#8208;throughput analysis of cancer cell intravasation under controlled conditions. This engineered platform integrates 23 parallel niche chambers with an endothelialized channel, providing both precise microenvironmental control and optical accessibility for real&#8208;time visualization. Using this platform, distinct intravasation mechanisms are uncovered: MCF&#8208;7 cells exhibit collective invasion, while MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells demonstrate an interactive mode with three functionally distinct subpopulations. A previously unknown epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal&#8208;epithelial transition (MET) switch is We discovered during intravasation, where MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells initially increase Vimentin expression before undergoing a 2.3 fold decrease over 96 h alongside a 1.5 fold increase in epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). Remarkably, endothelial cells directly suppress cancer cell mesenchymal properties, as evidenced by a 4.6 fold reduction in Vimentin expression compared to mono&#8208;cultures. Additionally, bilateral cancer&#8208;endothelial interactions are revealed, aggressive cancer cells induce significant intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;1 (ICAM&#8208;1) upregulation in endothelium. The INVADE platform represents an engineering advancement for studying complex cell&#8211;cell interactions with implications for understanding metastatic mechanisms.

         <title>Mitigating Surface Energy and Core&#8208;Shell Interface Strain of Yb3+&#8208;Doped ZnSe&#8208;Based Quantum Dots for Pure&#8208;Blue Emission QLED Devices</title>

Breaking Quantum Confinement in Yb3&#8314;&#8208;Doped ZnSe QDs: Surface&#8208;energy engineering enables scalable growth beyond the exciton Bohr radius with high&#8208;purity blue emission (453 nm), narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 46 nm, and exceptional photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 67.5%. 








Abstract
Large ZnSe quantum dots (QDs) with an emission peak &#8776;450&#160;nm hold significant promise for display technologies. However, achieving efficient pure&#8208;blue emission through the enlargement of ZnSe nanocrystals remains a significant challenge. In this study, a breakthrough is reported in growing large&#8208;size ZnSe QDs well beyond the exciton Bohr radius through Yb3+ doping strategy. Yb3+ doping reduces the surface energy of the ZnSe (220) crystal plane and alleviates interface strain in the ZnSe/ZnS structure, enabling the QDs to grow larger while maintaining enhanced crystal stability. The resulting Yb: ZnSe/ZnS QDs exhibit pure&#8208;blue emission at 453&#160;nm, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 46&#160;nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 67.5%. When integrated into quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), the devices display electroluminescence (EL) at 455&#160;nm, with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.35%, and a maximum luminance of 1337.08&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>Gambogic Acid Based Coordination Polymer Reinforces High&#8208;Intensity Focused Ultrasound Treatment of Gynecologic Malignancies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>

The study developed GAZn&#8208;PEG nanoparticles&#160;(GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs) that synergize with HIFU to enhance anti&#8208;tumor immunity. GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs reduce HSP&#8208;90 expression, promote dendritic cell maturation, and activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, amplifying immune stimulation. Combined with HIFU, GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs eradicated local tumors and induced durable systemic immunity, effectively suppressing metastasis and recurrence.









Abstract
High&#8208;intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is emerging as a promising non&#8208;invasive treatment for solid tumors. Nevertheless, HIFU may also induce the upregulation of Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP&#8208;90), potentially resulting in resistance to HIFU. Besides, although it is effective against in situ tumors, challenges remain with tumor metastasis and recurrence. Herein, the innovative design of gambogic acid (GA) based coordination polymer&#8212;GAZn&#8208;PEG nanoparticles (GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs) are synthesized through the coordination of GA with zinc ions (Zn2+), and subsequently functionalized with lipid bilayer incorporating polyethylene glycol (PEG), sensitizing HIFU for the treatment of cervical and ovarian cancers. Briefly, under HIFU exposure, GA markedly suppresses the expression of HSP&#8208;90, thereby increasing the tumor's sensitivity to HIFU therapy. Furthermore, Zn2+ not only overcome the issue of GA's poor water solubility but also synergistically stimulate immune responses in conjunction with GA. More intriguingly, it has been discovered that GAZn&#8208;PEG can effectively activate the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of the interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway, thereby enhancing the immune responses provoked by HIFU. Specifically, GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs show a remarkable increase in dendritic cell activation and the effective stimulation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, crucial for long&#8208;term protection against tumor recurrence and metastasis.

         <title>On&#8208;Chip Active Non&#8208;Reciprocal Topological Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;compact and efficient on&#8208;chip isolator is experimentally demonstrated by integrating magneto&#8208;optical InSb onto a terahertz silicon topological chip. The simultaneous breaking of spatial and temporal reversal symmetries forms a valley&#8208;conserved non&#8208;reciprocal waveguide mode, enabling a compact cavity size of 6.4 &#215; 2.5&#955;2 and a low insertion loss of 2.6 dB, with actively tunable isolation ratios up to 64.3 dB.








Abstract
Chip&#8208;scale non&#8208;reciprocity is essential for advancing integrated photonics, particularly in realizing photonic circulators and isolators for data communication, signal modulation, and quantum computing. However, achieving a non&#8208;reciprocal silicon chip with a small footprint, high isolation ratio, low loss, and active control remains a challenge. Here, a non&#8208;reciprocal topological silicon chip based on magneto&#8208;optical Indium Antimonide (InSb) integrated valley Hall system is reported. The valley&#8208;conserved non&#8208;reciprocal modes, realized by breaking both time&#8208;reversal and spatial&#8208;inversion symmetries, enable ultra&#8208;compact and efficient non&#8208;reciprocal photonic devices that outperform conventional chips. A maximum isolation ratio of 64.3&#160;dB and a low chip loss of 2.6&#160;dB is experimentally achieved by fine&#8208;tuning the non&#8208;reciprocal critical coupling points of a topological cavity with a small footprint of 6.4 &#215; 2.5&#955;2. An all&#8208;optical method is also applied to actively modulate the isolation ratio from 0 to 48&#160;dB. The development of a non&#8208;reciprocal topological silicon chip marks a pivotal advancement in communication systems, LiDAR, terahertz technologies, quantum computing, and cryptography.

         <title>Spontaneous Twist of Ferroelectric Smectic Blocks in Polar Fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral ground state of ferroelectric smectric is discovered which emerges in an achiral rod mesogen. This is not due to the torque&#8208;driven effect on the surface. The research confirms that the polar smectric blocks are twisted despite its high elasticity. Such a structure is predominantly generated in molecules with larger dipole moments, smaller dipole angles, and smaller aspect ratios.








Abstract
In soft matter, the polar orientational order of molecules can facilitate the coexistence of structural chirality and ferroelectricity. The ferroelectric nematic (NF) state, exhibited by achiral calamitic molecules with large dipole moments, serves as an ideal model for the emergence of spontaneous structural chirality. This chiral ground state arises from a left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed twist of polarization due to depolarization effects. In contrast, the ferroelectric smectic state, characterized by a polar lamellar structure with lower symmetry, experiences significantly higher energy associated with layer&#8208;twisting deformations and the formation of domain walls, thus avoiding a continuously twisted layered structure. In this study, two types of achiral molecules (BOE&#8208;NO2 and DIOLT) are reported that possess different molecular structures but exhibit a NF&#8211;ferroelectric smectic phase sequence. It is demonstrated that the chiral ground state of NF is inherited in the ferroelectric smectic phases of BOE&#8208;NO2, which features larger dipole moments and a steric hindrance moiety, thereby triggering the formation of the twisted polar smectic blocks.

         <title>Suppression of Stacking Faults for Stable Formamidinium&#8208;Rich Perovskite Absorbers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors show that the (011)C perovskite planes are prone to stacking faults formation in all leading formamidinium&#8208;rich perovskite compositions. Using ethylene thiourea as a precursor additive, Othman et&#160;al. suppress those vulnerable facets, significantly enhancing the absorber's intrinsic stability under various operational conditions.









Abstract
The poor intrinsic perovskite absorber stability is arguably a central limitation challenging the prospect of commercialization for photovoltaic (PV) applications. Understanding the nanoscopic structural features that trigger instabilities in perovskite materials is essential to mitigate device degradation. Using nanostructure characterization techniques, we observe the local degradation to be initiated by material loss at stacking faults, forming inherently in the (011)&#8208;faceted perovskite domains in different formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite compositions. We introduce Ethylene Thiourea (ETU) as an additive into the perovskite precursor, which manipulates the perovskite crystal growth and results in dominantly in&#8208;and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (001) oriented perovskite domains. Combining in&#8208;depth experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations, we find that ETU lowered the perovskite formation energy, readily enabling crystallization of the perovskite phase at room temperature without the need for an antisolvent quenching step. This facilitated the fabrication of high&#8208;quality large area 5 cm by 5 cm blade&#8208;coated perovskite films and devices. Encapsulated and unmasked ETU&#8208;treated devices, with an active area of 0.2 cm2, retained &gt; 93 % of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) for &gt; 2100 hours at room temperature, and additionally, 1 cm2 ETU&#8208;treated devices maintained T80 (the duration for the PCE to decay to 80 % of the initial value) for &gt; 600 hours at 65 &#176;C, under continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination at the maximum power point in ambient conditions. Our demonstration of scalable and stable perovskite solar cells represents a promising step towards achieving a reliable perovskite PV technology.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance 721 nm&#8208;Excitable Photon Upconversion Porous Aromatic Frameworks for Broad&#8208;Range Oxygen Sensing and Efficient Heterogeneous Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance 721 nm&#8208;excitable solid upconversion porous aromatic frameworks (UC PAFs) was constructed and applied to a broad&#8208;range oxygen sensing and efficient heterogeneous photoredox catalysis. Moreover, homogeneous triple exciton energy is recognized to facilitate exciton diffusion, resulting in a high upconversion quantum yield (1.5% with an upper limit of 50%).








Abstract
The development of long&#8208;wavelength excitable solid upconversion materials and the regulation of exciton behavior is important for solar energy harvesting, photocatalysis, and other emerging applications. However, the approaches for regulating exciton diffusion are very limited, resulting in extremely poor photonic upconversion performance in solid&#8208;state. Here, the annihilation unit is integrated into porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) and loaded with photosensitizer to construct efficient 721 nm&#8208;excitable solid upconversion material (upconversion quantum yield up to 1.5%, upper limit 50%). Most importantly, we found that the steric hindrance of annihilator units breaks the &#960;&#8208;conjugation between the annihilation unit and the PAFs framework to form the homogeneous triplet exciton energy, which is conducive to the exciton diffusion. After increasing the exciton diffusion constant from 2.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6 to 1.34&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 cm2 s&#8722;1, the upconversion quantum yield is increased &#8776; 50&#8208;fold. Further, this solid upconversion material is utilized to demonstrate, for the first time, a broad&#8208;range oxygen sensing and 721 nm&#8208;driven heterogeneous and recyclable photoredox catalysis. These findings provide an important approach for regulating the behavior of triplet exciton in disorder solid materials to gain better upconversion performance, which will advance practical applications of organic photon upconversion in energy, chemistry, and photonics.

         <title>Revealing Trapped Carrier Dynamics at Buried Interfaces in Perovskite Solar Cells via Infrared&#8208;Modulated Action Spectroscopy with Surface Photovoltage Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new spectroscopy technique (i.e., pump&#8208;push&#8208;surface photovoltage) is introduced that monitors trapped carrier dynamics at the buried interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) via combining optical trap activation by infrared light with surface photovoltage detection. The proposed new approach separates interfacial carrier&#8208;loss contributions from the top and buried surfaces, providing design insights for achieving high&#8208;performance PeSCs through interface optimization. 








Abstract
Interfacial engineering is a proven strategy to enhance the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PeSCs) by controlling surface electronic defects and carrier trapping. The trap states at the &#8220;top&#8221; interface between the perovskite and upper charge extraction layers are experimentally accessible and have been extensively studied. However, the understanding of the unexposed &#8220;bottom&#8221; surface of the perovskite layer remains elusive, due to the lack of selective and non&#8208;destructive tools to access buried interface. Here, a new spectroscopy technique is introduced that monitors nanosecond to millisecond dynamics of trapped carriers at the buried interfaces by combining optical trap activation by infrared light with surface photovoltage detection. Applied to various PeSC architectures, this method reveals that most interfacial traps reside between the perovskite and hole transport layer, suggesting a predominance of hole traps (e.g., cation and lead vacancies) over electron traps (e.g., halide vacancies) in the studied PeSC systems. The proposed new approach separates interfacial carrier&#8208;loss contributions from the top and buried surfaces, providing design insights for achieving high&#8208;performance PeSCs through interface optimization.

         <title>Thermally Activated Swelling and Wetting Transition of Frozen Polymer Brushes:a New Concept for Surface Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach is introduced that&#160;leverages polymer phase transitions to modulate brush behavior. The oleophilic bottle brush system exhibits two distinct melting transitions&#8212;bulk and surface&#8212;enabling a two&#8208;stage swelling and wetting transition. These transitions can be controlled globally, or locally with a focused laser beam, offering a new strategy for designing adaptive surfaces based on intrinsic polymer properties.









Abstract
Functional polymer brush coatings have great potential for various industrial applications thanks to their ability to adapt to environmental stimuli, providing tunable surface properties. While existing approaches rely on polymer&#8208;solvent interactions and their response to external stimuli, changes in the intrinsic physical properties of the polymer also play a critical role in modulating brush behavior. In this context, the melting transition of a semicrystalline oleophilic poly&#8208;octadecylmethacrylate (P18MA) brush coating is shown to drive a swelling and wetting transition upon exposure to various liquid alkanes. The top surface of this polymer displays a somewhat higher melting temperature than the bulk, enabling separate control of the bulk&#8208;driven swelling and surface&#8208;driven wetting transitions. Laser&#8208;induced heating enables reversible on&#8208;demand activation of both transitions with micrometer lateral resolution. These findings suggest a new concept of polymer brush&#8208;based functional surfaces that allow for controlled fluid transport via separately switchable surface barriers and bulk transport layers based on a suitable choice of polymer&#8208;polymer and polymer&#8208;solvent interactions.

         <title>Evidence of Cation Symmetry Reduction Induced Bulk Photovoltaic Effect in Metal&#8208;Free Perovskite for Efficient Self&#8208;Powered X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relationship between the bulk photovoltaic effect and cation symmetry is systematically investigated, leading to the first realization of a self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detector in metal&#8208;free perovskites. Reduced cation symmetry enhances both the dipole moment and crystal polarity, facilitating carrier migration while simultaneously passivating defects. Leveraging the nonlinear photocurrent response mechanism, the X&#8208;ray detector achieves ultra&#8208;high equivalent sensitivity at zero bias.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free perovskite (MFP) X&#8208;ray detectors have attracted attention due to biocompatibility and synthesizability. However, the necessity of high voltages for MFP X&#8208;ray detectors affects stability and safety. Although, the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) with spontaneous electric field is a potential alternative for X&#8208;ray detection without high voltage, the constitutive relationship of BPVE in MFP remains unclear. Herein, the relationship between BPVE and cation symmetry is explored, and a self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detector is realized by BPVE in MFP for the first time. Theoretical studies show that cation symmetry reduction can distort the halide octahedron in one direction, which increases the dipole moment and crystal polarity to induce BPVE. The electric field from crystal polarity can drive the defect passivation by the equilibrium carrier and enhance the nonequilibrium carrier performance for BPVE. Then, polar MFP (mPAZE&#8208;NH4Br3 H2O) with excellent BPVE is designed. Due to the nonlinear response, the detector obtains a numerically recorded equivalent sensitivity (&#8776;103 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) at 0&#160;V. Moreover, the imaging performance is demonstrated and two image convolution kernels for it are constructed. Finally, it features continuous operation (20000 s) and temperature stability (&#8208;55&#8211;250 &#176;C). It is believed that the method will further drive the application of MFP for X&#8208;ray detectors.

         <title>Electron Extraction Optimization for Carbon&#8208;Based Hole&#8208;Conductor&#8208;Free Perovskite Photovoltaics With Record 1.41&#160;V VOC</title>

A gradient electron energy level strategy is constructed to reduce voltage losses in planar HTL&#8208;free CsPbI2Br C&#8208;PSCs. This electron extraction optimization enables rapid photogenerated electron extraction and carrier separation, thereby suppressing recombination at the back contact. The resulting PSCs deliver a record VOC of 1.41 V, a high PCE of 17.42% and a high stability, simultaneously.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells (PSCs) free of a hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL) have emerged as promising photovoltaics due to their low processing cost and superior stability. However, the voltage deficit resulting from inefficient carrier extraction causes insufficient power conversion efficiency (PCE), severely hindering their progress. Here, a gradient electron energy level modulation strategy proves effective in reducing voltage losses through the rapid extraction of photogenerated electrons. This process enhances carrier separation/collection and reduces recombination at the back contact, thereby achieving high&#8208;performance photovoltaics. It is demonstrated that the front electron extraction, equally critical as the prevailing back perovskite/carbon contact, accounts for the significant contributing factor of voltage deficit in carbon&#8208;based HTL&#8208;free PSCs. The resulting PSCs deliver a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.41&#160;V and a PCE of 17.42% and retain more than 92% of their initial efficiency after 1, 000&#160;h. These results highlight the significant potential of carbon&#8208;based HTL&#8208;free perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Time&#8208;Division Multiplexing Physical Unclonable Functions Based on Multicolor Phosphorescent Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A time&#8208;division multiplexing physical unclonable function (TDM&#8208;PUF) label based on multicolor phosphorescent carbon dots (CDs) is proposed, which leverages the variations in wavelengths and lifetimes of the phosphorescent CDs to construct time&#8208;resolved multidimensional cryptographic protocols. This study provides a competitive anti&#8208;counterfeiting label and inspires the development of novel anti&#8208;counterfeiting strategies.








Abstract
Phosphorescent materials offer a promising approach to information encryption due to their long luminescence lifetimes and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios. However, fixed phosphorescent patterns are vulnerable to imitation over time, limiting their effectiveness in advanced encryption. Here, a time&#8208;division multiplexing physical unclonable function (TDM&#8208;PUF) label utilizing multicolor phosphorescent carbon dots (CDs) is proposed that leverages variations in wavelength and lifetime to construct time&#8208;resolved, multidimensional cryptographic protocols. Efficient multi&#8208;color phosphorescence in CDs is achieved by enhancing intersystem crossing, suppressing non&#8208;radiative transitions through confinement effects, and regulating emission spectra via energy transfer. The random spatial distribution and unpredictable emissions of phosphorescent CDs significantly enhance the complexity of the PUF system, thereby fortifying its defenses against mimicry attacks. Furthermore, this PUF system exhibits multiple optical responses over time, allowing correct information recognition only at specified time nodes, achieving time&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Finally, by segmenting PUF labels based on emission color and time channels, non&#8208;overlapping multicolor and multi&#8208;time segments are achieved, enabling highly secure time&#8208;division multiplexed encryption.

     alt="Time-Division Multiplexing Physical Unclonable Functions Based on Multicolor Phosphorescent Carbon Dots"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A time-division multiplexing physical unclonable function (TDM-PUF) label based on multicolor phosphorescent carbon dots (CDs) is proposed, which leverages the variations in wavelengths and lifetimes of the phosphorescent CDs to construct time-resolved multidimensional cryptographic protocols. This study provides a competitive anti-counterfeiting label and inspires the development of novel anti-counterfeiting strategies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphorescent materials offer a promising approach to information encryption due to their long luminescence lifetimes and high signal-to-noise ratios. However, fixed phosphorescent patterns are vulnerable to imitation over time, limiting their effectiveness in advanced encryption. Here, a time-division multiplexing physical unclonable function (TDM-PUF) label utilizing multicolor phosphorescent carbon dots (CDs) is proposed that leverages variations in wavelength and lifetime to construct time-resolved, multidimensional cryptographic protocols. Efficient multi-color phosphorescence in CDs is achieved by enhancing intersystem crossing, suppressing non-radiative transitions through confinement effects, and regulating emission spectra via energy transfer. The random spatial distribution and unpredictable emissions of phosphorescent CDs significantly enhance the complexity of the PUF system, thereby fortifying its defenses against mimicry attacks. Furthermore, this PUF system exhibits multiple optical responses over time, allowing correct information recognition only at specified time nodes, achieving time-resolved anti-counterfeiting. Finally, by segmenting PUF labels based on emission color and time channels, non-overlapping multicolor and multi-time segments are achieved, enabling highly secure time-division multiplexed encryption. The study provides a competitive anti-counterfeiting label and inspires the development of novel anti-counterfeiting strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Porous Single&#8208;Crystalline Molybdenum Nitride Monoliths at the Centimeter Scale Surpass Platinum for all pH Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;sized porous single&#8208;crystalline MoN monoliths with unsaturated Mo&#8211;N coordination structures are fabricated through solid&#8208;state phase transformation. The porous single&#8208;crystalline MoN integrates the structural features, suitable hydrogen adsorption energy, high electronic conductivity and intrinsic catalytic activity, demonstrating low Tafel slopes, minimal charge transfer resistances and long&#8208;term stability across all&#8208;pH conditions, significantly surpassing traditional Pt/C electrodes.








Abstract
Platinum is widely used in the important components in most electrochemical energy conversion systems while as a noble metal it faces the inevitable challenge of limited reserves. Herein, porous single&#8211;crystalline (PSC) molybdenum nitride (MoN) monoliths are reported at the centimeter scale that surpass platinum for all&#8211;pH hydrogen evolution. Free&#8211;standing PSC MoN electrode with the pore size of &#8776;6&#160;nm and porosity of &#8776;72% present both noble&#8211;metal&#8211;like electronic structure and unsaturated Mo&#9472;N coordination structures at surface, contributing to remarkably high intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. The unprecedented overpotentials of as low as 13 and 11&#160;mV are presented at the geometrical current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution in H2SO4 (pH 0) and KOH (pH 14) media, respectively, which is dramatically superior to commercial Pt electrodes. As a result of the structural stability, the outstanding long&#8211;term durability for all pH hydrogen evolution is demonstrated without visible degradation in a continuous operation for 300&#160;h.

         <title>Energy Transfer Loop Enables Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with &gt;20% EQE and Near&#8208;Zero Roll&#8208;Offs at 104 Nits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence diodes with the record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.8% and the record&#8208;low EQE roll&#8208;off of only 2.6% at 104 nits is first realized through an &#8220;energy transfer loop&#8221; strategy, in which a TADF sensitizer 24DDMACPPPO with vibration&#8208;free reverse intersystem crossing is used to displace TADF emitter in triplet&#8208;singlet up&#8208;conversion for phonon decoupling, leading to markedly enhanced radiation and suppressed quenching.








Abstract
The bottleneck in efficiency stability at high luminance limits the development of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) diodes, due to the insufficient management of quenching factors, especially exciton&#8208;phonon coupling during reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) assistant with vibrational coupling. Herein, this challenge is overcome by a TADF sensitizer based &#8220;energy transfer loop&#8221; strategy. A dimethylacridine&#8208;phosphole oxide hybrid sensitizer named 24DDMACPPPO is constructed with vibration&#8208;free RISC and excited&#8208;state energy levels equal to a TADF emitter 4CzTPNBu. The former displaces the latter in RISC for phonon decoupling through reverse triplet and positive singlet energy transfer between them. As a result, co&#8208;doping 0&#160;.1%wt. 24DDMACPPPO doubles the RISC rate constant and triples the singlet radiation rate of 4CzTPNBu, and simultaneously nearly halves non&#8208;radiation rate constants, giving rise to 70% and 90% increased photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;luminescence quantum efficiencies of 4CzTPNBu. More importantly, the energy transfer loop between 24DDMACPPPO and 4CzTPNBu combines their advantages in RISC, quenching suppression, and singlet radiation, giving rise to the record values of external quantum efficiency (&#8776;23%wt.) and roll&#8208;off (2.6%) at 104&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Large&#8208;Area Perovskite Solar Cells via a Multifunctional Crystallization Regulating Passivation Additive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chlorine&#8208;substituted aromatic polycyclic compound is introduced into perovskite solar cells to regulate perovskite crystallization, passivate various defects, and enhance hole transport at the HTL/perovskite interface. This approach achieved high efficiencies of 25.04% for 1 cm2 cells and 22.81% for 12 cm2 modules, with excellent stability (maintaining 80% of initial efficiency after 2500 h of MPP tracking under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 standards).








Abstract
Film morphology and surface/interface defect density play a critical role in determining the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a chlorine&#8208;substituted aromatic polycyclic derivative (BNCl) is reported, which shows strong interaction with both lead iodide and dimethyl sulfoxide, to regulate the crystallization of perovskite, along with effective passivation of grain boundaries and surface. In addition, the extruded BNCl molecule at the hole transport layer (HTL)/perovskite interface can facilitate the hole transport, leading to better charge transfer. As a result, certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.04% and 22.81% are achieved for PSCs and minimodules with aperture areas of 1 cm2 and 12 cm2 respectively. In addition, the device maintained 80% of its initial efficiency after 2500 h of maximum power point (MPP) tracking under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 standard.

         <title>Synergistic Interface Engineering via o&#8208;Difluorobenzene&#8208;Mediated HPWO Crystallization and ITO Fluorination for 20.57% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;action optimization strategy is developed combining the fluorination of ITO electrodes with precisely controlled crystallization of phosphotungstic acid, which establishes favorable energy level alignment and reduces interface trap density to obtain 20.57% efficiency of organic solar cells.








Abstract
Interfacial energy loss is a critical challenge in achieving high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs), primarily due to mismatched energy levels and inefficient charge collection. Herein, a bifunctional interface engineering strategy is proposed, employing an ethanol/o&#8208;difluorobenzene (EtOH/o&#8208;DFB) dual&#8208;solvent system for phosphotungstic acid (HPWO) processing. During film formation, o&#8208;DFB regulates HPWO crystallization by suppressing excessive aggregation, while enabling in situ ITO fluorination through the adsorbed o&#8208;DFB. This synergistic approach simultaneously mitigates the trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination at the hole transport layer while enhancing the electrode work function, resulting in better ohmic contact, minimized trap&#8208;state densities, and improved energy level alignment at the electrode/active layer interface. The effectiveness of this strategy is demonstrated across multiple active layer systems. Remarkable power conversion efficiencies of 19.55%, 20.07%, and 20.57% are achieved for PM6/L8&#8208;BO, D18/L8&#8208;BO, and D18/BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based OSCs, respectively. Notably, the 20.57% PCE represents one of the highest efficiencies reported to date for OSCs, highlighting the potential of this bifunctional interface engineering strategy in advancing high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaics.

         <title>O, S, and N Bridged Atoms Screening on 2D Conjugated Central Units of High&#8208;Performance Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
O, S, and N atoms are adopted to bridge the 2D conjugated central cores, yielding three acceptors of CH&#9472;O, CH&#9472;S, and CH&#9472;N. CH&#9472;N&#8208;based device affords the highest fill factor of 83.13% in organic photovoltaics and the first&#8208;class binary device efficiency of 20.23%.








Abstract
Almost all of central cores in high&#8208;performance acceptors are limited to the electron&#8208;withdrawing diimide structure currently, which constrains further acceptor structural innovation greatly. Herein, oxygen (O), sulfur (S), and nitrogen (N) atoms are adopted to bridge the 2D conjugated central cores, yielding three acceptor platforms of CH&#9472;O, CH&#9472;S, and CH&#9472;N that differ in structure by only two atoms. Because of the characteristic atomic outer electron configuration and hybrid orbital orientation, O&#8208;, S&#8208;, and N&#8208;bridged central cores display quite different conformations and electronic properties, namely, dibenzodioxin (planar, non&#8208;aromatic), thianthrene (puckered, non&#8208;aromatic) and phenazine (planar, aromatic), respectively. A systematic investigation discloses how the central core, especially its p&#8208;&#960; orbital overlap between lone pair on O/S/N and coterminous benzene planes, affect the intrinsic photoelectronic properties of acceptors for the first time. Finally, CH&#9472;N&#8208;based binary device affords the highest fill factor of 83.13% in organic photovoltaics along with a first&#8208;class efficiency of 20.23%. By evaluating the strictly controlled O&#8208;, S&#8208;, and N&#8208;bridged molecular platforms comprehensively, the work reveals the potential uniqueness of diimide in determining the excellent photovoltaic outcomes of acceptors.

         <title>Microbial Photosynthetic Oxygenation and Radiotherapeutic Sensitization Enables Pyroptosis Induction for Combinatorial Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the preparation of lanthanum oxide nanoparticles (La2O3 NPs) via a solid&#8208;phase synthesis method, combined with cyanobacteria (Cyan) to effectively alleviate hypoxia. These components are confined within the tumor microenvironment using a thermosensitive hydrogel, enhancing the sensitivity of radiotherapy for colorectal and lung cancers. By alleviating hypoxia through cyanobacteria&#8208;mediated photosynthetic oxygenation, La2O3 NPs not only promote reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, triggering pyroptosis via GSDMD activation, but also amplify radiotherapy&#8208;induced pyroptosis mediated by GSDME. This dual mechanism provides a powerful strategy to overcome hypoxia&#8208;induced radiotherapy resistance in colorectal and lung cancers.








Abstract
Rectal cancer surgery is challenging due to the complex anatomy, making it difficult to achieve clear surgical margins. Radiotherapy (RT) plays a crucial role, especially in treating locally recurrent rectal cancer and preserving anal function. However, its effectiveness is often limited by tumor hypoxia, particularly prevalent in hypoxic regions near the bowel wall in colorectal cancer. Hypoxia contributes to both radiation resistance and apoptosis resistance, compromising RT outcomes. To overcome hypoxia&#8208;driven radiotherapy resistance, this work designs and engineers a radiotherapy&#8208;sensitizing bioplatform for efficient cancer RT. It combines lanthanum oxide nanoparticles (La2O3 NPs) with cyanobacteria, which produces oxygen through photosynthesis. This bioplatform uniquely reduces tumor hypoxia, enhances radiation deposition, and improves RT efficacy. La2O3 NPs further enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) production induced by radiation, triggering pyroptosis via the ROS&#8208;NLRP3&#8208;GSDMD pathway, while RT amplifies pyroptosis through GSDME, circumventing tumor apoptosis resistance. The further integrated thermosensitive hydrogels ensure precise localization of the bioplatform, reducing systemic toxicity and improving therapeutic specificity. Compared to conventional therapies, this dual&#8208;action system addresses hypoxia, RT resistance, and apoptosis resistance more effectively. In vivo and in vitro hypoxia models validate its potent anti&#8208;tumor efficacy, offering valuable insights for refining clinical treatment paradigms.

         <title>AI&#8208;Generated Ammonium Ligands for High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable 2D/3D Heterojunction Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning procedure combined with an artificial intelligence (AI) model are used to accelerate the generation of ammonium ligands (ALs) in 2D perovskites. The relationship between the carrier transport barrier and the structure of ALs is explored. Utilizing the AI&#8208;designed ALs significantly enhances the carrier transport of the 2D perovskites, leading to high&#8208;efficiency and stable 2D/3D perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The 2D/3D heterojunction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit remarkable stability, but the quantum well in the 2D perovskite capping layer hinders the carrier transport, thereby lowering the power conversion efficiency (PCE). The relationship between the transport barrier and the complex structure of ammonium ligands (ALs) is currently poorly understood, thus leading to the one&#8208;sided approach and inefficient process in the development of 2D perovskite. Here, a machine learning procedure is established to comprehensively explore the relationship and combined it with an artificial intelligence (AI) model based on reinforcement learning algorithm to accelerate the generation of ALs. Finally, the AI&#8208;designed ALs improved the carrier transport performance of the 2D perovskite capping layer, and we achieved a certified PCE of 26.12% in inverted PSCs. The devices retained 96.79% of the initial PCE after 2000 h operation in maximum power point tracking under 1&#8208;sun illumination at 85&#176;C.

         <title>Highly Defective Ultrafine Carbon Nanoreactors Enriched with Edge&#8208;Type Zn&#8208;N3P1 Moiety Boosting Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous&#8208;dominant carbon nanoreactor is designed with dimensions in the range of 15&#8211;43 nm with edge&#8208;rich defective atomic Zn sites. The crystal size and pore diameter of this carbon nanoreactors can be precisely adjusted to enable tunable mass diffusion pathways and porosities. The hydrophobic nature of 25 nm nanoreactors maximizes the nonkinetic advantages of active site exposure and rapid O2 mass transfer at the triple&#8208;phase interface.








Abstract
High&#8208;active nonplatinum group metal oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts have great potential to improve fuel cell and metal&#8211;air battery performance due to their efficiency and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, a fundamental understanding of their size&#8208;dependent structure&#8211;performance relationships remain elusive. Here a mesoporous&#8208;dominant carbon nanoreactor with dimensions in the range of 15&#8211;43 nm with edge&#8208;rich defective atomic Zn sites is designed. The crystal size and pore diameter of this carbon nanoreactors can be precisely adjusted to enable tunable mass diffusion pathways and porosities. Importantly, the hydrophobic nature of 25 nm nanoreactors maximizes the nonkinetic advantages of active site exposure and rapid O2 mass transfer at the triple&#8208;phase interface. The developed Zn&#8208;N&#8208;P/NPC catalysts delivers outstanding alkaline and acidic ORR performance with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.92 and 0.80 V, respectively, as well as excellent zinc&#8211;air battery performance with charge/discharge over 400 h under 20 mA cm&#8722;2. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations indicate that the enhanced ORR catalytic activity of Zn&#8208;N&#8208;P/NPC stems from the introduction of P atoms and edge carbon defects effectively exciting the localized electronic asymmetric distribution of Zn species. The findings provide new perspectives on the size effect of porous carbon supports for the development of efficient cathodes catalysts with multifunctionality.

         <title>Customized Multifunctional Additive Regulates 1.67 eV&#8208;Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Crystallization for Four&#8208;Terminal Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>

A doping strategy of incorporating Bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene (BTFIB) additive in 1.67 eV WBG perovskite precursor has been proposed to passivate uncoordinated lead ions and iodide vacancies and retard the crystallization of perovskite. Finally, BTFIB&#8208;based perovskite solar cells yielded a champion efficiency of 23.05% (certified 22.21%) and enabled a four&#8208;terminal perovskite/Si tandem cell with a PCE of 31.20% and excellent long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs, Eg &gt;&#160;1.6&#160;eV), serving as the top cell in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (PSTSCs), play an indispensable role in absorbing high energy photons and increasing overall efficiency. However, WBG PSCs often suffer from severe light&#8208;induced phase segregation and significant non&#8208;radiative recombination losses due to uncontrolled rapid crystallization. Here, polyfluoride molecular additives are designed and incorporated via (diacetoxyiodo)benzene into WBG perovskite, to regulate crystallization process of perovskite films and thereby reduce defects. (Bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene (BTFIB) can passivate uncoordinated lead ions and iodide vacancies, thereby inhibiting phase separation caused by iodide migration and reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination loss during charge transport. Moreover, the introduction of BTFIB can effectively moderate the film formation process and confer excellent hydrophobic properties to the films. Consequently, BTFIB&#8208;based 1.67 eV&#8208;WBG perovskite devices yield a champion efficiency of 23.05% (certified efficiency of 22.21%), enabling a 31.20% efficiency in four&#8208;terminal PSTSCs, along with excellent open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.246&#160;V and fill factor of 85.34%. After 2500&#160;h of aging in a glovebox, the device retained 80% of its initial efficiency.

         <title>Atomic Insights Into Self&#8208;Assembly of Zingibroside R1 and its Therapeutic Action Against Fungal Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cryo&#8208;EM reveals Zingibroside R1 (ZR1) undergoes self&#8208;assemble helical nanofibrils. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding interface between ZR1 nanofibrils and glucan compromises membrane integrity, inhibiting C. albicans proliferation in vitro and in vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) model mice in vivo. ZR1 gel could also deliver probiotic Lactobacillus to restore the vaginal microenvironment, synergistically inhibiting VVC.








Abstract
Natural products are a crucial resource for drug discovery, but poor understanding of the molecular&#8208;scale mechanisms of their self&#8208;assembly into soluble, bioavailable hydrogels limits their applications and therapeutic potential. It is demonstrated that Zingibroside R1 (ZR1), derived from Panax notoginseng, undergoes spontaneous self&#8208;assemble into a hydrogel comprising helical nanofibrils with potent antifungal activity lacking in its monomeric state. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) revealed an intricate hydrogen&#8208;bonding network that facilitates ZR1 nanofibril formation, characterized by a hydrophobic core and hydrophilic exterior architecture, which underpin its binding activity with cell wall in the vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) pathogen, C. albicans. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding interface between ZR1 gel and glucan compromises membrane integrity, inhibiting C. albicans proliferation in vitro and in VVC model mice in vivo. ZR1 gel could also deliver probiotic Lactobacillus, synergistically inhibiting VVC and restoring the vaginal microenvironment. This study advances the mechanistic understanding of ZR1's structure&#8208;function relationships, offering valuable insights into the rational design and therapeutic optimization of natural product&#8208;based hydrogels.

         <title>Optimization of Core&#8211;Shell Ternary Electrodes for High&#8208;Performance Ionic Actuator in Soft Gripper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8211;shell ternary electrode (Opt&#8208;SWCNTs/PEDOT:PSS/IL) is developed via a simple two&#8208;step dispersion and vacuum filtration process, with component ratios optimized to achieve excellent mechanical toughness and electrical conductivity based on simulation results. The resulting actuators demonstrate high strain and blocking force, enabling precise gripping and complex deformation, showing great potential for soft robotics and next&#8208;generation electrochemical actuators.








Abstract
Ionic actuators based on composite electrodes consisting of nanomaterials and conducting polymer typically offer the advantages of low&#8208;voltage operation and high stability, however, electrode preparation using conventional mixing suffers from issues of ineffective dispersion of nanomaterials, greatly diminishing their synergistic effects. Here, the ternary electrode system based on SWCNTs/PEDOT: PSS/ionic liquid using the two&#8208;step dispersion process is optimized, achieving a uniformly coated core&#8211;shell structure with high conductivity (&#8776;392.4 S cm&#8722;1). The ions migration process is analyzed according to the core&#8211;shell model, further optimization of the ternary electrode and device structure enables the actuator to realize the peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak strain per volt reaching 1.3% V&#8722;1 and normalized blocking force of 0.15&#160;MPa V&#8722;1 (&#8776;89.2 times its own weight), with stable performance maintained over 1 million cycles. Therefore, the actuator can be utilized for the assembly of multi&#8208;clawed grippers to grasp precision components or larger objects. Multiple connected actuators fulfill a complex deformation, indicating promising applications in smart grippers, bioinspired robotics, and human&#8211;machine interaction.

         <title>Interstitial&#8208;Substitutional&#8208;Mixed Solid Solution of RuO2 Nurturing a New Pathway Beyond the Activity&#8208;Stability Linear Constraint in Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An AEM&#8208;derived proton acceptor&#8208;electron donor mechanism is proposed in RuO2 by constructing an interstitial&#8208;substitutional mixed solid solution structure (C,Ta&#8208;RuO2), in which the interstitial C as the proton acceptor decreases the deprotonation energy barrier, while the substitutional Ta as the electron donor weakens the Ru&#9472;O bond covalency, thereby breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off of RuO2 in acidic OER.








Abstract
The acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane electrolyzer (PEMWE) often face a trade&#8208;off between activity and stability due to inherent linear relationship and overoxidation of metal atoms in highly oxidative environments, while following the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Herein, a favorable AEM&#8208;derived proton acceptor&#8208;electron donor mechanism (PAEDM) is proposed in RuO2 by constructing interstitial&#8208;substitutional mixed solid solution structure (denoted as C,Ta&#8208;RuO2), which can effectively break the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off of RuO2 in acidic OER. In situ spectroscopy experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the interstitial C as the proton acceptor reduces the deprotonation energy barrier, enhancing catalytic activity, while the substitutional Ta as the electron donor donates electrons to the Ru sites via bridging oxygen, weakening the Ru&#9472;O bond covalency and preventing over&#8208;oxidation of surface Ru, thereby ensuring long&#8208;term stability. Under the guidance of this mechanism, the optimized C,Ta&#8208;RuO2 simultaneously achieves far low overpotential (&#951;10 = 171&#160;mV) and ultra&#8208;long stability (over 1300&#160;h) for the acidic OER. More remarkably, a homemade PEMWE using C,Ta&#8208;RuO2 as the anode also shows high water splitting performance (1.63&#160;V@1 A cm&#8722;2). This work supplies a novel strategy to guide future developments on efficient OER electrocatalysts toward water oxidation.

         <title>Direct Recycling of Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes Through Photocatalytic Correction of Anti&#8208;Site Defects</title>

We employ photocatalysis to decrease the iron migration barrier, enabling the repositioning of disordered iron atoms into their designated octahedral sites while simultaneously facilitating Li+ diffusion into the LFP lattice, thereby realizing the direct recovery of S&#8208;LFP. This method has substantial environmental and economic benefits, making it a promising solution for sustainable lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling.








Abstract
Fe&#8208;Li (FeLi) anti&#8208;site defects, commonly observed in degraded LiFePO4 cathodes, impede Li+ mobility and disrupt the electronic pathways, leading to significant performance degradation in LFP. However, addressing FeLi anti&#8208;site defects to achieve direct recycling of LFP remains challenging due to Fe high migration energy barriers and the lattice distortions they induce. Here, a feasible strategy is proposed for LFP regeneration by utilizing photocatalysis to reduce the Fe migration barrier. This approach facilitates repositioning disordered Fe atoms to their designated octahedral sites while simultaneously enabling Li+ diffusion into the LFP lattice, thus restoring capacity and ensuring cycling stability. The mechanism of the photocatalysis regeneration strategy is comprehensively analyzed through a combination of theoretical calculations, in&#8208;depth atomic characterization techniques, and electrochemical evaluations. Notably, this strategy is adaptable to varying levels of FeLi anti&#8208;site defects in spent LFP. Furthermore, life cycle analysis highlights the substantial environmental and economic benefits of this advanced strategy, making it a promising solution for sustainable lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Fluorinated Ni Single Atom Catalyst for Efficient Artificial Photosynthetic Diluted CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, synergistic spatial and electronic structure regulation of conjugated Ni single&#8208;atom catalysts are achieved through a dual&#8208;fluorination strategy. Under diluted CO2 (10%) atmosphere, TPB&#8208;SA2F&#8208;Ni obtains the highest reported CO yield (30344.4 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) among heterogeneous catalytic systems with 98% CO selectivity.








Abstract
The development of efficient photocatalysts to convert dilute CO2 from flue gas into high value&#8208;added products is a promising approach to achieving carbon neutrality. In this work, a dual&#8208;fluorinated Ni single atom photocatalyst is reported for the photoreduction of diluted CO2 to CO. Under a dilute CO2 (10%) atmosphere, TPB&#8208;SA2F&#8208;Ni achieves the highest reported CO yield (30344.4&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) among heterogeneous catalytic systems with a CO selectivity of 98%. Kevin probe force microscopy and photoelectrochemical characterizations indicate that dual&#8208;fluorination strategy enhances photoexcited electron transfer between the photosensitizer and photocatalyst by optimizing the conjugated electronic structure. Pore size distribution and CO2 adsorption experiments show that the uniform microporous structure induced by the dual&#8208;F site further enhanced the ability of the Ni&#8208;N2O2 active site to capture CO2 molecules. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the high CO yield of TPB&#8208;SA2F&#8208;Ni stems from a lowered energy barrier for *COOH intermediate formation.

         <title>Direct Experimental Evidence of Low Carrier Scattering Potential in High Performance Thermoelectric AgSbSe2 Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of high&#8208;quality AgSb0.973Cd0.017Se2 crystals with short&#8208;range order embeds within a long&#8208;range periodic structure, achieving the synergistic optimization of both electrical and phonon transport properties. Time&#8208;resolved reflectance spectroscopy provides clear evidence of a pronounced reduction in carrier scattering barriers, leads to a threefold enhancement in the average power factor (PFavg), ultimately achieving superior thermoelectric performance.








Abstract
Thermoelectric materials, like other electronic materials, require high carrier mobility, which is governed by carrier scattering potential. In addition to intrinsic acoustic phonon scattering, the extrinsic factors such as microstructure and atomic arrangement also have great influence on carrier transport in solids, e.g., the emerging thermoelectric material AgSbSe2 with strong cation disorder. However, the experimental evaluation of total carrier scattering potential and distinguishing the contributions from intrinsic and extrinsic scatterings is challenging at present. Here, the time&#8208;resolved ultrafast spectroscopy analysis utilizing a pump&#8208;probe scheme is performed to characterize the charge carrier dynamics of AgSbSe2 with femtosecond time resolution quantitatively. A significantly lowered total carrier scattering potential energy in Cd&#8208;doped AgSbSe2 crystal is determined, resulting from the elimination of grain boundaries and the presence of short&#8208;range order that leads to a negative extrinsic scattering potential. The reduction in carrier scattering potential leads to a threefold increase in the average power factor from 323 to 723 K. A maximum thermoelectric figure of merit of 1.7 is achieved in high&#8208;quality AgSb0.973Cd0.017Se2 crystal at 723 K, with the output efficiency of the single&#8208;leg thermoelectric device reaching a competitive value of 8%. This work reveals how to effectively characterize and modulate carrier scattering potential in thermoelectric compounds.

         <title>Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Deposition of Antigen Peptides on Bifidobacterium for Subintestinal Lymphatic System&#8208;Guided Personalized Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vaccine (Bif&#8208;OVA&#8208;Ocur) is designed to target gut&#8208;associated lymphoid tissues, promoting the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the expansion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)&#160;at mucosal sites. This targeted approach strengthens both mucosal and systemic immunes responses. These immune responses enable the immune system to specifically recognize and destroy tumor cells, thereby inhibiting tumor growth and progression.








Abstract
Gut&#8208;associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) possesses a highly specialized immune system and is rational as a foothold for oral tumor vaccines. Here, a noninvasive oral vaccine (Bif&#8208;OVA&#8208;Ocur) is designed to engage GALT, inducing both intestinal mucosal and systemic immunity for tumor therapeutics. The vaccine uses Bifidobacterium (Bif) as a delivery vehicle for tumor antigen peptides, which are coated with antigen peptides (OVA) and oxidized curdlan (Ocur) in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) manner. Upon oral administration, Bif&#8208;OVA&#8208;Ocur is efficiently directed to Peyer's patches (PPs) in the intestines and further presented to antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs), which then migrate to the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) to evoke specific T cell responses. In mouse models, Bif&#8208;OVA&#8208;Ocur effectively boosts the production of secretory immunoglobin A (SIgA) and promotes a strong mucosal and systemic immune response, leading to significant tumor suppression and resistance to tumor challenges. Importantly, the vaccine shows no systemic toxicity. This approach to harnessing the intestinal mucosal immune system offers valuable insights for the development of other non&#8208;invasive oral vaccines and therapeutic agents.

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Electric&#8208;Mechanical Coupling Selects Barrier Layer for Advanced Bismuth Telluride Thermoelectric Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermo&#8208;electric&#8208;mechanical coupling strategy proposed here predicts the feasibility of Ni2SbTe2 and NiTe2 as ideal TEbMs for (Bi,Sb)2Te3 and Bi2(Te,Se)3, based on three&#8208;phase thermodynamic equilibrium, electrical resistivity, and CTE compatibility. The fabricated TE generators demonstrate a third&#8208;party&#8208;verified conversion efficiency of 7.1% and a power density of 0.49 W cm&#8722;2 when the hot&#8208;side temperature is 523 K, with negligible degradation over 200 h.








Abstract
The long&#8208;term stability of thermoelectric generators, including those based on Bi2Te3, is hindered by the lack of ideal thermoelectric barrier materials (TEbMs). Conventional selection methods for TEbMs mainly rely on trial&#8208;and&#8208;error, which is time&#8208;consuming and does not reveal the underlying mechanisms. In this study, a new design principle for selecting TEbMs based on thermo&#8211;electric&#8211;mechanical coupling is proposed. By combining the phase diagram predictions with the thermal expansion coefficients and electrical resistivities of the potential reactants, the Ni2SbTe2 and NiTe2 compounds are identified as ideal TEbMs for (Bi,Sb)2Te3 and Bi2(Te,Se)3, respectively, leading to interfaces with high thermal stability, low contact resistivity, and high strength. The fabricated thermoelectric generator achieves a competitive conversion efficiency of 7.1% and a power density of 0.49 W cm&#8722;2 at hot&#8208;side and cold&#8208;side temperatures of 523 and 296 K, respectively. Moreover, performance degradation is negligible after 200&#160;h of cycling. This work demonstrates progress toward stable high&#8208;performance service, provides the foundation for applications in low&#8208;grade heat recovery, and offers new insights for more thermoelectric generators.

&lt;p&gt;The thermo-electric-mechanical coupling strategy proposed here predicts the feasibility of Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NiTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as ideal TEbMs for (Bi,Sb)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Te,Se)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, based on three-phase thermodynamic equilibrium, electrical resistivity, and CTE compatibility. The fabricated TE generators demonstrate a third-party-verified conversion efficiency of 7.1% and a power density of 0.49 W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; when the hot-side temperature is 523 K, with negligible degradation over 200 h.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-term stability of thermoelectric generators, including those based on Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is hindered by the lack of ideal thermoelectric barrier materials (TEbMs). Conventional selection methods for TEbMs mainly rely on trial-and-error, which is time-consuming and does not reveal the underlying mechanisms. In this study, a new design principle for selecting TEbMs based on thermo&#8211;electric&#8211;mechanical coupling is proposed. By combining the phase diagram predictions with the thermal expansion coefficients and electrical resistivities of the potential reactants, the Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NiTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compounds are identified as ideal TEbMs for (Bi,Sb)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Te,Se)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, leading to interfaces with high thermal stability, low contact resistivity, and high strength. The fabricated thermoelectric generator achieves a competitive conversion efficiency of 7.1% and a power density of 0.49 W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at hot-side and cold-side temperatures of 523 and 296 K, respectively. Moreover, performance degradation is negligible after 200&#160;h of cycling. This work demonstrates progress toward stable high-performance service, provides the foundation for applications in low-grade heat recovery, and offers new insights for more thermoelectric generators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decoupling Lithium Reutilization Behavior under Different Discharge Rates for Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uncovers the Li0 reutilization behavior of AFLMBs at different discharge rates, which exhibits a &#8220;volcano&#8208;type&#8221; variation. The opposite effects of the distribution relationship between fresh Li and residue Li0 and concentration polarization at specific discharge rate dominate Li0 reutilization. This cognition provides guidance toward high&#8208;power density AFLMBs under practical conditions.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal battery (AFLMB) has become an excellent candidate for long endurance electric vehicles and electric low altitude aircraft, profiting from its high energy density as well as outstanding manufacturing safety. However, the limitation at high discharge rates of AFLMBs is shrouded in mystery, yet to achieve more attention. Herein, the limitation of fast discharge for AFLMBs is dissected exhaustively, and a symptomatic strategy to break the limit is put forward, in order to eliminate the inevitable mismatch that lies in the inferior performance of AFLMBs. A &#8220;volcano&#8208;type&#8221; curve of capacity retention of AFLMBs is discovered with the discharge rate increased. Systematic investigation revealed that the overlapped spatial relationship between fresh deposited Li and residue Li0 facilitated the utilization of &#8220;recoverable Li0&#8221; (Li0) at the prophase of discharge rate increase. However, further enhanced discharge rate induced large concentration polarization (&#951;conc), reflecting limited Li+ diffusion. Enabling the electrolyte to rapidly transport Li+ by lowering &#951;conc increased the optimal discharge rate as well as the cycling stability of AFLMBs. This work reveals the rate&#8208;determining step for high&#8208;rate discharge and expands the employment boundary of AFLMBs under harsh conditions, providing a significant complement of present knowledge with respect to the power performance of AFLMBs.

Investigation of charge carrier dynamics in graphene/ MoS2 heterostructures under photoexcitation, revealing associated intraband THz responses. The study highlights charge transfer mechanisms and carrier lifetimes, advancing the understanding of light&#8208;matter interactions in 2D materials for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The engineering of terahertz phonons is challenging due to difficulties in achieving sub&#8208;nanometer material precision and in facilitating efficient phonon coupling at terahertz frequencies region. The effective generation, detection, and manipulation of terahertz phonons via the integration of atomically thin layers in van der Waals heterostructures can enable new designs for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic quantum devices, offering new avenues for thermal engineering in the terahertz regime. Here, optical pump terahertz probe and terahertz time&#8208;domain experiments are used to reveal the behavior of charge carrier transfer in real time at heterostructure interfaces of single&#8208;layer graphene and monolayer MoS2 upon photoexcitation and plausible mechanism has been put forward. Moreover, a temperature&#8208;dependent terahertz response of GM heterostructure along with experimental observation is explored in detail with considered appropriate theoretical models. These insights can prove valuable for designing the next generation of optoelectronic applications with stacked 2D heterostructures within the terahertz bandwidth.

         <title>Photogenetic&#8208;Like Liposomes Disrupt Neuroligin&#8208;3 Dependency to Enhance Glioma Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a light&#8208;responsive liposome Lip&#8208;CuRA that synergizes photothermal therapy (CuS/980&#160;nm) with dual NLGN3 regulation: RuBi&#8208;GABA/UCNPs suppress NLGN3 synthesis via Cl&#8315; channels, while GI254023X inhibits ADAM10&#8208;mediated release. In glioma models, this strategy blocks PI3K/Wnt pathways, reduces stemness, and prolongs survival through combined neuromodulation&#8208;photothermal effects.








Abstract
Neuronal activity is shown to potentiate glioma initiation, progression, and/or metastasis. A key mechanism in neural regulation of brain cancer involves the activity&#8208;dependent cleavage and release of the synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin&#8208;3 (NLGN3). Here, this report describes the preparation of optogenetics&#8208;like liposome Lip&#8208;CuRA, which is used to regulate the content of NLGN3 in neurons and mediate phototherapy in cancer cells. Lip&#8208;CuRA contains upconversion nanoparticles encapsulating CuS (CuS@PUCNPs), a visible light&#8208;activated neurotransmitter prodrug RuBi&#8208;GABA, and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM10) inhibitors GI254023X. Upon 980&#160;nm laser irradiation, the photothermal conversion of CuS not only induces tumor cell apoptosis, but also destroys liposome structure, releasing Rubi&#8208;GABA and GI254023X. The UCNPs convert the 980&#160;nm laser into 540&#160;nm, activating RuBi&#8208;GABA into GABA. GABA selectively opens Cl&#8315; channels in nerve cells, reducing the expression of NLGN3 and the degree of axonal connections. GI254023X inhibits the activity of the ADAM10 enzyme on the nerve surface, reducing the release of NLGN3, thereby blocking the transmission of proliferation and stemness signals. In the GL261&#8208;luc orthotopic glioma model, C6&#8208;luc orthotopic glioma model, and glioma patient&#8208;derived xenograft (PDX) model, Lip&#8208;CuRA effectively inhibits tumor recurrence, reduces glioma stemness, and extends survival through a synergistic photothermal and NLGN3&#8208;regulating therapy.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative plasmon&#8208;mediated electron emission (PMEE) nanocathode is developed through gold nanoparticle&#8208;decorated vertically aligned few&#8208;layer graphene, enabling synchronized generation of picosecond electron pulses and GHz electromagnetic radiation. This room&#8208;temperature system achieves exceptional performance of 8.81 &#215; 109 A&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;sr&#8722;1&#183;V&#8722;1 brightness and 0.97 eV energy spread, while operating at moderate excitation, offering a promising platform for compact and high&#8208;efficiency vacuum electronic devices.









Abstract
Vacuum electronic devices offer superior electron mobility and spatiotemporal electron manipulating precision, with recent challenges focusing on ultrafast electron pulses for high&#8208;frequency, high&#8208;energy, and high&#8208;resolution applications. Plasmon&#8208;mediated electron emission (PMEE) nanocathodes provide a promising solution by producing high&#8208;quality ultrafast electron pulses while simplifying the electron beam manipulation.

&lt;p&gt;An innovative plasmon-mediated electron emission (PMEE) nanocathode is developed through gold nanoparticle-decorated vertically aligned few-layer graphene, enabling synchronized generation of picosecond electron pulses and GHz electromagnetic radiation.

&lt;p&gt;Vacuum electronic devices offer superior electron mobility and spatiotemporal electron manipulating precision, with recent challenges focusing on ultrafast electron pulses for high-frequency, high-energy, and high-resolution applications. Plasmon-mediated electron emission (PMEE) nanocathodes provide a promising solution by producing high-quality ultrafast electron pulses while simplifying the electron beam manipulation. In this study, we developed a PMEE Au-on-Gr nanocathode using vertically aligned few-layer graphene decorated with gold nanoparticles, enabling synchronized generation of picosecond pulsed electron beam and electromagnetic radiation.

         <title>Constructing Controlled Vertical Gradient Morphology in Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Photovoltaics via Self&#8208;Assembled Interface Orthogonal Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled interface orthogonal strategy is first applied to construct pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction organic photovoltaics with controllable vertical gradient distribution morphology. Introducing low surface&#8208;energy N2200 to self&#8208;assemble molecular layer on PM6 surface overcomes erosion effect and modulates phase morphology, thus achieving the highest efficiency of 19.86% via air&#8208;printing process.








Abstract
Precisely regulating vertically distributed morphology by blade&#8208;coating process is crucial to realize high&#8208;performance large&#8208;scale pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction organic photovoltaics (OPVs). However, the thermodynamic motion and random diffusion of donor/acceptor (D/A) generated from the differences in surface energy and concentration during sequentially blade&#8208;coating process will cause great challenges for obtaining ideal active layer morphology. Herein, this study have proposed a self&#8208;assembled interface orthogonal strategy by introducing low surface energy guest (N2200) to form protective layer on PM6 surface, which counteracts erosion from orthogonal solution of acceptor to enhance continuity of D/A phases, thus promoting directional carrier migration and effectively suppressing energetic disorder. Finally, N2200&#8208;modified device achieves the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.86%, and large&#8208;area module (16.94 cm2) exhibits exceptional PCE (16.43%). This investigation presents innovative insights into morphology issue triggered by molecular motion and provides an effective method for air&#8208;printing large&#8208;scale OPVs with precisely controlled morphology based on non&#8208;halogenated solvent.

         <dc:description>
A machine learning framework is harnessed to scrutinize the thermodynamically induced crystal phase transition behavior of medium&#8208;entropy Prussian blue analogs (ME&#8208;PBA). This study provides a unified framework for understanding the crystal phase transformation in ME&#8208;PBA and is poised to lay the groundwork for the development of other polymetallic coordination polymer derivatives.









Abstract
Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are exemplary precursors for the synthesis of a diverse array of derivatives.Yet, the intricate mechanisms underlying phase transitions in these multifaceted frameworks remain a formidable challenge. In this study, a machine learning&#8208;guided analysis of phase transitions in a medium&#8208;entropy PBA system is delineated, utilizing an array of descriptors that encompass crystallographic phases, structural subtleties, and fluctuations in multimetal valence states. By integrating multimodal simulations with experimental validation, a thermodynamics&#8208;driven phase transformation model for medium&#8208;entropy PBA is established and accurately predicted the critical synthesis parameters. A constellation of advanced techniques&#8212;including atomic force microscopy coupled with Kelvin probe force microscopy for individual nanoparticles, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, operando ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy, in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, theoretical calculations, and multiphysics simulations&#8212;substantiated that the iron oxide@NiCoZnFe&#8208;PBA exhibits both exceptional stability and remarkable electrochemical activity. This investigation provides profound insights into the phase transition dynamics of polymetallic complexes and propels the rational design of other thermally&#8208;induced derivatives.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Halogen Pockets Steering *CO Adsorption Configurations for Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and synthesis of copper nanoparticles encaged in polymer&#8208;halogen pockets for selective CO2 reduction are presented. As a direct outcome, the strategy achieves selective conversion of ethylene and ethanol, &#8776;48.3 &#177; 1.3% selectivity for ethanol, and 60.3 &#177; 2.1% for ethylene.








Abstract
The selective CO2 electroreduction (CO2R) toward specific C2 products represents a critical challenge for practical applicability, requiring precise control over *CO intermediates. Herein, a &#8220;polymer&#8208;halogen&#8221; pocketed Cu catalyst is proposed, wherein the adjustable concentration of Iodide ion (I&#8722;) within the pocket enables continuous modulation of *CO adsorption configurations on the Cu, thereby enabling tailored CO2R toward ethylene or ethanol production. A perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA)&#8208;modified CuI catalyst is constructed, where I&#8722; is in situ leaching from CuI and subsequently confined by PFSA as an anion shielding layer to form polymer&#8208;halogen pockets. By tuning the thickness of PFSA shell, the amount of I&#8722; in the pocket can be controlled. The surface&#8208;enhanced in situ Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that the coverage of *CO intermediates on Cu surface increases and tends to adsorb at low coordination Cu sites in catalyst granule for dimerization reaction as the I&#8722; concentration in the pocket increases. Furthermore, the coordination environment exhibits distinct product selectivity. *CO at medium&#8208;coordinated sites favor ethanol production, while those at low&#8208;coordinated sites are conducive to ethylene formation. This strategy enables wide modulation of ethylene&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol ratios from 0.65 to 3.96, achieving peak Faradaic efficiencies (FE) of 60.3 &#177;&#160;2.1% for ethylene and 48.3 &#177;&#160;1.3% for ethanol.

         <title>Growth Control of InP/ZnSe Heterostructured Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The morphology of ZnSe epilayers on InP NCs is controlled, ranging from tetrapod to spherical InP/ZnSe heterostructured NCs, under the guidance of DFT calculations. The expanded morphology envelope permits InP/ZnSe heterostructured NCs to customize their photophysical characteristics from stable and pure emission to environment&#8208;sensitive ones, which will prompt their practical use in a range of photonic applications.








Abstract
The morphology of heterostructured semiconductor nanocrystals (h&#8208;NCs) dictates the spatial distribution of charge carriers and their recombination dynamics and/or transport, which are the main performance indicators of photonic applications utilizing h&#8208;NCs. The inability to control the morphology of heterovalent III&#8208;V/II&#8208;VI h&#8208;NCs composed of heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free elements hinders their practical use. As a case study of III&#8208;V/II&#8208;VI h&#8208;NCs, the growth control of ZnSe epilayers on InP NCs is demonstrated here. The anisotropic morphology in InP/ZnSe h&#8208;NCs is attributed to the facet&#8208;dependent energy costs for the growth of ZnSe epilayers on different facets of InP NCs, and effective chemical means for controlling the growth rates of ZnSe on different surface planes are demonstrated. Ultimately, this article capitalizes on the controlled morphology of InP/ZnSe h&#8208;NCs to expand their photophysical characteristics from stable and pure emission to environment&#8208;sensitive one, which will facilitate their use in a variety of photonic applications.

&lt;p&gt;The morphology of ZnSe epilayers on InP NCs is controlled, ranging from tetrapod to spherical InP/ZnSe heterostructured NCs, under the guidance of DFT calculations. The expanded morphology envelope permits InP/ZnSe heterostructured NCs to customize their photophysical characteristics from stable and pure emission to environment-sensitive ones, which will prompt their practical use in a range of photonic applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morphology of heterostructured semiconductor nanocrystals (&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-NCs) dictates the spatial distribution of charge carriers and their recombination dynamics and/or transport, which are the main performance indicators of photonic applications utilizing &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-NCs. The inability to control the morphology of heterovalent III-V/II-VI &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-NCs composed of heavy-metal-free elements hinders their practical use. As a case study of III-V/II-VI &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-NCs, the growth control of ZnSe epilayers on InP NCs is demonstrated here. The anisotropic morphology in InP/ZnSe &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-NCs is attributed to the facet-dependent energy costs for the growth of ZnSe epilayers on different facets of InP NCs, and effective chemical means for controlling the growth rates of ZnSe on different surface planes are demonstrated. Ultimately, this article capitalizes on the controlled morphology of InP/ZnSe &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-NCs to expand their photophysical characteristics from stable and pure emission to environment-sensitive one, which will facilitate their use in a variety of photonic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Information Density Enhancement Using Lossy Compression in DNA Data Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Explored deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) lossy compression models to increase the information density in DNA storage. This study compared these models with others, showing potential competitive advantages, in terms of information density and image quality. This study also examined model applications using convolutional neural networks for image quality assessment, highlighting the potential of DNA storage technology for handling complex data.








Abstract
This study develops two deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#160;lossy compression models, Models A and B, to encode grayscale images into DNA sequences, enhance information density, and enable high&#8208;fidelity image recovery. These models, distinguished by their handling of pixel domains and interpolation methods, offer a novel approach to data storage for DNA. Model A processes pixels in overlapped domains using linear interpolation (LI), whereas Model B uses non&#8208;overlapped domains with nearest&#8208;neighbor interpolation (NNI). Through a comparative analysis with Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG)&#160;compression, the DNA lossy compression models demonstrate competitive advantages in terms of information density and image quality restoration. The application of these models to the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset reveals their efficiency and the recognizability of decompressed images, which is validated by convolutional neural network (CNN) performance. In particular, Model B2, a version of Model B, emerges as an effective method for balancing high information density (surpassing over 20 times the typical densities of two bits per nucleotide) with reasonably good image quality. These findings highlight the potential of DNA&#8208;based data storage systems for high&#8208;density and efficient compression, indicating a promising future for biological data storage solutions.

         <title>Rapid Surface Reconstruction of In2S3 Photoanode via Flame Treatment for Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid surface reconstruction strategy is proposed to enhance the charge collection efficiency and stability of indium sulfide (In2S3) photoanode via a high&#8208;temperature flame treatment. This method selectively transforms the In2S3 surface into a diffusionless In2O3 and generates bulk sulfur vacancies, resulting in surface&#8208;reconstructed In2S3 (sr&#8208;In2S3). The sr&#8208;In2S3 exhibits an impressive photocurrent density of 8.5 mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming previously reported sulfide&#8208;based photoanodes.








Abstract
Surface reconstruction, reorganizing the surface atoms or structure, is a promising strategy to manipulate materials' electrical, electrochemical, and surface catalytic properties. Herein, a rapid surface reconstruction of indium sulfide (In2S3) is demonstrated via a high&#8208;temperature flame treatment to improve its charge collection properties. The flame process selectively transforms the In2S3 surface into a diffusionless In2O3 layer with high crystallinity. Additionally, it controllably generates bulk sulfur vacancies within a few seconds, leading to surface&#8208;reconstructed In2S3 (sr&#8208;In2S3). When using those sr&#8208;In2S3 as photoanode for photoelectrochemical water splitting devices, these dual functions of surface In2O3/bulk In2S3 reduce the charge recombination in the surface and bulk region, thus improving photocurrent density and stability. With optimized surface reconstruction, the sr&#8208;In2S3 photoanode demonstrates a significant photocurrent density of 8.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), marking a 2.5&#8208;fold increase compared to pristine In2S3 (3.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). More importantly, the sr&#8208;In2S3 photoanode exhibits an impressive photocurrent density of 7.3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.6&#160;V versus RHE for iodide oxidation reaction. A practical and scalable surface reconstruction is also showcased via flame treatment. This work provides new insights for surface reconstruction engineering in sulfide&#8208;based semiconductors, making a breakthrough in developing efficient solar&#8208;fuel energy devices.

         <title>Ferroelectric Stochasticity in 2D CuInP2S6 and Its Application for True Random Number Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a true random number generator (TRNG) based on stochastic ferroelectric polarization switching in 2D CuInP2S6 materials, is reported. The TRNG exhibits exceptional stochastic variability, surpassing conventional entropy metrics, and passes the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) randomness tests. Moreover, TRNG's unclonability is demonstrated through device&#8208;to&#8208;device variation, providing resilience against machine learning (ML) attacks.








Abstract
True random number generators (TRNGs), which create cryptographically secure random bitstreams, hold great promise in addressing security concerns regarding hardware, communication, and authentication in the Internet of Things (IoT) realm. Recently, TRNGs based on nanoscale materials have gained considerable attention for avoiding conventional and predictable hardware circuitry designs that can be vulnerable to machine learning (ML) attacks. In this article, a low&#8208;power and low&#8208;cost TRNG developed by exploiting stochastic ferroelectric polarization switching in 2D ferroelectric CuInP2S6 (CIPS)&#8208;based capacitive structures, is reported. The stochasticity arises from the probabilistic switching of independent electrical dipoles. The TRNG exhibits enhanced stochastic variability with near&#8208;ideal entropy, uniformity, uniqueness, Hamming distance, and independence from autocorrelation variations. Its unclonability is systematically examined using device&#8208;to&#8208;device variations. The generated cryptographic bitstreams pass the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) randomness tests. This nanoscale CIPS&#8208;based TRNG is circuit&#8208;integrable and exhibits potential for hardware security in edge devices with advanced data encryption.

         <title>Spiking Neural Network Integrated with Impact Ionization Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Neuron and a Ferroelectric Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Synapse</title>

2D spiking neural network consisting of 2D ferroelectric FET synapses and 2D impact ionization FET spiking neurons are demonstrated. This study marks a major leap in developing fast&#8208;switching, energy&#8208;efficient ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power devices vital for future artificial neural networks, addressing key challenges in energy management for spiking neuron devices.








Abstract
The integration of artificial spiking neurons based on steep&#8208;switching logic devices and artificial synapses with neuromorphic functions enables an energy&#8208;efficient computer architecture that mimics the human brain well, known as a spiking neural network (SNN). 2D materials with impact ionization or ferroelectric characteristics have the potential for use in such devices. However, research on 2D spiking neurons remains limited and investigations of 2D artificial synapses far more common. An innovative 2D spiking neuron is implemented using a WSe2 impact ionization transistor (I2FET), while a spiking neural network is formed by combining it with a 2D ferroelectric synaptic device (FeFET). The suggested 2D spiking neuron demonstrates precise spiking behavior that closely resembles that of actual neurons. In addition, it achieves a low energy consumption of 2&#160;pJ/spike. The better impact ionization properties of WSe2 are responsible for this efficiency. Furthermore, an all&#8208;2D SNN consisting of 2D I2FET neurons and 2D FeFET synapses is constructed, which achieves high accuracy of 87.5% in a face classification task by unsupervised learning. The integration of a 2D SNN with 2D steep&#8208;switching spiking neuronal devices and 2D synaptic devices shows great potential for the development of neuromorphic systems with improved energy efficiency and computational capabilities.

&lt;p&gt;The integration of artificial spiking neurons based on steep-switching logic devices and artificial synapses with neuromorphic functions enables an energy-efficient computer architecture that mimics the human brain well, known as a spiking neural network (SNN). 2D materials with impact ionization or ferroelectric characteristics have the potential for use in such devices. However, research on 2D spiking neurons remains limited and investigations of 2D artificial synapses far more common. An innovative 2D spiking neuron is implemented using a WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; impact ionization transistor (I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FET), while a spiking neural network is formed by combining it with a 2D ferroelectric synaptic device (FeFET). The suggested 2D spiking neuron demonstrates precise spiking behavior that closely resembles that of actual neurons. In addition, it achieves a low energy consumption of 2&#160;pJ/spike. The better impact ionization properties of WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are responsible for this efficiency. Furthermore, an all-2D SNN consisting of 2D I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;FET neurons and 2D FeFET synapses is constructed, which achieves high accuracy of 87.5% in a face classification task by unsupervised learning. The integration of a 2D SNN with 2D steep-switching spiking neuronal devices and 2D synaptic devices shows great potential for the development of neuromorphic systems with improved energy efficiency and computational capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Percolative Metal Microweb&#8208;Based Flexible Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery with Fast Charging and High Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel percolative metal microweb&#8208;based flexible electrode using electrohydrodynamic processes is developed. This lightweight and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) electrode enhances the electrochemical and mechanical performances of the resultant lithium&#8208;ion batteries with improved energy density, lithium&#8208;ion diffusion, and electron transfer. As a result, the lithium&#8208;ion battery developed here exhibits exceptional energy and power densities of 110 and 1048&#160;W&#160;kg&#8315;&#185;, respectively.








Abstract
Flexible and high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) encounter challenges due to the inherent trade&#8208;offs in conventional electrode designs, particularly concerning mechanical flexibility and high energy density. Here, a novel percolative metal microweb&#8208;based electrode, fabricated via electrohydrodynamic processes, yielding a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network structure with exceptional electrical properties and mechanical durability is introduced. This lightweight electrode design addresses the need for improved energy density by reducing the weight of the current collector, which typically accounts for more than 10% of the battery's weight. The 3D architecture of the electrode enhances the contact area with the electrolyte, thereby minimizing polarization voltage and improving lithium&#8208;ion diffusion. Furthermore, the low coating thickness&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio promotes electron transfer and mitigates capacity fade at high current densities. The microweb&#8208;based full cell exhibits energy and power densities of 110 and 1,048&#160;W&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; at 10 C, respectively, which are the highest reported values among LIBs utilizing similar materials. The design of the electrode proposed in this study is expected to significantly contribute to the development of wearable and flexible electronics.

The proposed &#181;LED pixel circuit utilizes IGZO/Te CFETs, which exhibits symmetrical ambipolar behavior. The IGZO/Te heterostructure is confirmed to consist of an amorphous IGZO layer and a hexagonal Te layer using HR&#8208;TEM and GIXRD. The circuit, based on PWM, achieved 8&#8208;bit gray level control and stable &#181;LED luminance, confirming its suitability for high&#8208;quality &#181;LED displays.








Abstract
This study investigates a micro light&#8208;emitting diode (&#181;LED) pixel circuit using the heterogeneous integration of complementary field&#8208;effect transistors (CFETs). The CFETs are fabricated using a semiconductor layer composed of tellurium (Te) and indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc oxide (IGZO) layers. Te and IGZO layers in the heterostructure IGZO/Te film exhibit hexagonal and amorphous phases, respectively, indicating that each layer maintains independent material characteristics. The fabricated IGZO/Te CFETs exhibit ambipolar behavior with a turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.0&#160;V and field&#8208;effect mobility of 0.74 and 1.42 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type channels, respectively. Inverters comprising IGZO/Te CFET and IGZO TFT exhibit inverting behavior. A &#181;LED pixel circuit is designed using IGZO/Te CFETs based on pulse width modulation (PWM). The proposed circuit uses an inverter structure with IGZO/Te and IGZO to control the emission time, suppressing the wavelength shift of &#181;LEDs depending on the &#181;LED current levels. The operation of the proposed pixel circuit is investigated through simulation and measurement of the fabricated circuit. The fabricated &#181;LED pixel circuit successfully exhibits PWM operation, controlling the emission time and luminance. Consequently, IGZO/Te CFETs show promise as devices for high&#8208;quality &#181;LED displays.

         <title>Electron Release via Internal Polarization Fields for Optimal S&#8208;H Bonding States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study offers insights into material design rules for activating the basal planes of TMDs and suggests ultimate strategies using positively charged built&#8208;in polarized fields that electrostatically repel H2S+ ions. The de&#8208;localizing charge density derived from the released electrons originally bound to S atoms at the Sv incorporated heterointerface, results in unidirectional charge transport to the basal plane.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have received considerable attention as promising electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet their potential is often constrained by the inertness of the basal planes arising from their poor hydrogen adsorption ability. Here, the relationship between the electronic structure of the WS2 basal plane and HER activity is systemically analyzed to establish a clear insight. The valance state of the sulfur atoms on the basal plane has been tuned to enhance hydrogen adsorption through sequential engineering processes, including direct phase transition and heterostructure that induces work function&#8208;difference&#8208;induced unidirectional electron transfer. Additionally, an innovative synthetic approach, harnessing the built&#8208;in internal polarization field at the W&#8208;graphene heterointerface, triggers the in&#8208;situ formation of sulfur vacancies in the bottom WSx (x &lt; 2) layers. The resultant modulation of the valance state of the sulfur atom stabilizes the W&#8208;S bond, while destabilizing the S&#8208;H bond. The electronic structural changes are further amplified by the release and transfer of surplus electrons via sulfur vacancies, filling the valance state of W and S atoms. Consequently, this work provides a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between the electronic structure of the WS2 basal plane and the HER activity, focusing on optimizing S&#8208;H bonding state.

         <title>High Thermal Conductive Crystalline Organohalide for Endurable Resistive Switching Non&#8208;Volatile Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Typical organic materials&#8208;based resistive memory devices suffer from poor operational reliability and stability. The crystalline organohalide&#8208;based thin film with high thermal conductivity and low electrical conductivity introduced in this study enabled a reliable resistive memory device with significantly enhanced endurance, high on/off ratio, and millivolt scale operating voltages.








Abstract
The organic&#8208;based memristive devices are widely studied as a next&#8208;generation electronics for eco&#8208;friendly wearable applications, thanks to materials` flexibility and biocompatibility. However, poor operational reliability and stability of the devices remain a critical challenge. Here, the study demonstrates a crystalline organohalide, Dabconium ammonium triiodide (DABCO&#8208;NH4&#8208;I3, DABCO is 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2] octonium)&#8208;based memristive device with exceptionally high reliability and endurance. Owing to the low dielectric constant and anisotropic hexagonal crystal structure consisting of hydrogen bonds with a high bandgap, the DABCO&#8208;NH4&#8208;I3&#8208;based conductive bridging random access memory device demonstrates millivolt&#8208;scale operating voltages with a remarkably high on/off ratio of &#8776;109, capable of multi&#8208;level storage. The relatively higher thermal conductivity of the crystalline organohalide (1.06&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1K&#8722;1), compared to most of organic materials (0.1&#8211;0.5&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1K&#8722;1), is found to be beneficial to suppress intense heat accumulation generated by Joule heating effect during device operation. With the facilitated dissipation of the generated heat, the simple planar heterojunction structured device shows remarkably endurable resistive switching over 103 cycles of program&#8208;erase at both room temperature and 85 &#176;C with high switching reliability. This study introduced a new class of materials that can overcome the limitations of existing organic materials for high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation organic electronic devices.

The relatively higher thermal conductivity of the crystalline organohalide (1.06&#160;W&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), compared to most of organic materials (0.1&#8211;0.5&#160;W&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), is found to be beneficial to suppress intense heat accumulation generated by Joule heating effect during device operation. With the facilitated dissipation of the generated heat, the simple planar heterojunction structured device shows remarkably endurable resistive switching over 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; cycles of program-erase at both room temperature and 85 &#176;C with high switching reliability. This study introduced a new class of materials that can overcome the limitations of existing organic materials for high-performance next-generation organic electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spectroscopic Signatures of Ultra&#8208;Thin Amorphous Carbon with the Tuned Disorder Directly Grown on a Dielectric Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a method for directly growing ultra&#8208;thin amorphous carbon with controlled levels of disorder on dielectric substrates, eliminating issues related to material transfer. Using XPS, EELS, and Raman spectroscopy for material characterization, the films exhibit distinct signatures, with Raman spectroscopy especially effective in identifying disorder levels. Additionally, electrical and dielectric measurements indicate promising potential for nanometer&#8208;scale semiconductor applications.








Abstract
The reduced structural complexity of atomically thin amorphous carbons makes it suitable for semiconductor technology. Inherent challenges arise from transfer processes subsequent to growth on metallic substrates, posing significant challenges to the accurate characterization of amorphous materials, thereby compromising the reliability of spectroscopic analysis. Here this work presents a novel approach: direct growth of ultra&#8208;thin amorphous carbon with tuned disorder on a dielectric substrate (SiO2/Si) using photochemical reaction and thermal annealing process with a solid precursor. This work characterizes the amorphous carbon films' disorder using spectroscopic techniques, such as X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Electron energy loss spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy, which offer greater convenience compared to microscopy&#8208;based studies. This method, rooted in comprehensive spectroscopic characterization, elucidates characteristic signatures inherent to the amorphous carbon films. These findings reveal that Raman spectroscopy is particularly effective in identifying the amorphous phase of atomically&#8208;thin carbon. Additionally, I&#8208;V characterization and high&#8208;frequency dielectric measurements showcase the potential application of directly grown amorphous carbon films in the semiconductor industry, where nanometer&#8208;level thin conductors and dielectrics are commonly utilized. This transfer&#8208;free characterization method provides a useful tool to find the correlation between atomic structure and electrical/optical properties, giving valuable insights into comprehensive crystallographic fundamental research.

         <title>Titanium&#8210;Nickel Dual Active Sites Enabled Reversible Hydrogen Storage of Magnesium at 180&#160;&#176;C with Exceptional Cycle Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the Mg2Ni@Ti&#9472;MgO catalyst, featuring Mg2Ni and stable Ti&#9472;MgO with stable Ti valence state, is applied to Mg/MgH2. It simultaneously facilitates the hydrogen adsorption, dissociation, diffusion, and nucleation processes, enabling moderate&#8208;temperature hydrogen storage reactions with long&#8208;term cycle stability. These findings suggest the importance of combining early&#8208; and late&#8208;transition metals in a gas&#8208;solid phase reaction.








Abstract
Enhancing hydrogenation and dehydrogenation (de/hydrogenation) kinetics without compromising cycle stability is a major challenge for Mg&#8208;based hydrogen storage materials (Mg/MgH2). The de/hydrogenation reactions of Mg/MgH2 are one of the gas&#8211;solid reactions involving hydrogen adsorption, dissociation, diffusion, and nucleation, which often results in the catalysts being unable to simultaneously accelerate these distinct kinetic processes. Here, the Mg2Ni@Ti&#9472;MgO catalyst with dual active sites is reported to be designed to address this issue. The stabilization of Ti2+ and Ti3+ valence states in the MgO lattice simultaneously accelerates hydrogen adsorption and dissociation. Additionally, Mg2Ni serves as a hydrogen diffusion and nucleation center, synergistically enhancing de/hydrogenation reactions. Consequently, it enables MgH2 to release 5.28&#160;wt.% H2 in 2&#160;min at 280&#160;&#176;C, and achieves 1.96&#160;wt.% H2 of hydrogen release in 60&#160;min at 180&#160;&#176;C. The Mg2Ni@Ti&#9472;MgO catalyst exhibits remarkable chemical stability at the interfacial structure, minimizing structural and chemical degradation impact, and realizing excellent de/hydrogenation performance over 1000 cycles. These results provide a new methodology for optimizing multiple kinetic steps, attaining highly efficient and stable de/hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Decoding the Role of Molecular Orientation in Conjugated Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for High&#8208;Performance Binary Organic Photovoltaics Approaching 20% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study elucidates how the molecular orientation of conjugated self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) governs work function (WF) modulation via alignment of the conjugated core with the surface normal. Edge&#8208;on&#8208;oriented BCZ&#8208;1 molecule maximizes vertical dipole moments and achieves dense in&#8208;plane coverage, enabling ultrafast hole extraction and minimized recombination. The resultant binary organic photovoltaics achieve a record efficiency of 19.93%, highlighting orientation engineering as a pivotal strategy for high&#8208;performance devices.








Abstract
Molecular orientation stands as the quintessential hallmark of conjugated self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs), which have recently catalyzed noteworthy advancements in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Nevertheless, an unambiguous understanding of these directional arrangements and their impact on optoelectronic properties remains elusive. To address this issue, herein three SAMs with representative orientations, i.e., edge&#8208;on (BCZ&#8208;1), tilt&#8208;on (4PACz) and face&#8208;on (BCZ&#8208;2) are meticulously designed. These orientations have been rigorously validated by sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy and first&#8208;principles calculations. Remarkably, an unequivocal correlation between the molecular orientation and the device performance is discerned. Particularly, the edge&#8208;on oriented BCZ&#8208;1 exhibits the largest dipole moment normal to the electrode, accompanied by a dense and uniform coverage. These features collectively contribute to its strongest work function increment for ultra&#8208;fast hole extraction and minimum interfacial carrier recombination. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency of 19.93% is achieved in devices based on BCZ&#8208;1 with D18:L8&#8208;BO as the active layer, representing one of the highest values reported for binary bulk heterojunction OPVs. Besides, BCZ&#8208;1 shows great potential for practical applications due to its superior up&#8208;scalability and enhanced device shelf&#8208;stability. Overall, this work offers in&#8208;depth insights into the orientation behaviors of SAMs, opening new avenues to unlock the efficiency potential of OPVs.

         <title>Imaging the 4D Chemical Heterogeneity of Single V2O5 Particles During Charging/Discharging Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spectrally&#8208;resolved dual&#8208;mode spinning&#8208;disk confocal microscopy is developed to monitor the 4D chemical heterogeneity of single V2O5 particles during cycling. A unique and irreversible transformation of V5+ to V3+ on a particle's bottom electric contact points has been unveiled for the first time. The coordination strategy between ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid and V3+ is proposed to inhibit V3+ precipitation effectively.








Abstract
Microparticle cathode materials are widely used in secondary batteries. However, obtaining dynamic chemical heterogeneities of these microparticles is challenging, hindering in&#8208;depth mechanistic investigation of the underlying processes. For example, although vanadium pentoxide shows promise as an electrode material for zinc ion batteries, its poor performance's root cause is elusive. Herein, a fluorescence/scattering dual&#8208;mode spinning disk confocal microscopy&#8208;based approach is developed to visualize the 4D chemical heterogeneity of single V2O5 particles during cycling. Dual&#8208;mode in situ imaging identifies valence state changes of vanadium ions with high spatiotemporal resolution. A unique difference is observed between the scattering intensities of a particle's bottom electric contact points and the rest parts during the discharging process. In contrast, fluorescence intensity variation suggests high consistency across the particles. Correlative Raman, UV&#8211;Vis spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses suggest the precipitation of V3+ species at the bottom interface of the V2O5 electrode, leading to increased electron transfer resistance and compromised overall performance. A coordination strategy between ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid and V3+ is proposed for inhibiting V3+ precipitation, and its effectiveness is further verified by imaging and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses. Insights from the imaging approach presented herein will enable the rational design of high&#8208;performance batteries.

Herein, a fluorescence/scattering dual-mode spinning disk confocal microscopy-based approach is developed to visualize the 4D chemical heterogeneity of single V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; particles during cycling. Dual-mode in situ imaging identifies valence state changes of vanadium ions with high spatiotemporal resolution. A unique difference is observed between the scattering intensities of a particle's bottom electric contact points and the rest parts during the discharging process. In contrast, fluorescence intensity variation suggests high consistency across the particles. Correlative Raman, UV&#8211;Vis spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses suggest the precipitation of V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; species at the bottom interface of the V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; electrode, leading to increased electron transfer resistance and compromised overall performance. A coordination strategy between ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid and V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is proposed for inhibiting V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; precipitation, and its effectiveness is further verified by imaging and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses. Insights from the imaging approach presented herein will enable the rational design of high-performance batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proposing Altermagnetic&#8208;Ferroelectric Type&#8208;III Multiferroics with Robust Magnetoelectric Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiferroics are highly sought after for advanced technological applications. Here, a novel class of type&#8208;III multiferroics is proposed, where ferroelectricity and altermagnetism are inherently interlocked by crystal symmetry, setting them apart from conventional multiferroics. The ferroelectric switching is shown to fully invert the spin polarization of altermagnets, equivalent to a 180&#176; reversal of magnetic spin.








Abstract
Multiferroic materials, characterized by the coexisting of ferroelectric polarization (breaking space&#8208; inversion symmetry, &#119979;) and magnetism (breaking time&#8208;reversal symmetry, &#119983;), with strong magnetoelectric coupling, are highly sought after for advanced technological applications. Novel altermagnets, distinct from conventional magnets, have recently been revealed to exhibit unique spin polarization protected by crystal symmetry, which naturally overcomes the isolation of magnetism from ferroelectrics associated with spatial symmetry. In this study, a novel class of type&#8208;III multiferroics is proposed, which leverages the unique symmetry of altermagnets to enforce spin&#8208;ferroelectric locking, setting them apart from conventional multiferroics. Through first&#8208;principles calculations, ferroelectric switching is shown to fully invert the spin polarization of altermagnets, equivalent to a 180&#176; reversal of magnetic spin. This altermagnetic phase controlled by ferroelectrics can be effectively probed using the magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect, revealing a new class of multiferroics with intrinsic and deterministic magnetoelectric coupling. This theoretical advancement redefines the design principles of magnetoelectric materials and lays the foundation for the design of next&#8208;generation spintronic devices leveraging altermagnetism.

         <title>Interfacial Energetics Reversal Strategy for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy&#8208; &#8220;interfacial energetics reversal&#8221; to reconstruct perovskite energetics that matches well with the upper hole transport layer has been successfully developed, enabling efficient n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite solar cells with nonradiative recombination induced qVoc loss of only 57 meV from the radiative limit.








Abstract
Reducing heterointerface nonradiative recombination is a key challenge for realizing highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Motivated by this, a facile strategy is developed via interfacial energetics reversal to functionalize perovskite heterointerface. A surfactant molecule, trichloro[3&#8208;(pentafluorophenyl)propyl]silane (TPFS) reverses perovskite surface energetics from intrinsic n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type, evidently demonstrated by ultraviolet and inverse photoelectron spectroscopies. The reconstructed perovskite surface energetics match well with the upper deposited hole transport layer, realizing an exquisite energy level alignment for accelerating hole extraction across the heterointerface. Meanwhile, TPFS further diminishes surface defect density. As a result, this cooperative strategy leads to greatly minimized nonradiative recombination. PSCs achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.9% with excellent reproducibility, and a nonradiative recombination&#8208;induced qVoc loss of only 57 meV, which is the smallest reported to date in n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured PSCs.

         <title>Key Role of Bridge Adsorbed Hydrogen Intermediate on Pt&#8211;Ru Pair for Efficient Acidic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed Pt atomic chain modified fcc&#8208;type Ru nanocrystal with co&#8208;crystalline structure possesses an efficient bridge adsorbed hydrogen configuration (*Hbridge) at the Pt&#8211;Ru(fcc) interface. The *Hbridge dominates HER and exhibits superior intrinsic activity, &#8776;10.6 times higher than that of Pt. The designed Pt&#8211;Ru(fcc) with *Hbridge demonstrates excellent catalytic activity and stability for both laboratory and industrial levels.








Abstract
Atop and multiple adsorbed hydrogen are considered as key intermediates on Pt&#8208;group metal for acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet the role of bridge hydrogen intermediate (*Hbridge) is consistently overlooked experimentally. Herein, a Pt atomic chain modified fcc&#8208;Ru nanocrystal (Pt&#8211;Ru(fcc)) is developed with a co&#8208;crystalline structure, featuring *Hbridge intermediate bonded on the Pt&#8211;Ru pair site. Electrons leap from the pair site to *Hbridge facilitate hydrogen desorption, thus accelerating the Tafel kinetics and ensuring outstanding electrocatalytic performance, with a low overpotential (4.0&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#8201;&#160;cm&#8722;2) and high turnover frequency (56.4&#8201;H2&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 50&#8201;mV). Notably, the proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer PEMWE with ultra&#8208;low loading of 10 ugPt&#8201;cm&#8722;2 shows excellent activity (1.61&#160;V at 1.0&#8201;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and low average degradation rate (4.0 &#181;V h&#8722;1 over 1000&#160;h), significantly outperforming the benchmark Pt/C. Furthermore, the PEMWE&#8208;based 80&#160;&#181;m Gore membrane under identical operating conditions requires only 1.54 and 1.58&#160;V to achieve 1.0 and 1.5 A cm&#8722;2. This finding highlights the key role of *Hbridge at the Pt&#8211;Ru interface in obtaining high HER intrinsic activity and underscores the transformative potential in designing next&#8208;generation bimetallic catalysts for clean hydrogen energy.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Mediated Redox Strategy for Sustainable Lithium Extraction From Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iodine&#8208;mediated electrochemical strategy recycles spent LiFePO4 cathodes, extracting lithium as carbonate and producing metallic zinc. Delithiated LiFePO4 is transformed into an efficient oxygen evolution catalyst. This scalable, sustainable approach reduces energy use and emissions while offering economic benefits for clean energy applications.








Abstract
With the widespread application of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, the recycling of spent batteries, especially those involving LiFePO4 (LFP) cathodes for their low&#8208;cost and high safety, has become an urgent environmental and resource challenge. Traditional recycling methods (hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy) struggle to achieve green and efficient recycling. Herein, this study proposes an iodine&#8208;mediated electrochemical strategy to utilize a recyclable I3&#8722;/I&#8722; redox system and efficiently extract Li+ from spent LFP through liquid&#8208;phase reactions on one side (achieving a 93% leaching rate and recovery as lithium carbonate), while simultaneously producing metallic zinc through electrodeposition, which can be directly used in Zn&#8208;air batteries or hydrogen production. Furthermore, the delithiated LFP is upcycled into an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, achieving an overpotential of only 250&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, superior to commercial RuO2 catalysts. Eventually, this system reduces energy consumption by 32% (9.2&#160;MJ kg&#8722;1) compared to traditional hydrometallurgical processes, decreases greenhouse gas emissions by 35% compared to traditional pyrometallurgical processes, while achieving a net profit of &#8776;$0.44 per kg. This work establishes a novel, scalable recycling system, providing a robust sustainable solution for spent LFP cathodes recycling and clean energy storage.

Furthermore, the delithiated LFP is upcycled into an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, achieving an overpotential of only 250&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, superior to commercial RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts. Eventually, this system reduces energy consumption by 32% (9.2&#160;MJ kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to traditional hydrometallurgical processes, decreases greenhouse gas emissions by 35% compared to traditional pyrometallurgical processes, while achieving a net profit of &#8776;$0.44 per kg. This work establishes a novel, scalable recycling system, providing a robust sustainable solution for spent LFP cathodes recycling and clean energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Flexible QZPCs formulated by the MES@CNT/CC air cathode and IL&#8208;PANa hydrogel electrolyte demonstrate a high cell&#8208;level energy density of 105 Wh kgcell&#8722;1, and an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 4000 cycles at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 even at low temperature of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C. The electronic synergy within the bifunctional MES@CNT/CC air cathode, initiates an intriguing adaptive active&#8208;site&#8208;switching catalytic mechanism during the reciprocating ORR and OER processes, thereby sustaining the high performance of the QZPCs.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air pouch cells (QZPCs) promise a high energy&#8208;to&#8208;cost ratio while ensuring inherent safety. However, addressing the challenges associated with exploring superior energy&#8208;wise cathode catalysts along with their activity origin, and the super&#8208;ionic electrolytes remains a fundamental task. Herein, the realistic high&#8208;performance QZPCs are contrived, underpinned by a robust NiVFeCo medium&#8208;entropy metal sulfides (MESs) bifunctional air cathode with a record&#8208;low potential polarization of 0.523&#160;V, paired with a sodium polyacrylate&#8208;ionic liquid hydrogel exhibiting exceptional conductivity (234 mS cm&#8722;1) and water retention (93.8% at 7 days) at room temperature as the super&#8208;ionic conductor electrolyte. Through combined studies of in situ Raman, ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis, and theoretic calculations, an intriguing adaptive active&#8208;sites&#8208;switching mechanism of the MESs cathode during discharging/charging processes is unveiled, revealing a dynamic role transition of Co and Ni active sites in the reversible oxygen electrocatalysis. Consequently, the persistent low cathode polarization and super ion&#8208;conductive electrolyte endorse QZPCs an excellent rate performance from 1 to 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at room temperature. Moreover, an impressively high cell&#8208;level energy density of 105&#160;Wh kgcell&#8722;1 with an ultra&#8208;long cycle lifespan of 4000 cycles at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a low temperature of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C is achieved.

         <title>Emergent Locomotion in Self&#8208;Sustained, Mechanically Connected Soft Matter Rings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 26, July 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally fueled, self&#8208;moving twisted rings made from liquid crystal elastomers are investigated. By studying single rings and linked knots, it is shown how autonomous locomotion emerges through coupling between the rings. The movement is programmable via handedness control at connection points, offering insights into collective behavior and programmable motion in soft materials.








Abstract
In nature, the interplay between individual organisms often leads to the emergence of complex belabours, of which sophistication has been refined through millions of years of evolution. Synthetic materials research has focused on mimicking the natural complexity, e.g., by harnessing non&#8208;equilibrium states to drive self&#8208;assembly processes. However, it is highly challenging to understand the interaction dynamics between non&#8208;equilibrium entities and to obtain collective behavior that can arise autonomously through interaction. In this study, thermally fueled, twisted rings exhibiting self&#8208;sustained movements are used as fundamental units and their interactive behaviors and emergent functions are investigated. The rings are fabricated from connected thermoresponsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) strips that undergo zero&#8208;elastic&#8208;energy&#8208;mode, autonomous motions upon a heat gradient. Single&#8208;ring structures with various twisting numbers and nontrivial links, and connected knots where several LCE rings (N = 2,3,4,5) are studied and linked. The observations uncover that controlled locomotion of the structures can emerge when N &#8805; 3. The locomotion can be programmed by controlling the handedness at the connection points between the individual rings. These findings illustrate how group activity emerges from individual responsive material components through mechanical coupling, offering a model for programming autonomous locomotion in soft matter constructs.
