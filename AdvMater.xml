         <title>All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries of High Cycling Stability and Rate Capability Enabled by a Self&#8208;Lithiated Sn&#8208;C Interlayer</title>

A self&#8208;lithiated tin (Sn)&#8208;carbon (C)&#160;composite interlayer (LSCI) capable of enhancing electrochemical/structural stability and homogenizing lithium (Li)&#8208;ion transport across the Li/solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) interfaces enables an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur battery (ASSLSBs) with high cycling stability and rate capability.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) have attracted intense interest due to their high theoretical energy density and intrinsic safety. However, constructing durable lithium (Li) metal anodes with high cycling efficiency in ASSLSBs remains challenging due to poor interface stability. Here, a compositionally stable, self&#8208;lithiated tin (Sn)&#8208;carbon (C) composite interlayer (LSCI) between Li anode and solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE), capable of homogenizing Li&#8208;ion transport across the interlayer, mitigating decomposition of SSE, and enhancing electrochemical/structural stability of interface, is developed for ASSLSBs. The LSCI&#8208;mediated Li metal anode enables stable Li plating/stripping over 7000&#160;h without Li dendrite penetration. The ASSLSBs equipped with LSCI thus exhibit excellent cycling stability of over 300 cycles (capacity retention of &#8776;80%) under low applied pressure (&lt;8&#160;MPa) and demonstrate improved rate capability even at 3C. The enhanced electrochemical performance and corresponding insights of the designed LSCI broaden the spectrum of advanced interlayers for interface manipulation, advancing the practical application of ASSLSBs.

         <title>Shape Memory Polymers with Patternable Recovery Onset Regulated by Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A shape memory hydrogel with a photo&#8208;patterned onset time of autonomous shape recovery is prepared. Via introducing photo&#8208;responsive nitrocinnamate groups, thermally induced reversible microphase separation of the material is adjusted, which is responsible for the tunable recovery onset. Consequently, multi&#8208;shape morphing without any external stimulation can be realized, greatly extending the versatility of shape memory polymers.








Abstract
Shape memory polymers (SMPs) show attractive prospects in emerging fields such as soft robots and biomedical devices. Although their typical trigger&#8208;responsive character offers the essential shape&#8208;changing controllability, having to access external stimulation is a major bottleneck toward many applications. Recently emerged autonomous SMPs exhibit unique stimuli&#8208;free shape&#8208;shifting behavior with its controllability achieved via a delayed and programmable recovery onset. Achieving multi&#8208;shape morphing in an arbitrary fashion, however, is infeasible. In this work, a molecular design that allows to spatio&#8208;temporally define the recovery onset of an autonomous shape memory hydrogel (SMH) is reported. By introducing nitrocinnamate groups onto an SMH, its crosslinking density can be adjusted by light. This affects greatly the phase separation kinetics, which is the basis for the autonomous shape memory behavior. Consequently, the recovery onset can be regulated between 0 to 85&#160;min. With masked light, multiple recovery onsets in an arbitrarily defined pattern which correspondingly enable multi&#8208;shape morphing can be realized. This ability to achieve highly sophisticated morphing without relying on any external stimulation greatly extends the versatility of SMPs.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Defect&#8208;Controlled Diffusion in van der Waals Gaps</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
W atom diffusion at van der Waals (vdW) interfaces (BN/WSe2, BN/BN), and on BN surfaces using scanning transmission electron microscopy is visualized. Diffusion is in all cases is governed by intermittent trapping at electron beam&#8208;generated defect sites, suggesting processes that are highly tunable and sensitive to crystal quality. This enables direct visualization of atomic interactions and materials inside vdW heterostructures.








Abstract
Diffusion processes govern fundamental phenomena such as phase transformations, doping, and intercalation in van der Waals (vdW) bonded materials. Here, the diffusion dynamics of W atoms by visualizing the motion of individual atoms at three different vdW interfaces: hexagonal boron nitride (BN)/vacuum, BN/BN, and BN/WSe2, by recording scanning transmission electron microscopy movies is quantified. Supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is inferred that in all cases diffusion is governed by intermittent trapping at electron beam&#8208;generated defect sites. This leads to diffusion properties that depend strongly on the number of defects. These results suggest that diffusion and intercalation processes in vdW materials are highly tunable and sensitive to crystal quality. The demonstration of imaging, with high spatial and temporal resolution, of layers and individual atoms inside vdW heterostructures offers possibilities for direct visualization of diffusion and atomic interactions, as well as for experiments exploring atomic structures, their in situ modification, and electrical property measurements of active devices combined with atomic resolution&#160;imaging.

         <title>Bifunctional Oxygen&#8208;Defect Bismuth Catalyst toward Concerted Production of H2O2 with over 150% Cell Faradaic Efficiency in Continuously Flowing Paired&#8208;Electrosynthesis System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional oxygen&#8208;defect bismuth catalyst, obtained through the in situ electrochemical reconstruction of Bi&#8208;MOF nanorods, is applied as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for both anodic water oxidation reaction and cathodic oxygen reduction reaction, which is capable of promoting a novel continuously flowing paired&#8208;electrosynthesis system for large&#8208;scale and cost&#8208;effective production of H2O2 with over 150% cell Faradaic efficiency.








Abstract
The electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from O2 or H2O via the two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR) or water oxidation (2e&#8722; WOR) reaction provides a green and sustainable alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process. Herein, a paired&#8208;electrosynthesis tactic is reported for concerted H2O2 production at a high rate by coupling the 2e&#8722; ORR and 2e&#8722; WOR, in which the bifunctional oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched Bi2O3 nanorods (Ov&#8208;Bi2O3&#8208;EO), obtained through electrochemically oxidative reconstruction of Bi&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Bi&#8208;MOF) nanorod precursor, are used as both efficient anodic and cathodic electrocatalysts, achieving concurrent H2O2 production at both electrodes with high Faradaic efficiencies. Specifically, the coupled 2e&#8722; ORR//2e&#8722; WOR electrolysis system based on such distinctive oxygen&#8208;defect Bi catalyst displays excellent performance for the paired&#8208;electrosynthesis of H2O2, delivering a remarkable cell Faradaic efficiency of 154.8% and an ultrahigh H2O2 production rate of 4.3 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. Experiments combined with theoretical analysis reveal the crucial role of oxygen vacancies in optimizing the adsorption of intermediates associated with the selective two&#8208;electron reaction pathways, thereby improving the activity and selectivity of the 2e&#8722; reaction processes at both electrodes. This work establishes a new paradigm for developing advanced electrocatalysts and designing novel paired&#8208;electrolysis systems for scalable and sustainable H2O2 electrosynthesis.

         <dc:description>
The conductivity of sub&#8208;20&#8208;nm thin poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) films is improved by treating them sequentially with HNO3 and CsCl. The resulting layers show enhanced crystallinity with electrical conductivity of up to 5500 S cm&#8722;1, with 85% of this value being retained after 270 d of storage in ambient air at room temperature without being encapsulated.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is an important polymeric conductor used extensively in organic flexible, wearable, and stretchable optoelectronics. However, further enhancing its conductivity and long&#8208;term stability while maintaining its superb mechanical properties remains challenging. Here, a novel post&#8208;treatment approach to enhance the electrical properties and stability of sub&#8208;20&#8208;nm&#8208;thin PEDOT:PSS films processed from solution is introduced. The approach involves a sequential post&#8208;treatment with HNO3 and CsCl, resulting in a remarkable enhancement of the electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films to over 5500 S cm&#8722;1, along with improved carrier mobility. The post&#8208;treated films exhibit remarkable air stability, retaining over 85% of their initial conductivity even after 270 days of storage. Various characterization techniques, including X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Hall effect measurements, and grazing incidence wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering, coupled with density functional theory calculations, provide insights into the structural changes and interactions responsible for these improvements. To demonstrate the potential for practical applications, the ultrathin PEDOT:PSS films are connected to an inorganic light&#8208;emitting diode with a battery, showcasing their suitability as transparent electrodes. This work presents a promising approach for enhancing the electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS while offering a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms that can guide further advances.

         <title>Sodiophilic Substrate Induces NaF&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interface for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly porous 3D framework with abundant sodiophilic active sites can effectively uniform electric field distribution and reduce nucleation energy barriers. The synergistic interaction between the optimized interfacial solvation structure and the robust NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface layer contributes to a dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anode, significantly prolonging the lifespan of sodium metal batteries.








Abstract
3D substrate with abundant sodiophilic active sites holds promise for implementing dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anodes and high&#8208;performance sodium batteries. However, the heightened electrode/electrolyte side reactions stemming from high specific surface area still hinder electrode structure stability and cycling reversibility, particularly under high current densities. Herein, the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) component is regulated and detrimental side reactions are restrained through the uniform loading of Na&#8211;Sn alloy onto a porous 3D nanofiber framework (NaSn&#8208;PCNF). The strong interaction between Na&#8211;Sn alloy and PF6&#8722; anions facilitates the dissociation of sodium salts and releases more free sodium ions for effective charge transfer. Simultaneously, the modulations of the interfacial electrolyte solvation structure and the construction of a high NaF content SEI layer stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface. NaSn&#8208;PCNF symmetrical battery demonstrates stable cycling for over 600 h with an ultralow overpotential of 24.5&#160;mV under harsh condition of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the full cells and pouch cells exhibit accelerated reaction kinetics and splendid capacity retention, providing valuable insights into the development of advanced Na substrates for high&#8208;energy sodium metal batteries.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Free Upcycling of Poly(Ethylene Terephthalate) Waste to Biodegradable Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optimal approach without the need for additional catalysts or solvents for the upcycling of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) waste is reported. Specifically, bio&#8208;based hydrogenated dimer acids are found to directly convert PET bottles into biodegradable copolyesters suitable for agricultural mulch films. This work provides an environmentally friendly and cost&#8208;effective strategy for the large&#8208;scale upgrading and reprocessing of PET waste.








Abstract
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is an important polymer with annual output second only to polyethylene. Due to its low biodegradability, a large amount of PET is recycled for sustainable development. However, current strategies for PET recycling are limited by low added value or small product scale. It is urgent to make a breakthrough on the principle of PET macromolecular reaction and efficiently prepare products with high added value and wide applications. Here, the catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free synthesis of biodegradable plastics are reported through novel carboxyl&#8208;ester transesterification between PET waste and bio&#8208;based hydrogenated dimer acid (HDA), which can directly substitute some terephthalic acid (TPA) units in PET chain by HDA unit. This macromolecular reaction can be facilely carried out on current equipment in the polyester industry without any additional catalyst and solvent, thus enabling low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale production. Furthermore, the product semi&#8208;bio&#8208;based copolyester shows excellent mechanical properties, regulable flexibility and good biodegradability, which is expected to substitute poly(butylene adipate&#8208;co&#8208;terephthalate) (PBAT) plastic as high value&#8208;added biodegradable materials. This work provides an environmental&#8208;friendly and economic strategy for the large&#8208;scale upcycling of PET waste.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Quantum Reconfiguration of Oxyhydroxides for Photoanodes with 4.24% Efficiency and Stability Beyond 250 Hours</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting attracts significant interest in converting solar energy into clean hydrogen fuels. A light&#8208;accelerated atomic reconfiguration of NiFe oxyhydroxides&#8208;alloy heterostructure based on NiFe nanofilm is engineered as a catalytic&#8208;protective layer for photoanodes, reporting a record ABPE value of 4.24% in buried homojunction&#8208;free photoanodes and stability over 250 h with above 88% retention of the initial current density.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is attracting significant research interest in addressing sustainable development goals in renewable energy. Current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, however, cannot provide photoanodes with simultaneously high efficiency and long&#8208;lasting lifetime. Here, large&#8208;scale NiFe oxyhydroxides&#8208;alloy hybridized co&#8208;catalyst layer that exhibits an applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (ABPE) of 4.24% in buried homojunction&#8208;free photoanodes and stability over 250 h is reported. These performances represent an increase over the present highest&#8208;performing technology by 408% in stability and the most stable competitor by over 330% in efficiency. These results originate from a previously unexplored mechanism of light&#8208;induced atomic reconfiguration, which rapidly self&#8208;generates a catalytic&#8208;protective amorphous/crystalline heterostructure at low biases. This mechanism provides active sites for reaction and insulates the photoanode from performance degradation. Photon&#8208;generated NiFe oxyhydroxides are more than 200% higher than the quantity that pure electrocatalysis would otherwise induce, overcoming the threshold for an efficient water oxidation reaction in the device. While of immediate interest in the industry of water splitting, the light&#8208;induced NiFe oxyhydroxides&#8208;alloy co&#8208;catalyst developed in this work provides a general strategy to enhance further the performances and stability of PEC devices for a vast panorama of chemical reactions, ranging from biomass valorization to organic waste degradation, and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.

         <title>Calcium Hexacyanoferrate (III) Nanocatalyst Enables Redox Homeostasis for Autism Spectrum Disorder Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a multifaced neurodevelopmental disorder with considerable heterogeneity. Oxidative stress is a critical pathological feature of ASD, contributing to neuronal damage and inflammation due to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS). Herein a pioneering intervention, calcium hexacyanoferrate (III) nanocatalysts (CaH NCs), a distinct catalytic nanoenzyme designed for ASD treatment is unveiled. By mitigating oxidative stress, impeding cellular apoptosis, and fostering an anti&#8208;inflammatory environment within the neural milieu, CaH NCs play a pivotal role in alleviating autism&#8208;like behaviors in animal models of ASD.








Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a multifaced neurodevelopmental disorder with considerable heterogeneity, in which over&#8208;generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce a cascade of pathological changes, including cellular apoptosis and inflammatory responses. Given the complex etiology of ASD, no effective treatment is available for ASD. In this work, a specific catalytic nanoenzyme, calcium hexacyanoferrate (III) nanocatalysts (CaH NCs), is designed and engineered for efficient ASD treatment. CaH NCs can mimic the activities of natural enzymes including superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, which mitigates intracellular excessive ROS and regulates redox equilibrium. These CaH NCs modulate mitochondrial membrane potential, elevate B&#8208;cell lymphoma&#8208;2 levels, and suppress pro&#8208;apoptotic proteins, including Caspase&#8208;3 and B&#8208;cell lymphoma&#8208;2&#8208;associated X, thus effectively reducing cellular apoptosis. Importantly, CaH NCs alleviate inflammation by upregulating anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokine interleukin&#8208;10 and downregulating pro&#8208;inflammatory factors, resulting in attenuated activation of microglial and astrocytic and subsequent reduction in neuroinflammation. Subsequently, CaH NCs enhance social abilities, decrease anxiety levels, ameliorate repetitive behaviors, and improve learning and memory in ASD animal models through inflammation regulation and apoptosis inhibition. The CaH NCs in managing and preventing ASD represents a paradigm shift in autism treatment, paving the alternative but efficient way for clinical interventions in neurological conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a multifaced neurodevelopmental disorder with considerable heterogeneity, in which over-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce a cascade of pathological changes, including cellular apoptosis and inflammatory responses. Given the complex etiology of ASD, no effective treatment is available for ASD. In this work, a specific catalytic nanoenzyme, calcium hexacyanoferrate (III) nanocatalysts (CaH NCs), is designed and engineered for efficient ASD treatment. CaH NCs can mimic the activities of natural enzymes including superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, which mitigates intracellular excessive ROS and regulates redox equilibrium. These CaH NCs modulate mitochondrial membrane potential, elevate B-cell lymphoma-2 levels, and suppress pro-apoptotic proteins, including Caspase-3 and B-cell lymphoma-2-associated X, thus effectively reducing cellular apoptosis. Importantly, CaH NCs alleviate inflammation by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 and downregulating pro-inflammatory factors, resulting in attenuated activation of microglial and astrocytic and subsequent reduction in neuroinflammation. Subsequently, CaH NCs enhance social abilities, decrease anxiety levels, ameliorate repetitive behaviors, and improve learning and memory in ASD animal models through inflammation regulation and apoptosis inhibition. The CaH NCs in managing and preventing ASD represents a paradigm shift in autism treatment, paving the alternative but efficient way for clinical interventions in neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Binary&#8208;Cooperative Ultrathin Porous Membrane for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gel&#8208;state zeolitic imidazolate framework (g&#8208;ZIF) nanoparticles are synthesized by a metal&#8208;gel&#8208;induced strategy, and the resulting defect&#8208;free membranes are obtained via spin&#8208;coating and thermal treatment. The membrane is constructed with g&#8208;ZIF nanoparticles and stacked cross&#8208;linking boundaries, which form dual channels with fast gas transport and molecular sieving. The membrane performance is stable under 3.0 MPa.








Abstract
The construction of ultrathin porous membranes with stable structures is critical for achieving efficient gas separation. Inspired by the binary&#8208;cooperative structural features of bones and teeth&#8212;composed of rigid hydroxyapatite and flexible collagen, which confer excellent mechanical strength&#8212;a binary&#8208;cooperative porous membrane constructed with gel&#8208;state zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (g&#8208;ZIFs), synthesized using a metal&#8208;gel&#8208;induced strategy, is proposed. The enlarged cavity size and flexible frameworks of the g&#8208;ZIF nanoparticles significantly improve gas adsorption and diffusion, respectively. After thermal treatment, the coordination structures forming rigid segments in the g&#8208;ZIF membranes appear at the stacked g&#8208;ZIF boundaries, exhibiting a higher Young's modulus than the g&#8208;ZIF nanoparticles, denoted as the flexible segments. The g&#8208;ZIF membranes demonstrate excellent tensile and compression resistances, attributed to the effective translation of binary&#8208;cooperative effects of rigidity and flexibility into the membranes. The resulting dual&#8208;aperture structure, composed of g&#8208;ZIF nanoparticles surrounded by nanoscale apertures at the boundaries, yields a membrane with a stable CO2 permeance of 4834 GPU and CO2/CH4 selectivity of 90 within 3.0&#160;MPa.

The study explores Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalates ([TMMo6O24]n&#8208;, TM = Co, Ni, Fe) as modified materials for Li&#8208;S battery separators, enhancing performance. CoMo6 units show optimal binding energy and Gibbs free energy, forming strong polar bonds with LiPSs. The resulting Li&#8208;S battery exhibits high capacity, excellent cycle life, and stability across &#8722;20 to 60&#160;&#176;C, advancing high&#8208;performance, all&#8208;weather Li&#8208;S batteries.








Abstract
To improve the performance of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries, the reaction catalysts of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) reactions should have the characteristics of large surface area, efficient atomic utilization, high conductivity, small size, good stability, and strong adjustability. Herein, Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalate ([TMMo6O24]n&#8722;, TM = Co, Ni, Fe, represented by TMMo6 POMs) are used as the modified materials for Li&#8208;S battery separator. By customizing the central metal atoms, this work gains insights into the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer electron transfer mechanism between TMMo6 units and LiPSs, similar to the collision effect of a bowling ball. Theoretical analysis and in situ experimental characterization show that the changes of CoMo6 units with moderate binding energy and lowest Gibbs free energy result in the formation of robust polar bonds and prolonged S&#9472;S bonds after adsorption. Hence, the representative Li&#8208;S battery with CoMo6 and graphene composite modified separator has a high initial capacity of 1588.6&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C, excellent cycle performance of more than 3000 cycles at 5 C, and uniform Li+ transport over 1900&#160;h. More importantly, this work has revealed the inherent contradiction between the kinetics and thermodynamics, achieving a stable cycle in the temperature range of &#8722;20 to 60&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>An Acceptor&#8211;Donor&#8211;Acceptor Structured Nano&#8208;Aggregate for NIR&#8208;Triggered Interventional Photoimmunotherapy of Cervical Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acceptor&#8211;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A)&#8208;structured nanoaggregate is developed with dual phototherapy, including photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), triggered by single near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. In combination with aluminum adjuvant gel, a novel photoimmunotherapy strategy for cervical cancer is developed and demonstrated to significantly inhibit primary and metastatic tumors in vivo.








Abstract
Compared with conventional therapies, photoimmunotherapy offers precise targeted cancer treatment with minimal damage to healthy tissues and reduced side effects, but its efficacy may be limited by shallow light penetration and the potential for tumor resistance. Here, an acceptor&#8211;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A)&#8208;structured nanoaggregate is developed with dual phototherapy, including photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), triggered by single near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. Benefiting from strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), the A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;structured nanoaggregates exhibit broad absorption extending to the NIR region and effectively suppressed fluorescence, which enables deep penetration and efficient photothermal conversion (&#951;&#160;=&#160;67.94%). A suitable HOMO&#8211;LUMO distribution facilitates sufficient intersystem crossing (ISC) to convert ground&#8208;state oxygen (3O2) to singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide anions (&#183;O2&#8722;), and catalyze hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) generation. The enhanced ICT and ISC effects endow the A&#8211;D&#8211;A structured nanoaggregates with efficient PTT and PDT for cervical cancer, inducing efficient immunogenic cell death. In combination with clinical aluminum adjuvant gel, a novel photoimmunotherapy strategy for cervical cancer is developed and demonstrated to significantly inhibit primary and metastatic tumors in orthotopic and intraperitoneal metastasis cervical cancer animal models. The noninvasive therapy strategy offers new insights for clinical early&#8208;stage and advanced cervical cancer treatment.

         <title>Constructing Co4(SO4)4 Clusters within Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multinuclear metal clusters are widely used in nature for catalyzing small molecule activation reactions, which involve the transfer of multiple electrons. However, synthesizing active metal clusters is a big challenge. Herein, a series of Co4(SO4)4&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks and their electrocatalytic properties for oxygen electrocatalysis are reported. The Co4(SO4)4 cluster has an unparalleled structure among previously reported Co&#8208;based clusters.








Abstract
Multinuclear metal clusters are ideal candidates to catalyze small molecule activation reactions involving the transfer of multiple electrons. However, synthesizing active metal clusters is a big challenge. Herein, on constructing an unparalleled Co4(SO4)4 cluster within porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and the electrocatalytic features of such Co4(SO4)4 clusters for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is reported. The reaction of CoII sulfate and metal complexes of tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin under solvothermal conditions afforded Co4&#8208;M&#8208;MOFs (M&#9552;Co, Cu, and Zn). Crystallographic studies revealed that these Co4&#8208;M&#8208;MOFs have the same framework structure, having the Co4(SO4)4 clusters connected by metalloporphyrin units through Co&#9472;Npyridyl bonds. In the Co4(SO4)4 cluster, the four CoII ions are chemically and symmetrically equivalent and are each coordinated with four sulfate O atoms to give a distorted cube&#8208;like structure. Electrocatalytic studies showed that these Co4&#8208;M&#8208;MOFs are all active for electrocatalytic OER and ORR. Importantly, by regulating the activity of the metalloporphyrin units, it is confirmed that the Co4(SO4)4 cluster is active for oxygen electrocatalysis. With the use of Co porphyrins as connecting units, Co4&#8208;Co&#8208;MOF displays the highest electrocatalytic activity in this series of MOFs by showing a 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 OER current density at 357&#160;mV overpotential and an ORR half&#8208;wave potential at 0.83&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Theoretical studies revealed the synergistic effect of two proximal Co atoms in the Co4(SO4)4 cluster in OER by facilitating the formation of O&#9472;O bonds. This work is of fundamental significance to present the construction of Co4(SO4)4 clusters in framework structures for oxygen electrocatalysis and to demonstrate the cooperation between two proximal Co atoms in such clusters during the O&#9472;O bond formation process.

Herein, on constructing an unparalleled Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cluster within porphyrin-based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and the electrocatalytic features of such Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; clusters for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is reported. The reaction of Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; sulfate and metal complexes of tetrakis(4-pyridyl)porphyrin under solvothermal conditions afforded Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-M-MOFs (M&#9552;Co, Cu, and Zn). Crystallographic studies revealed that these Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-M-MOFs have the same framework structure, having the Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; clusters connected by metalloporphyrin units through Co&#9472;N&lt;sub&gt;pyridyl&lt;/sub&gt; bonds. In the Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cluster, the four Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; ions are chemically and symmetrically equivalent and are each coordinated with four sulfate O atoms to give a distorted cube-like structure. Electrocatalytic studies showed that these Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-M-MOFs are all active for electrocatalytic OER and ORR. Importantly, by regulating the activity of the metalloporphyrin units, it is confirmed that the Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cluster is active for oxygen electrocatalysis. With the use of Co porphyrins as connecting units, Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-Co-MOF displays the highest electrocatalytic activity in this series of MOFs by showing a 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; OER current density at 357&#160;mV overpotential and an ORR half-wave potential at 0.83&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Theoretical studies revealed the synergistic effect of two proximal Co atoms in the Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cluster in OER by facilitating the formation of O&#9472;O bonds. This work is of fundamental significance to present the construction of Co&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; clusters in framework structures for oxygen electrocatalysis and to demonstrate the cooperation between two proximal Co atoms in such clusters during the O&#9472;O bond formation process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Infectious and Inflammatory Microenvironment Self&#8208;Adaptive Artificial Peroxisomes with Synergetic Co&#8208;Ru Pair Centers for Programmed Diabetic Ulcer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An infectious and inflammatory microenvironment self&#8208;adaptive artificial peroxisome with synergetic Co&#8208;Ru pair centers (APCR) has been designed for programmed diabetic ulcer therapy. The synthesized APCR presents pH&#8208;switchable enzyme&#8208;like reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation activities, thus achieving the programmed bifunctional performances for bacterial sterilization in the infectious microenvironment and also alleviation of oxidative stress to promote wound tissue regeneration in the inflammatory microenvironment.








Abstract
Complex microenvironments with bacterial infection, persistent inflammation, and impaired angiogenesis are the major challenges in chronic refractory diabetic ulcers. To address this challenge, a comprehensive strategy with highly effective and integrated antimicrobial, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and accelerated angiogenesis will offer a new pathway to the rapid healing of infected diabetic ulcers. Here, inspired by the tunable reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation properties of natural peroxisomes, this work reports the design of infectious and inflammatory microenvironments self&#8208;adaptive artificial peroxisomes with synergetic Co&#8208;Ru pair centers (APCR) for programmed diabetic ulcer therapy. Benefiting from the synergistic Co and Ru atoms, the APCR can simultaneously achieve ROS production and metabolic inhibition for bacterial sterilization in the infectious microenvironment. After disinfection, the APCR can also eliminate ROS to alleviate oxidative stress in the inflammatory microenvironment and promote wound regeneration. The data demonstrate that the APCR combines highly effective antibacterial, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and provascular regeneration capabilities, making it an efficient and safe nanomedicine for treating infectious and inflammatory diabetic foot ulcers via a programmed microenvironment self&#8208;adaptive treatment pathway. This work expects that synthesizing artificial peroxisomes with microenvironments self&#8208;adaptive and bifunctional enzyme&#8208;like ROS regulation properties will provide a promising path to construct ROS catalytic materials for treating complex diabetic ulcers, trauma, or other infection&#8208;caused diseases.

         <title>Branched Oligomer&#8208;Based Reversible Adhesives Enabled by Controllable Self&#8208;Aggregation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The smart supramolecular adhesive based on small molecules suffers from low adhesion strength and narrow designability. Herein, a strong tough, and large&#8208;span rapid reversible adhesive is designed through controlling branched oligomer self&#8208;aggregation strategy with design flexibility and reversible double cross&#8208;linking interactions. This work makes it possible to design reversible adhesives with long&#8208;span outstanding properties using covalent polymers.








Abstract
Supramolecular adhesion material systems based on small molecules have shown great potential to unite the great contradiction between strong adhesion and reversibility. However, these material systems suffer from low adhesion strength/narrow adhesion span, limited designability, and single interaction due to fewer covalent bond content and action sites in small molecules. Herein, an ultrahigh&#8208;strength and large&#8208;span reversible adhesive enabled by a branched oligomer controllable self&#8208;aggregation strategy is developed. The dense covalent bonds present in the branched oligomers greatly enhance adhesion strength without compromising reversibility. The resulting adhesive exhibits a large&#8208;span reversible adhesion of &#8776;140 times, switching between ultra&#8208;strong and tough adhesion strength (5.58&#160;MPa and 5093.92&#160;N&#160;m&#8722;1) and ultralow adhesion (0.04&#160;MPa and 87.656&#160;N&#160;m&#8722;1) with alternating temperature. Moreover, reversible dynamic double cross&#8208;linking endows the adhesive with stable reversible adhesion transitions even after 100 cycles. This reversible adhesion property can also be remotely controlled via a voltage of 8&#160;V, with a loading voltage duration of 45&#160;s. This work paves the way for the design of reversible adhesives with long&#8208;span outstanding properties using covalent polymers and offers a pathway for the rational design of high&#8208;performance adhesives featuring both robust toughness and exceptional reversibility.

         <title>Accounting for the Quantum Capacitance of Graphite in Constant Potential Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The constant applied potential molecular dynamics method is modified to account for the quantum capacitance of electrode materials. The parameterization is made based on density functional theory calculations of the electronic density of states. The method is validated by computing the capacitance of graphite electrodes in contact with ionic electrolytes.








Abstract
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at a constant electric potential are an essential tool to study electrochemical processes, providing microscopic information on the structural, thermodynamic, and dynamical properties. Despite the numerous advances in the simulation of electrodes, they fail to accurately represent the electronic structure of materials such as graphite. In this work, a simple parameterization method that allows to tune the metallicity of the electrode based on a quantum chemistry calculation of the density of states (DOS) is introduced. As a first illustration, the interface between graphite electrodes and two different liquid electrolytes, an aqueous solution of NaCl and a pure ionic liquid, at different applied potentials are studied. It is shown that the simulations reproduce qualitatively the experimentally&#8208;measured capacitance; in particular, they yield a minimum of capacitance at the point of zero charge (PZC), which is due to the quantum capacitance (QC) contribution. An analysis of the structure of the adsorbed liquids allows to understand why the ionic liquid displays a lower capacitance despite its large ionic concentration. In addition to its relevance for the important class of carbonaceous electrodes, this method can be applied to any electrode materials (e.g. 2D materials, conducting polymers, etc), thus enabling molecular simulation studies of complex electrochemical devices in the&#160;future.

         <title>Muscle&#8208;Inspired Formable Wood&#8208;Based Phase Change Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, muscle&#8208;inspired, formable wood&#8208;based phase change materials (PCMs) are fabricated by leveraging the aligned structure of delignified wood and supramolecular networks of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/wood composites. The biodegradable PVA/wood composite with solvent&#8208;responsive characteristics between wood fibers and PVA chains enables the development of wood&#8208;based PCMs with switchable stiffness, making them formable and sustainable for versatile thermal management applications.








Abstract
Phase change materials (PCMs) are crucial for sustainable thermal management in energy&#8208;efficient construction and cold chain logistics, as they can store and release renewable thermal energy. However, traditional PCMs suffer from leakage and a loss of formability above their phase change temperatures, limiting their shape stability and versatility. Inspired by the muscle structure, formable PCMs with a hierarchical structure and solvent&#8208;responsive supramolecular networks based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/wood composites are developed. The material, in its hydrated state, demonstrates low stiffness and pliability due to the weak hydrogen bonding between aligned wood fibers and PVA molecules. Through treatment of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) into the PVA/wood PEG gel (PEG/PVA/W) with strengthened hydrogen bonds, the resulting wood&#8208;based PCMs in the hard and melting states elevate the tensile stress from 10.14 to 80.86&#160;MPa and the stiffness from 420&#160;MPa to 4.8&#160;GPa, making it 530 times stiffer than the PEG/PVA counterpart. Capable of morphing in response to solvent changes, these formable PCMs enable intricate designs for thermal management. Furthermore, supported by a comprehensive life cycle assessment, these shape&#8208;adaptable, recyclable, and biodegradable PCMs with lower environmental footprint present a sustainable alternative to conventional plastics and thermal management materials.

         <title>Bottom Contact Engineering for Ambient Fabrication of &gt;25% Durable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium gluconate (SG) is used to disperse tin oxide (SnO2) nanoparticles (NPs) in order to create a uniform SG&#8208;SnO2 film and control the buried interface. This allows for the deposition of perovskite films with nearly pinhole&#8208;free at the bottom contact interface in ambient air. The SG&#8208;SnO2 PSCs achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.34% (certified as 25.17%). Additionally, these PSCs retained around 90% of their initial PCE after 1000 h of operation (T90 = 1000&#160;h). Microstructure analysis revealed that light&#8208;induced degradation primarily occurred at the buried holes, so SG&#8208;SnO2 PSCs enhance light stability by suppressing the formation of holes at the buried interface.








Abstract
The bottom contact in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is easy to cause deep trap states and severe instability issues, especially under maximum power point tracking (MPPT). In this study, sodium gluconate (SG) is employed to disperse tin oxide (SnO2) nanoparticles (NPs) and regulate the interface contact at the buried interface. The SG&#8208;SnO2 electron transfer layer (ETL) enabled the deposition of pinhole&#8208;free perovskite films in ambient air and improved interface contact by bridging effect. SG&#8208;SnO2 PSCs achieved an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.34% (certified as 25.17%) with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) exceeding 1.19&#160;V. The VOC loss is less than 0.34&#160;V relative to the 1.53&#160;eV bandgap, and the fill factor (FF) loss is only 2.02% due to the improved contact. The SG&#8208;SnO2 PSCs retained around 90% of their initial PCEs after 1000&#160;h operation (T90 = 1000&#160;h), higher than T80 = 1000&#160;h for the control SnO2 PSC. Microstructure analysis revealed that light&#8208;induced degradation primarily occurred at the buried holes and grain boundaries and highlighted the importance of bottom&#8208;contact engineering.

         <title>Revealing Mode Formation in Quasi&#8208;Bound States in the Continuum Metasurfaces via Near&#8208;Field Optical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;field microscopy technique is introduced that resolves and quantifies quasi&#8208;bound state in the continuum modes in dielectric metasurfaces. The technique is employed for analyzing metasurface properties such as the finite array size effect, directional coupling, edge effects and defects on the single resonator level promising advancements in metasurface based catalysis and biospectroscopy by optimizing spatial footprint and active area.








Abstract
Photonic metasurfaces offer exceptional control over light at the nanoscale, facilitating applications spanning from biosensing, and nonlinear optics to photocatalysis. Many metasurfaces, especially resonant ones, rely on periodicity for the collective mode to form, which makes them subject to the influences of finite size effects, defects, and edge effects, which have considerable negative impact at the application level. These aspects are especially important for quasi&#8208;bound state in the continuum (BIC) metasurfaces, for which the collective mode is highly sensitive to perturbations due to high&#8208;quality factors and strong near&#8208;field enhancement. Here, the mode formation in quasi&#8208;BIC metasurfaces on the individual resonator level using scattering scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy (s&#8208;SNOM) in combination with a new image processing technique, is quantitatively investigated. It is found that the quasi&#8208;BIC mode is formed at a minimum size of 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8208;unit cells much smaller than expected from far&#8208;field measurements. Furthermore, it is shown that the coupling direction of the resonators, defects and edge states have pronounced influence on the quasi&#8208;BIC mode. This study serves as a link between the far&#8208;field and near&#8208;field responses of metasurfaces, offering crucial insights for optimizing spatial footprint and active area, holding promise for augmenting applications such as catalysis and biospectroscopy.

         <title>Synchronous Switching Strategy to Enhance the Real&#8208;Time Powering and Charging Performance of Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synchronous switching strategy is developed to enhance the real&#8208;time powering and charging performance of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). It can improve the real&#8208;time powering performance of TENG for sensors to 5&#8211;7 times, comparable to a commercial constant voltage source; and make it possible to enhance the charging performance of TENG in every charging cycle by up to 2.4 times.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are of great significance as sustainable power sources that harvest energy from the human body and environment. Nevertheless, due to TENG's impedance&#8208;dependent output voltage characteristics, in traditional strategy (TS), real&#8208;timely powering a sensor with TENG has a poor sensing on/off ratio (or response), and directly charging a capacitor with TENG shows a low charging efficiency. This degraded real&#8208;time powering and charging performance of TENG compared to a commercial constant voltage source is a huge challenge of the TENG field for a long time. This work proposes a synchronous switching strategy (SSS) for TENG to real&#8208;timely power sensors or charge capacitors without degrading its performance. Compared with TS, this new strategy enables sensors to have 5&#8211;7 times sensing on/off ratio enhancement when using TENG as a power source, reaching the powering ability of a commercial constant voltage source, it makes the powering performance of TENG stable under different driving frequency, improving the powering robustness of TENG. In addition, compared with TS, SSS can also enhance the charging efficiency of TENG in every charging cycle by up to 2.4 times when charging capacitors. This work contributes to real&#8208;timely powering or charging the distributed, mobile and wireless electronics using TENG.

         <title>Embedding Biomimetic Vascular Networks via Coaxial Sacrificial Writing into Functional Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coaxial sacrificial writing into functional tissues (co&#8208;SWIFT) is used to embed biomimetic vascular networks into densely cellular matrices. These coaxially printed and perfusable hierarchical, branching vessels are composed of a smooth muscle cell&#8208;laden shell that surrounds endothelialized lumens. Using co&#8208;SWIFT, vascularized cardiac tissues are constructed that exhibit synchronous beating, high contractility, and cardio&#8208;effective drug response.








Abstract
Printing human tissues and organs replete with biomimetic vascular networks is of growing interest. While it is possible to embed perfusable channels within acellular and densely cellular matrices, they do not currently possess the biomimetic architectures found in native vessels. Here, coaxial&#160;sacrificial writing into functional tissues (co&#8208;SWIFT) is developed, an embedded bioprinting method capable of generating hierarchically branching, multilayered vascular networks within both granular hydrogel and densely cellular matrices. Coaxial printheads are designed with an extended core&#8211;shell configuration to facilitate robust core&#8211;core and shell&#8211;shell interconnections between printed branching vessels during embedded bioprinting. Using optimized core&#8211;shell ink combinations, biomimetic vessels composed of a smooth muscle cell&#8208;laden shell that surrounds perfusable lumens are coaxially printed into granular matrices composed of: 1) transparent alginate microparticles, 2) sacrificial microparticle&#8208;laden collagen, or 3) cardiac spheroids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Biomimetic blood vessels that exhibit good barrier function are produced by seeding these interconnected lumens with a confluent layer of endothelial cells. Importantly, it is found that co&#8208;SWIFT cardiac tissues mature under perfusion, beat synchronously, and exhibit a cardio&#8208;effective drug response in vitro. This advance opens new avenues for the scalable biomanufacturing of vascularized organ&#8208;specific tissues for drug testing, disease modeling, and therapeutic use.

         <title>Engineering d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization with P, S Co&#8208;Coordination Asymmetric Configuration of Single Atoms Toward High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Cycling Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A P, S co&#8208;coordination asymmetric configuration of single atoms is designed to enhance the catalytic activity of Co central atoms and analyze the influence of coordination structure on electrochemical performance. The well&#8208;designed CoSA&#8208;N3PS structure can promote d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between Co and S atoms, thereby accelerating the bi&#8208;directional redox process of sulfur and exhibiting satisfactory electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been increasingly explored in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries to address the issues of severe polysulfide shuttle effects and sluggish redox kinetics. However, the structure&#8208;activity relationship between single&#8208;atom coordination structures and the performance of Li&#8211;S&#160;batteries remain unclear. In this study, a P, S co&#8208;coordination asymmetric configuration of single atoms is designed to enhance the catalytic activity of Co central atoms and promote d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between Co and S atoms, thereby limiting polysulfides and accelerating the bidirectional redox process of sulfur. The well&#8208;designed SACs enable Li&#8211;S batteries to demonstrate an ultralow capacity fading rate of 0.027% per cycle after 2000 cycles at a high rate of 5 C. Furthermore, they display excellent rate performance with a capacity of 619 mAh g&#8722;1 at an ultrahigh rate of 10 C due to the efficient catalysis of CoSA&#8208;N3PS. Importantly, the assembled pouch cell still retains a high discharge capacity of 660 mAh g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C and provides a high areal capacity of 4.4 mAh cm&#8722;2 even with a high sulfur loading of 6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates that regulating the coordination environment of SACs is of great significance for achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8211;S batteries.

&lt;p&gt;A P, S co-coordination asymmetric configuration of single atoms is designed to enhance the catalytic activity of Co central atoms and analyze the influence of coordination structure on electrochemical performance. The well-designed CoSA-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PS structure can promote d-p orbital hybridization between Co and S atoms, thereby accelerating the bi-directional redox process of sulfur and exhibiting satisfactory electrochemical performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been increasingly explored in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries to address the issues of severe polysulfide shuttle effects and sluggish redox kinetics. However, the structure-activity relationship between single-atom coordination structures and the performance of Li&#8211;S&#160;batteries remain unclear. In this study, a P, S co-coordination asymmetric configuration of single atoms is designed to enhance the catalytic activity of Co central atoms and promote d-p orbital hybridization between Co and S atoms, thereby limiting polysulfides and accelerating the bidirectional redox process of sulfur. The well-designed SACs enable Li&#8211;S batteries to demonstrate an ultralow capacity fading rate of 0.027% per cycle after 2000 cycles at a high rate of 5 C. Furthermore, they display excellent rate performance with a capacity of 619 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at an ultrahigh rate of 10 C due to the efficient catalysis of CoSA-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PS. Importantly, the assembled pouch cell still retains a high discharge capacity of 660 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 100 cycles at 0.2 C and provides a high areal capacity of 4.4 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; even with a high sulfur loading of 6&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work demonstrates that regulating the coordination environment of SACs is of great significance for achieving state-of-the-art Li&#8211;S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling the Role of Electric Double&#8208;Layer in Sulfur Catalysis for Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a competitive adsorption factor (fsulfur) to describe the sulfur adsorption in the electric double layer on the metal catalyst surface. An alloying method to alter it by enhancing p&#8211;d hybridization with electrolyte solvents is proposed, and a cobalt&#8211;zinc alloy catalyst with a moderate fsulfur shows enhanced activity and anti&#8208;passivation ability simultaneously in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
The metal&#8208;catalyzed sulfur reaction in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries usually suffers from the strong binding of sulfur species to the catalyst surface, which destroys the electric double layer (EDL) region there. This causes rapid catalyst deactivation because it prevents the desorption of sulfur species and mass transport through the EDL is hindered. This work introduces a competitive adsorption factor (fsulfur) as a new indicator to quantify the competitive adsorption of sulfur species in the EDL and proposes an alloying method to change it by strengthening the p&#8211;d hybridization of alloying metals with electrolyte solvents. A cobalt&#8211;zinc alloy catalyst with a moderate fsulfur lowers the activation energy of the rate&#8208;limiting step of the conversion of lithium polysulfides to lithium sulfide, giving a platform capacity proportion that is 96% of the theoretical value and has a greatly improved anti&#8208;passivation ability, especially at high sulfur loadings and lean electrolyte conditions (a low E/S ratio of 5&#160;&#181;L mgS&#8722;1). A pouch cell using this approach has a high energy density of up to 464&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. Such a competitive adsorption indicator and alloying strategy offer a new guideline for catalyst design and a practical electrocatalysis solution for Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Spatially Resolved Light&#8208;Induced Ferroelectric Polarization in &#945;&#8208;In2Se3/Te Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study visualizes light&#8208;induced ferroelectric polarization in an &#945;&#8208;In&#8322;Se&#8323;/Te heterojunction using photocurrent mapping. The device shows nonvolatile photoresponsivity with photocurrent enhancement up to 1000 times after polarization saturation. These findings demonstrate the potential of 2D ferroelectric materials for advanced photodetectors and optical information storage applications.








Abstract
Light&#8208;induced ferroelectric polarization in 2D layered ferroelectric materials holds promise in photodetectors with multilevel current and reconfigurable capabilities. However, translating this potential into practical applications for high&#8208;density optoelectronic information storage remains challenging. In this work, an &#945;&#8208;In2Se3/Te heterojunction design that demonstrates spatially resolved, multilevel, nonvolatile photoresponsivity is presented. Using photocurrent mapping, the spatially localized light&#8208;induced poling state (LIPS) is visualized in the junction region. This localized ferroelectric polarization induced by illumination enables the heterojunction to exhibit enhanced photoresponsivity. Unlike previous reports that observe multilevel polarization enhancement in electrical resistance, the device shows nonvolatile photoresponsivity enhancement under illumination. After polarization saturation, the photocurrent increases up to 1000 times, from 10&#8722;12 to 10&#8722;9 A under the irradiation of a 520&#160;nm laser with a power of 1.69 nW, compared to the initial state in a self&#8208;driven mode. The photodetector exhibits high detectivity of 4.6&#215;1010 Jones, with a rise time of 27 &#181;s and a fall time of 28 &#181;s. Furthermore, the device's localized poling characteristics and multilevel photoresponse enable spatially multiplexed optical information storage. These results advance the understanding of LIPS in 2D ferroelectric materials, paving the way for optoelectronic information storage technologies.

         <title>Aided Porous Medium Emulsification for Functional Hydrogel Microparticles Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aided porous medium emulsification for hydrogel microparticle synthesis (APME&#8208;HMS) system introduces a new approach to the hydrogel microparticle synthesis arsenal utilizing emulsification in a 3D porous medium. This innovative method synthesizes various&#8208;sized, functional microgels in minutes. With a scalable, cost&#8208;effective technique, APME&#8208;HMS has vast potential in biomedicine and beyond, with promising advancements in drug delivery, biosensing, and culinary arts.








Abstract
Despite the substantial advancement in developing various hydrogel microparticle (HMP) synthesis methods, emulsification through porous medium to synthesize functional hybrid protein&#8211;polymer HMPs has yet to be addressed. Here, the aided porous medium emulsification for hydrogel microparticle synthesis (APME&#8208;HMS) system, an innovative approach drawing inspiration from porous medium emulsification is introduced. This method capitalizes on emulsifying immiscible phases within a 3D porous structure for optimal HMP production. Using the APME&#8208;HMS system, synthesized responsive bovine serum albumin (BSA) and polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) HMPs of various sizes are successfully synthesized. Preserving protein structural integrity and functionality enable the formation of cytochrome c (cyt c) &#8211; PEGDA HMPs for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) detection at various concentrations. The flexibility of the APME&#8208;HMS system is demonstrated by its ability to efficiently synthesize HMPs using low volumes (&#8776;50&#160;&#181;L) and concentrations (100&#160;&#181;m) of proteins within minutes while preserving proteins&#8217; structural and functional properties. Additionally, the capability of the APME&#8208;HMS method to produce a diverse array of HMP types enriches the palette of HMP fabrication techniques, presenting it as a cost&#8208;effective, biocompatible, and scalable alternative for various biomedical applications, such as controlled drug delivery, 3D printing bio&#8208;inks, biosensing devices, with potential implications even in culinary applications.

         <title>The Guardian of Vision: Intelligent Bacteriophage&#8208;Based Eyedrops for Clinical Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Ocular Surface Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel intelligent phage eyedrop for treating refractory bacterial keratitis caused by clinically isolated multidrug&#8208;resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, combining a type I photosensitizer ACR&#8208;DMT with a phage is developed. This eyedrop maximizes the advantages of phagotherapy and photodynamic therapy to effectively target and kill multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria in the eye, preventing biofilm formation and promoting healing without scarring, and acts as a robust guardian of vision. 








Abstract
Clinical multidrug&#8208;resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR&#8208;PA) is the leading cause of refractory bacterial keratitis (BK). However, the reported BK treatment methods lack biosecurity and bioavailability, which usually causes irreversible visual impairment and even blindness. Herein, for BK caused by clinically isolated MDR&#8208;PA infection, armed phages are modularized with the type I photosensitizer (PS) ACR&#8208;DMT, and an intelligent phage eyedrop is developed for combined phagotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT). These eyedrops maximize the advantages of bacteriophages and ACR&#8208;DMT, enabling more robust and specific targeting killing of MDR&#8208;PA under low oxygen&#8208;dependence, penetrating and disrupting biofilms, and efficiently preventing biofilm reformation. Altering the biofilm and immune microenvironments alleviates inflammation noninvasively, promotes corneal healing without scar formation, protects ocular tissues, restores visual function, and prevents long&#8208;term discomfort and pain. This strategy exhibits strong scalability, enables at&#8208;home treatment of ocular surface infections with great patient compliance and a favorable prognosis, and has significant potential for clinical application.

These eyedrops maximize the advantages of bacteriophages and ACR-DMT, enabling more robust and specific targeting killing of MDR-PA under low oxygen-dependence, penetrating and disrupting biofilms, and efficiently preventing biofilm reformation. Altering the biofilm and immune microenvironments alleviates inflammation noninvasively, promotes corneal healing without scar formation, protects ocular tissues, restores visual function, and prevents long-term discomfort and pain. This strategy exhibits strong scalability, enables at-home treatment of ocular surface infections with great patient compliance and a favorable prognosis, and has significant potential for clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling Anomalies in Preferential Liquid Transport through the Intrinsic Pores of Cyclodextrin in Polyester Nanofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acyl chloride crosslinked macrocyclic&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based polyester nanofilm composite membranes result in membranes with high water permeance and superior ion&#8208;sieving capabilities. Polar aggregate pores in the nanofilm facilitate water permeation while the intrinsic cyclodextrin cavity does not contribute to liquid permeation, enabling selective permeation of polar liquids with extremely high permeance selectivity of &gt;500 and diminishes the existence of Janus pathways.








Abstract
The precise manipulation of the porous structure of the nanofiltration membrane is critical for unlocking enhanced separation efficiencies across various liquids and solutes. Ultrathin films of crosslinked macrocycles, specifically cyclodextrins (CDs), have drawn considerable attention in this area owing to their ability to facilitate precise molecular separation with high liquid permeance for both polar and non&#8208;polar liquids, resembling Janus membranes. However, the functional role of the intrinsic cavity of CD in liquid transport remains inadequately understood, demanding immediate attention in designing nanofiltration membranes. Here, the synthesis of polyester nanofilms derived from crosslinked &#946;&#8208;CD, demonstrating remarkable Na2SO4 rejection (&#8776;92 &#8211; 99.5%), high water permeance (&#8776;4.4 &#8211; 37.4 Lm&#8722;2h&#8722;1bar&#8722;1), extremely low hexane permeance (&lt;1 Lm&#8722;2h&#8722;1bar&#8722;1), and extremely high ratio (&#945; &gt; 500) of permeances for polar and non&#8208;polar liquids, is reported. Molecular simulations support the findings, indicating that neither the polar nor the non&#8208;polar liquids flow through the &#946;&#8208;CD cavity in the nanofilm. Instead, liquid transport predominantly occurs through the 2.2&#160;nm hydrophilic aggregate pores. This challenges the presumed functional role of macrocyclic cavities in liquid transport and raises questions about the existence of the Janus structure in nanofiltration membranes produced from the macrocyclic monomers.

         <title>Stabilizing Interlayer Repulsion in Layered Sodium&#8208;Ion Oxide Cathodes via Hierarchical Layer Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical layer modification strategy stabilizes interlayer repulsion and suppresses phase transformation in sodium&#8208;ion layered cathodes, achieving a single structure across a wide voltage by maintaining cationic content with migrated Li+ and anchored Ca2+, increasing oxygen layer valence with F&#8722; substitution and O redox reactions, and leveraging the interplay between robust Li&#9472;F bonds and Ca2+ steric effects.








Abstract
Layered sodium&#8208;ion oxides hold considerable promise in achieving high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the notorious phase transformation during charging, attributed to increased O2&#8722;&#9472;O2&#8722; repulsion, results in substantial performance decay. Here, a hierarchical layer modification strategy is proposed to stabilize interlayer repulsion. During desodiation, migrated Li+ from the transition metal layer and anchored Ca2+ in sodium sites maintain the cationic content within the sodium layer. Meanwhile, partial oxygen substitution by fluorine and the involvement of oxygen in redox reactions increase the average valence of the oxygen layer. This sustained cation presence and elevated anion valence collectively mitigate increasing O2&#8722;&#9472;O2&#8722; repulsion during sodium extraction, enabling the Na0.61Ca0.05[Li0.1Ni0.23Mn0.67]O1.95F0.05 (NCLNMOF) cathode to retain a pure P2&#8208;type structure across a wide voltage range. Unexpected insights reveal the interplay between different doping elements: the robust Li&#9472;F bonds and Ca2+ steric effects suppressing Li+ loss. The NCLNMOF electrode exhibits 82.5% capacity retention after 1000 cycles and a high&#8208;rate capability of 94 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1600&#160;mA g&#8722;1, demonstrating the efficacy of hierarchical layer modification for high&#8208;performance layered oxide cathodes.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Based Artificial Synapses for Sustainable Neuromorphic Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in functional hydrogel&#8208;based transistors and memristors and their potential as artificial synapses are discussed. In doing so, an outlook on new biocompatible and sustainable neuromorphic hardware is provided and how potential energy&#8208;efficient information storage and processing can be achieved using artificial neural networks with brain&#8208;inspired architecture for neuromorphic computing is discussed.








Abstract
Hydrogels find widespread applications in biomedicine because of their outstanding biocompatibility, biodegradability, and tunable material properties. Hydrogels can be chemically functionalized or reinforced to respond to physical or chemical stimulation, which opens up new possibilities in the emerging field of intelligent bioelectronics. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in functional hydrogel&#8208;based transistors and memristors is reviewed as potential artificial synapses. Within these systems, hydrogels can serve as semisolid dielectric electrolytes in transistors and as switching layers in memristors. These synaptic devices with volatile and non&#8208;volatile resistive switching show good adaptability to external stimuli for short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term synaptic memory effects, some of which are integrated into synaptic arrays as artificial neurons; although, there are discrepancies in switching performance and efficacy. By comparing different hydrogels and their respective properties, an outlook is provided on a new range of biocompatible, environment&#8208;friendly, and sustainable neuromorphic hardware. How potential energy&#8208;efficient information storage and processing can be achieved using artificial neural networks with brain&#8208;inspired architecture for neuromorphic computing is described. The development of hydrogel&#8208;based artificial synapses can significantly impact the fields of neuromorphic bionics, biometrics, and biosensing.

         <title>Advanced Anti&#8208;Icing Strategies and Technologies by Macrostructured Photothermal Storage Superhydrophobic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective reviews the cutting&#8208;edge progress of superhydrophobic surfaces in anti&#8208;icing and proposes a unique concept of smart surfaces, termed the macrostructured photothermal storage superhydrophobic (MPSS) surfaces, for all&#8208;day efficient anti&#8208;icing. The MPSS surfaces integrate the functions of macrostructured superhydrophobic surfaces, photothermal materials, and energy storage materials, and shall be applied in diverse anti&#8208;icing scenarios.








Abstract
Water is the source of life and civilization, but water icing causes catastrophic damage to human life and diverse industrial processes. Currently, superhydrophobic surfaces (inspired by the lotus effect) aided anti&#8208;icing attracts intensive attention due to their energy&#8208;free property. Here, recent advances in anti&#8208;icing by design and functionalization of superhydrophobic surfaces are reviewed. The mechanisms and advantages of conventional, macrostructured, and photothermal superhydrophobic surfaces are introduced in turn. Conventional superhydrophobic surfaces, as well as macrostructured ones, easily lose the icephobic property under extreme conditions, while photothermal superhydrophobic surfaces strongly rely on solar illumination. To address the above issues, a potentially smart strategy is found by developing macrostructured photothermal storage superhydrophobic (MPSS) surfaces, which integrate the functions of macrostructured superhydrophobic materials, photothermal materials, and phase change materials (PCMs), and are expected to achieve all&#8208;day anti&#8208;icing in various fields. Finally, the latest achievements in developing MPSS surfaces, showcasing their immense potential, are highlighted. Besides, the perspectives on the future development of MPSS surfaces are provided and the problems that need to be solved in their practical applications are proposed.

         <title>Reprograming Clots for In Vivo Chemical Targeting in Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a novel targeting strategy for traumatic brain injury, R. Kandell, J. Wu, and E. Kwon utilize in vivo click chemistry to reprogram the fibrin clot for secondary targeting of intravenously delivered nanomaterials. Strained cyclooctynes are engineered on the clot for subsequent capture and retention of circulating azide&#8208;modified materials, including a small molecule, 8&#8208;arm PEG nanomaterial, and therapeutic antioxidant protein.








Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a critical public health concern, yet there are no therapeutics available to improve long&#8208;term outcomes. Drug delivery to TBI remains a challenge due to the blood&#8208;brain barrier and increased intracranial pressure. In this work, a chemical targeting approach to improve delivery of materials to the injured brain, is developed. It is hypothesized that the provisional fibrin matrix can be harnessed as an injury&#8208;specific scaffold that can be targeted by materials via click chemistry. To accomplish this, the brain clot is engineered in situ by delivering fibrinogen modified with strained cyclooctyne (SCO) moieties, which incorporated into the injury lesion and is retained there for days. Improved intra&#8208;injury capture and retention of diverse, clickable azide&#8208;materials including a small molecule azide&#8208;dye, 40&#160;kDa azide&#8208;PEG nanomaterial, and a therapeutic azide&#8208;protein in multiple dosing regimens is subsequently observed. To demonstrate therapeutic translation of this approach, a reduction in reactive oxygen species levels in the injured brain after delivery of the antioxidant catalase, is achieved. Further, colocalization between azide and SCO&#8208;fibrinogen is specific to the brain over off&#8208;target organs. Taken together, a chemical targeting strategy leveraging endogenous clot formation is established which can be applied to improve therapeutic delivery after TBI.

         <title>Stable n&#8208;Type Perylene Derivative Ladder Polymer with Antiambipolarity for Electrically Reconfigurable Organic Logic Gates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;type, &#960;&#8208;extended poly(benzimidazoanthradiisoquinolinedione) ladder polymer with good backbone planarity, predominant edge&#8208;on packing, and porous structure exhibits excellent mixed ionic&#8208;electronic transport properties and enables high&#8208;performing organic electrochemical transistor (OECT). Additionally, the OECT shows stable reversible antiambipolar characteristics. Electrically reconfigurable logic gates, with the dynamic capability of realizing AND, NOR, OR, and NAND gates are accomplished with this single polymer.









Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are one of the promising building blocks to realize next&#8208;generation bioelectronics. To date, however, the performance and signal processing capabilities of these devices remain limited by their stability and speed. Herein, the authors demonstrate stable and fast n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors based on a side&#8208;chain&#8208;free ladder polymer, poly(benzimidazoanthradiisoquinolinedione). The device demonstrated fast normalized transient speed of 0.56 &#177; 0.17 ms&#160;um&#8722;2 and excellent long&#8208;term stability in aqueous electrolytes, with no significant drop in its doping current after 50&#8239;000 successive doping/dedoping cycles and 2&#8208;month storage at ambient conditions. These unique characteristics make this polymer especially suitable for bioelectronics, such as being used as a pull&#8208;down channel in a complementary inverter for long&#8208;term stable detection of electrophysiological signals. Moreover, the developed device shows a reversible anti&#8208;ambipolar behavior, enabling reconfigurable electronics to be realized using a single material. These results go beyond the conventional OECT and demonstrate the potential of OECTs to exhibit dynamically configurable functionalities for next&#8208;generation reconfigurable electronics.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Functionalized Microgels as Artificial Antigen&#8208;Presenting Cells to Regulate Expansion of T Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microgels are fabricated as artificial antigen&#8208;presenting cells (aAPCs) to present stimulatory ligands specifically on the surface. Surface&#8208;specific functionalization is achieved via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer coatings, forming a thin but dense polymer layer on the surface. Microgels modified with appropriate ligands promote polyclonal and antigen&#8208;specific T cell expansion and regulate T cell phenotype and function.








Abstract
Artificial antigen&#8208;presenting cells (aAPCs) are currently used to manufacture T cells for adoptive therapy in cancer treatment, but a readily tunable and modular system can enable both rapid T cell expansion and control over T cell phenotype. Here, it is shown that microgels with tailored surface biochemical properties can serve as aAPCs to mediate T cell activation and expansion. Surface functionalization of microgels is achieved via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer coating using oppositely charged polymers, forming a thin but dense polymer layer on the surface. This facile and versatile approach is compatible with a variety of coating polymers and allows efficient and flexible surface&#8208;specific conjugation of defined peptides or proteins. The authors demonstrate that tethering appropriate stimulatory ligands on the microgel surface efficiently activates T cells for polyclonal and antigen&#8208;specific expansion. The expansion, phenotype, and functional outcome of primary mouse and human T cells can be regulated by modulating the concentration, ratio, and distribution of stimulatory ligands presented on microgel surfaces as well as the stiffness and viscoelasticity of the microgels.

         <title>Visualizing the Internal Nanocrystallinity of Calcite Due to Nonclassical Crystallization by 3D Coherent X&#8208;Ray Diffraction Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcite particles are synthesized using two approaches and their 3D internal crystalline structure is characterized using coherent X&#8208;ray imaging. A defects&#8217; analysis reveals the existence of multiple domains for the samples synthesized under nonequilibrium conditions with the presence of null electron density regions, while the particles synthesized under near&#8208;equilibrium conditions show a much less defective structure.








Abstract
The internal crystallinity of calcite is investigated for samples synthesized using two approaches: precipitation from solution and the ammonium carbonate diffusion method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses reveal that the calcite products precipitated using both approaches have a well&#8208;defined rhombohedron shape, consistent with the euhedral crystal habit of the mineral. The internal structure of these calcite crystals is characterized using Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) to determine the 3D electron density and the atomic displacement field. BCDI reconstructions for crystals synthesized using the ammonium carbonate diffusion approach have the expected euhedral shape, with internal strain fields and few internal defects. In contrast, the crystals synthesized by precipitation from solution have very complex external shapes and defective internal structures, presenting null electron density regions and pronounced displacement field distributions. These heterogeneities are interpreted as multiple crystalline domains, created by a nonclassical crystallization mechanism, where smaller nanoparticles coalescence into the final euhedral particles. The combined use of SEM, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and BCDI allows for structurally differentiating calcite crystals grown with different approaches, opening new opportunities to understand how grain boundaries and internal defects alter calcite reactivity.

Magnetic navigation systems (MNS) facilitate minimally invasive procedures but face cost and infrastructure constraints. The Navion, a portable electromagnetic system, addresses these issues by generating a large magnetic field and is easily deployable in hospitals. It aids in the adoption of magnetically responsive medical devices, demonstrated through in vitro and in vivo experiments navigating various microstructures and catheters for medical procedures.








Abstract
Magnetic navigation systems are used to precisely manipulate magnetically responsive materials enabling the realization of new minimally invasive procedures using magnetic medical devices. Their widespread applicability has been constrained by high infrastructure demands and costs. The study reports on a portable electromagnetic navigation system, the Navion, which is capable of generating a large magnetic field over a large workspace. The system is easy to install in hospital operating rooms and transportable through health care facilities, aiding in the widespread adoption of magnetically responsive medical devices. First, the design and implementation approach for the system are introduced and its performance is characterized. Next, in vitro navigation of different microrobot structures is demonstrated using magnetic field gradients and rotating magnetic fields. Spherical permanent magnets, electroplated cylindrical microrobots, microparticle swarms, and magnetic composite bacteria&#8208;inspired helical structures are investigated. The navigation of magnetic catheters is also demonstrated in two challenging endovascular tasks: 1) an angiography procedure and 2) deep navigation within the circle of Willis. Catheter navigation is demonstrated in a porcine model in vivo to perform an angiography under magnetic guidance.</dc:description>

Catheter navigation is demonstrated in a porcine model in vivo to perform an angiography under magnetic guidance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microneedle&#8208;Mediated Delivery of Immunomodulators Restores Immune Privilege in Hair Follicles and Reverses Immune&#8208;Mediated Alopecia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alopecia areata is a condition characterized by hair loss due to autoimmunity. Expansion of endogenous regulatory T cells (Tregs) at the site of antigen encounter can restore the skin immune balance. Here, a hydrogel microneedle is utilized to amplify Tregs in a murine model of alopecia leading to sustained hair regrowth without engendering peripheral immunosuppression. This approach could reshape the landscape of autoimmune skin disease management.








Abstract
Disorders in the regulatory arm of the adaptive immune system result in autoimmune&#8208;mediated diseases. While systemic immunosuppression is the prevailing approach to manage them, it fails to achieve long&#8208;lasting remission due to concomitant suppression of the regulatory arm and carries the risk of heightened susceptibility to infections and malignancies. Alopecia areata is a condition characterized by localized hair loss due to autoimmunity. The accessibility of the skin allows&#160;local rather than systemic intervention to avoid broad immunosuppression. It is hypothesized that the expansion of endogenous regulatory T cells (Tregs) at the site of antigen encounter can restore the immune balance and generate a long&#8208;lasting tolerogenic response. A hydrogel microneedle (MN) patch is therefore utilized for delivery of CCL22, a Treg&#8208;chemoattractant, and IL&#8208;2, a Treg&#160;survival factor to amplify them. In an immune&#8208;mediated murine model of alopecia, local bolstering of Treg&#160;numbers is shown, leading to sustained hair regrowth and attenuation of inflammatory pathways. In a humanized skin transplant mouse model, expansion of Tregs within human skin is confirmed without engendering peripheral immunosuppression. The patch offers high&#8208;loading capacity and shelf&#8208;life stability for prospective clinical translation. By harmonizing immune responses locally, the aim is to reshape the landscape of autoimmune skin disease management.

         <title>Antiferroelectric Ceramics for Energy&#8208;Efficient Capacitors by Theory&#8208;Guided Discovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;perfect charge&#8211;discharge energy efficiency, 98.2%, is observed in a PbZrO3&#8208;based antiferroelectric ceramic. The compositions with such compatible antiferroelectric&#8211;ferroelectric phase transitions are discovered by theory&#8208;guided high&#8208;throughput synthesis. The almost eliminated electric hysteresis is a result of minimized lattice mismatch strain at the interface during phase transition. The highly energy&#8208;efficient capacitor also exhibits 80 times enhancement in service lifetime.








Abstract
Antiferroelectric ceramics, via the electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced antiferroelectric (AFE)&#8211;ferroelectric (FE) phase transitions, show great promise for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density capacitors. Yet, currently, only 70&#8211;80% energy release is found during a charge&#8211;discharge cycle. Here, for PbZrO3&#8208;based oxides, geometric nonlinear theory of martensitic phase transitions is applied (first used to guide supercompatible shape&#8208;memory alloys) to predict the reversibility of the AFE&#8211;FE transition by using density&#8208;functional theory to assess AFE/FE interfacial lattice&#8208;mismatch strain that assures ultralow electric hysteresis and extended fatigue lifetime. A good correlation of mismatch strain with electric hysteresis, hence, with energy efficiency of AFE capacitors is observed. Guided by theory, high&#8208;throughput material search is conducted and AFE compositions with a near&#8208;perfect charge&#8211;discharge energy efficiency (98.2%), i.e., near&#8208;zero hysteresis are discovered. And the fatigue life of the capacitor reaches 79.5 million charge&#8211;discharge cycles, a factor of 80 enhancement over AFE ceramics with large electric hysteresis.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Engineering Enables Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Exhibiting BT.2020 Color Gamut</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, an effective approach is proposed to design deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence&#160;molecules based on hybrid long&#8208; and short&#8208;range charge&#8208;transfer by incorporating multiple donor moieties into organoboron multiple resonance acceptors. The resulting molecule exhibits deep&#8208;blue emission, narrow spectra, and high reverse intersystem crossing&#160;rate. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode fabricated with the designed molecule records maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.8% with the Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage&#160;coordinates of (0.163, 0.046).








Abstract
Organic luminescent materials that exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) can convert non&#8208;emissive triplet excitons into emissive singlet states through a reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. Therefore, they have tremendous potential for applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, with the development of ultra&#8208;high definition 4K/8K display technologies, designing efficient deep&#8208;blue TADF materials to achieve the Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates fulfilling BT.2020 remains a significant challenge. Here, an effective approach is proposed to design deep&#8208;blue TADF molecules based on hybrid long&#8208; and short&#8208;range charge&#8208;transfer by incorporation of multiple donor moieties into organoboron multiple resonance acceptors. The resulting TADF molecule exhibits deep&#8208;blue emission at 414&#160;nm with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29&#160;nm, together with a thousand&#8208;fold increase in RISC rate. OLEDs based on the champion material achieve a record maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.8% with CIE coordinates of (0.163, 0.046), approaching the coordinates of the BT.2020 blue standard. Moreover, TADF&#8208;assisted fluorescence devices employing the designed material as a sensitizer exhibit an exceptional EQE of 33.1%. This work thus provides a blueprint for future development of efficient deep&#8208;blue TADF emitters, representing an important milestone towards meeting the blue color gamut standard of BT.2020.

         <title>Wearable Coaxially&#8208;Shielded Metamaterial for Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drawing inspiration from commercial coaxial cable, a wireless, flexible, lightweight, and cheap metamaterial with an internal coaxially&#8208;shielded structure, confining electric field within while possessing a predominant magnetic response for magnetic resonance imaging is constructed. The metamaterial is capable of achieving a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio comparable to or surpass that of commercial receive coil arrays in some aspects.








Abstract
Recent advancements in metamaterials have yielded the possibility of a wireless solution to improve signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Unlike traditional closely packed local coil arrays with rigid designs and numerous components, these lightweight, cost&#8208;effective metamaterials eliminate the need for radio frequency cabling, baluns, adapters, and interfaces. However, their clinical adoption is limited by their low sensitivity, bulky physical footprint, and limited, specific use cases. Herein, a wearable metamaterial developed using commercially available coaxial cable, designed for a 3.0&#160;T MRI system is introduced. This metamaterial inherits the coaxially&#8208;shielded structure of its constituent cable, confining the electric field within and mitigating coupling to its surroundings. This ensures safer clinical adoption, lower signal loss, and resistance to frequency shifts. Weighing only 50&#160;g, the metamaterial maximizes its sensitivity by conforming to the anatomical region of interest. MRI images acquired using this metamaterial with various pulse sequences achieve an SNR comparable or even surpass that of a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 16&#8208;channel knee coil. This work introduces a novel paradigm for constructing metamaterials in the MRI environment, paving the way for the development of next&#8208;generation wireless MRI technology.

         <title>Temperature Dependence of Relativistic Valence Band Splitting Induced by an Altermagnetic Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Altermagnets exhibit momentum&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;split states providing new opportunities for spin electronic devices. Through temperature&#8208;dependent angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and disordered local moment calculations, it is demonstrated that the relativistic valence band splitting of the prototypical MnTe altermagnet is of magnetic origin. This is attributed to a novel relativistic spin&#8208;splitting phenomenon concurrent with the establishment of the altermagnetic order below the N&#233;el temperature.








Abstract
Altermagnetic (AM) materials exhibit non&#8208;relativistic, momentum&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;split states, ushering in new opportunities for spin electronic devices. While the characteristics of spin&#8208;splitting are documented within the framework of the non&#8208;relativistic spin group symmetry, there is limited exploration of the inclusion of relativistic symmetry and its impact on the emergence of a novel spin&#8208;splitting in the band structure. This study delves into the intricate relativistic electronic structure of an AM material, &#945;&#8722;MnTe. Employing temperature&#8208;dependent angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy across the AM phase transition, the emergence of a relativistic valence band splitting concurrent with the establishment of magnetic order is elucidated. This discovery is validated through disordered local moment calculations, modeling the influence of magnetic order on the electronic structure and confirming the magnetic origin of the observed splitting. The temperature&#8208;dependent splitting is ascribed to the advent of relativistic spin&#8208;splitting resulting from the strengthening of AM order in &#945;&#8722;MnTe as the temperature decreases. This sheds light on a previously unexplored facet of this intriguing material.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Crack Formation on DNA Film via Organic Solvent&#8208;Induced Dehydration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orientation control is possible for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in a hydrated state, and this affects to create cracks induced by drying. A method is for controlled crack generation in oriented DNA films by inducing mechanical fractures through organic solvent&#8208;induced dehydration (OSID). The straightforward approach devised for aligning cracks has the potential for use in various patterning applications.








Abstract
Crack is found on the soil when severe drought comes, which inspires the idea to rationalize patterning applications using dried deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) film. DNA is one of the massively produced biomaterials in nature, showing the lyotropic liquid crystal (LC) phase in highly concentrated conditions. DNA nanostructures in the hydrated condition can be orientation controlled, which can be extended to make dryinginduced cracks. The controlled crack generation in oriented DNA films by inducing mechanical fracture through organic solvent&#8208;induced dehydration (OSID) using tetrahydrofuran (THF) is explored. The corresponding simulations show a strong correlation between the long axis of DNA due to the shrinkage during the dehydration and in the direction of crack propagation. The cracks are controlled by simple brushing and a 3D printing method. This facile way of aligning cracks will be used in potential patterning applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Ceramics Enhanced Droplet Electricity Generator for Energy Harvesting and Bacterial Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper presents a novel method to enhance output of droplet electricity generator (DEG) by high entropy ceramics. Further development is made in expanding the application scope of high&#8208;output DEG, not only enhancing energy harvesting efficiency but also promoting the development of single&#8208;droplet&#8208;electricity&#8208;generator&#8208;based biosensors.









Abstract
The droplet electricity generator (DEG) is a solid&#8211;liquid triboelectric nanogenerator with transistor&#8208;inspired bulk effect, which is regarded as an effective strategy for raindrop energy harvesting. However, further enhancement of DEG output voltage is necessary to enable its widespread applications. Here, high&#8208;entropy ceramics are integrated into the design of DEG intermediate layer for the first time, achieving a high output voltage of 525 V. High&#8208;entropy ceramics have colossal dielectric constant, which can help to reduce the triboelectric charge decay for DEG. Furthermore, the effect of factors on DEG output performance when employing high&#8208;entropy ceramics as the intermediate layer is extensively analyzed, and the underlying mechanisms and mathematical models are explored. Finally, the enhanced output voltage of DEG not only facilitates faster energy harvesting but also develops a novel method for rapid bacterial detection. This work successfully integrates high&#8208;entropy ceramics into DEG design, significantly enhances the output voltage, and offers a novel direction for DEG development.

         <title>Enhanced Oxygen Evolution and Zinc&#8208;Air Battery Performance via Electronic Spin Modulation in Heterostructured Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic spin modulation by magnetic heterojunctions facilitates spin&#8208;selected charge transport, optimizes the reaction kinetics, and decreases the energy barrier to the evolution of oxygen, without the need for an external magnetic field.








Abstract
Beyond optimizing electronic energy levels, the modulation of the electronic spin configuration is an effective strategy, often overlooked, to boost activity and selectivity in a range of catalytic reactions, including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This electronic spin modulation is frequently accomplished using external magnetic fields, which makes it impractical for real applications. Herein, spin modulation is achieved by engineering Ni/MnFe2O4 heterojunctions, whose surface is reconstructed into NiOOH/MnFeOOH during the OER. NiOOH/MnFeOOH shows a high spin state of Ni, which regulates the OH&#8722; and O2 adsorption energy and enables spin alignment of oxygen intermediates. As a result, NiOOH/MnFeOOH electrocatalysts provide excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 261 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Besides, rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries based on Ni/MnFe2O4 show a high open circuit potential of 1.56 V and excellent stability for more than 1000 cycles. This outstanding performance is rationalized using density functional theory calculations, which show that the optimal spin state of both Ni active sites and oxygen intermediates facilitates spin&#8208;selected charge transport, optimizes the reaction kinetics, and decreases the energy barrier to the evolution of oxygen. This study provides valuable insight into spin polarization modulation by heterojunctions enabling the design of next&#8208;generation OER catalysts with boosted performance.

         <title>Endothermic Charge Separation Occurs Spontaneously in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptor/Polymer Bulk Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endothermic charge separation is found to occur spontaneously in a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA)&#8208;based bulk heterostructure (PM6:Y6), which can be driven by entropy. This process can produce free carriers even with a small interfacial energy level offset, which can contribute to the high performance found in recent NFA organic photovoltaics.








Abstract
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) based on non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have achieved a power conversion efficiency close to 20%. These NFA OPVs can generate free carriers efficiently despite a very small energy level offset at the donor/acceptor interface. Why these NFAs can enable efficient charge separation (CS) with low energy losses remains an open question. Here, the CS process in the PM6:Y6 bulk heterojunction is probed by time&#8208;resolved two&#8208;photon photoemission spectroscopy. It is found that the CS, the conversion from bound charge transfer (CT) excitons to free carriers, is an endothermic process with an enthalpy barrier of 0.15&#160;eV. The CS can occur spontaneously despite being an endothermic process, which implies that it is driven by entropy. It is further argued that the morphology of the PM6:Y6 film and the anisotropic electron delocalization restrict the electron and hole wavefunctions within the CT exciton such that they can primarily contact each other through point&#8208;like junctions. This configuration can maximize the entropic driving force.

It is found that the CS, the conversion from bound charge transfer (CT) excitons to free carriers, is an endothermic process with an enthalpy barrier of 0.15&#160;eV. The CS can occur spontaneously despite being an endothermic process, which implies that it is driven by entropy. It is further argued that the morphology of the PM6:Y6 film and the anisotropic electron delocalization restrict the electron and hole wavefunctions within the CT exciton such that they can primarily contact each other through point-like junctions. This configuration can maximize the entropic driving force.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elevating Charge Transport Layer for Stable Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique nanostructure of elevated hole transport layer between the perovskite grains is introduced to effectively inhibit ion migration in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes, achieving a record operational half&#8208;lifetime of 256 and 1774 h under current densities of 100 and 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#65292; respectively.








Abstract
Ion migration is a major factor affecting the long term stability of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), which limits their commercialization potential. The accumulation of excess halide ions at the grain boundaries of perovskite films is a primary cause of ion migration in these devices. Here, it is demonstrated that the channels of ion migrations can be effectively impeded by elevating the hole transport layer between the perovskite grain boundaries, resulting in highly stable perovskite LEDs. The unique structure is achieved by reducing the wettability of the perovskites, which prevents infiltration of the upper hole&#8208;transporting layer into the spaces of perovskite grain boundaries. Consequently, nanosized gaps are formed between the excess halide ions and the hole transport layer, effectively suppressing ion migration. With this structure, perovskite LEDs with operational half&#8208;lifetimes of 256 and 1774 h under current densities of 100 and 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 respectively are achieved. These lifetimes surpass those of organic LEDs at high brightness. It is further found that this approach can be extended to various perovskite LEDs, showing great promise for promoting perovskite LEDs toward commercial applications.

         <title>Bioinspired Superhydrophobic All&#8208;In&#8208;One Coating for Adaptive Thermoregulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the longitudinal gradient and surface structure of the lotus leaf, this study presents an all&#8208;in&#8208;one coating that integrates superhydrophobicity, thermal&#8208;responsive sunlight reflectivity, and high infrared emission through a simple one&#8208;step process. The coating enables automatic transitions between radiative cooling and solar warming, preventing overcooling and contamination, offering a novel approach for large&#8208;scale production of smart thermoregulatory coatings.








Abstract
The development of scalable and passive coatings that can adapt to seasonal temperature changes while maintaining superhydrophobic self&#8208;cleaning functions is crucial for their practical applications. However, the incorporation of passive cooling and heating functions with conflicting optical properties in a superhydrophobic coating is still challenging. Herein, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one coating inspired by the hierarchical structure of a lotus leaf that combines surface wettability, optical structure, and temperature self&#8208;adaptation is obtained through a simple one&#8208;step phase separation process. This coating exhibits an asymmetrical gradient structure with surface&#8208;embedded hydrophobic SiO2 particles and subsurface thermochromic microcapsules within vertically distributed hierarchical porous structures. Moreover, the coating imparts superhydrophobicity, high infrared emission, and thermo&#8208;switchable sunlight reflectivity, enabling autonomous transitions between radiative cooling and solar warming. The all&#8208;in&#8208;one coating prevents contamination and over&#8208;cooling caused by traditional radiative cooling materials, opening up new prospects for the large&#8208;scale manufacturing of intelligent thermoregulatory coatings.

         <title>3D Intelligent Cloaked Vehicle Equipped with Thousand&#8208;Level Reconfigurable Full&#8208;Polarization Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D full&#8208;polarization cloaking system is proposed and the in situ dynamic invisibility is realized using a travelling vehicle. The cloaking system integrates with a perception&#8208;decision&#8208;control&#8208;execution operation loop, which mainly contains external sensors, high&#8208;performance metasurfaces, and hybrid inverse optimization strategy. Experiment results verifies its performance which yields a background scattering matching degree of up to 93.3%.








Abstract
A crucial aspect in shielding a variety of advanced electronic devices from electromagnetic detection involves controlling the flow of electromagnetic waves, akin to invisibility cloaks. Decades ago, the exploration of transformation optics heralded the dawn of modern invisibility cloaks, which has stimulated immense interest across various physical scenarios. However, most prior research is simplified to low&#8208;dimensional and stationary hidden objects, limiting their practical applicability in a dynamically changing world. This study develops a 3D large&#8208;scale intelligent cloak capable of remaining undetectable even in non&#8208;stationary conditions. By employing thousand&#8208;level reconfigurable full&#8208;polarization metasurfaces, this work has achieved an exceptionally high degree of freedom in sculpting the scattering waves as desired. Serving as the core computational unit, a hybrid inverse design enables the cloaked vehicle to respond in real&#8208;time, with a rapid reaction time of just 70&#160;ms. These experiments integrate the cloaked vehicle with a perception&#8208;decision&#8208;control&#8208;execution system and evaluate its performance under random static positions and dynamic travelling trajectories, achieving a background scattering matching degree of up to 93.3%. These findings establish a general paradigm for the next generation of intelligent meta&#8208;devices in real&#8208;world settings, potentially paving the way for an era of &#8220;Electromagnetic Internet of Things.&#8221;

         <title>Neutrophil Extracellular Traps&#8208;Inhibiting and Fouling&#8208;Resistant Polysulfoxides Potently Prevent Postoperative Adhesion, Tumor Recurrence, and Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wang and colleagues have crafted and evaluated a sulfoxide&#8208;containing homopolymer, PMeSEA, distinguished by its pronounced fouling resistance and the capability to inhibit neutrophil extracellular traps. These properties endow PMeSEA with the inherent capacity to simultaneously prevent a spectrum of postoperative complications, including postoperative adhesion, tumor recurrence, and metastasis.








Abstract
Peritoneal metastasis (PM) is considered one of the most dreaded forms of cancer metastases for both patients and physicians. Aggressive cytoreductive surgery (CRS) is the primary treatment for peritoneal metastasis. Unfortunately, this intensive treatment frequently causes clinical complications, such as postoperative recurrence, metastasis, and adhesion formation. Emerging evidence suggests that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) released by inflammatory neutrophils contribute to these complications. Effective NET&#8208;targeting strategies thus show considerable potential in counteracting these complications but remain challenging. Here, one type of sulfoxide&#8208;containing homopolymer, PMeSEA, with potent fouling&#8208;resistant and NET&#8208;inhibiting capabilities, is synthesized and screened. Hydrating sulfoxide groups endow PMeSEA with superior nonfouling ability, significantly inhibiting protein/cell adhesion. Besides, the polysulfoxides can be selectively oxidized by ClO&#8722; which is required to stabilize the NETs rather than H2O2, and ClO&#8722; scavenging effectively inhibits NETs formation without disturbing redox homeostasis in tumor cells and quiescent neutrophils. As a result, PMeSEA potently prevents postoperative adhesions, significantly suppresses peritoneal metastasis, and shows synergetic antitumor activity with chemotherapeutic 5&#8208;Fluorouracil. Moreover, coupling CRS with PMeSEA potently inhibits CRS&#8208;induced tumor metastatic relapse and postoperative adhesions. Notably, PMeSEA exhibits low in vivo acute and subacute toxicities, implying significant potential for clinical postoperative adjuvant treatment.

         <title>Realization of Fine&#8208;Tuning the Lattice Thermal Conductivity and Anharmonicity in Layered Semiconductors via Entropy Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;range mixing entropy engineering is realized in a series of layered semiconductors. Dominating Umklapp three&#8208;phonon scattering process mechanism is revealed by the linear &#954;&#8208;T&#8722;1 behavior. Fine tuning of lattice thermal conductivity is achieved with an almost linear &#916;Smix dependence. The slope of the &#954;&#8208;T&#8722;1 curve reduces with increasing &#916;Smix, revealing a linear response to the reduced Gr&#252;neisen parameter.








Abstract
Entropy engineering is widely proven to be effective in achieving ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity for well&#8208;performed thermoelectric and heat management applications. However, no strong correlation between entropy and lattice thermal conductivity is found until now, and the fine&#8208;tuning of thermal conductivity continuously via entropy&#8208;engineering in a wide entropy range is still lacking. Here, a series of high&#8208;entropy layered semiconductors, Ni1&#8722;x(Fe0.25Co0.25Mn0.25Zn0.25)xPS3, where 0 &#8804; x &lt; 1, with low mass/size disorder is designed. High&#8208;purity samples with mixing configuration entropy of metal atomic site in a wide range of 0&#8211;1.61R are achieved. Umklapp phonon&#8208;phonon scattering is found to be the dominating phonon scattering mechanism, as revealed by the linear T&#8722;1 dependence of thermal conductivity. Meanwhile, fine tuning of the lattice thermal conductivity via continuous entropy engineering at metal atomic sites is achieved, in an almost linear dependence in middle&#8208;/high&#8208; entropy range. Moreover, the slope of the &#954;&#160;&#8208; T&#8722;1 curve reduces with the increase in entropy, and a linear response of the reduced Gr&#252;neisen parameter is revealed. This work provides an entropy engineering strategy by choosing multiple metal elements with low mass/size disorder to achieve the fine tuning of the lattice thermal conductivity and the anharmonic effect.

         <title>Enabling Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Charged Near&#8208;Infrared Persistent Luminescence in Organics by Intermolecular Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controllable hour&#8208;level near&#8208;infrared (NIR) persistent luminescence is achieved by incorporating intermolecular charge transfer and trap states into a typical host&#8208;guest organic system. The constructed host&#8208;guest system allows for charge separation under visible light and efficient light&#8208;energy storage at room temperature by trap states, thus enabling a new triple&#8208;mode NIR anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information storage technology.








Abstract
Visible light is a universal and user&#8208;friendly excitation source; however, its use to generate persistent luminescence (PersL) in materials remains a huge challenge. Herein, the concept of intermolecular charge transfer (xCT) is applied in typical host&#8211;guest molecular systems, which allows for a much lower energy requirement for charge separation, thus enabling efficient charging of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) PersL in organics by visible light (425&#8211;700&#160;nm). Importantly, NIR PersL in organics occurs via the trapping of electrons from charge&#8208;transfer aggregates (CTAs) into constructed trap states with trap depths of 0.63&#8211;1.17&#160;eV, followed by the detrapping of these electrons by thermal stimulation, resulting in a unique light&#8208;storage effect and long&#8208;lasting emission up to 4.6 h at room temperature. The xCT absorption range is modulated by changing the electron&#8208;donating ability of a series of acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;b]pyrazine&#8208;8,9&#8208;dicarbonitrile&#8208;based CTAs, and the organic PersL is tuned from 681 to 722&#160;nm. This study on xCT interaction&#8208;induced NIR PersL in organic materials provides a major step forward in understanding the underlying luminescence mechanism of organic semiconductors and these findings are expected to promote their applications in optoelectronics, energy storage, and medical diagnosis.

A flexible conformally bioadhesive MXene hydrogel electronics is facilely fabricated for high&#8208;quality epidermal electrophysiological sensing and machine learning&#8208;facilitated human&#8208;interactive sensing, showing remarkable bioadhesive performance, excellent conformality, robust UV&#8208;protection performance, reliable antibacterial capability, excellent biocompatibility, effective hemostasis properties, and outstanding photothermal conversion capability for high&#8208;performance personal healthcare monitoring, intelligent human&#8208;machine interaction sensing, smart brain&#8208;machine interface, and timely therapeutic treatment.








Abstract
Wearable epidermic electronics assembled from conductive hydrogels are attracting various research attention for their seamless integration with human body for conformally real&#8208;time health monitoring, clinical diagnostics and medical treatment, and human&#8208;interactive sensing. Nevertheless, it remains a tremendous challenge to simultaneously achieve conformally bioadhesive epidermic electronics with remarkable self&#8208;adhesiveness, reliable ultraviolet (UV) protection ability, and admirable sensing performance for high&#8208;fidelity epidermal electrophysiological signals monitoring, along with timely photothermal therapeutic performances after medical diagnostic sensing, as well as efficient antibacterial activity and reliable hemostatic effect for potential medical therapy. Herein, a conformally bioadhesive hydrogel&#8208;based epidermic sensor, featuring superior self&#8208;adhesiveness and excellent UV&#8208;protection performance, is developed by dexterously assembling conducting MXene nanosheets network with biological hydrogel polymer network for conformally stably attaching onto human skin for high&#8208;quality recording of various epidermal electrophysiological signals with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios (SNR) and low interfacial impedance for intelligent medical diagnosis and smart human&#8208;machine interface. Moreover, a smart sign language gesture recognition platform based on collected electromyogram (EMG) signals is designed for hassle&#8208;free communication with hearing&#8208;impaired people with the help of advanced machine learning algorithms. Meanwhile, the bioadhesive MXene hydrogel possesses reliable antibacterial capability, excellent biocompatibility, and effective hemostasis properties for promising bacterial&#8208;infected wound bleeding.

         <title>Cluster&#8208;Triggered Self&#8208;Luminescence, Rapid Self&#8208;Healing, and Adaptive Reprogramming Liquid Crystal Elastomers Enabled by Dynamic Imine Bond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clusteroluminescence&#8208;based liquid&#8208;crystal elastomers (CL&#8208;LCEs) with fast self&#8208;healing, reprogramming, and actuation properties are prepared using an efficient green strategy. The resulting material can be customized for advanced materials, as demonstrated by their successful application in information storage, anticounterfeiting, actuators, and smart textiles.








Abstract
The integration of advanced functions and diverse practical applications calls for multifunctional liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs); however, the structure&#8208;intrinsic luminescence and excellent mechanical properties of LCEs have not yet been explored. In this study, clusteroluminescence (CL)&#8208;based LCEs (CL&#8208;LCEs) are successfully fabricated without depending on large conjugated structures, thereby avoiding redundant organic synthesis and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. The experimental and theoretical results reveal that secondary amine (&#8211;NH&#8211;) and imine (&#8211;C&#160;=&#160;N&#8211;) groups play vital roles in determining the presence of fluorescence in CL&#8208;LCEs. Based on the above observation, the strategy universalization and a molecular library for constructing CL&#8208;LCEs are further demonstrated. Meanwhile, the dynamic bond of imine bonds endows the CL&#8208;LCE system with rapid self&#8208;healing under mild conditions (70&#160;&#176;C in 10&#160;min), excellent stretchability, and adaptive programmable characteristics. Furthermore, the self&#8208;luminescent performance enables visual detection of the self&#8208;healing process. Finally, CL&#8208;based information storage and anticounterfeiting are successfully realized and their applications in fiber actuators and fluorescent textiles are demonstrated. The distinctive luminescence and dynamic chemistry presented in this work has significant implications in elucidating the mechanism of CL and providing new strategies for the rational design of novel multifunctional LCE materials.

         <title>SHG Assisted Mixed&#8208;Phases Anatomizing in a Molecular Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an advanced molecular ferroelectric with amalgamation of two symmetric phases (phase &#945; and phase &#947;). The mixing profile, as unveiled by Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) polarimetry, is predominantly at the nanoscale, as opposed to mixed grains. The transition process between the two symmetric phases is facilitated through the application of an external electrical field.








Abstract
Anatomizing mixed&#8208;phases, referring to analyzing the mixing profiles and quantifying the phases&#8217; proportions in a material, which is of great significance in the genuine applications. Here, by using second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG)&#160;polarimetry and piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) techniques, this work elucidates the contributions and distributions of two different symmetric phases mixed in an archetype monoaxial molecular ferroelectric, diisopropylammonium chloride (DIPACl). The two competing phases are preferred in thermodynamics or kinetic process respectively, and this work evidences the switching behavior between the two competing phases facilitated by an external electrical field as opposed to a heating process. This research contributes novel insights into phase engineering in the field of molecular ferroelectrics and is poised to serve as a potent analytical tool for subsequent applications.

         <title>3D Directional Assembly of Liquid Crystal Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Femtosecond laser direct writing technology enables high&#8208;resolution, single&#8208;step programmable 3D assembly of liquid crystal (LC)&#160;molecules. This method utilizes the light field directly to assemble LC molecules in 3D space without additional alignment. In the field of molecular directional assembly, this technology is anticipated to overcome weak intermolecular interactions and facilitate the assembly of molecules into long&#8208;range ordered structures.








Abstract
The precise construction of hierarchically long&#8208;range ordered structures using molecules as fundamental building blocks can fully harness their anisotropy and potential. However, the 3D, high&#8208;precision, and single&#8208;step directional assembly of molecules is a long&#8208;pending challenge. Here, a 3D directional molecular assembly strategy via femtosecond laser direct writing (FsLDW) is proposed and the feasibility of this approach using liquid crystal (LC) molecules as an illustrative example is demonstrated. The physical mechanism for femtosecond (fs) laser&#8208;induced assembly of LC molecules is investigated, and precise 3D arbitrary assembly of LC molecules is achieved by defining the discretized laser scanning pathway. Additionally, an LC&#8208;based Fresnel zone plate array with polarization selection and colorization imaging functions is fabricated to further illustrate the potential of this method. This study not only introduces a 3D high&#8208;resolution alignment method for LC&#8208;based functional devices but also establishes a universal protocol for the precise 3D directional assembly of anisotropic molecules.

         <title>Anisotropic 2D van der Waals Magnets Hosting 1D Spin Chains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic chains of atoms (&#8220;1D magnets&#8221;) have intriguing properties that illuminate fundamental principles in many&#8208;body physics while also promising applications in magnonics and spintronics. This article describes AgCrP2S6 and its family, layered crystals that host magnetic chains, focusing on their highly anisotropic properties and the additional degrees of freedom that can arise from patterning or stacking to engineer the structure.








Abstract
The exploration of 1D magnetism, frequently portrayed as spin chains, constitutes an actively pursued research field that illuminates fundamental principles in many&#8208;body problems and applications in magnonics and spintronics. The inherent reduction in dimensionality often leads to robust spin fluctuations, impacting magnetic ordering and resulting in novel magnetic phenomena. Here, structural, magnetic, and optical properties of highly anisotropic 2D van der Waals antiferromagnets that uniquely host spin chains are explored. First&#8208;principle calculations reveal that the weakest interaction is interchain, leading to essentially 1D magnetic behavior in each layer. With the additional degree of freedom arising from its anisotropic structure, the structure is engineered by alloying, varying the 1D spin chain lengths using electron beam irradiation, or twisting for localized patterning, and spin textures are calculated, predicting robust stability of the antiferromagnetic ordering. Comparing with other spin chain magnets, these materials are anticipated to bring fresh perspectives on harvesting low&#8208;dimensional magnetism.

         <title>Interfacially Enhanced Superconductivity in Fe(Te,Se)/Bi4Te3 Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seeking to understand new routes to control exotic topological superconductors, it is reported that superconductivity can be controlled at an atomically precise, epitaxial interface with the topological insulator Bi4Te3 in comparison to Bi2Te3. This finding, at the clean, low&#8208;Se&#8208;doping regime may be critical for emerging applications in quantum information science.








Abstract
Realizing topological superconductivity by integrating high&#8208;transition&#8208;temperature (TC) superconductors with topological insulators can open new paths for quantum computing applications. Here, a new approach is reported for increasing the superconducting transition temperature (TConset)$( {T_{\mathrm{C}}^{{\mathrm{onset}}}} )$ by interfacing the unconventional superconductor Fe(Te,Se) with the topological insulator Bi&#8211;Te system in the low&#8208;Se doping regime, near where superconductivity vanishes in the bulk. The critical finding is that the TConset$T_{\mathrm{C}}^{{\mathrm{onset}}}$ of Fe(Te,Se) increases from nominally non&#8208;superconducting to as high as 12.5&#160;K when Bi2Te3 is replaced with the topological phase Bi4Te3. Interfacing Fe(Te,Se) with Bi4Te3 is also found to be critical for stabilizing superconductivity in monolayer films where TConset$T_{\mathrm{C}}^{{\mathrm{onset}}}$ can be as high as 6&#160;K. Measurements of the electronic and crystalline structure of the Bi4Te3 layer reveal that a large electron transfer, epitaxial strain, and novel chemical reduction processes are critical factors for the enhancement of superconductivity. This novel route for enhancing TC in an important epitaxial system provides new insight on the nature of interfacial superconductivity and a platform to identify and utilize new electronic phases.

         <title>Directed Surface Reconstruction of Fe Modified Co2VO4 Spinel Oxides for Water Oxidation Catalysts Experiencing Self&#8208;Terminating Surface Deterioration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Fe modified Co2VO4 spinel oxide is elaborately designed as high&#8208;performance OER electrocatalyst. With structural flexibility and directed generation of alkali&#8208;resistance surface restructuring layer, the trade&#8208;off between activity and stability of transition metal catalysts is perfectly addressed, and consequently, this catalyst can sustain an alkaline OER operation for 600 h at 500 mA cm&#8722;2 with almost no activity decay.








Abstract
Affordable highly efficient catalysts for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) play pivotal roles in green hydrogen production via water electrolysis. Regarding the non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts, considerable efforts are made to decipher the cation leaching and surface reconstruction; yet, little attention is focused on correlating them with catalytical activity and stability. Herein, in situ reconstruction of Fe&#8208;modified Co2VO4 precursor catalyst to form a highly active (Fe,V)&#8208;doped CoOOH phase for OER is reported, during which partial leaching of V accelerates the surface reconstruction and the V reserved in the reconstructed CoOOH layer in the form of alkali&#8208;resistant V2O3 serves for dynamic charge compensation and prevention of excessive loss of lattice oxygen and Co dissolution. Fe substitution facilitates Co pre&#8208;oxidation and endows the catalysts with structural flexibility by elevating O 2p band level; hence, encouraging participation of lattice oxygen in OER. The optimized Co2Fe0.25V0.75O4 electrode can afford current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm&#8722;2 at low overpotentials of 205 and 320 mV, respectively, with satisfactory stability over 600 h. By coupling with Pt/C cathode, the assembled alkaline electrolyzer can deliver 500 mA cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 1.798 V, better than that of commercial RuO2 (+) || Pt/C (&#8722;).

&lt;p&gt;Affordable highly efficient catalysts for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) play pivotal roles in green hydrogen production via water electrolysis. Regarding the non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts, considerable efforts are made to decipher the cation leaching and surface reconstruction; yet, little attention is focused on correlating them with catalytical activity and stability. Herein, in situ reconstruction of Fe-modified Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;VO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; precursor catalyst to form a highly active (Fe,V)-doped CoOOH phase for OER is reported, during which partial leaching of V accelerates the surface reconstruction and the V reserved in the reconstructed CoOOH layer in the form of alkali-resistant V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; serves for dynamic charge compensation and prevention of excessive loss of lattice oxygen and Co dissolution. Fe substitution facilitates Co pre-oxidation and endows the catalysts with structural flexibility by elevating O 2p band level; hence, encouraging participation of lattice oxygen in OER. The optimized Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;0.75&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrode can afford current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at low overpotentials of 205 and 320 mV, respectively, with satisfactory stability over 600 h. By coupling with Pt/C cathode, the assembled alkaline electrolyzer can deliver 500 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a low cell voltage of 1.798 V, better than that of commercial RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (+) || Pt/C (&#8722;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrauniform Plating of Lithium on 10&#8208;nm&#8208;Scale Ordered Carbon Grids for Long Lifespan Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring the structure of Li plating substrate at a scale down to 10&#160;nm is achieved by decorating graphene with ordered carbon grids. Unlike the situation on flat reduced graphene oxide, where isolated Li nuclei are observed, the nucleation of Li is intrinsically inhibited on such a textile substrate with characteristic size below the thermodynamic critical nucleation size of Li. The continuous, dense, and planar plating on such a carbon thus significantly improves the cycling stability of Li metal anode.








Abstract
Tailorable lithium (Li) nucleation and uniform early&#8208;stage plating is essential for long&#8208;lifespan Li metal batteries. Among factors influencing the early plating of Li anode, the substrate is critical, but a fine control of the substrate structure on a scale of &#8776;10&#160;nm has been rarely achieved. Herein, a carbon consisting of ordered grids is prepared, as a model to investigate the effect of substrate structure on the Li nucleation. In contrast to the individual spherical Li nuclei formed on the flat graphene, an ultrauniform and nuclei&#8208;free Li plating is obtained on the ordered carbon with a grid size smaller than the thermodynamical critical radius of Li nucleation (&#8776;26&#160;nm). Simultaneously, an inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase is promoted by the cross&#8208;sectional carbon layers of such ordered grids which are exposed to the electrolyte. Consequently, the carbon grids with a grid size of &#8776;10&#160;nm show a favorable cycling stability for more than 1100 cycles measured at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a half cell. With LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 as cathode, the assembled full cell with a cathode capacity of 3 mAh cm&#8722;2 and a negative/positive ratio of 1.67 demonstrates a stable cycling for over 130 cycles with a capacity retention of 88%.

         <title>Thermal Runaway Mechanism in Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Full Cells of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: The Role of Multidirectional Crosstalk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work addresses the fundamental causes of thermal runaway in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, particularly in LiNi0.88Co0.1Al0.02O2/graphite full cells, a significant challenge for the electric vehicle industry. By employing synchrotron&#8208;based high&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray diffraction, mass spectrometry, and calorimetry, the intermediates that establish a self&#8208;amplifying positive feedback loop are comprehensively identified through multidirectional crosstalk.








Abstract
Crosstalk, the exchange of chemical species between battery electrodes, significantly accelerates thermal runaway (TR) of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. To date, the understanding of their main mechanisms has centered on single&#8208;directional crosstalk of oxygen (O2) gas from the cathode to the anode, underestimating the exothermic reactions during TR. However, the role of multidirectional crosstalk in steering additional exothermic reactions is yet to be elucidated due to the difficulties of correlative in situ analyses of full cells. Herein, the way in which such crosstalk triggers self&#8208;amplifying feedback is elucidated that dramatically exacerbates TR within enclosed full cells, by employing synchrotron&#8208;based high&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray diffraction, mass spectrometry, and calorimetry. These findings reveal that ethylene (C2H4) gas generated at the anode promotes O2 evolution at the cathode. This O2 then returns to the anode, further promoting additional C2H4 formation and creating a self&#8208;amplifying loop, thereby intensifying TR. Furthermore, CO2, traditionally viewed as an extinguishing gas, engages in the crosstalk by interacting with lithium at the anode to form Li2CO3, thereby accelerating TR beyond prior expectations. These insights have led to develop an anode coating that impedes the formation of C2H4 and O2, to effectively mitigate TR.

         <title>Singular Hall Response from a Correlated Ferromagnetic Flat Nodal&#8208;Line Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A singular Hall response arising from a unique band structure of flat topological nodal lines in combination with electron correlation in a layered room&#8208;temperature ferromagnet, Fe3GaTe2 is reported. Exceptionally high anomalous Hall conductivity violating the conventional scaling, resistivity upturn at low temperatures, and a large Sommerfeld coefficient of Fe3GaTe2 imply heavy fermion features in the ferromagnetic topological material.








Abstract
Topological quantum phases are largely understood in weakly correlated systems, which have identified various quantum phenomena, such as the spin Hall effect, protected transport of helical fermions, and topological superconductivity. Robust ferromagnetic order in correlated topological materials particularly attracts attention, as it can provide a versatile platform for novel quantum devices. Here, a singular Hall response arising from a unique band structure of flat topological nodal lines in combination with electron correlation in a van der Waals ferromagnetic semimetal, Fe3GaTe2, with a high Curie temperature of Tc = 347 K is reported. High anomalous Hall conductivity violating the conventional scaling, resistivity upturn at low temperature, and a large Sommerfeld coefficient are observed in Fe3GaTe2, which implies heavy fermion features in this ferromagnetic topological material. The scanning tunneling microscopy, circular dichroism in angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations support the original electronic features of the material. Thus, low&#8208;dimensional Fe3GaTe2 with electronic correlation, topology, and room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic order appears to be a promising candidate for robust quantum devices.

         <title>Tailoring the Electrochemical Responses of MOF&#8208;74 Via Dual&#8208;Defect Engineering for Superior Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;defects engineering of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is performed to manipulate the electrochemical response. Using&#160;salicylic acid and cobalt doping for defect introduction, the modified MOF exhibits 4.4 times the discharging capacity of the original, resulting in a superior cathode for Ni&#8211;Zn batteries. The comprehensive investigations provide critical insights into the electrochemical reconfiguration mechanism.








Abstract
Rationally designed defects in a crystal can confer unique properties. This study showcases a novel dual&#8208;defects engineering strategy to tailor the electrochemical response of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials used for electrochemical energy storage. Salicylic acid (SA) is identified as an effective modulator to control MOF&#8208;74 growth and induce structural defects, and cobalt cation doping is adopted for introducing a second type of defect. The resulting dual&#8208;defects engineered bimetallic MOF exhibits a discharging capacity of 218.6 mAh g&#8722;1, 4.4 times that of the pristine MOF&#8208;74, and significantly improved cycling stability. Moreover, the engineered MOF&#8208;74(Ni0.675Co0.325)&#8208;8//Zn aqueous battery shows top energy/power density performances for Ni&#8211;Zn batteries (266.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, 17.22&#160;kW kg&#8722;1). Comprehensive investigations reveal that engineered defects modify the local coordination environment and promote the in situ electrochemical reconfiguration during operation to significantly boost the electrochemical activity. This work suggests that rational tailoring of the defects within the MOF crystal is an effective strategy to manipulate the coordination environment of the metal centers and the corresponding electrochemical reconfiguration for electrochemical applications.

The resulting dual-defects engineered bimetallic MOF exhibits a discharging capacity of 218.6 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 4.4 times that of the pristine MOF-74, and significantly improved cycling stability. Moreover, the engineered MOF-74(Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.675&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.325&lt;/sub&gt;)-8//Zn aqueous battery shows top energy/power density performances for Ni&#8211;Zn batteries (266.5&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 17.22&#160;kW kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Comprehensive investigations reveal that engineered defects modify the local coordination environment and promote the in situ electrochemical reconfiguration during operation to significantly boost the electrochemical activity. This work suggests that rational tailoring of the defects within the MOF crystal is an effective strategy to manipulate the coordination environment of the metal centers and the corresponding electrochemical reconfiguration for electrochemical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Naturally Inspired Extrusion&#8208;Based Microfluidic Approach for Manufacturing Tailorable Magnetic Soft Continuum Microrobotic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, microfluidics is leveraged to precisely control reaction&#8208;diffusion (RD) processes for generating multifunctional and compartmentalized alginate&#8208;based microfibers. This nature&#8208;inspired RD process allows for producing sophisticated fibers acting as magnetic soft continuum robots. The method allows for tailoring the stiffness and magnetic responsiveness of the microfibers via customizing the geometry, degree of cross&#8208;linking, and spatial localization of magnetic nanoparticles.








Abstract
Soft materials play a crucial role in small&#8208;scale robotic applications by closely mimicking the complex motion and morphing behavior of organisms. However, conventional fabrication methods face challenges in creating highly integrated small&#8208;scale soft devices. In this study, microfluidics is leveraged to precisely control reaction&#8208;diffusion (RD) processes to generate multifunctional and compartmentalized calcium&#8208;cross&#8208;linkable alginate&#8208;based microfibers. Under RD conditions, sophisticated alginate&#8208;based fibers are produced for magnetic soft continuum robotics applications with customizable features, such as geometry (compact or hollow), degree of cross&#8208;linking, and the precise localization of magnetic nanoparticles (inside the core, surrounding the fiber, or on one side). This fine control allows for tuning the stiffness and magnetic responsiveness of the microfibers. Additionally, chemically cleavable regions within the fibers enable disassembly into smaller robotic units or roll&#8208;up structures under a rotating magnetic field. These findings demonstrate the versatility of microfluidics in processing highly integrated small&#8208;scale devices.

         <title>Unzippable Siamese Nanoparticles for Programmed Two&#8208;Stage Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detachable Siamese nanoparticles (SIANPs) are programmed to separate in responding to abundant extracellular adenosine triphosphate in the tumor microenvironment, conferring two&#8208;pronged delivery of epigenetic drugs and immune modulators to tumor cells and myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), respectively. SIANP treatment prevents MDSC induction driven by epigenetic drugs, enabling epigenetic therapy in solid tumors such as breast and colorectal cancers.








Abstract
Epigenetic drugs (epi&#8208;drugs) can destruct cancer cells and initiate both innate and adaptive immunity, yet they have achieved very limited success in solid tumors so far, partly attributing to their concurrent induction of the myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cell (MDSC) population. Here, dissociable Siamese nanoparticles (SIANPs) are developed for tumor cell&#8208;targeted delivery of epi&#8208;drug CM&#8208;272 and MDSC&#8208;targeted delivery of small molecule inhibitor Ibrutinib. The SIANPs are assembled via interparticle DNA annealing and detached via tumor microenvironment&#8208;triggered strand separation. Such binary regulation induces endogenous retrovirus expression and immunogenic cell death in tumor cells while restraining the immunosuppressive effects of MDSCs, and synergistically promotes dendritic cell maturation and CD8+ T cell activation for tumor inhibition. Significantly, immune microenvironment remodeling via SIANPs further overcomes tumor resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. This study represents a two&#8208;pronged approach for orchestrating immune responses, and paves a new way for employing epi&#8208;drugs in cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Promotion of Probabilistic Bit Generation in Mott Devices by Embedded Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Randomness of p&#8208;bit streams generated via the pump&#8211;probe pulse inputs can be increased by the deliberate incorporation of metal nanoparticles (NPs), which influence the transient dynamics of switchable domains in VO2 Mott switches. The study presents a novel strategy that exploits nanoscale phase control to maximize the generation of nondeterministic information sources for energy&#8208;efficient probabilistic computing hardware.








Abstract
Considerable attention has been drawn to the use of volatile two&#8208;terminal devices relying on the Mott transition for the stochastic generation of probabilistic bits (p&#8208;bits) in emerging probabilistic computing. To improve randomness and endurance of bit streams provided by these devices, delicate control of the transient evolution of switchable domains is required to enhance stochastic p&#8208;bit generation. Herein, it is demonstrated that the randomness of p&#8208;bit streams generated via the consecutive pulse inputs of pump&#8211;probe protocols can be increased by the deliberate incorporation of metal nanoparticles (NPs), which influence the transient dynamics of the nanoscale metallic phase in VO2 Mott switches. Among the vertically stacked Pt&#8208;NP&#8208;containing VO2 threshold switches, those with higher Pt NP density show a considerably wider range of p&#8208;bit operation (e.g., up to &#8776;300% increase in &#916;Vprobe upon going from (Pt NP/VO2)0 to (Pt NP/VO2)11) and can therefore be operated under the conditions of high speed (400 kbit s&#8722;1), low power consumption (14 nJ per bit), and high stability (&gt;105&#160;200 bits) for p&#8208;bit generation. Thus, the study presents a novel strategy that exploits nanoscale phase control to maximize the generation of nondeterministic information sources for energy&#8208;efficient probabilistic computing hardware.

         <title>3D Printed Room Temperature Phosphorescence Materials Enabled by Edible Natural Konjac Glucomannan</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ingenious design strategy is developed to construct sophisticated 3D room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) architectures with high fidelity and mechanical strength via direct ink writing&#8208;based 3D printing and freeze&#8208;drying. Konjac glucomannan with decent rheological properties can anchor arylboronic acid chromophores with various &#960; conjugations via B&#9472;O covalent bonds in pure water to afford 3D&#8208;printable inks.








Abstract
Shaping room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials into 3D bodies is important for stereoscopic optoelectronic displays but remains challenging due to their poor processability and mechanical properties. Here, konjac glucomannan (KGM) is employed to anchor arylboronic acids with various &#960; conjugations via a facile B&#9472;O covalent reaction to afford printable inks, using which full&#8208;color high&#8208;fidelity 3D RTP objects with high mechanical strength can be obtained via direct ink writing&#8208;based 3D printing and freeze&#8208;drying. The doubly rigid structure supplied by the synergy of hydrogen bonding and B&#9472;O covalent bonding can protect the triplet excitons; thus, the prepared 3D RTP object shows a striking lifetime of 2.14 s. The printed counterparts are successfully used for 3D anti&#8208;counterfeiting and can be recycled and reprinted nondestructively by dissolving in water. This success expands the scope of printable 3D luminescent materials, providing an eco&#8208;friendly platform for the additive manufacturing of sophisticated 3D RTP architectures.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible all&#8208;in&#8208;one supercapacitor is cultivated through a continuous biosynthesis, harnessing uninterrupted 3D network during the growth of bacterial cellulose. The design establishes a seamless electrode&#8211;separator&#8211;electrode structure and facilitates stress transfer within and between layers. Thereby, the supercapacitor demonstrates remarkable shear and bending resistance, presenting a promising approach for the integrated development of high&#8208;performance flexible power sources.








Abstract
Flexible supercapacitors can potentially power next&#8208;generation flexible electronics. However, the mechanical and electrochemical stability of flexible supercapacitors under different flexible conditions is limited by the weak bonding between adjacent layers, posing a significant hindrance to their practical applicability. Herein, based on the uninterrupted 3D network during the growth of bacterial cellulose (BC), a flexible all&#8208;in&#8208;one supercapacitor is cultivated through a continuous biosynthesis process. This strategy ensures the continuity of the 3D network of BC throughout the material, thereby forming a continuous electrode&#8211;separator&#8211;electrode structure. Benefitting from this bioinspired structure, the all&#8208;in&#8208;one supercapacitor not only achieves a high areal capacitance (3.79 F cm&#8722;2) of electrodes but also demonstrates the integration of high tensile strength (2.15&#160;MPa), high shear strength (more than 54.6&#160;kPa), and high bending resistance, indicating a novel pathway toward high&#8208;performance flexible power sources.

         <title>Enhanced Infrared Vision by Nonlinear Up&#8208;Conversion in Nonlocal Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imaging of short&#8208;wave infrared (IR) light has essential applications in surveillance and autonomous navigation. However, it typically relies on complex cameras that incorporate narrow&#8208;band semiconductors. This research demonstrates IR imaging using nonlinear up&#8208;conversion to the visible with an ultra&#8208;compact, high&#8208;quality&#8208;factor lithium niobate metasurface. Despite the strong metasurface nonlocality, the method produces high&#8208;quality images with efficient conversion and high resolution.








Abstract
The ability to detect and image short&#8208;wave infrared light has important applications in surveillance, autonomous navigation, and biological imaging. However, the current infrared imaging technologies often pose challenges due to large footprint, large thermal noise and inability to augment infrared and visible imaging. Here, infrared imaging is demonstrated by nonlinear up&#8208;conversion to the visible in an ultra&#8208;compact, high&#8208;quality&#8208;factor lithium niobate resonant metasurface. Images with high conversion efficiency and resolution quality are obtained despite the strong nonlocality of the metasurface. The possibility of edge&#8208;detection image processing augmented with direct up&#8208;conversion imaging for advanced night vision applications is further&#160;shown.

         <title>Superconductivity in Freestanding Infinite&#8208;Layer Nickelate Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work reports the synthesis of the superconducting freestanding La0.8Sr0.2NiO2 membranes (Tczero=10.6K${T}_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{zero}}\ =\ 10.6\mathrm{K}$), emphasizing the crucial roles of the interface engineering in the precursor phase film growth and the quick transfer process in achieving superconductivity. This work offers a new versatile platform for investigating superconductivity in nickelates, such as the pairing symmetry via constructing Josephson tunneling junctions and higher Tc values via high&#8208;pressure experiments.








Abstract
The observation of superconductivity in infinite&#8208;layer nickelates has attracted significant attention due to its potential as a new platform for exploring high&#8208;Tc superconductivity. However, thus far, superconductivity has only been observed in epitaxial thin films, which limits the manipulation capabilities and modulation methods compared to two&#8208;dimensional exfoliated materials. Given the exceptionally giant strain tunability and stacking capability of freestanding membranes, separating superconducting nickelates from the as&#8208;grown substrate is a novel way to engineer the superconductivity and uncover the underlying physics. Herein, this work reports the synthesis of the superconducting freestanding La0.8Sr0.2NiO2 membranes (Tczero=10.6K${T}_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{zero}}\ =\ 10.6\ \mathrm{K}$), emphasizing the crucial roles of the interface engineering in the precursor phase film growth and the quick transfer process in achieving superconductivity.

         <title>Heterostructures via a Solution&#8208;Based Anion Exchange in Microcrystalline 2D Layered Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work outlines solution&#8208;based processes to obtain in&#8208;plane heterojunctions in two&#8208;dimensional layered perovskites with different halide composition. The obtained microcrystalline heterostructures have a core&#8208;shell architecture with distinctly different optical properties in the different crystal phases. This work elucidates the underlying reaction mechanisms that depend strongly on the exchange route, leading either to vacancy&#8208;assisted diffusion, or dissolution&#8208;recrystallization processes.








Abstract
Layered perovskites consist of stacks of inorganic semiconducting metal&#8208;halide octahedra lattices sandwiched between organic layers with typically dielectric behavior. The in&#8208;plane confinement of electrical carriers in such two&#8208;dimensional metal halide perovskites drives a large range of appealing electronic properties, such as strong exciton binding, anisotropic charge diffusion, and polarization&#8208;directionality. Heterostructures provide additional control on carrier diffusion and localization, and in&#8208;plane heterojunctions are interesting because of the associated high charge mobility. Here, this work demonstrates a versatile solution&#8208;based approach to fabricate in&#8208;plane heterostructures with different halide composition in two&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;halide perovskite microcrystals. This leads to spatially separated halide phases with different band gap and light emission. Interestingly, the composition of the exchanged phase and the morphology of the phase boundary depends on the exchange route, which can be related to the preferred localization of the halides at the equatorial or axial octahedra positions that either leads to dissolution and recrystallization of the octahedra lattice (for bromide to iodide), or allows for ion diffusion within the lattice (for iodide to bromide). These detailed insights on the ion exchange processes in layered perovskites will stimulate the development of heterostructures that can be tailored for different applications such as photocatalysis, energy storage, and light emission.

         <title>Immunoregulatory Engineering of Semiconducting Charge&#8208;Reversal Nanoantioxidant for Ameliorating Cancer Radioimmunotheranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile X&#8208;ray theranostic nano&#8208;antioxidant (XTN) is developed to prevent normal tissues from oxidative damage and induce systematic and robust anticancer immunity. In the bilateral 4T1 tumor model, XTN plus radiotherapy (RT) remarkably boosts the abscopal effect and induce durable immunological memory against tumor growth.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) is a crucial clinical modality for cancer. However, nonselectivity, toxicity to normal tissues, and radio&#8208;resistance severely limit RT applications. This study develops a versatile X&#8208;ray theranostic nano&#8208;antioxidant (XTN) to prevent normal tissues from oxidative damage and induce systematic and robust anticancer immunity. XTN owns NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic (PA) imaging properties for precise discrimination of the tumor margin through, thereby improving the accuracy of RT. Additionally, XTN is a nano&#8208;antioxidant to enhance the cell viability of normal cells after irradiation. Most importantly, XTN scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the TME to preserve the stimulatory activity of released high mobility group protein B1 to dendritic cells (DCs) and recover T cells&#8217; immune function. Meanwhile, XTN achieves charge&#8208;reversal specifically releasing an immunomodulator (demethylcantharidin, DMC) in the acidic TME. Moreover, the specifically released DMC inhibits protein phosphatase&#8208;2A activity and reduces regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation. In the bilateral 4T1 tumor model, XTN&#8208;mediated radioimmunotherapy remarkably boosts a systemic antitumor immune response and induces durable immunological memory against tumor growth.

         <title>Linearly Polarized Broadband Emission and Multiwavelength Lasing in Solution&#8208;Processed Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, by adjusting the structural polarization and energy transfer in quantum dots, linearly polarized broadband emission and multiwavelength lasers in the visible and near&#8208;infrared wavelength ranges are demonstrated by incorporating Er3+&#8208;doped Cs2Ag0.4Na0.6In0.98Bi0.02Cl6 double perovskite quantum dots into solution&#8208;processable silica structure. This work offers a promising light source for future photonic integrated circuits targeted at high&#8208;capacity optical applications.








Abstract
A miniature laser with linear polarization is a long sought&#8208;after component of photonic integrated circuits. In particular, for multiwavelength polarization lasers, it supports simultaneous access to multiple, widely varying laser wavelengths in a small spatial region, which is of great significance for advancing applications such as optical computing, optical storage, and optical sensing. However, there is a trade&#8208;off between the size of small&#8208;scale lasers and laser performance, and multiwavelength co&#8208;gain of laser media and multicavity micromachining in the process of laser miniaturization remain as significant challenges. Herein, room&#8208;temperature linearly polarized multiwavelength lasers in the visible and near&#8208;infrared wavelength ranges are demonstrated, by fabricating random cavities scattered with silica in an Er&#8208;doped Cs2Ag0.4Na0.6In0.98Bi0.02Cl6 double&#8208;perovskite quantum dots gain membrane. By regulating the local symmetry and enabling effective energy transfer in nanocrystals, multiwavelength lasers with ultralow thresholds are achieved at room temperature. The maximum degree of polarization reaches 0.89. With their advantages in terms of miniaturization, ultralow power consumption, and adaptability for integration, these lasers offer a prospective light source for future photonic integrated circuits aimed at high&#8208;capacity optical applications.

         <title>Lead Isolation and Capture in Perovskite Photovoltaics toward Eco&#8208;Friendly Commercialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes the concept of an all&#8208;round detoxification strategy of&#8201; &#8220;lead isolation and capture&#8221; on perovskite solar cells (PSCs) for the first time, and the adequate in vivo experiments in mice reveal that this material has significant inhibitory effect on the toxicity of perovskite. This strategy can further enhance the device performance, achieving an impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.19%.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are developed rapidly in efficiency and stability in recent years, which can compete with silicon solar cells. However, an important obstacle to the commercialization of PSCs is the toxicity of lead ions (Pb2+) from water&#8208;soluble perovskites. The entry of free Pb2+ into organisms can cause severe harm to humans, such as blood lead poisoning, organ failure, etc. Therefore, this work reports a &#8220;lead isolation&#8208;capture&#8221; dual detoxification strategy with calcium disodium edetate (EDTA Na&#8208;Ca), which can inhibit lead leakage from PSCs under extreme conditions. More importantly, leaked lead exists in a nontoxic aggregation state chelated by EDTA. For the first time, in vivo experiments are conducted in mice to systematically prove that this material has a significant inhibitory effect on the toxicity of perovskites. In addition, this strategy can further enhance device performance, enabling the optimized devices to achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.19%. This innovative strategy is a major breakthrough in the research on the prevention of lead toxicity in PSCs.

         <title>Room Temperature Reduction of Nitrogen Oxide on Iron Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mimicking a natural enzyme, a sustainable, reducible iron MOF is able to selectively decompose NO
and NO2 into N2 and O2 in ambient conditions, without any reducing agent. This contributes to solve a long&#8208;standing problem in air purification and emissions control, opens new perspectives in heterogeneous catalysis and bridges the gap between homogeneous, enzymatic and heterogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
Nitrogen oxides represent one of the main threats for the environment. Despite decades of intensive research efforts, a sustainable solution for NOx removal under environmental conditions is still undefined. Using theoretical modelling, material design, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art investigation methods and mimicking enzymes, it is found that selected porous hybrid iron(II/III) based MOF material are able to decompose NOx, at room temperature, in the presence of water and oxygen, into N2 and O2 and without reducing agents. This paves the way to the development of new highly sustainable heterogeneous catalysts to improve air quality.

         <title>Structurally Tunable Donor&#8722;Bridge&#8722;Fluorophore Architecture Enables Highly Efficient and Concentration&#8208;Independent Narrowband Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatial confinement strategy, denoted as donor&#8722;bridge&#8722;fluorophore architecture, has been proposed to construct highly efficient and concentration&#8208;independent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on B&#8211;N&#8208;containing multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials. The final established compound BN&#8208;PCz&#8208;TPA&#8208;based devices exhibit maximum external quantum efficiency of 36.3% at 10&#160;wt% doping concentrations and remain 32.5% at 20&#160;wt% doping concentration with almost unchanged spectray.








Abstract
Luminescent materials with narrowband emission have extraordinary significance for developing ultrahigh&#8208;definition display. B&#8211;N&#8208;containing multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials are strong contenders. However, their device performances pervasively encounter detrimental aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect that is highly vulnerable to doping concentration, complicating device fabrication. Therefore, constructing highly efficient and concentration&#8208;independent MR&#8208;TADF emitters is of pragmatic importance for improving device controllability and reproducibility, simplifying manufacturing procedures, and conserving production costs. Here, by systematic arrangement of donor triphenylamine and fluorophore BNCz on distinct bridges, a spatial confinement strategy has been developed with a donor&#8722;bridge&#8722;fluorophore architecture. Structurally fine modulation and progressive evolution to construct molecular entities with congested steric hindrance effect that can suppress intermolecular interactions without substantially affecting the luminescence tone of fluorophore BNCz, resulting in highly efficient and concentration&#8208;independent narrowband emitters; through isomer engineering, two isomers BN&#8208;PCz&#8208;TPA and TPA&#8208;PCz&#8208;BN with different crystal stacking patterns are synthesized by altering the connection mode between triphenylamine and BNCz. As a result, BN&#8208;PCz&#8208;TPA&#8208;based device showcases maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.3% with narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 27 nm at 10 wt% doping concentration. Even at 20 wt% doping concentration, the maximum EQE remains at 32.5% and the emission spectrum is almost unchanged.

         <title>Unveiling the Role of Cationic Pyridine Sites in Covalent Triazine Framework for Boosting Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The abundant cationic pyridine sites of cationic pyridine&#8208;rich covalent triazine framework (CCTF&#8208;TPMB)&#160;can not only significantly suppress the leakage and shuttle of I2 species (I&#8722;, I3&#8722;, and I5&#8722;) and the occurrence of side reactions on the Zn anode, but also accelerate the conversion reaction of I2 species, enabling good reversibility, high electrochemical activity, and fast reaction kinetics for I2 loaded CCTF&#8208;TPMB cathode based Zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (ZIBs) are gaining attention as energy storage devices due to their high energy density, low&#8208;cost, and inherent safety. However, the poor cycling performance of these batteries always arises from the severe leakage and shuttle effect of polyiodides (I3&#8211; and I5&#8211;). Herein, a novel cationic pyridine&#8208;rich covalent triazine framework (CCTF&#8208;TPMB) is developed to capture and confine iodine (I2) species via strong electrostatic interaction, making it an attractive host for I2 in ZIBs. The as&#8208;fabricated ZIBs with I2 loaded CCTF&#8208;TPMB (I2@CCTF&#8208;TPMB) cathode achieve a large specific capacity of 243&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 and an exceptionally stable cyclic performance, retaining 93.9% of its capacity over 30&#160;000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. The excellent electrochemical performance of the ZIBs can be attributed to the pyridine&#8208;rich cationic sites of CCTF&#8208;TPMB, which effectively suppress the leakage and shuttle of polyiodides, while also accelerating the conversion reaction of I2 species. Combined in situ Raman and UV&#8211;vis analysis, along with theoretical calculations, clearly reveal the critical role played by pyridine&#8208;rich cationic sites in boosting the ZIBs performances. This work opens up a promising pathway for designing advanced I2 cathode materials toward next&#8208;generation ZIBs and beyond.

         <title>Single Dispersion of Fe(H2O)2&#8208;Based Polyoxometalate on Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Biomimetic CH4 Photooxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined Fe single&#8208;site catalyst is constructed by uniformly dispersing nanosized molecular cluster on the polymeric carbon nitride support. The well&#8208;defined (WO)4&#8208;Fea(H2O)2 site can not only act as active site for dramatically boosting methane&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion, but also serves as the model with precise structure for the investigating enzyme&#8208;like catalytic mechanism.








Abstract
Direct methane conversion to value&#8208;added oxygenates under mild conditions with in&#8208;depth mechanism investigation has attracted wide interest. Inspired by methane monooxygenase, the K9Na2Fe(H2O)2{[&#947;&#8208;SiW9O34Fe(H2O)]}2&#183;25H2O polyoxometalate (Fe&#8208;POM) with well&#8208;defined Fe(H2O)2 sites is synthesized to clarify the key role of Fe species and their microenvironment toward CH4 photooxidation. The Fe&#8208;POM can efficiently drive the conversion of CH4 to HCOOH with a yield of 1570.0&#160;&#181;mol gPOM&#8722;1 and 95.8% selectivity at ambient conditions, much superior to that of [Fe(H2O)SiW11O39]5&#8722; with Fe(H2O) active site, [Fe2SiW10O38(OH)]214&#8722; and [P8W48O184Fe16(OH)28(H2O)4]20&#8722; with multinuclear Fe&#8722;OH&#8722;Fe active sites. Single&#8208;dispersion of Fe&#8208;POM on polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) is facilely achieved to provide single&#8208;cluster functionalized PCN with well&#8208;defined Fe(H2O)2 site, the HCOOH yield can be improved to 5981.3&#160;&#181;mol gPOM&#8722;1. Systemic investigations demonstrate that the (WO)4&#8722;Fe(H2O)2 can supply Fe&#9552;O active center for C&#8722;H activation via forming (WO)4&#8722;Fea&#8722;Ot&#183;&#183;&#183;CH4 intermediate, similar to that for CH4 oxidation in the monooxygenase. This work highlights a promising and facile strategy for single dispersion of &#8776;1&#8211;2 &#197; metal center with precise coordination microenvironment by uniformly anchoring nanoscale molecular clusters, which provides a well&#8208;defined model for in&#8208;depth mechanism research.

         <title>Fast Photoactuation and Environmental Response of Humidity&#8208;Sensitive pDAP&#8208;Silicon Nanocantilevers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocantilevers are made using FIB milling on plasma pDAP&#8208;coated Si nanomembranes. Photoactuation originates in reversible sorption of atmospheric water vapor by the responsive pDAP layer. Rapid photothermal heating leads to the pDAP contraction and cantilever deflection within ms timescales. The straightening is spontaneous, albeit fast, due to the efficient heat dissipation through Si, leading to water absorption and pDAP expansion.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;responsive nanomembranes are a new class of advanced materials that can be harnessed in complex architectures for micro and nano&#8208;manipulators, artificial muscles, energy harvesting, soft robotics, and sensors. The design and fabrication of responsive membranes must meet such challenges as trade&#8208;offs between responsiveness and mechanical durability, volumetric low&#8208;cost production ensuring low environmental impact, and compatibility with standard technologies or biological systems This work demonstrates the fabrication of multi&#8208;responsive, mechanically robust poly(1,3&#8208;diaminopropane) (pDAP) nanomembranes and their application in fast photoactuators. The pDAP films are developed using a plasma&#8208;assisted polymerization technique that offers large&#8208;scale production and versatility of potential industrial relevance. The pDAP layers exhibit high elasticity with the Young's modulus of &#8776;7 GPa and remarkable mechanical durability across 20&#8211;80&#160;&#176;C temperatures. Notably, pDAP membranes reveal immediate and reversible contraction triggered by light, rising temperature, or reducing relative humidity underpinned by a reversible water sorption mechanism. These features enable the fabrication of photoactuators composed of pDAP&#8208;coated Si nanocantilevers, demonstrating ms timescale response to light, tens of &#181;m deflections, and robust performance up to kHz frequencies. These results advance fundamental research on multi&#8208;responsive nanomembranes and hold the potential to boost versatile applications in light&#8208;to&#8208;motion conversion and sensing toward the industrial level.

         <title>Direct Electroplating Ruthenium Precursor on the Surface Oxidized Nickel Foam for Efficient and Stable Bifunctional Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>

Nanoparticle based catalysts of Ru&#8211;Ni(OH)2 with a tuned valence state overcome the thermodynamic instability of Ru active sites. The synergistic modulation of tailored valence state, coordination environment, and electronic property results in fast kinetics for both the OER and HER.








Abstract
Water electrolysis to produce hydrogen (H2) using renewable energy is one of the most promising candidates for realizing carbon neutrality, but its reaction kinetics is hindered by sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Ruthenium (Ru) in its high&#8208;valence state (oxide) provides one of the most active OER sites and is less costly, but thermodynamically unstable. The strong interaction between Ru nanoparticles (NPs) and nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) is leveraged to directly form Ru&#8211;Ni(OH)2 on the surface of a porous nickel foam (NF) electrode via spontaneous galvanic replacement reaction. The formation of Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Ni bonds at the interface of the Ru NPs and Ni(OH)2 (Ru&#8211;Ni(OH)2) on the surface oxidized NF significantly enhance stability of the Ru&#8211;Ni(OH)2/NF electrode. In addition to OER, the catalyst is active enough for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As a result, it is able to deliver overpotentials of 228 and 15&#160;mV to reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for OER and HER, respectively. An industry&#8208;scale evaluation using Ru&#8211;Ni(OH)2/NF as both OER and HER electrodes demonstrates a high current density of 1500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (OER: 410&#160;mV; HER: 240&#160;mV), surpassing commercial RuO2 (OER: 600&#160;mV) and Pt/C based performance (HER: 265&#160;mV).

&lt;p&gt;Nanoparticle based catalysts of Ru&#8211;Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a tuned valence state overcome the thermodynamic instability of Ru active sites. The synergistic modulation of tailored valence state, coordination environment, and electronic property results in fast kinetics for both the OER and HER.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water electrolysis to produce hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) using renewable energy is one of the most promising candidates for realizing carbon neutrality, but its reaction kinetics is hindered by sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Ruthenium (Ru) in its high-valence state (oxide) provides one of the most active OER sites and is less costly, but thermodynamically unstable. The strong interaction between Ru nanoparticles (NPs) and nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is leveraged to directly form Ru&#8211;Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on the surface of a porous nickel foam (NF) electrode via spontaneous galvanic replacement reaction. The formation of Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Ni bonds at the interface of the Ru NPs and Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Ru&#8211;Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) on the surface oxidized NF significantly enhance stability of the Ru&#8211;Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NF electrode. In addition to OER, the catalyst is active enough for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As a result, it is able to deliver overpotentials of 228 and 15&#160;mV to reach 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for OER and HER, respectively. An industry-scale evaluation using Ru&#8211;Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NF as both OER and HER electrodes demonstrates a high current density of 1500&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (OER: 410&#160;mV; HER: 240&#160;mV), surpassing commercial RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (OER: 600&#160;mV) and Pt/C based performance (HER: 265&#160;mV).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Rotating Cathode with Periodical Changes in Electrolyte Layer Thickness for High&#8208;Rate Li&#8210;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is generally believed that the rate performance of Li&#8210;O2 batteries (LOBs) is limited by the slow mass transfer. To this end, a new type of LOB with a rotating cathode has been designed to decouple the maximum transfer rate of Li+ and O2, and consequently, the rate performance of LOBs has been significantly improved.








Abstract
Li&#8211;O2 batteries (LOBs) possess the highest theoretical gravimetric energy density among all types of secondary batteries, but they are still far from practical applications. The poor rate performance resulting from the slow mass transfer is one of the primary obstacles in LOBs. To solve this issue, a rotating cathode with periodic changes in the electrolyte layer thickness is designed, decoupling the maximum transfer rate of Li+ and O2. During rotation, the thinner electrolyte layer on the cathode facilitates the O2 transfer, and the thicker electrolyte layer enhances the Li+ transfer. As a result, the rotating cathode enables the LOBs to undergo 58 cycles at 2.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and discharge stably even at a high current density of 7.5 mA cm&#8722;2. Besides, it also makes the batteries exhibit a large discharge capacity of 6.8 mAh cm&#8722;2, and the capacity decay is much slower with increasing current density. Notably, this rotating electrode holds great promise for utilization in other electrochemical cells involving gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid triple&#8208;phase interfaces, suggesting a viable approach to enhance the mass transfer in such systems.

         <title>Handedness&#8208;Inverted and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Circularly Polarized Luminescent Nano/Micromaterials Through Pathway&#8208;Dependent Chiral Supramolecular Polymorphism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Handedness&#8208;inverted circularly polarized luminescent nano/micromaterials from the same monomers in the same concentrations and the same solvent have been prepared through a pathway&#8208;dependent chiral supramolecular polymorphism approach for the first time, which display multistimuli responsive and ON&#8211;OFF switching abilities.








Abstract
The precise manipulation of supramolecular polymorphs has been widely applied to control the morphologies and functions of self&#8208;assemblies, but is rarely utilized for the fabrication of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials with tailored properties. Here, this work reports that an amphiphilic naphthalene&#8208;histidine compound (NIHis) readily self&#8208;assembled into distinct chiral nanostructures through pathway&#8208;dependent supramolecular polymorphism, which shows opposite and multistimuli responsive CPL signals. Specifically, NIHis display assembly&#8208;induced CPL from the polymorphic keto tautomer, which become predominant during enol&#8208;keto tautomerization shifting controlled by a bulk solvent effect. Interestingly, chiral polymorphs of nanofiber and microbelt with inverted CPL signals can be prepared from the same NIHis monomer in exactly the same solvent compositions and concentrations by only changing the temperature. The tunable CPL performance of the solid microbelts is realized under multi external physical or chemical stimuli including grinding, acid fuming, and heating. In particular, an emission color and CPL on&#8211;off switch based on the microbelt polymorph by reversible heating&#8211;cooling protocol is developed. This work brings a new approach for developing smart CPL materials via supramolecular polymorphism engineering.

         <title>Achieving Exceptional Volumetric Desalination Capacity Using Compact MoS2 Nanolaminates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 nanolaminates with compact architecture achieved high capacitance up to &#8764;277.5 F cm&#8722;3 under scan rate of 1000 mV s&#8722;1. The electrode demonstrates an exceptional volumetric desalination capacity of 65.1 mgNaCl cm&#8722;3 in capacitive deionization. Theoretical analysis reveals 1T&#697; phase is thermodynamically preferable over 2H phase, and ion hydration, channel confinement also play critical role in ion adsorption.








Abstract
Capacitive deionization (CDI) has emerged as a promising technology for freshwater recovery from low&#8208;salinity brackish water. It is still inapplicable in specific scenarios (e.g., households, islands, or offshore platforms) due to too low volumetric adsorption capacities. In this study, a high&#8208;density semi&#8208;metallic molybdenum disulfide (1T&#697;&#8208;MoS2) electrode with compact architecture obtained by restacking of exfoliated nanosheets, which achieve high capacitance up to &#8776;277.5&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3 under an ultrahigh scan rate of 1000&#160;mV&#160;s&#8722;1 with a lower charge&#8208;transfer resistance and nearly tenfold higher electrochemical active surface area than the 2H&#8208;MoS2 electrode, is reported. Furthermore, 1T&#697;&#8208;MoS2 electrode demonstrates exceptional volumetric desalination capacity of 65.1&#160;mgNaCl&#160;cm&#8722;3 in CDI experiments. Ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) reveal that the cation storage mechanism with the dynamic expansion of 1T&#697;&#8208;MoS2 interlayer to accommodate cations such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, which in turn enhances the capacity. Theoretical analysis unveils that 1T&#697; phase is thermodynamically preferable over 2H phase, the ion hydration and channel confinement also play critical role in enhancing ion adsorption. Overall, this work provides a new method to design compact 2D&#8208;layered nanolaminates with high&#8208;volumetric performance for CDI desalination.

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;Conductive and Patternable 40&#160;nm&#8208;Thick Polymer Film for Reliable Emotion Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin (40&#160;nm) polymer film comprising photolithographic poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) and graphene (PLPG) is developed as a patternable and compliant bioelectrode. Finite element analysis is adopted to optimize electrode structure for better stress dissipation ability. PLPG demonstrates excellent performance in motion artifact&#8208;less electrophysiological sensing. Integrating facial electromyogram with machine learning algorithms, a high emotion recognition accuracy is achieved.








Abstract
Understanding psychology is an important task in modern society which helps predict human behavior and provide feedback accordingly. Monitoring of weak psychological and emotional changes requires bioelectronic devices to be stretchable and compliant for unobtrusive and high&#8208;fidelity signal acquisition. Thin conductive polymer film is regarded as an ideal interface; however, it is very challenging to simultaneously balance mechanical robustness and opto&#8208;electrical property. Here, a 40&#160;nm&#8208;thick film based on photolithographic double&#8208;network conductive polymer mediated by graphene layer is reported, which concurrently enables stretchability, conductivity, and conformability. Photolithographic polymer and graphene endow the film photopatternability, enhance stress dissipation capability, as well as improve opto&#8208;electrical conductivity (4458 S cm&#8722;1@&gt;90% transparency) through molecular rearrangement by &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction, electrostatic interaction, and hydrogen bonding. The film is further applied onto corrugated facial skin, the subtle electromyogram is monitored, and machine learning algorithm is performed to understand complex emotions, indicating the outstanding ability for stretchable and compliant bioelectronics.

     alt="An Ultra-Conductive and Patternable 40&#160;nm-Thick Polymer Film for Reliable Emotion Recognition"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ultrathin (40&#160;nm) polymer film comprising photolithographic poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) and graphene (PLPG) is developed as a patternable and compliant bioelectrode. Finite element analysis is adopted to optimize electrode structure for better stress dissipation ability. PLPG demonstrates excellent performance in motion artifact-less electrophysiological sensing. Integrating facial electromyogram with machine learning algorithms, a high emotion recognition accuracy is achieved.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding psychology is an important task in modern society which helps predict human behavior and provide feedback accordingly. Monitoring of weak psychological and emotional changes requires bioelectronic devices to be stretchable and compliant for unobtrusive and high-fidelity signal acquisition. Thin conductive polymer film is regarded as an ideal interface; however, it is very challenging to simultaneously balance mechanical robustness and opto-electrical property. Here, a 40&#160;nm-thick film based on photolithographic double-network conductive polymer mediated by graphene layer is reported, which concurrently enables stretchability, conductivity, and conformability. Photolithographic polymer and graphene endow the film photopatternability, enhance stress dissipation capability, as well as improve opto-electrical conductivity (4458 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;@&amp;gt;90% transparency) through molecular rearrangement by &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction, electrostatic interaction, and hydrogen bonding. The film is further applied onto corrugated facial skin, the subtle electromyogram is monitored, and machine learning algorithm is performed to understand complex emotions, indicating the outstanding ability for stretchable and compliant bioelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bistable Electrochromic Ionogels via Supramolecular Interactions for Energy&#8208;Efficient Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy leveraging supramolecular interactions is proposed for designing bistable electrochromic materials, facilitating reversible color transitions, stabilizing the colored structure, and enabling spatial confinement to inhibit diffusion for bistable electrochromism. Utilizing biobased building blocks, reusable ITO electrodes, and ionogel functional layers, this approach achieves a flexible, energy&#8208;efficient, low&#8208;cost, and sustainable EC displays with excellent bistability.








Abstract
Bistable electrochromic (EC) materials and systems offer significant potential for building decarbonization through their optical modulation and energy efficiency. However, challenges such as limited design strategies and bottlenecks in cost, fabrication, and color have hindered the full commercialization of energy&#8208;saving EC windows and displays, with few materials achieving true bistability. Herein, a novel strategy for designing bistable electrochromic materials is proposed by leveraging supramolecular interactions. These interactions facilitate reversible color transitions, stabilize the colored structure, and enable spatial confinement to inhibit diffusion, thereby achieving bistable electrochromism. The mechanisms and materials underlying these unconventional electrochromic systems are substantiated through detailed characterization. This strategy enables the preparation of low&#8208;cost and sustainable transparent electrochromic displays with high performance. Notably, the display information remains clearly visible for more than 2 h without consuming energy. Involving biomass materials and removable device structures also enhances the sustainability and scalability of EC technology applications and development. These results demonstrate the crucial role of supramolecular chemistry in the development of cutting&#8208;edge materials for applications such as energy&#8208;saving smart windows.

         <title>Rapid&#8208;Response Water&#8208;Shrink Films with High Output Work Density Based on Polyethylene Oxide and &#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin for Autonomous Wound Closure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel water&#8208;shrink film (WS film) with supercontraction, constructed by poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin, is demonstrated. Upon wetting, this film rapidly contracts, generating substantial contraction stress and a high output work density. Water&#8208;shrink tapes, based on this supercontractile film, autonomously close the bleeding wound, offering an innovative approach for self&#8208;treatment, especially in urgent self&#8208;care scenarios.








Abstract
Conventional wound closure methods, including sutures and tissue adhesives, present significant challenges for self&#8208;care treatment, particularly in the context of bleeding wounds. Existing stimuli&#8208;responsive contractile materials designed for autonomous wound closure frequently lack sufficient output work density to generate the force needed to bring the wound edges into proximity or necessitate stimuli that are not compatible with the human body. Here, semi&#8208;transparent, flexible, and water&#8208;responsive shrinkable films, composed of poly(ethylene oxide) and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin, are reported. These films exhibit remarkable stability under ambient conditions and demonstrate significant contraction (&#8776;50%) within 6 s upon exposure to water, generating substantial contractile stress (up to 6&#160;MPa) and output work density (&#8776;1028&#160;kJ m&#8722;3), which is 100 times larger than that of conventional hydrogel and 25 times larger than that of skeletal muscles. Remarkably, upon hydration, these films are capable of lifting objects 10&#160;000 times their own weight. Leveraging this technology, water&#8208;shrink tapes, which, upon contact with water, effectively constrict human skin and autonomously close bleeding wounds in animal models within 10 seconds, are developed further. This work offers a novel approach to skin wound management, showing significant potential for emergency and self&#8208;care scenarios.

         <title>Accelerated Discovery of (TiZrHf)x(NbTa)1&#8722;x High&#8208;Entropy Alloys With Superior Thermal Stability and a New Crystallization Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work performs a high&#8208;throughput investigation of the thermal stability of (TiZrHf)x(NbTa)1&#8722;x&#160;high&#8208;entropy alloys based on combinatorial magnetron co&#8208;sputtering, vacuum annealing, and synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques, observing superior phase and grain size stability than previously reported nanocrystalline counterparts. The effect of composition on thermal stability is evaluated and a new crystallization mechanism is revealed.








Abstract
Nanocrystalline (nc) metals are generally strong yet thermally unstable, rendering them difficult to process and unsuitable for use, particularly at elevated temperatures. Nc multicomponent and high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are found to offer enhanced thermal stability but only in a few empirically discovered systems out of a vast compositional space. In response, this work develops a combinatorial strategy to accelerate the discovery of nc&#8208;(TiZrHf)x(NbTa)1&#8722;x alloy library with distinct thermal stability, in terms of phases and grain sizes. Based on synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and electron microscopy characterizations, a phase transition is observed from amorphous&#8211;crystalline nanocomposites to a body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) phase upon annealing. With increased NbTa content (decreased x value), the system tends to achieve thermally stable dual bcc phases upon annealing; in contrast, alloys with increased TiZrHf content (x &gt; 0.6) maintain a single&#8208;composition nanocomposite state, impeding crystallization and grain growth. This investigation not only broadens the understanding of thermal stability but also delves into the onset of crystallization in HEA systems.

         <title>2D Graphene Oxide Films Expand Functionality of Photonic Chips</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By harnessing the unique property changes induced by photothermal effects in 2D graphene oxide (GO) films, three novel functionalities beyond the capability of photonic integrated circuits are demonstrated, including all&#8208;optical control and tuning, optical power limiting, and nonreciprocal light transmission. The experimental results are theoretically analyzed, reflecting intriguing insights into the physics of 2D GO films.








Abstract
On&#8208;chip integration of 2D materials with unique structures and properties endow integrated devices with new functionalities and improved performance. With high flexibility in ways to modify its properties and compatibility with integrated platforms, graphene oxide (GO) is an exceptionally attractive 2D material for hybrid integrated photonic chips. Here, by harnessing unique property changes induced by photothermal effects in 2D GO films, novel functionalities beyond the capability of photonic integrated circuits are demonstrated. These include all&#8208;optical control and tuning, optical power limiting, and nonreciprocal light transmission. The 2D layered GO films are integrated onto photonic chips with precise control of their thickness and size. Benefitting from the broadband optical response of 2D GO films, all three functionalities feature a very wide operational optical bandwidth. By fitting the experimental results with theory, the changes in GO film properties induced by the photothermal effects are analyzed, revealing interesting insights about the physics of 2D GO films. These results highlight the versatility of 2D GO films in implementing new functions for integrated photonic devices for a wide range of applications.

         <title>Surface Reconstruction for Efficient NiOx&#8208;Based Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A record efficiency of 25.64% is achieved for NiOx&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cell via a surface reconstruction strategy utilized lead chelation (LC) molecules. The LC molecules target passivates the undesirable defects while avoids the adverse clustering in local areas on perovskite surface during the surface reconstruction process, thereby maximizing the passivation effect.








Abstract
Functional agents are verified to efficiently enhance device performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) through surface engineering. However, the influence of intrinsic characteristics of molecules on final device performance is overlooked. Here, a surface reconstruction strategy is developed to enhance the efficiency of inverted PSCs by mitigating the adverse effects of lead chelation (LC) molecules. Bathocuproine (BCP) is chosen as the representative of LC molecules for its easy accessibility and outstanding optoelectronic properties. During this strategy, BCP molecules on perovskite surface are first dissolved in solvents and then captured specially by undercoordinated Pb2+ ions, preventing adverse n&#8208;type doping by the molecules themselves. In this case, the BCP molecule exhibits outstanding passivation effect on perovskite surface, which leads to an obviously increased open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC). Therefore, a record power conversion efficiency of 25.64% for NiOx&#8208;based inverted PSCs is achieved, maintaining over 80% of initial efficiency after exposure to ambient condition for &#8776;1500 h.

         <title>Carbon Dots&#8208;Inked Paper with Single/Two&#8208;Photon Excited Dual&#8208;Mode Thermochromic Afterglow for Advanced Dynamic Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermochromic afterglow (TCAG) in carbon dots&#8208;inked paper (CDs@Paper) is achieved by tuning the temperature&#8208;dependent dual&#8208;mode afterglow of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). The TCAG properties of CDs@Paper are leveraged to design a multidimensional color code containing color and temperature information for advanced dynamic information encryption. And the two&#8208;photon afterglow is first reported in CDs materials.








Abstract
Achieving thermochromic afterglow (TCAG) in a single material for advanced information encryption remains a significant challenge. Herein, TCAG in carbon dots (CDs)&#8208;inked paper (CDs@Paper) is achieved by tuning the temperature&#8208;dependent dual&#8208;mode afterglow of room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). The CDs are synthesized through thermal treatment of levofloxacin in melting boric acid with postpurification via dialysis. CDs@Paper exhibit both TCAG and excitation&#8208;dependent afterglow color properties. The TCAG of CDs@Paper exhibits dynamic color changes from blue at high temperatures to yellow at low temperatures by adjusting the proportion of the temperature&#8208;dependent TADF and phosphorescence. Notably, two&#8208;photon afterglow in CDs&#8208;based afterglow materials and time&#8208;dependent two&#8208;photon afterglow colors are achieved for the first time. Moreover, leveraging the opposite emission responses of phosphorescence and TADF to temperature, CDs@Paper demonstrate TCAG with temperature&#8208;sensing capabilities across a wide temperature range. Furthermore, a CDs@Paper&#8208;based 3D code containing color and temperature information is successfully developed for advanced dynamic information encryption.

         <title>Pt1.8Pd0.2CuGa Intermetallic Nanocatalysts with Enhanced Methanol Oxidation Performance for Efficient Hybrid Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quaternary Pt1.8Pd0.2CuGa intermetallic nanoparticle electrocatalyst is designed, which shows outstanding performance for the methanol oxidation reaction in alkaline&#8211;saline water. Stable energy&#8208;saving hybrid seawater electrolysis is further demonstrated, using the prepared Pt1.8Pd0.2CuGa nanoparticles to catalyze the anodic methanol oxidation coupled with the cathodic hydrogen evolution, which completely circumvents the interfering chlorine evolution.








Abstract
Seawater electrolysis is a potentially cost&#8208;effective approach to green hydrogen production, but it currently faces substantial challenges for its high energy consumption and the interference of chlorine evolution reaction (ClER). Replacing the energy&#8208;demanding oxygen evolution reaction with methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) represents a promising alternative, as MOR occurs at a significantly low anodic potential, which cannot only reduce the voltage needed for electrolysis but also completely circumvents ClER. To this end, developing high&#8208;performance MOR catalysts is a key. Herein, a novel quaternary Pt1.8Pd0.2CuGa/C intermetallic nanoparticle (i&#8208;NP) catalyst is reported, which shows a high mass activity (11.13 A mgPGM&#8722;1), a large specific activity (18.13&#160;mA cmPGM&#8722;2), and outstanding stability toward alkaline MOR. Advanced characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that the introduction of atomically distributed Pd in Pt2CuGa intermetallic markedly promotes the oxidation of key reaction intermediates by enriching electron concentration around Pt sites, resulting in weak adsorption of carbon&#8208;containing intermediates and favorable adsorption of synergistic OH&#8722; groups near Pd sites. MOR&#8208;assisted seawater electrolysis is demonstrated, which continuously operates under 1.23&#160;V for 240&#160;h in simulated seawater and 120&#160;h in natural seawater without notable degradation.

         <title>Giant Iontronic Flexoelectricity in Soft Hydrogels Induced by Tunable Biomimetic Ion Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant iontronic flexoelectricity of soft hydrogels is reported induced by the ion polarization of cations and anions with different transfer rates under bending deformations, achieving flexoelectric coefficient much higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art flexoelectric materials.








Abstract
Flexoelectricity features the strain gradient&#8208;induced mechanoelectric conversion using materials not limited by their crystalline symmetry, but state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art flexoelectric materials exhibit very small flexoelectric coefficients and are too brittle to withstand large deformations. Here, inspired by the ion polarization in living organisms, this paper reports the giant iontronic flexoelectricity of soft hydrogels where the ion polarization is attributed to the different transfer rates of cations and anions under bending deformations. The flexoelectricity is found to be easily regulated by the types of anion&#8211;cation pairs and polymer networks in the hydrogel. A polyacrylamide hydrogel with 1&#160;m NaCl achieves a record&#8208;high flexoelectric coefficient of &#8776;1160 &#181;C m&#8722;1, which can even be improved to &#8776;2340 &#181;C m&#8722;1 by synergizing with the effects of ion pairs and extra polycation chains. Furthermore, the hydrogel as flexoelectric materials can withstand larger bending deformations to obtain higher polarization charges owing to its intrinsic low modulus and high elasticity. A soft flexoelectric sensor is then demonstrated for object recognition by robotic hands. The findings greatly broaden the flexoelectricity to soft, biomimetic, and biocompatible materials and applications.

         <title>Molecule Crowding Strategy in Polymer Electrolytes Inducing Stable Interfaces for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecule crowding effect caused by 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5&#160;leads to the abundant anions are forcing into the Li+ coordinated sheath to form anion&#8208;rich coordinated structure, which weakens the Li+ coordination and consequently boosts the Li+ transport. The confined anions decomposed at electrode/electrolyte interfaces to forming stable SEI and CEI, which achieve uniform lithium deposition, prevent electrolytes' continuous degradation, and suppress transition&#8208;metal crosstalk.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries with polymer electrolytes suffer from electrolyte decomposition and lithium dendrites because of the unstable electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Herein, a molecule crowding strategy is proposed to modulate the Li+ coordinated structure, thus in situ constructing the stable interfaces. Since 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 possesses superior compatibility with polymer and electrostatic repulsion for anion of lithium salt, the anions are forced to crowd into a Li+ coordinated structure to weaken the Li+ coordination with polymer and boost the Li+ transport. The coordinated anions prior decompose to form LiF&#8208;rich, thin, and tough interfacial passivation layers for stabilizing the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Thus, the symmetric Li&#8211;Li cell can stably operate over 4360&#160;h, the LiFePO4||Li full battery presents 97.18% capacity retention in 700 cycles at 2&#160;C, and the NCM811||Li full battery possesses the capacity retention of 83.17% after 300 cycles. The assembled pouch cell shows excellent flexibility (stand for folding over 2000 times) and stability (89.42% capacity retention after 400 cycles). This work provides a promising strategy to regulate interfacial chemistry by modulating the ion environment to accommodate the interfacial issues and will inspire more effective approaches to general interface issues for polymer electrolytes.

&lt;p&gt;The molecule crowding effect caused by 15-crown-5&#160;leads to the abundant anions are forcing into the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; coordinated sheath to form anion-rich coordinated structure, which weakens the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; coordination and consequently boosts the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport. The confined anions decomposed at electrode/electrolyte interfaces to forming stable SEI and CEI, which achieve uniform lithium deposition, prevent electrolytes' continuous degradation, and suppress transition-metal crosstalk.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-solid-state lithium batteries with polymer electrolytes suffer from electrolyte decomposition and lithium dendrites because of the unstable electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Herein, a molecule crowding strategy is proposed to modulate the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; coordinated structure, thus in situ constructing the stable interfaces. Since 15-crown-5 possesses superior compatibility with polymer and electrostatic repulsion for anion of lithium salt, the anions are forced to crowd into a Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; coordinated structure to weaken the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; coordination with polymer and boost the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Array via Liquid Metal Nanoreactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The liquid metal nanoreactor strategy is proposed for realizing high&#8208;entropy alloy arrays. The coalescence nature endowed by the tendency to decrease surface energy constructed the basis of the nanoreactor to provide a confined reaction environment for the nucleation and growth of multiple elements, thus forming a single particle within each patterned feature.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) nanostructures arranged into well&#8208;defined configurations hold great potential for accelerating the development of electronics, photonics, catalysis, and device integration. However, the random nucleation induced by the disparity in physicochemical properties of multiple elements makes it challenging to achieve single&#8208;particle synthesis at the patterned preset sites in the high&#8208;entropy scenario. Herein, the liquid metal nanoreactor strategy is proposed to realize the construction of HEA arrays. The coalescence of the liquid metal driven by the tendency to decrease surface energy provides a restricted environment for the nucleation and growth to form single HEA particles at the preset locations, which can be regarded as a self&#8208;confinement reaction. Liquid metal endowing a low diffusion energy barrier on the substrate and a high diffusivity of the alloy system can dynamically promote the aggregation process. As a result, the HEA array is prepared with elements up to eleven and possesses uniform periodicity, which exhibits excellent holography response in a broad spectrum. This work injects new vitality into the construction of HEA nanopatterns and provides an excellent platform for propelling their fundamental research and applications.

         <title>Intrinsic Elastomer with Remarkable Dielectric Constant via Elastification of Relaxor Ferroelectric Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the slight cross&#8208;linking of relaxor ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;ter&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;ter&#8208;chlorofluoroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CFE)), intrinsic elastomer with a remarkable dielectric constant of 54.2 at 100 Hz is obtained. Notably, the dielectric constant of the elastomer nearly doubles that of pristine P)(VDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CFE), and surpasses all reported intrinsic elastomers, suggesting that the slight cross&#8208;linking of relaxor ferroelectric polymers can effectively enhance the dielectric constants in intrinsic elastomers.








Abstract
High&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant elastomers always play a critical role in the development of wearable electronics for actuation, energy storage, and sensing; therefore, there is an urgent need for effective strategies to enhance dielectric constants. The present methods mainly involve adding inorganic or conductive fillers to the polymer elastomers, however, the addition of fillers causes a series of problems, such as large dielectric loss, increased modulus, and deteriorating interface conditions. Here, the elastification of relaxor ferroelectric polymers is investigated through slight cross&#8208;linking, aiming to obtain intrinsic elastomers with high&#8208;dielectric constants. By cross&#8208;linking of the relaxor ferroelectric polymer poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;ter&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;ter&#8208;chlorofluoroethylene) with a long soft chain cross&#8208;linker, a relaxor ferroelectric elastomer with an enhanced dielectric constant is obtained, twice that of the pristine relaxor ferroelectric polymer and surpassing all reported intrinsic elastomers. This elastomer maintains its high&#8208;dielectric constant over a wide temperature range and exhibits robust mechanical fatigue resistance, chemical stability, and thermal stability. Moreover, the ferroelectricity of the elastomer remains stable under strains up to 80%. This study offers a simple and effective way to enhance the dielectric constant of intrinsic elastomers, thus facilitating advancements in soft robots, biosensors, and wearable electronics.

         <title>Photosensitizer&#8208;Amplified Antimicrobial Materials for Broad&#8208;Spectrum Ablation of Resistant Pathogens in Ocular Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of photodynamic therapy agents combining nonphotosensitive and photosensitive benzodiazoles and their modular integration into peptide sequences for broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity is presented. Chemical optimization leads to PEP3 with strong phototoxicity against Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria as well as fungi, including MDR pathogens, biofilms, and ex vivo porcine models of microbial keratitis.








Abstract
The emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens and the scarcity of new potent antibiotics and antifungals are one of the biggest threats to human health. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) combines light and photosensitizers to kill drug&#8208;resistant pathogens; however, there are limited materials that can effectively ablate different classes of infective pathogens. In the present work, a new class of benzodiazole&#8208;paired materials is designed as highly potent PDT agents with broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity upon illumination with nontoxic light. The results mechanistically demonstrate that the energy transfer and electron transfer between nonphotosensitive and photosensitive benzodiazole moieties embedded within pathogen&#8208;binding peptide sequences result in increased singlet oxygen generation and enhanced phototoxicity. Chemical optimization renders PEP3 as a novel PDT agent with remarkable activity against MDR bacteria and fungi as well as pathogens at different stages of development (e.g., biofilms, spores, and fungal hyphae), which also prove effective in an ex vivo porcine model of microbial keratitis. The chemical modularity of this strategy and its general compatibility with peptide&#8208;based targeting agents will accelerate the design of highly photosensitive materials for antimicrobial PDT.

         <title>Constructing an Interlaced Catalytic Surface via Fluorine&#8208;Doped Bimetallic Oxides for Oxygen Electrode Processes in Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural and catalytic factors of the oxygen electrode, culminating in the design of fluorine&#8208;doped bimetallic cobalt&#8208;nickel oxide (CoNiO2&#8211;xFx/CC) featuring an interlaced catalytic surface and a corncob&#8208;like structure, are meticulously balanced. Benefiting from its unique structural configuration and catalytic mechanism, the designed material significantly enhances the electrochemical performance of Li&#8211;O2 batteries across various aspects.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries, renowned for their high theoretical energy density, have garnered significant interest as prime candidates for future electric device development. However, their actual capacity is often unsatisfactory due to the passivation of active sites by solid&#8208;phase discharge products. Optimizing the growth and storage of these products is a crucial step in advancing Li&#8211;O2 batteries. Here, a fluorine&#8208;doped bimetallic cobalt&#8208;nickel oxide (CoNiO2&#8211;xFx/CC) with an interlaced catalytic surface (ICS) and a corncob&#8208;like structure is proposed as an oxygen electrode. Unlike conventional oxide electrodes with a &#8220;single adsorption catalytic mechanism,&#8221; the ICS of CoNiO2&#8722;xFx/CC offers a &#8220;competitive adsorption catalytic mechanism,&#8221; where oxygen sites facilitate oxygen conversion while fluorine sites contribute to the growth of Li2O2. This results in a change in Li2O2 morphology from a surface film to toroidal particles, effectively preventing&#160;the burial of active sites. Additionally, the unique open architecture aids in the capture and release of oxygen and the formation of well&#8208;contacted Li2O2/electrode interfaces, which benefits the complete decomposition of Li2O2 products. Consequently, the Li&#8211;O2 battery with a CoNiO2&#8722;xFx/CC cathode demonstrates a high specific capacity of up to 30923 mAh g&#8722;1 and a lifespan exceeding 580 cycles, surpassing most reported metal oxide&#8208;based cathodes.

   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/CC) with an interlaced catalytic surface (ICS) and a corncob-like structure is proposed as an oxygen electrode. Unlike conventional oxide electrodes with a &#8220;single adsorption catalytic mechanism,&#8221; the ICS of CoNiO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;F&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/CC offers a &#8220;competitive adsorption catalytic mechanism,&#8221; where oxygen sites facilitate oxygen conversion while fluorine sites contribute to the growth of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This results in a change in Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; morphology from a surface film to toroidal particles, effectively preventing&#160;the burial of active sites. Additionally, the unique open architecture aids in the capture and release of oxygen and the formation of well-contacted Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/electrode interfaces, which benefits the complete decomposition of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; products. Consequently, the Li&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery with a CoNiO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;F&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/CC cathode demonstrates a high specific capacity of up to 30923 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a lifespan exceeding 580 cycles, surpassing most reported metal oxide-based cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visual Eosin Y&#8208;Based Photosensitization Sensing Systems for Ultrasensitive Detection of Diclofenac with Single&#8208;Atom Co&#9472;N2O2 Site&#8208;Immobilized g&#8208;C3N4 Nanosheets</title>

Single&#8208;atom Co&#9472;N2O2 site&#8208;immobilized g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets are used to successfully establish a novel, visually striking, ultrahigh sensitive, and selective photosensitive detection system for colorless diclofenac with dye eosin Y for the first time.








Abstract
It is highly desired to develop a visual sensing system for ultrasensitive detection of colorless diclofenac (DCF), yet with a significant challenge. Herein, a novel dye&#8208;based photosensitization sensing system has been successfully developed for detecting DCF for the first time, in which the used dye eosin Y (DeY) can strongly absorb visible light and then be decolorized obviously by transferring photogenerated electrons to g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets (CN), while the built single&#8208;atomic Co&#9472;N2O2 sites on CN by boron&#8208;oxygen connection can competitively adsorb DCF to impede the photosensitization decoloration of DeY. This system exhibits a broad detection range from 8&#160;ng&#160;L&#8722;1 to 2 mg&#160;L&#8722;1 with 535&#160;nm light, an exceptionally low detection limit (3.5&#160;ng&#160;L&#8722;1), and remarkable selectivity. Through the time&#8208;resolved, in situ technologies, and theoretical calculations, the decolorization of DeY is attributed to the disruption of DeY's conjugated structure caused by the triplet excited state electron transfer from DeY to CN, meanwhile, the adsorbed oxygen facilitates the charge transfer process. The preferential adsorption of DCF mainly depends on the strong interactions between the as&#8208;constructed single&#8208;atom Co and Cl in DCF. This study opens an innovative light&#8208;driven sensing system by combining dye and single&#8208;atom metal/nanomaterial for visually intuitive detection of environmental pollutants.

         <title>Novel Palladium Hydride Surface Enabling Simultaneous Bacterial Killing and Osteogenic Formation through Proton Capturing and Activation of Antioxidant System in Immune Microenvironments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium hydride (PdHx) film, fabricated on titanium implants, exhibits a lattice capable of capturing protons within the bacterial microenvironment, consequently inducing bacterial death. Furthermore, it mimics human antioxidant systems, reshaping the osteogenic immune microenvironment and promoting osteogenesis.








Abstract
Achieving bacterial killing and osteogenic formation on an implant surface rarely occurs. In this study, a novel surface design&#8211;a palladium hydride (PdHx) film that enables these two distinct features to coexist is introduced. The PdHx lattice captures protons in the extracellular microenvironment of bacteria, disrupting their normal metabolic activities, such as ATP synthesis, nutrient co&#8208;transport, and oxidative stress. This disruption leads to significant bacterial death, as evidenced by RNA sequence analysis. Additionally, the unique enzymatic activity and hydrogen&#8208;loading properties of PdHx activate the human antioxidant system, resulting in the rapid clearance of reactive oxygen species. This process reshapes the osteogenic immune microenvironment, promoting accelerated osteogenesis. These findings reveal that the downregulation of the NOD&#8208;like receptor signaling pathway is critical for activating immune cells toward M2 phenotype polarization. This novel surface design provides new strategies for modifying implant coatings to simultaneously prevent bacterial infection, reduce inflammation, and enhance tissue regeneration, making it a noteworthy contribution to the field of advanced materials.

         <title>Toward 1D Transport in 3D Materials: SOC&#8208;Induced Charge&#8208;Transport Anisotropy in Sm3ZrBi5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) mechanistically induces 1D charge transport in the bulk, 3D structure Ln3ZrPn5 (Ln = La, Sm; Pn = Sb, Bi). Anisotropic charge transport measurements and electronic structure calculations demonstrate how the anisotropic 3D Fermi Surface of the antimonide is dimensionally reduced to 1D sheets of electron density in the bismuthides.








Abstract
1D charge transport offers great insight into strongly correlated physics, such as Luttinger liquids, electronic instabilities, and superconductivity. Although 1D charge transport is observed in nanomaterials and quantum wires, examples in bulk crystalline solids remain elusive. In this work, it is demonstrated that spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) can act as a mechanism to induce quasi&#8208;1D charge transport in the Ln3MPn5 (Ln = lanthanide; M = transition metal; Pn = Pnictide) family. From three example compounds, La3ZrSb5, La3ZrBi5, and Sm3ZrBi5, density functional theory calculations with SOC included show a quasi&#8208;1D Fermi surface in the bismuthide compounds, but an anisotropic 3D Fermi surface in the antimonide structure. By performing anisotropic charge transport measurements on La3ZrSb5, La3ZrBi5, and Sm3ZrBi5, it is demonstrated that SOC starkly affects their anisotropic resistivity ratios (ARR) at low temperatures, with an ARR of &#8776;4 in the antimonide compared to &#8776;9.5 and &#8776;22 (&#8776;32 after magnetic ordering) in La3ZrBi5 and Sm3ZrBi5, respectively. This report demonstrates the utility of spin&#8208;orbit coupling to induce quasi&#8208;low&#8208;dimensional Fermi surfaces in anisotropic crystal structures, and provides a template for examining other&#160;systems.

         <title>Protocell Flow Reactors for Enzyme and Whole&#8208;Cell Mediated Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protocell continuous flow reactors consisting of a densely packed array of enzyme&#8208; or bacteria&#8208;containing membranized coacervate vesicles are constructed and used for the spatiotemporal processing of biochemical and whole&#8208;cell mediated catalysis. The engineering of continuous flow reactors based on cell&#8208;like microscale agents offers opportunities in the development of green and sustainable industrial bioprocessing.








Abstract
The design and construction of continuous flow biochemical reactors comprising immobilized biocatalysts have generated great interest in the efficient synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals. Living cells use compartmentalization and reaction&#8208;diffusion processes for spatiotemporal regulation of biocatalytic reactions, and implementing these strategies into continuous flow reactors can offer new opportunities in reactor design and application. Herein, the fabrication of protocell&#8208;based continuous flow reactors for enzyme and whole&#8208;cell mediated biocatalysis is demonstrated. Semipermeable membranized coacervate vesicles are employed as model protocells that spontaneously sequester enzymes or accumulate living bacteria to produce embodied microreactors capable of single&#8208; or multiple&#8208;step catalytic reactions. By packing millions of the enzyme/bacteria&#8208;containing coacervate vesicles in a glass column, a facile, cost&#8208;effective, and modular methodology capable of performing oxidoreductase, peroxidase and lipolytic reactions, enzyme&#8208;mediated L&#8208;DOPA synthesis, and whole&#8208;cell glycolysis under continuous flow conditions, is demonstrated. It is shown that the protocell&#8208;nested enzymes and bacterial cells exhibit enhanced activities and stability under deleterious operating conditions compared with their non&#8208;encapsulated counterparts. These results provide a step toward the engineering of continuous flow reactors based on cell&#8208;like microscale agents and offer opportunities in the development of green and sustainable industrial bioprocessing.

&lt;p&gt;The design and construction of continuous flow biochemical reactors comprising immobilized biocatalysts have generated great interest in the efficient synthesis of value-added chemicals. Living cells use compartmentalization and reaction-diffusion processes for spatiotemporal regulation of biocatalytic reactions, and implementing these strategies into continuous flow reactors can offer new opportunities in reactor design and application. Herein, the fabrication of protocell-based continuous flow reactors for enzyme and whole-cell mediated biocatalysis is demonstrated. Semipermeable membranized coacervate vesicles are employed as model protocells that spontaneously sequester enzymes or accumulate living bacteria to produce embodied microreactors capable of single- or multiple-step catalytic reactions. By packing millions of the enzyme/bacteria-containing coacervate vesicles in a glass column, a facile, cost-effective, and modular methodology capable of performing oxidoreductase, peroxidase and lipolytic reactions, enzyme-mediated L-DOPA synthesis, and whole-cell glycolysis under continuous flow conditions, is demonstrated. It is shown that the protocell-nested enzymes and bacterial cells exhibit enhanced activities and stability under deleterious operating conditions compared with their non-encapsulated counterparts. These results provide a step toward the engineering of continuous flow reactors based on cell-like microscale agents and offer opportunities in the development of green and sustainable industrial bioprocessing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Symmetry Evolution Induced 2D Pt Single Atom Catalyst with High Density for Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uses salt&#8208;assisted methods to adjust the tetrahedral coordination in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks &#8208; 8 (ZIF&#8208;8) to planar tetragonal coordination without changing the ligand. In the carbonization process, to maintain the 2D morphology, the five&#8208;membered ring undergoes reconstruction to form a six&#8208;membered ring, introducing defects. These defects result in highly loaded Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts with high hydrogen oxidation reaction activity after electrodeposition.








Abstract
The performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts is greatly influenced by the chemical environment surrounding the central atom. Here, a salt&#8208;assisted method is employed to transform the tetrahedral coordination structure of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks &#8208; 8 (ZIF&#8208;8)&#160;into a planar square coordination structure without altering the ligands. During the subsequent carbonization process, concurrent with the evaporation of zinc atoms, the structure of the nitrogen and carbon carriers (NC carriers) undergoes a transition from five&#8208;membered rings to six&#8208;membered rings to preserve the 2D structure. This transition results in the generation of additional defect sites on the 2D&#8208;NC substrates. Hence, the Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts with planar square coordination symmetries can be precisely prepared via electrodeposition (denoted as 2D&#8208;Pt SAC). The Pt loading of 2D&#8208;Pt SAC is 0.49 &#177; 0.03 &#181;g cm&#8722;2, higher than that of 3D&#8208;Pt SAC (0.37 &#177; 0.04 &#181;g cm&#8722;2). In the context of the hydrogen oxidation reaction electrocatalysis, under an overpotential of 50 mV, these single&#8208;atom catalysts with 2D coordination exhibit mass activities of 2396 A gPt&#8722;1 (32 times higher than commercial Pt/C catalyst, 2 times higher than 3D&#8208;PtNC).

         <title>Planar Chlorination Engineering: A Strategy of Completely Breaking the Geometric Symmetry of Fe&#8208;N4 Site for Boosting Oxygen Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The planar chlorination engineering of Fe&#8208;N4 site is successfully designed by &#8220;NaCl&#8208;co&#8208;pyrolysis&#8221; strategy, which completely breaks the geometric symmetry of Fe&#8208;N4 site. The Fe&#8208;N4/CNCl catalyst exhibits higher catalytic activities for both oxygen electroreduction and Zn&#8208;air battery test than traditional Fe&#8208;N4 catalyst, revealing the enormous potential of planar chlorination engineering in electrocatalysis, energy storage, and conversion devices.








Abstract
Introducing asymmetric elements and breaking the geometric symmetry of traditional metal&#8208;N4 site for boosting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are meaningful and challenging. Herein, the planar chlorination engineering of Fe&#8208;N4 site is first proposed for remarkably improving the ORR activity. The Fe&#8208;N4/CNCl catalyst with broken symmetry exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.917&#160;V versus RHE, 49 and 72&#160;mV higher than those of traditional Fe&#8208;N4/CN and commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalysts. The Fe&#8208;N4/CNCl catalyst also has excellent stability for 25&#160;000 cycles and good methanol tolerance ability. For Zn&#8208;air battery test, the Fe&#8208;N4/CNCl catalyst has the maximum power density of 228&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and outstanding stability during 150&#160;h charge&#8211;discharge test, as the promising substitute of Pt&#8208;based catalysts in energy storage and conversion devices. The density functional theory calculation demonstrates that the adjacent C&#9472;Cl bond effectively breaks the symmetry of Fe&#8208;N4 site, downward shifts the d&#8208;band center of Fe, facilitates the reduction and release of OH*, and remarkably lowers the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step. This work reveals the enormous potential of planar chlorination engineering for boosting the ORR activity of traditional metal&#8208;N4 site by thoroughly breaking their geometric symmetry.

         <title>Treefrog&#8208;Inspired Flexible Electrode with High Permeability, Stable Adhesion, and Robust Durability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The challenges of instable adhesion, low impedance, and robust durability that hinder the long&#8208;term application of in vitro bioelectrodes. Inspired by treefrog web and bird's beak, through the optimization design, a web&#8208;like electrode, which can solve these complex integrated challenges, is proposed. Proposed electrode has the most balanced mechanical, electrical, and electrode properties of typical electrodes reported in recent years.









Abstract
Long&#8208;term continuous monitoring (LTCM) of physiological electrical signals is an effective means for detecting several cardiovascular diseases. However, the integrated challenges of stable adhesion, low impedance, and robust durability under different skin conditions significantly hinder the application of flexible electrodes in LTCM. This paper proposes a structured electrode inspired by the treefrog web, comprising dispersed pillars at the bottom and asymmetric cone holes at the top. Attachment structures with a dispersed pillar improve the contact stability (adhesion increases 2.79/13.16 times in dry/wet conditions compared to an electrode without structure). Improved permeable duct structure provides high permeability (12 times compared to cotton). Due to high adhesion and permeability, the electrode's durability is 40 times larger than commercial Ag/AgCl electrodes. The treefrog web&#8208;like electrode has great advantages in permeability, adhesion, and durability, resulting in prospects for application in physiological electrical signal detection and a new design idea for LTCM wearable dry electrodes.

         <dc:description>
The development of machine learning has dramatically revolutionized the process of material discovery. Here, the desired xanthene dyes are rational designed through machine learning and dual&#8208;locked probe for precise imaging of complex hepatocellular carcinoma is constructed. These results not only affirm the validity of the model but also guide the design of novel probes with practical applications.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance fluorescent probes stand as indispensable tools in fluorescence&#8208;guided imaging, and are crucial for precise delineation of focal tissue while minimizing unnecessary removal of healthy tissue. Herein, machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted strategy to investigate the current available xanthene dyes is first proposed, and a quantitative prediction model to guide the rational synthesis of novel fluorescent molecules with the desired pH responsivity is constructed. Two novel Si&#9472;rhodamine derivatives are successfully achieved and the cathepsin/pH sequentially activated probe Si&#9472;rhodamine&#9472;cathepsin&#8208;pH (SiR&#9472;CTS&#8208;pH) is constructed. The results reveal that SiR&#9472;CTS&#8208;pH exhibits higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of fluorescence imaging, compared to single pH or cathepsin&#8208;activated probe. Moreover, SiR&#9472;CTS&#8208;pH shows strong differentiation abilities for tumor cells and tissues and accurately discriminates the complex hepatocellular carcinoma tissues from normal ones, indicating its significant application potential in clinical practice. Therefore, the continuous development of xanthene dyes and the rational design of superior fluorescent molecules through machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted model broaden the path and provide more advanced methods to researchers.

         <title>Hierarchical Chiral Calcium Silicate Hydrate Films Promote Vascularization for Tendon&#8208;to&#8208;Bone Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium silicate hydrate films with levorotatory chirality promote endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis by activating integrin receptors and mechanosensitive ion channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 4. This process enhances vascularization at the enthesis and eventually promotes tendon&#8208;to&#8208;bone healing in rat rotator cuff tear models, underscoring the potential of chiral biomaterials for tissue regeneration via revascularization.








Abstract
Revascularization after rotator cuff repair is crucial for tendon&#8208;to&#8208;bone healing. The chirality of materials has been reported to influence their performance in tissue repair. However, data on the use of chiral structures to optimize biomaterials as a revascularization strategy remain scarce. Here, calcium silicate hydrate (CSO) films with hierarchical chirality on the atomic to micrometer scale are developed. Interestingly, levorotatory CSO (L&#8208;CSO) films promote the migration and angiogenesis of endothelial cells, whereas dextral and racemic CSO films do not induce the same effects. Molecular analysis demonstrates that L&#8208;chirality can be recognized by integrin receptors and leads to the formation of focal adhesion, which activates mechanosensitive ion channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 to conduct Ca2+ influx. Consequently, the phosphorylation of serum response factor is biased by Ca2+ influx to promote the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 signaling pathway, resulting in enhanced angiogenesis. After implanted in a rat rotator cuff tear model, L&#8208;CSO films strongly enhance vascularization at the enthesis, promoting collagen maturation, increasing bone and fibrocartilage formation, and eventually improving the biomechanical strength. This study reveals the mechanism through which chirality influences angiogenesis in endothelial cells and provides a critical theoretical foundation for the clinical application of chiral biomaterials.

         <title>A Cable&#8208;Stayed Honeycomb Superstructure to Improve the Stability of Li&#8208;Rich Materials via Inhibiting Interlaminar Lattice Strain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cable&#8208;stayed honeycomb superstructure is constructed by inducing high Li/Ni disorder in Li&#8208;rich cathode materials. The short&#8208;range order of the honeycomb superstructure is confirmed by the neutron pair distribution function. Benefiting from the high voltage stability and a superior crystal cell evolution mechanism of the cable&#8208;stayed superstructure, excellent cycle performance of the Li&#8208;rich/Si&#8208;C full cell is achieved.








Abstract
In layered Li&#8208;rich materials, over stoichiometric Li forms an ordered occupation of LiTM6 in transition metal (TM)&#160;layer, showing a honeycomb superstructure along [001] direction. At the atomic scale, the instability of the superstructure at high voltage is the root cause of problems such as capacity/voltage decay of Li&#8208;rich materials. Here a Li&#8208;rich material with a high Li/Ni disorder is reported, these interlayer Ni atoms locate above the honeycomb superstructure and share adjacent O coordination with honeycomb TM. These Ni&#9472;O bonds act as cable&#8208;stayed bridge to the honeycomb plane, and improve the high&#8208;voltage stability. The cable&#8208;stayed honeycomb superstructure is confirmed by in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction to have a unique cell evolution mechanism that it can alleviate interlaminar lattice strain by promoting in&#8208;plane expansion along a&#8208;axis and inhibiting c&#8208;axis stretching. Electrochemical tests also demonstrate significantly improved long cycle performance after 500 cycles (86% for Li&#8208;rich/Li half cell and 82% for Li&#8208;rich/Si&#8208;C full cell) and reduced irreversible oxygen release. This work proves the feasibility of achieving outstanding stability of lithium&#8208;rich materials through superstructure regulation and provides new insights for the development of the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes.

         <title>Full&#8208;Space Electric Field in Mo&#8208;Decorated Zn2In2S5 Polarization Photocatalyst for Oriented Charge Flow and Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting the challenge of inadequate charge kinetics within the photocatalyst, this work has induced a sophisticated full&#8208;space electric field in an atomically dispersed Mo cluster&#8208;decorated Zn2In2S5, resulting in a substantial boost in charge separation efficiency and a streamlined charge flow, thereby paving the way for a highly&#8208;efficient artificial photosynthesis process.








Abstract
Integration of photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution with oxidative organic synthesis presents a highly attractive strategy for the simultaneous production of clean H2 fuel and high&#8208;value chemicals. However, the sluggish dynamics of photogenerated charge carriers across the photocatalysts result in low photoconversion efficiency, hindering the wide applications of such a technology. Herein, this work overcomes this limitation by inducing the full&#8208;space electric field via charge polarization engineering on a Mo cluster&#8208;decorated Zn2In2S5 (Mo&#8208;Zn2In2S5) photocatalyst. Specifically, this full&#8208;space electric field arises from a cascade of the bulk electric field (BEF) and local surface electric field (LSEF), triggering the oriented migration of photogenerated electrons from [Zn&#8211;S] regions to [In&#8211;S] regions and eventually to Mo cluster sites, ensuring efficient separation of bulk and surface charge carriers. Moreover, the surface Mo clusters induce a tip enhancement effect to optimize charge transfer behavior by augmenting electrons and proton concentration around the active sites on the basal plane of Zn2In2S5. Notably, the optimized Mo1.5&#8208;Zn2In2S5 catalyst achieves exceptional H2 and benzaldehyde production rates of 34.35 and 45.31&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively, outperforming pristine ZnIn2S4 by 3.83&#8208; and 4.15&#8208;fold. These findings mark a significant stride in steering charge flow for enhanced photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Unconventional Band Structure via Combined Molecular Orbital and Lattice Symmetries in a Surface&#8208;Confined Metallated Graphdiyne Sheet</title>

ToC Figure illustrates the emergence of unconventional band structure in mesoscopically (&#8776;1 &#181;m) ordered metallated&#8208;graphdiyne single sheet due to combined frontier molecular orbital and lattice symmetries.








Abstract
Graphyne (GY) and graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based monolayers represent the next generation 2D carbon&#8208;rich materials with tunable structures and properties surpassing those of graphene. However, the detection of band formation in atomically thin GY/GDY analogues has been challenging, as both long&#8208;range order and atomic precision have to be fulfilled in the system. The present&#160;work reports direct evidence of band formation in on&#8208;surface synthesized metallated Ag&#8208;GDY sheets with mesoscopic (&#8776;1&#160;&#181;m) regularity. Employing scanning tunneling and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopies, energy&#8208;dependent transitions of real&#8208;space electronic states above the Fermi level and formation of the valence band are respectively observed. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations corroborate the observations and reveal that doubly degenerate frontier molecular orbitals on a honeycomb lattice give rise to flat, Dirac and Kagome bands close to the Fermi level. DFT modeling also indicates an intrinsic band gap for the pristine sheet material, which is retained for a bilayer with h&#8208;BN, whereas adsorption&#8208;induced in&#8208;gap electronic states evolve at the synthesis platform with Ag&#8208;GDY decorating the (111) facet of silver. These results illustrate the tremendous potential for engineering novel band structures via molecular orbital and lattice symmetries in atomically precise 2D carbon materials.

         <title>Gradient Doping Enables an Extraordinary Efficiency in Thermoelectric PbTe1&#8722;xIx</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gradient doping is realized in PbTe1&#8722;xIx using a vertical gradient solidification technique, enabling a spatial gradient in carrier concentration that optimizes zT at each portion of the device under its operating temperature. Such a gradient doping results in an extraordinary device efficiency of &#8776;14% at a &#916;T of &#8776;500&#160;K, corresponding to a &#8776;40% improvement as compared to homogeneous doping.








Abstract
The conversion efficiency of thermoelectric generators that have to be operated under a temperature difference (&#916;T) is mainly determined by material's dimensionless figure of merit (zT). However, maximization of zT at each temperature requires an optimization of carrier concentration (nopt) which strongly depends on the temperature and band parameters. Commonly utilized strategy of chemical doping usually enables a homogeneous carrier concentration throughout the material, leading the maximal zT to be achievable only within a narrow temperature range. In this work, a gradiently doping is successfully realized in PbTe1&#8722;xIx using a vertical gradient solidification technique, enabling a spatial gradient in carrier concentration that correspondingly optimizes zT at each portion of the material under its operating temperature. Such a gradient doping results in an extraordinary device efficiency of &#8776;14% at a &#916;T of &#8776;500&#160;K, corresponding to a &#8776;40% improvement as compared to that of homogeneous doping. Since directional solidification technique commonly enables gradient dopant concentrations in semiconductors, the resultant gradient carrier concentration is illustrated here as an effective approach for advancing thermoelectrics.

         <title>Brain Delivery of Protein Therapeutics by Cell Matrix&#8208;Inspired Biomimetic Nanocarrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell matrix&#8208;inspired biomimetic nanocarrier for intracerebral delivery of protein therapeutics. It transports diverse proteins across the blood&#8211;brain barrier. It facilitates rapid intracellular delivery and release of catalase via macropinocytosis&#8208;activated membrane fusion, resulting in improved spatial learning and memory in traumatic brain injury mice, and enhances motor function and prolongs survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mice.








Abstract
Protein therapeutics are anticipated to offer significant treatment options for central nervous system (CNS) diseases. However, the majority of proteins are unable to traverse the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and reach their CNS target sites. Inspired by the natural environment of active proteins, the cell matrix components hyaluronic acid (HA) and protamine (PRTM) are used to self&#8208;assemble with proteins to form a protein&#8208;loaded biomimetic core and then incorporated into ApoE3&#8208;reconstituted high&#8208;density lipoprotein (rHDL) to form a protein&#8208;loaded biomimetic nanocarrier (Protein&#8208;HA&#8208;PRTM&#8208;rHDL). This cell matrix&#8208;inspired biomimetic nanocarrier facilitates the penetration of protein therapeutics across the BBB and enables their access to intracellular target sites. Specifically, CAT&#8208;HA&#8208;PRTM&#8208;rHDL facilitates rapid intracellular delivery and release of catalase (CAT) via macropinocytosis&#8208;activated membrane fusion, resulting in improved spatial learning and memory in traumatic brain injury (TBI) model mice (significantly reduces the latency of TBI mice and doubles the number of crossing platforms), and enhances motor function and prolongs survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) model mice (extended the median survival of ALS mice by more than 10 days). Collectively, this cell matrix&#8208;inspired nanoplatform enables the efficient CNS delivery of protein therapeutics and provides a novel approach for the treatment of CNS diseases.

         <title>Intranasal Delivery of Near&#8208;Infrared and Magnetic Dual&#8208;Response Nanospheres to Rapidly Produce Antidepressant&#8208;Like and Cognitive Enhancement Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>

Inspired from snuff bottle, a nasal delivery system with the combination of iron supplementation and a peripheral D2 receptor antagonist is developed for dopamine receptors upregulation which can solve a variety of mental disorders (such as depression, anxiety, and addiction) and improve cognition of patients.








Abstract
Restricted by synaptic plasticity, dopamine receptor (DR) upregulation takes a long time to work. Moreover, the impact of the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) on delivery efficiency restricts the development of drugs. Taking inspiration from snuff bottles, a convenient, fast&#8208;acting, and nonaddictive nasal drug delivery system has been developed to rapidly reshape the balance of synaptic transmitters. This optical and magnetic response system called CFs@DP, comprised of carbonized MIL&#8208;100 (Fe) frameworks (CFs) and domperidone (DP), which can enter the brain via nasal administration. Under dual stimulation of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation and catecholamine&#8208;induced complexation, CFs@DP disintegrates to release iron ions and DP, causing upregulation of the dopamine type 1 (D1), type 2 (D2) receptors, and brain&#8208;derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to achieve a therapeutic effect. In vivo experiments demonstrate that the DR density of mice (postnatal day 50&#8211;60) increased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HPC) after 10 days of therapy, resulting in antidepressant&#8208;like and cognitive enhancement effects. Interestingly, the cognitive enhancement effect of CFs@DP is even working in noniron deficiency (normal fed) mice, making it a promising candidate for application in enhancing learning ability.

         <title>Dipole Moment Influences the Reversibility and Corrosion of Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dipole moment influences the distribution and orientation of solvent molecules in the electric double layer on lithium metal surface. And these parameters have significant impacts on lithium metal reversibility and corrosion. Solvents with high dipole moments are more likely to adsorb onto lithium metal surfaces, which also influence the solid electrolyte interphase.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) must have both long cycle life and calendar life to be commercially viable. However, &#8220;trial and error&#8221; methodologies remain prevalent in contemporary research endeavors to identify favorable electrolytes. Here, a guiding principle for the selection of solvents for LMBs is proposed, which aims to achieve high Coulombic efficiency while minimizing the corrosion. For the first time, this study reveals that the dipole moment and orientation of solvent molecules have significant impacts on lithium metal reversibility and corrosion. Solvents with high dipole moments are more likely to adsorb onto lithium metal surfaces, which also influence the solid electrolyte interphase. Using this principle, the use of LiNO3 is demonstrated as the sole salt in LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Li cells can achieve excellent cycling stability. Overall, this work bridges the molecular structure of solvents to the reversibility and corrosion of lithium metal, and these concepts can be extended to other metal&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Perovskite Solar Cells with &gt; 25% Efficiency: Unveiling the Hidden Bottom Surface of Perovskite Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the often&#8208;overlooked PbI2 residual and its detailed impact on device performance are thoroughly investigated. Leveraging effective PbI2 management and precise regulation of the perovskite crystallization process, the champion devices achieve a PCE of 25.06% with long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
While significant efforts in surface engineering have been devoted to the conversion process of lead iodide (PbI2) into perovskite and top surface engineering of perovskite layer with remarkable progress, the exploration of residual PbI2 clusters and the hidden bottom surface on perovskite layer have been limited. In this work, a new strategy involving 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium acetate (BMIMAc) ionic liquid (IL) additives is developed and it is found that both the cations and the anions in ILs can interact with the perovskite components, thereby regulating the crystallization process and diminishing the residue PbI2 clusters as well as filling vacancies. The introduction of BMIMAc ILs induces the formation of a uniform porous PbI2 film, facilitating better penetration of the second&#8208;step organic salt and fostering a more extensive interaction between PbI2 and the organic salt. Surprisingly, the oversized residual PbI2 clusters at the bottom surface of the perovskite layer completely diminish. In addition, advanced depth analysis techniques including depth&#8208;resolved grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) and bottom thinning technology are employed for a comprehensive understanding of the reduction in residual PbI2. Leveraging effective PbI2 management and regulation of the perovskite crystallization process, the champion devices achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.06% with long&#8208;term stability.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, the often-overlooked PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; residual and its detailed impact on device performance are thoroughly investigated. Leveraging effective PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; management and precise regulation of the perovskite crystallization process, the champion devices achieve a PCE of 25.06% with long-term stability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While significant efforts in surface engineering have been devoted to the conversion process of lead iodide (PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) into perovskite and top surface engineering of perovskite layer with remarkable progress, the exploration of residual PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; clusters and the hidden bottom surface on perovskite layer have been limited. In this work, a new strategy involving 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (BMIMAc) ionic liquid (IL) additives is developed and it is found that both the cations and the anions in ILs can interact with the perovskite components, thereby regulating the crystallization process and diminishing the residue PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; clusters as well as filling vacancies. The introduction of BMIMAc ILs induces the formation of a uniform porous PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; film, facilitating better penetration of the second-step organic salt and fostering a more extensive interaction between PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the organic salt. Surprisingly, the oversized residual PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; clusters at the bottom surface of the perovskite layer completely diminish. In addition, advanced depth analysis techniques including depth-resolved grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and bottom thinning technology are employed for a comprehensive understanding of the reduction in residual PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Leveraging effective PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; management and regulation of the perovskite crystallization process, the champion devices achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.06% with long-term stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Air&#8208;Processed Perovskite Solar Cells with &gt;25% Efficiency and High Stability Enabled by Crystallization Modulation and Holistic Passivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic semiconductor nanoparticles with good dispersion in perovskite inks are facilely synthesized. The addition of these NPs into perovskite inks can effectively facilitate charge extraction and passivate the defects in the holistic perovskite films. The air&#8208;processed perovskite solar cells based on indene&#8208;C60 biadduct nanoparticles realize a high power conversion efficiency of 25.1% and improved stability.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors (e.g., PCBM and IDIC) frequently serve as interface passivants for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to their beneficial passivation effects on perovskite interfaces. However, their passivation to the interiors of perovskite films is greatly limited by their poor solubility in polar solvents and compatibility issues. Here the facile synthesis of organic semiconductor nanoparticle (NP) passivants that readily disperse in perovskite inks is reported. Adding these NPs into perovskite inks not only modulates perovskite crystallization, improves film quality and conductivity, but also achieves holistic bulk film passivation. Consequently, blade&#8208;coated p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs with ICBA NPs achieve an impressive efficiency of 25.1% (independently certified as 25.0%), the highest reported value for air&#8208;processed PSCs irrespective of fabrication methods or device structures. This work develops a novel approach for effective and holistic perovskite passivation by converting conventional passivants to perovskite&#8208;compatible NPs, paving the way for more efficient and stable perovskite solar devices.

         <title>Adhesive Zwitterionic Poly(ionic liquid) with Unprecedented Organic Solvent Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a zwitterionic poly(ionic liquid) (ZPIL) adhesive, known for its exceptional resistance to organic solvents and recyclability. Utilizing electrostatic dipole&#8211;dipole interactions, ZPIL maintains strong adhesion across various substrates and withstands prolonged exposure to organic solvents. This breakthrough addresses key challenges in adhesive technology, offering significant potential for industrial applications in plastics, coatings, and adhesives.








Abstract
The resistance of adhesives to organic solvents is of paramount importance in diverse industries. Unfortunately, many currently available adhesives exhibit either weak intermolecular chain interactions, resulting in insufficient resistance to organic solvents, or possess a permanent covalent crosslinked network, impeding recyclability. This study introduces an innovative approach to address this challenge by formulating zwitterionic poly(ionic liquid) (ZPIL) derivatives with robust dipole&#8211;dipole interactions, incorporating sulfonic anions and imidazolium cations. Due to its unique dynamic and electrostatic self&#8208;crosslinking structure, the ZPIL exhibits significant adhesion to various substrates and demonstrates excellent recyclability even after multiple adhesion tests. Significantly, ZPIL exhibits exceptional adhesion stability across diverse nonpolar and polar organic solvents, including ionic liquids, distinguishing itself from nonionic polymers and conventional poly(ionic liquid)s. Its adhesive performance remains minimally affected even after prolonged exposure to soaking conditions. The study presents a promising solution for the design of highly organic solvent&#8208;resistant materials for plastics, coatings, and adhesives.

         <title>Neutral Cyanine: Ultra&#8208;Stable NIR&#8208;II Merocyanines for Highly Efficient Bioimaging and Tumor&#8208;Targeted Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;II emissive neutral merocyanine dye is developed based on the clinically used ionic indocyanine green, exhibiting maintained strong near&#8208;infrared absorption, improved photostability, enhanced photothermal performance, bright NIR&#8208;II emission, and specific tumor accumulation. The mCy890 NPs are successfully utilized for efficient in vivo NIR&#8208;II fluorescence bioimaging and cancer phototheranostics.









Abstract
Fluorescence imaging (FLI)&#8208;guided phototheranostics using emission from the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window show significant potential for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Clinical imaging&#8208;used polymethine ionic indocyanine green (ICG) dye is widely adopted for NIR fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) research due to its exceptional photophysical properties. However, ICG has limitations such as poor photostability, low photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE), short&#8208;wavelength emission peak, and liver&#8208;targeting issues, which restrict its wider use. In this study, two ionic ICG derivatives are transformed into neutral merocyanines (mCy) to achieve much&#8208;enhanced performance for NIR&#8208;II cancer phototheranostics. Initial designs of two ionic dyes show similar drawbacks as ICG in terms of poor photostability and low photothermal performance. One of the modified neutral molecules, mCy890, shows significantly improved stability, an emission peak over 1000&#160;nm, and a high photothermal PCE of 51%, all considerably outperform ICG. In vivo studies demonstrate that nanoparticles of the mCy890 can effectively accumulate at the tumor sites for cancer photothermal therapy guided by NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging. This research provides valuable insights into the development of neutral merocyanines for enhanced cancer phototheranostics.

Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries
In article number 2402024, Jongwoo Lim and co&#8208;workers explore the fundamental causes of temperature surges during thermal runaway in lithium&#8208;ion battery full cells. The article identifies intermediates that create a self&#8208;amplifying loop via multidirectional crosstalk between the battery electrodes. The cover image depicts this crosstalk, illustrating how ethylene gas from the anode and oxygen gas from the cathode trigger thermal runaway.

Wearable Coaxially&#8208;Shielded Metamaterial
Drawing inspiration from commercial coaxial cable, Xia Zhu, Ke Wu, Stephan W. Anderson, and Xin Zhang construct a wireless, flexible, lightweight, and cheap metamaterial with an internal coaxially&#8208;shielded structure, confining electric field within while possessing a predominant magnetic response for magnetic resonance imaging. The metamaterial is capable of achieving a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio comparable to or surpass that of commercial receive coil arrays in some aspects. More details can be found in article number 2313692.

Highways for Spins
The spins efficiently move on the highways formed by two topological nodal lines in Fe3GaTe2. The brighter, upward, and large arrows indicate the presence of strongly correlated states that can preserve the spins traveling on the highways. In the cover image, Yeongkwan Kim, Myung Joon Han, Heejun Yang, and co&#8208;workers express the flat nodal lines in Fe3GaTe2 by the two straight ways for spins, and the spins' moving on the highways is observed as exceptionally the high anomalous Hall effect in Fe3GaTe2. More details can be found in article number 2402040.

Electromagnetic Navigation Systems for Minimally Invasive Surgery
Magnetic navigation systems (MNSs) are used to precisely manipulate magnetically responsive materials enabling the realization of new minimally invasive procedures. Widespread adoption is currently limited by the size and limits of the current generation of MNSs. In article number 2310701, Simone Gervasoni, Salvador Pan&#233;, Bradley J. Nelson, and co&#8208;workers present a new generation of a human&#8208;scale mobile eMNS, capable of manipulating tethered robotic catheters and untethered magnetic microrobots.

Quantum Materials
Integrating topological materials and high temperature superconductors is critical for new applications. However, merging materials at atomically sharp interfaces presents distinct materials challenges. In article 2401809, Robert G. Moore, Matthew Brahlek, and co&#8208;workers show an unconventional way to enhance superconductivity at epitaxial interfaces between the Bi&#8208;Te topological insulators and Fe(Se,Te), which highlights unusual properties while moving a step closer to the generation of new quantum technologies.

On&#8208;Demand Crack Formation
In article number 2314374, Dong Ki Yoon, Seunghwa Ryu, Soon Mo Park, and their colleagues present a simple method for creating aligned cracks via organic solvent&#8208;induced dehydration on DNA liquid crystal films. The directional fractures result from the anisotropic volume shrinkage of DNA polymers, and this will provide a new platform for patterning applications.

         <title>Visualizing Dynamic Single Atom Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many heterogeneous catalytic processes are key to developing sustainable products and energy. Visualization and analysis of dynamic single atom catalysis provide insights into the processes. The example shows in&#160;situ ESTEM&#8208;HAADF observations of carbon supported platinum catalysts important for fuel cells, revealing single atoms, atom clusters and multiple phases at 400&#160;&#176;C in hydrogen gas. The scale bar is 5&#160;nm.








Abstract
Many industrial chemical processes, including for producing fuels, foods, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and environmental controls, employ heterogeneous solid state catalysts at elevated temperatures in gas or liquid environments. Dynamic reactions at the atomic level play a critical role in catalyst stability and functionality. In situ visualization and analysis of atomic&#8208;scale processes in real time under controlled reaction environments can provide important insights into practical frameworks to improve catalytic processes and materials. This review focuses on innovative real time in situ electron microscopy (EM)&#160;methods, including recent progress in analytical in&#160;situ environmental (scanning) transmission EM (E(STEM), incorporating environmental scanning TEM (ESTEM) and environmental transmission EM (ETEM), with single atom resolution for visualizing and analysing dynamic single atom catalysis under controlled flowing gas reaction environments. ESTEM studies of single atom dynamics of reactions, and of sintering deactivation, contribute to a better&#8208;informed understanding of the yield and stability of catalyst operations. Advances in in situ technologies, including gas and liquid sample holders, nanotomography, and higher voltages, as well as challenges and opportunities in tracking reacting atoms, are highlighted. The findings show that the understanding and application of fundamental processes in catalysis can be improved, with valuable economic, environmental, and societal benefits.

         <title>Breaking the pH Limitation of Nanozymes: Mechanisms, Methods, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic activity of nanozymes is often pH dependent with elusive mechanism. In this review, the pH&#8208;dependent activities of peroxidase&#8208;like, oxidase&#8208;like, and catalase&#8208;like nanozymes are systematically summarized. Moreover, the inner pH&#8208;dependent mechanisms, methods to break through the limitation of catalytic pH, and applications of pH&#8208;independent nanozymes are comprehensively discussed.








Abstract
Although nanozymes have drawn great attention over the past decade, the activities of peroxidase&#8208;like, oxidase&#8208;like, and catalase&#8208;like nanozymes are often pH dependent with elusive mechanism, which largely restricts their application. Therefore, a systematical discussion on the pH&#8208;related catalytic mechanisms of nanozymes together with the methods to overcome this limitation is in need. In this review, various nanozymes exhibiting pH&#8208;dependent catalytic activities are collected and the root causes for their pH dependence are comprehensively analyzed. Subsequently, regulatory concepts including catalytic environment reconstruction and direct catalytic activity improvement to break this pH restriction are summarized. Moreover, applications of pH&#8208;independent nanozymes in sensing, disease therapy, and pollutant degradation are overviewed. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities on the development of pH&#8208;independent nanozymes are suggested. It is anticipated that this review will promote the further design of pH&#8208;independent nanozymes and broaden their application range with higher efficiency.

         <title>4D Printing for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reviews four&#8208;dimensional (4D) (bio&#8208;)printing, highlighting its application in biomedical engineering for developing medical devices (e.g., stents, microneedles (MNs), and implants). It further explores smart biomaterials, external stimuli, and design strategies essential for the success of 4D printing. Additionally, it discusses future research directions, including in vivo tissue regeneration and machine learning&#8208;based modeling to predict the behavior of 4D printed constructs.








Abstract
4D (bio&#8208;)printing endows 3D printed (bio&#8208;)materials with multiple functionalities and dynamic properties. 4D printed materials have been recently used in biomedical engineering for the design and fabrication of biomedical devices, such as stents, occluders, microneedles, smart 3D&#8208;cell engineered microenvironments, drug delivery systems, wound closures, and implantable medical devices. However, the success of 4D printing relies on the rational design of 4D printed objects, the selection of smart materials, and the availability of appropriate types of external (multi&#8208;)stimuli. Here, this work first highlights the different types of smart materials, external stimuli, and design strategies used in 4D (bio&#8208;)printing. Then, it presents a critical review of the biomedical applications of 4D printing and discusses the future directions of biomedical research in this exciting area, including in vivo tissue regeneration studies, the implementation of multiple materials with reversible shape memory behaviors, the creation of fast shape&#8208;transformation responses, the ability to operate at the microscale, untethered activation and control, and the application of (machine learning&#8208;based) modeling approaches to predict the structure&#8211;property and design&#8211;shape transformation relationships of 4D (bio)printed constructs.

         <title>Critical Review of Cu&#8208;Based Hole Transport Materials for Perovskite Solar Cells: From Theoretical Insights to Experimental Validation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;based binary oxides and chalcogenides face narrow bandgap issues. The &#8220;chemical modulation of the valence band&#8221; strategy creates ternary oxides with low mobility and ternary chalcogenides with high mobility but band alignment mismatch with perovskites. Cu&#8208;based halides are good hole&#8208;transporters but unstable. Single&#8208;anion types have limitations; composite anion compounds and mixed&#8208;cation chalcogenides are promising for future research.








Abstract
Despite the remarkable efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), long&#8208;term stability remains the primary barrier to their commercialization. The prospect of enhancing stability by substituting organic transport layers with suitable inorganic compounds, particularly Cu&#8208;based inorganic hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs), holds promise due to their high valence band maximum (VBM) aligning with perovskite characteristics. This review assesses the advantages and disadvantages of these five types of Cu&#8208;based HTMs. Although Cu&#8208;based binary oxides and chalcogenides face narrow bandgap issues, the &#8220;chemical modulation of the valence band&#8221; (CMVB) strategy has successfully broadened the bandgap for Cu&#8208;based ternary oxides and chalcogenides. However, Cu&#8208;based ternary oxides encounter challenges with low mobility, and Cu&#8208;based ternary chalcogenides face mismatches in VBM alignment with perovskites. Cu&#8208;based binary halides, especially CuI, exhibit excellent properties such as wider bandgap, high mobility, and defect tolerance, but their stability remains a concern. These limitations of single anion compounds are insightfully discussed, offering solutions from the perspective of practical application. Future research can focus on Cu&#8208;based composite anion compounds, which merge the advantages of single anion compounds. Additionally, mixed&#8208;cation chalcogenides such as CuxM1&#8722;xS enable the customization of HTM properties by selecting and adjusting the proportions of cation M.

Cu-based halides are good hole-transporters but unstable. Single-anion types have limitations; composite anion compounds and mixed-cation chalcogenides are promising for future research.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the remarkable efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), long-term stability remains the primary barrier to their commercialization. The prospect of enhancing stability by substituting organic transport layers with suitable inorganic compounds, particularly Cu-based inorganic hole-transport materials (HTMs), holds promise due to their high valence band maximum (VBM) aligning with perovskite characteristics. This review assesses the advantages and disadvantages of these five types of Cu-based HTMs. Although Cu-based binary oxides and chalcogenides face narrow bandgap issues, the &#8220;chemical modulation of the valence band&#8221; (CMVB) strategy has successfully broadened the bandgap for Cu-based ternary oxides and chalcogenides. However, Cu-based ternary oxides encounter challenges with low mobility, and Cu-based ternary chalcogenides face mismatches in VBM alignment with perovskites. Cu-based binary halides, especially CuI, exhibit excellent properties such as wider bandgap, high mobility, and defect tolerance, but their stability remains a concern. These limitations of single anion compounds are insightfully discussed, offering solutions from the perspective of practical application. Future research can focus on Cu-based composite anion compounds, which merge the advantages of single anion compounds. Additionally, mixed-cation chalcogenides such as Cu&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;x&lt;/sub&gt;S enable the customization of HTM properties by selecting and adjusting the proportions of cation M.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The topics covered include material properties, functional integration, and applications. The current application status and future development directions and challenges of e&#8208;skin in the field of health monitoring are discussed.








Abstract
Electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), a skin&#8208;like wearable electronic device, holds great promise in the fields of telemedicine and personalized healthcare because of its good flexibility, biocompatibility, skin conformability, and sensing performance. E&#8208;skin can monitor various health indicators of the human body in real time and over the long term, including physical indicators (exercise, respiration, blood pressure, etc.) and chemical indicators (saliva, sweat, urine, etc.). In recent years, the development of various materials, analysis, and manufacturing technologies has promoted significant development of e&#8208;skin, laying the foundation for the application of next&#8208;generation wearable medical technologies and devices. Herein, the properties required for e&#8208;skin health monitoring devices to achieve long&#8208;term and precise monitoring and summarize several detectable indicators in the health monitoring field are discussed. Subsequently, the applications of integrated e&#8208;skin health monitoring systems are reviewed. Finally, current challenges and future development directions in this field are discussed. This review is expected to generate great interest and inspiration for the development and improvement of e&#8208;skin and health monitoring systems.

         <title>Toward Durable CO2 Electroreduction with Cu&#8208;Based Catalysts via Understanding Their Deactivation Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review article, factors contributing to the gradual loss of performance in copper&#8208;based, ambient temperature CO2 electrochemical reduction systems are summarized into generalized deactivation modes that are applicable to other systems. Fundamental principles and mitigation strategies to each deactivation mode are discussed based on recent in situ/operando characterization studies in structure&#8208; and composition&#8208;activity relationship.








Abstract
The technology of CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ER) provides a means to convert CO2, a waste greenhouse gas, into value&#8208;added chemicals. Copper is the most studied element that is capable of catalyzing CO2ER to obtain multicarbon products, such as ethylene, ethanol, acetate, etc., at an appreciable rate. Under the operating condition of CO2ER, the catalytic performance of Cu decays because of several factors that alters the surface properties of Cu. In this review, these factors that cause the degradation of Cu&#8208;based CO2ER catalysts are categorized into generalized deactivation modes, that are applicable to all electrocatalytic systems. The fundamental principles of each deactivation mode and the associated effects of each on Cu&#8208;based catalysts are discussed in detail. Structure&#8208; and composition&#8208;activity relationship developed from recent in situ/operando characterization studies are presented as evidence of related deactivation modes in operation. With the aim to address these deactivation modes, catalyst design and reaction environment engineering rationales are suggested. Finally, perspectives and remarks built upon the recent advances in CO2ER are provided in attempts to improve the durability of CO2ER catalysts.

         <title>What Matters for the Charge Transport of 2D Perovskites?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review first comprehensively analyzes the factors influencing the charge transport properties of 2D perovskites from four key aspects. It then consolidates and compares the common transport testing methods for 2D perovskites, followed by investigating strategies to enhance charge transport properties from a compositional approach.








Abstract
Compared to 3D perovskites, 2D perovskites exhibit excellent stability, structural diversity, and tunable bandgaps, making them highly promising for applications in solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and photodetectors. However, the trade&#8208;off for worse charge transport is a critical issue that needs to be addressed. This comprehensive review first discusses the structure of 3D and 2D metal halide perovskites, then summarizes the significant factors influencing charge transport in detail and provides a brief overview of the testing methods. Subsequently, various strategies to improve the charge transport are presented, including tuning A&#8242;&#8208;site organic spacer cations, A&#8208;site cations, B&#8208;site metal cations, and X&#8208;site halide ions. Finally, an outlook on the future development of improving the 2D perovskites&#8217; charge transport is discussed.

         <title>Beyond Lipids: Exploring Advances in Polymeric Gene Delivery in the Lipid Nanoparticles Era</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent surge in lipid popularity, driven by approval of lipid nanoparticle vaccines, overshadows polymers as gene delivery vectors. Nonetheless, polymeric systems are advancing in clinical trials, with multiple early&#8208;stage companies actively developing them. This review highlights advances in polymer design for gene delivery via polyplexes and covalent polymer&#8208;nucleic acid conjugates, and briefly covers novel computational techniques for improved design.








Abstract
The recent success of gene therapy during the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has underscored the importance of effective and safe delivery systems. Complementing lipid&#8208;based delivery systems, polymers present a promising alternative for gene delivery. Significant advances have been made in the recent past, with multiple clinical trials progressing beyond phase I and several companies actively working on polymeric delivery systems which provides assurance that polymeric carriers can soon achieve clinical translation. The massive advantage of structural tunability and vast chemical space of polymers is being actively leveraged to mitigate shortcomings of traditional polycationic polymers and improve the translatability of delivery systems. Tailored polymeric approaches for diverse nucleic acids and for specific subcellular targets are now being designed to improve therapeutic efficacy. This review describes the recent advances in polymer design for improved gene delivery by polyplexes and covalent polymer&#8208;nucleic acid conjugates. The review also offers a brief note on novel computational techniques for improved polymer design. The review concludes with an overview of the current state of polymeric gene therapies in the clinic as well as future directions on their translation to the clinic.

         <title>Transparent Recombination Layers Design and Rational Characterizations for Efficient Two&#8208;Terminal Perovskite&#8208;Based Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent recombination layers for two&#8208;terminal perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells are reviewed, including their fundamental functions, photophysical mechanisms, working principles, requirements, and characterization methods. Existing challenges and future perspectives for research in this promising field are also presented.








Abstract
Two&#8208;terminal (2T) perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells (TSCs) arouse burgeoning interest in breaking the Shockley&#8211;Queisser (S&#8211;Q) limit of single&#8208;junction solar cells by combining two subcells with different bandgaps. However, the highest certified efficiency of 2T perovskite&#8208;based TSCs (33.9%) lags behind the theoretical limit (42&#8211;43%). A vital challenge limiting the development of 2T perovskite&#8208;based TSCs is the transparent recombination layers/interconnecting layers (RLs) design between two subcells. To improve the performance of 2T perovskite&#8208;based TSCs, RLs simultaneously fulfill the optical loss, contact resistance, carrier mobility, stress management, and conformal coverage requirements. In this review, the definition, functions, and requirements of RLs in 2T perovskite&#8208;based TSCs are presented. The insightful characterization methods applicable to RLs, which are inspiring for further research on the RLs both in 2T perovskite&#8208;based two&#8208;junction and multi&#8208;junction TSCs, are also highlighted. Finally, the key factors that currently limit the performance enhancement of RLs and the future directions that should be continuously focused on are summarized.

     alt="Transparent Recombination Layers Design and Rational Characterizations for Efficient Two-Terminal Perovskite-Based Tandem Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparent recombination layers for two-terminal perovskite-based tandem solar cells are reviewed, including their fundamental functions, photophysical mechanisms, working principles, requirements, and characterization methods. Existing challenges and future perspectives for research in this promising field are also presented.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-terminal (2T) perovskite-based tandem solar cells (TSCs) arouse burgeoning interest in breaking the Shockley&#8211;Queisser (S&#8211;Q) limit of single-junction solar cells by combining two subcells with different bandgaps. However, the highest certified efficiency of 2T perovskite-based TSCs (33.9%) lags behind the theoretical limit (42&#8211;43%). A vital challenge limiting the development of 2T perovskite-based TSCs is the transparent recombination layers/interconnecting layers (RLs) design between two subcells. To improve the performance of 2T perovskite-based TSCs, RLs simultaneously fulfill the optical loss, contact resistance, carrier mobility, stress management, and conformal coverage requirements. In this review, the definition, functions, and requirements of RLs in 2T perovskite-based TSCs are presented. The insightful characterization methods applicable to RLs, which are inspiring for further research on the RLs both in 2T perovskite-based two-junction and multi-junction TSCs, are also highlighted. Finally, the key factors that currently limit the performance enhancement of RLs and the future directions that should be continuously focused on are summarized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advances in Mixed Tin&#8208;Lead Narrow&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites for Single&#8208;Junction and All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the development of tin&#8208;lead perovskites and their applications in single&#8208;junction and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. The fundamental structural and optoelectronic properties of tin&#8208;lead perovskites and the recent advances with various approaches covering additives, solvents, interfaces, perovskite growth, and charge transport materials are discussed. The challenges and strategies for further development are also provided.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic metal&#8208;halide perovskites have received great attention for photovoltaic (PV) applications owing to their superior optoelectronic properties and the unprecedented performance development. For single&#8208;junction PV devices, although lead (Pb)&#8208;based perovskite solar cells have achieved 26.1% efficiency, the mixed tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites offer more ideal bandgap tuning capability to enable an even higher performance. The Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite (with a bandgap tuned to &#8776;1.2&#160;eV) is also attractive as the bottom subcell for a tandem configuration to further surpass the Shockley&#8211;Queisser radiative limit for the single&#8208;junction devices. The performance of the all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells has gained rapid development and achieved a certified efficiency up to 29.1%. In this article, the properties and recent development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mixed Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites and their application in single&#8208;junction and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells are reviewed. Recent advances in various approaches covering additives, solvents, interfaces, and perovskite growth are highlighted. The authors also provide the perspective and outlook on the challenges and strategies for further development of mixed Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites in both efficiency and stability for PV applications.

         <title>Organic Crystals and Optical Functions in Biology: Knowns and Unknowns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystals composed of organic molecules, mainly purines and pteridines, are produced by organisms to fulfill optical functions. Four levels of organization, molecular, structural, morphological, and superstructural, are examined to understand the optical, chemical, and biological principles of how such crystal assemblies manipulate light. This understanding may provide inspiration for new materials with tailor&#8208;made optical performance.








Abstract
Organic crystals are widely used by animals to manipulate light for producing structural colors and for improving vision. To date only seven crystal types are known to be used, and among them &#946;&#8208;guanine crystals are by far the most widespread. The fact that almost all these crystals have unusually high refractive indices (RIs) is consistent with their light manipulation function. Here, the physical, structural, and optical principles of how light interacts with the polarizable free&#8208;electron&#8208;rich environment of these quasiaromatic molecules are addressed. How the organization of these molecules into crystalline arrays introduces optical anisotropy and finally how organisms control crystal morphology and superstructural organization to optimize functions in light reflection and scattering are also discussed. Many open questions remain in this fascinating field, some of which arise out of this in&#8208;depth analysis of the interaction of light with crystal arrays. More types of organic crystals will probably be discovered, as well as other organisms that use these crystals to manipulate light. The insights gained from biological systems can also be harnessed for improving synthetic light&#8208;manipulating materials.

         <title>Ultrafast Metaphotonic PCR Chip with Near&#8208;Perfect Absorber</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metasurface&#8208;based, efficient, and low&#8208;cost photonic PCR device using a titanium nitride&#8208;based broadband meta&#8208;absorber is proposed by providing rapid heating and cooling, resulting in ultrafast DNA amplification within 6&#160;min 30 s using a compact single infrared LED. The meta&#8208;absorber is fabricated using cost&#8208;effective colloidal lithography on a 6&#8208;inch Si wafer, enabling mass production for applying photonic PCR for POC diagnosis.








Abstract
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the gold standard for nucleic acid amplification and quantification in diverse fields such as life sciences, global health, medicine, agricultural science, forensic science, and environmental science for global sustainability. However, implementing a cost&#8208;effective PCR remains challenging for rapid preventive medical action to the widespread pandemic diseases due to the absence of highly efficient and low&#8208;cost PCR chip&#8208;based POC molecular diagnostics. Here, this work reports an ultrafast metaphotonic PCR chip as a solution of a cost&#8208;effective and low&#8208;power&#8208;consumption POC device for the emerging global challenge of sustainable healthcare. This work designs a near&#8208;perfect photonic meta&#8208;absorber using ring&#8208;shaped titanium nitride to maximize the photothermal effect and realize rapid heating and cooling cycles during the PCR process. This work fabricates a large&#8208;area photonic meta&#8208;absorber on a 6&#8208;inch wafer cost&#8208;effectively using simple colloidal lithography. In addition, this work demonstrates 30 thermocycles from 65 (annealing temperature) to 95&#160;&#176;C (denaturation temperature) within 3&#160;min 15&#160;s, achieving an average 16.66&#160;&#176;C&#160;s&#8722;1 heating rate and 7.77&#160;&#176;C&#160;s&#8722;1 cooling rate during thermocycling, succeeding rapid metaphotonic PCR. This work believes a metaphotonic PCR chip can be used to create a low&#8208;cost, ultrafast molecular diagnostic chip with a meta&#8208;absorber.

         <title>Conductive Zeolite Supported Indium&#8211;Tin Alloy Nanoclusters for Selective and Scalable Formic Acid Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative electrically conductive zeolite is designed as a favorable electrocatalytic support, which impregnates ultrasmall In0.2Sn0.8 alloy nanoclusters into the supercages of 12&#8208;ring framework with tunable electronic and geometric metal&#8211;support interactions, achieving industrial&#8208;level formic acid electrosynthesis from CO2 electrolysis and opening a new era of zeolites in applications of electrocatalysis and energy conversion.








Abstract
Upgrading excess CO2 toward the electrosynthesis of formic acid is of significant research and commercial interest. However, simultaneously achieving high selectivity and industrially relevant current densities of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion remains a grand challenge for practical implementations. Here, an electrically conductive zeolite support is strategically designed by implanting Sn ions into the skeleton structure of a zeolite Y, which impregnates ultrasmall In0.2Sn0.8 alloy nanoclusters into the supercages of the tailored 12&#8208;ring framework. The prominent electronic and geometric interactions between In0.2Sn0.8 nanoalloy and zeolite support lead to the delocalization of electron density that enhances orbital hybridizations between In active site and *OCHO intermediate. Thus, the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;limiting *OCHO formation step is reduced, facilitating the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid. Accordingly, the developed zeolite electrocatalyst achieves an industrial&#8208;level partial current density of 322&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 98.2% for formate production and stably maintains Faradaic efficiency above 93% at an industrially relevant current density for over 102 h. This work opens up new opportunities of conductive zeolite&#8208;based electrocatalysts for industrial&#8208;level formic acid electrosynthesis from CO2 electrolysis and toward practically accessible electrocatalysis and energy conversion.

         <title>Versatile Method of Engineering the Band Alignment and the Electron Wavefunction Hybridization of Hybrid Quantum Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The versatile approach is fully compatible with the lithography processes to create an atomically connected interface and effectively modulate the band alignment at the interface. This method is also generic for other materials and will ultimately result in the desirable requirements for topological and Andreev devices.








Abstract
Hybrid devices that combine superconductors (S) and semiconductors (Sm) have attracted great attention due to the integration of the properties of both materials, which relies on the interface details and the resulting coupling strength and wavefunction hybridization. However, until now, none of the experiments have reported good control of the band alignment of the interface, as well as its tunability to the coupling and hybridization. Here, the interface is modified by inducing specific argon milling while maintaining its high quality, e.g., atomic connection, which results in a large induced superconducting gap and ballistic transport. By comparing with Schr&#246;dinger&#8211;Poisson calculations, it is proven that this method can vary the band bending/coupling strength and the electronic spatial distribution. In the strong coupling regime, the coexistence and tunability of crossed Andreev reflection and elastic co&#8208;tunneling&#8212;key ingredients for the Kitaev chain&#8212;are confirmed. This method is also generic for other materials and achieves a hard and huge superconducting gap in lead and indium antimonide nanowire (Pb&#8208;InSb) devices. Such a versatile method, compatible with the standard fabrication process and accompanied by the well&#8208;controlled modification of the interface, will definitely boost the creation of more sophisticated hybrid devices for exploring physics in solid&#8208;state systems.

         <title>Colossal Near&#8208;Field Radiative Heat Transfer Mediated by Coupled Polaritons with an Ultrahigh Dynamic Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large&#8208;area device near&#8208;field thermal radiation measurement system with in situ adjustable vacuum gap distances down to &lt;100&#160;nm is successfully established. The radiative thermal conductance and effective gap heat transfer coefficient of near&#8208;field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) can reach unprecedented values with the help of coupled polaritons. The dynamic regulation of NFRHT can be achieved by modulating the strong coupling effect.








Abstract
Near&#8208;field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) can exceed the blackbody limit by several orders of magnitude owing to the tunneling evanescent waves. Exploiting this near&#8208;field enhancement holds significant potential for emerging technologies. It has been suggested that coupled polaritons can give rise to orders of magnitude enhancement of NFRHT. However, a thorough experimental verification of this phenomenon is still missing. Here this work experimentally shows that NFRHT mediated by coupled polaritons in millimeter&#8208;size graphene/SiC/SiO2 composite devices in planar plate configuration can realize about 302.8 &#177; &#8197;35.2&#8208;fold enhancement with respect to the blackbody limit at a gap distance of 87&#8197; &#177; &#8197;0.8&#160;nm. The radiative thermal conductance and effective gap heat transfer coefficient can reach unprecedented values of 0.136 WK&#8722;1 and 5440 Wm&#8722;2K&#8722;1. Additionally, a scattering&#8208;type scanning near&#8208;field optical measurement, in conjunction with full&#8208;wave numerical simulations, provides further evidence for the coupled polaritonic characteristics of the devices. Notably, this work experimentally demonstrates dynamic regulation of NFRHT can be achieved by modulating the bias voltage, leading to an ultrahigh dynamic range of &#8776;4.115. This work ambiguously elucidates the important role of coupled polaritons in NFRHT, paving the way for the manipulation of nanoscale heat transport, energy conversion, and thermal computing via the strong coupling effect.

         <title>Photocontrolled Reversible Solid&#8208;Fluid Transitions of Azopolymer Nanocomposites for Intelligent Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer nanocomposites with photocontrolled reversible solid&#8208;fluid transitions are designed and used for the construction of intelligent nanomaterials. Photocontrolled reversible solid&#8208;fluid transitions enable the solvent&#8208;free processing and reconfiguration of nanocomposites at room temperature, which represent an innovative strategy for the development of intelligent materials with responsive, rewritable, error&#8208;correctable, and dynamic properties.








Abstract
Intelligent polymer nanocomposites are multicomponent and multifunctional materials that show immense potential across diverse applications. However, to exhibit intelligent traits such as adaptability, reconfigurability and dynamic properties, these materials often require a solvent or heating environment to facilitate the mobility of polymer chains and nanoparticles, rendering their applications in everyday settings impractical. Here intelligent azopolymer nanocomposites that function effectively in a solvent&#8208;free, room&#8208;temperature environment based on photocontrolled reversible solid&#8208;fluid transitions via switching flow temperatures (Tfs) are shown. A range of nanocomposites is synthesized through the grafting of Au nanoparticles, Au nanorods, quantum dots, or superparamagnetic nanoparticles with photoresponsive azopolymers. Leveraging the reversible cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization of azo groups, the azopolymer nanocomposites transition between solid (Tf above room temperature) and fluid (Tf below room temperature) states. Such photocontrolled reversible solid&#8208;fluid transitions empower the rewriting of nanopatterns, correction of nanoscale defects, reconfiguration of complex multiscale structures, and design of intelligent optical devices. These findings highlight Tf&#8208;switchable polymer nanocomposites as promising candidates for the development of intelligent nanomaterials operative in solvent&#8208;free, room&#8208;temperature conditions.

         <title>Highly Robust and Self&#8208;Adhesive Soft Strain Gauge via Interface Design Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multilayer soft strain gauges with strong and tough interfacial interactions are designed. Stable interface connections within the soft strain gauge allow for both high performance strain sensing and excellent mechanical/electrical robustness. The soft strain gauge's self&#8208;adhesive layer ensures seamless integration into complex dynamic surfaces for stable and fidelity signal acquisition.








Abstract
Highly robust soft strain gauges are rapidly emerging as a promising candidate in the fields of vital signs and machine conditions monitoring. However, it is still a key challenge to achieve high&#8208;performance strain sensing in these sensors with mechanical/electrical robustness for long&#8208;term usage. The multilayer structural design of sensors enhances sensing performance while the interfacial connection of heterogeneous materials between different layers is weak. Herein, inspired by the efficient perception mechanism of scorpion slit sensilla with tough interface interconnections, the synergy of ultra&#8208;high electrical performance and mechanical robustness is successfully achieved via interface design engineering. The developed multilayer soft strain gauge (MSSG) exhibits a strain sensitivity beyond 105, a lower detection limit of 8.3&#160;&#181;m, a frequency resolution within 0.1&#160;Hz, and cyclic stability over 63&#160;000 strain cycles. Also, the tough interface improves the level of heterogeneous integration in the MSSG which allows to endure different stresses. Furthermore, an MSSG&#8208;based wireless strain monitoring system is developed that enables applications on different complex dynamic surfaces, including accurate identification of human throat activity and monitoring of rolling bearing conditions.

         <title>Rational Design of Earth&#8208;Abundant Catalysts toward Sustainability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalysts are vital for clean energy and green chemistry but often rely on expensive metals. This review highlights advancements in earth&#8208;abundant catalysts, focusing on innovative strategies, including descriptor&#8208;guided design, high&#8208;throughput calculation, machine learning, and biomimetic design. It provides a roadmap for high&#8208;performance catalyst development toward sustainability, discussing fundamental principles, current challenges, and outlook.








Abstract
Catalysis is crucial for clean energy, green chemistry, and environmental remediation, but traditional methods rely on expensive and scarce precious metals. This review addresses this challenge by highlighting the promise of earth&#8208;abundant catalysts and the recent advancements in their rational design. Innovative strategies such as physics&#8208;inspired descriptors, high&#8208;throughput computational techniques, and artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;assisted design with machine learning (ML) are explored, moving beyond time&#8208;consuming trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approaches. Additionally, biomimicry, inspired by efficient enzymes in nature, offers valuable insights. This review systematically analyses these design strategies, providing a roadmap for developing high&#8208;performance catalysts from abundant elements. Clean energy applications (water splitting, fuel cells, batteries) and green chemistry (ammonia synthesis, CO2 reduction) are targeted while delving into the fundamental principles, biomimetic approaches, and current challenges in this field. The way to a more sustainable future is paved by overcoming catalyst scarcity through rational design.

         <title>Ultrafast Electron&#8208;Transfer Via Hybrid States at Perovskite/Fullerene Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With two&#8208;photon photoelectron spectroscopy, ultrafast electron&#8208;transfer of &#8776;100&#160;fs is observed between perovskite and fullerene. The timescale is comparable with hot&#8208;electron cooling inside perovskite, leading to efficient electron&#8208;transfer overcoming an unfavorable energy&#8208;level alignment. The process is achieved with the assistance of interfacial hybrid states, which originate from strong electronic coupling. This finding provides new guidelines for advanced device design.








Abstract
Interfacial charge&#8208;transfer between perovskite and charge&#8208;transport layers plays a key role in determining performance of perovskite solar cells. The conventional viewpoint emphases the necessity of favorable energy&#8208;level alignment of the two components. In recent reports, efficient electron&#8208;transfer is observed from perovskite to fullerene&#8208;based electron&#8208;transport layers even when there are unfavorable energy&#8208;level alignments, but the mechanism is still unclear. Here, using an ultrafast in situ two&#8208;photon photoelectron spectroscopy, real&#8208;time observations of electron&#8208;transfer processes at CsPbI3/C60 interface in both temporal and energetic dimensions are reported. Due to strong electronic coupling, a large amount of interfacial hybrid states is generated at the interfaces, aiding fast photoinduced electron&#8208;transfer in &#8776;124&#160;fs. This process is further verified by nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations and transient absorption experiments. The short timescale explains why electron&#8208;transfer can overcome unfavorable energy&#8208;level alignments, providing a guideline for device design.

         <title>Tailoring Interfacial Structures to Regulate Carrier Transport in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (SSLIBs) are prioritized for next&#8208;generation energy storage. However, numerous solid&#8208;solid interfaces present challenges that hinder their development. This review focuses on electron and lithium&#8208;ion transport mechanisms at these interfaces and summarizes interface modification strategies. By correlating carrier transport networks with battery performance, design principles are outlined for achieving selective carrier transport to better guide future practical applications.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (SSLIBs) have been considered as the priority candidate for next&#8208;generation energy storage system, due to their advantages in safety and energy density compare with conventional liquid electrolyte systems. However, the introduction of numerous solid&#8208;solid interfaces results in a series of issues, hindering the further development of SSLIBs. Therefore, a thorough understanding on the interfacial issues is essential to promote the practical applications for SSLIBs. In this review, the interface issues are discussed from the perspective of transportation mechanism of electrons and lithium ions, including internal interfaces within cathode/anode composites and solid electrolytes (SEs), as well as the apparent electrode/SEs interfaces. The corresponding interface modification strategies, such as passivation layer design, conductive binders, and thermal sintering methods, are comprehensively summarized. Through establishing the correlation between carrier transport network and corresponding battery electrochemical performance, the design principles for achieving a selective carrier transport network are systematically elucidated. Additionally, the future challenges are speculated and research directions in tailoring interfacial structure for SSLIBs. By providing the insightful review and outlook on interfacial charge transfer, the industrialization of SSLIBs are aimed to promoted.

         <title>Stable and Highly Emissive Infrared Yb&#8208;Doped Perovskite Quantum Cutters Engineered by Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents stable, highly emissive Yb&#8208;doped perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) synthesized with zwitterionic C3&#8208;sulfobetaine ligands through a novel method. The Yb&#8208;doped NCs, optimized by machine learning, achieved an infrared photoluminescence quantum yield of 190% approaching the quantum cutting limit. They also exhibit exceptional long&#8208;term stability against heat, humidity, and light, indicating their potential for fundamental research and practical applications.








Abstract
Quantum cutting (QC) allows the conversion of high&#8208;energy photons into lower&#8208;energy photons, exhibiting great potential for infrared communications. Yb&#8208;doped perovskite nanocrystals can achieve an efficient QC process with extremely high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) thanks to the favorable Yb3+ incorporation in the perovskite structure. However, conventionally used oleic acid&#8211;oleylamine&#8208;based ligand pairs cause instability issues due to highly dynamic binding to surface states that have curbed their potential applications. Herein, zwitterionic type C3&#8208;sulfobetaine 3&#8208;(N,N&#8208;Dimethylpalmitylammonio)propanesulfonate molecule is utilized to build a strong binding state on the nanocrystals&#8217; surface through a new phosphine oxide synthesis route. Leveraging machine learning and Bayesian Optimization workflow to determine optimal synthesis conditions, near&#8208;infrared PLQY above 190% is achieved. The high PLQY is well maintained after over three months of aging, under high&#8208;flux continuous UV irradiation, and long continuous annealing. This is the first report of highly efficient and stable perovskite quantum cutters, which will drive the study of fundamental physics phenomena and near&#8208;infrared quantum communications.

         <title>Approaching Splendid Catalysts for Li&#8211;CO2 Battery from the Theory to Practical Designing: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8211;CO2 batteries are new promising energy storage technologies of the next generation. In order to design splendid catalysts for practical Li&#8211;CO2 battery, this review summarizes the possible Li&#8211;CO2 energy storage mechanisms and the advance of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries in terms of composition, geometry, and phase. Ways toward practical applications are also presented for the first time.








Abstract
Lithium carbon dioxide (Li&#8211;CO2) batteries, noted for their high discharge voltage of approximately 2.8&#160;V and substantial theoretical specific energy of 1876&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, represent a promising avenue for new energy sources and CO2 emission reduction. However, the practical application of these batteries faces significant hurdles, particularly at high current densities and over extended cycle lives, due to their complex reaction mechanisms and slow kinetics. This paper delves into the recent advancements in cathode catalysts for Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, with a specific focus on the designing philosophy from composition, geometry, and homogeneity of the catalysts to the proper test conditions and real&#8208;world application. It surveys the possible catalytic mechanisms, giving readers a brief introduction of how the energy is stored and released as well as the critical exploration of the relationship between material properties and performances. Specifically, optimization and standardization of test conditions for Li&#8211;CO2 battery research is highlighted to enhance data comparability, which is also critical to facilitate the practical application of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. This review aims to bring up inspiration from previous work to advance the design of more effective and sustainable cathode catalysts, tailored to meet the practical demands of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Near Infrared&#8208;Fluorescent Dinuclear Iridium(III) Nanoparticles for Immunogenic Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasound&#8208;triggered, near&#8208;infrared fluorescent dinuclear iridium(III) nanoparticle, NanoIr, is reported to precisely and spatiotemporally generate reactive oxygen species for immunogenic sonodynamic therapy. Upon exposure to ultrasound irradiation, NanoIr inhibits tumor growth in CT26 tumor&#8208;bearing mice and elicits synergistic effects with the clinically approved chemotherapy drug cisplatin in patient&#8208;derived xenograft models of ovarian cancer.








Abstract
Dinuclear iridium(III) complexes activated by light&#8208;inducible spatiotemporal control are emerging as promising candidates for cancer therapy. However, broader applications of current light&#8208;activated dinuclear iridium(III) complexes are limited by the ineffective tissue penetration and undesirable feedback on guidance activation. Here, an ultrasound (US) triggered near infrared&#8208;fluorescent dinuclear iridium(III) nanoparticle, NanoIr, is first reported to precisely and spatiotemporally inhibit tumor growth. It is demonstrated that reactive oxygen species can be generated by NanoIr upon exposure to US irradiation (NanoIr + US), thereby inducing immunogenic cell death. When combined with cisplatin, NanoIr + US elicits synergistic effects in patient&#8208;derived tumor xenograft mice models of ovarian cancer. This work first provides a design of dinuclear iridium(III) nanoparticles for immunogenic sonodynamic therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dinuclear iridium(III) complexes activated by light-inducible spatiotemporal control are emerging as promising candidates for cancer therapy. However, broader applications of current light-activated dinuclear iridium(III) complexes are limited by the ineffective tissue penetration and undesirable feedback on guidance activation. Here, an ultrasound (US) triggered near infrared-fluorescent dinuclear iridium(III) nanoparticle, NanoIr, is first reported to precisely and spatiotemporally inhibit tumor growth. It is demonstrated that reactive oxygen species can be generated by NanoIr upon exposure to US irradiation (NanoIr + US), thereby inducing immunogenic cell death. When combined with cisplatin, NanoIr + US elicits synergistic effects in patient-derived tumor xenograft mice models of ovarian cancer. This work first provides a design of dinuclear iridium(III) nanoparticles for immunogenic sonodynamic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Confining Iodine into Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Derived Metal&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Carbon for Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design of several Zn&#8208;MOFs is adopted for obtaining porous carbon materials. Moreover, iron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon materials, featuring atomic Fe coordinated to nitrogen atoms, are further prepared and utilized as efficient cathode hosts for aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. The wearable microbattery application offers insights for future developments in long&#8208;lasting aqueous battery designs.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (AZIBs) are highly appealing for energy requirements owing to their safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and scalability. However, the inadequate redox kinetics and severe shuttling effect of polyiodide ions impede their commercial viability. Herein, several Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;derived porous carbon materials are designed, and the further preparation of iron&#8211;doped porous carbon (Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C, M9) with varied Fe doping contents is optimized based on a facile self&#8208;assembly/carbonization approach. M9, with atomic Fe coordinated to nitrogen atoms, is employed as an efficient cathode host for AZIBs. Functional modifications of porous carbon hosts involving the doping species and levels are investigated. The adsorption tests, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and in situ UV&#8211;vis results demonstrate the adsorption capability and charge&#8208;discharge mechanism for the iodine species. Furthermore, experimental findings and theoretical analyses have proven that the redox conversion of iodine is enhanced through a physicochemical confinement effect. This study offers basic principles for the strategic design of single&#8208;atom dispersed carbon as an iodine host for high&#8208;performance AZIBs. Flexible soft&#8211;pack battery and wearable microbattery applications also have implications for future long&#8208;life aqueous battery designs.

         <title>Constructing Slip Stacking Diversity in Van der Waals Homobilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diversified thermodynamically advantageous slip stackings with angstrom&#8208;scale structural discrepancies are constructed in low&#8208;symmetry van der Waals homobilayers via direct growth. Modulation strategies to switch the stacking via grain boundaries and to expand the slip stacking library from thermodynamic to kinetically favored structures via in situ thermal treatment are developed. The work unveils a unique epitaxy and offers a viable means for manipulating interlayer atomic registries.








Abstract
The van der Waals (vdW) interface provides two important degrees of freedom&#8212;twist and slip&#8212;to tune interlayer structures and inspire unique physics. However, constructing diversified high&#8208;quality slip stackings (i.e., lattice orientations between layers are parallel with only interlayer sliding) is more challenging than twisted stackings due to angstrom&#8208;scale structural discrepancies between different slip stackings, sparsity of thermodynamically stable candidates and insufficient mechanism understanding. Here, using transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayers as a model system, this work theoretically elucidates that vdW materials with low lattice symmetry and weak interlayer coupling allow the creation of multifarious thermodynamically advantageous slip stackings, and experimentally achieves&#160;13 and 9 slip stackings in 1T&#8243;&#8208;ReS2 and 1T&#8243;&#8208;ReSe2 bilayers via direct growth, which are systematically revealed by atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), angle&#8208;resolved polarization Raman spectroscopy, and second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements. This work also develops modulation strategies to switch the stacking via grain boundaries (GBs) and to expand the slip stacking library from thermodynamic to kinetically favored structures via in situ thermal treatment. Finally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest a prominent dependence of the pressure&#8208;induced electronic band structure transition on stacking configurations. These studies unveil a unique vdW epitaxy and offer a viable means for manipulating interlayer atomic registries.

         <title>Soft, Tough, Antifatigue Fracture Elastomer Composites with Low Thermal Resistance through Synergistic Crack Pinning and Interfacial Slippage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft, extreme fracture tough and antifatigue fracture polydimethylsiloxane/aluminum elastomer composite is developed by optimizing the dangling chains and spherical aluminum fillers, resulting in the combined effects of crack pinning and interfacial slippage. The elastomer composite also maintains low thermal resistance, which makes it highly promising for thermal interface applications in heat dissipation of electronic devices.








Abstract
Soft elastomer composites are promising functional materials for engineer interfaces, where the miniaturized electronic devices have triggered increasing demand for effective heat dissipation, high fracture energy, and antifatigue fracture. However, such a combination of these properties can be rarely met in the same elastomer composites simultaneously. Here a strategy is presented to fabricate a soft, extreme fracture tough (3316&#160;J m&#8722;2) and antifatigue fracture (1052.56&#160;J m&#8315;2) polydimethylsiloxane/aluminum elastomer composite. These outstanding properties are achieved by optimizing the dangling chains and spherical aluminum fillers, resulting in the combined effects of crack pinning and interfacial slippage. The dangling chains that lengthen the polymer chains between cross&#8208;linked points pin the cracks and the rigid fillers obstruct the cracks, enhancing the energy per unit area needed for fatigue failure. The dangling chains also promote polymer/filler interfacial slippage, enabling effective deflection and blunting of an advancing crack tip, thus enhancing mechanical energy dissipation. Moreover, the elastomer composite exhibits low thermal resistance (&#8776;0.12&#160;K cm2 W&#8722;1), due to the formation of a thermally conductive network. These remarkable characteristics render this elastomer composite promising for application as a thermal interface material in electronic devices.

         <title>Pyroptotic&#8208;Spatiotemporally Selective Delivery of siRNA against Pyroptosis and Autoimmune Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precision delivery and release of siRNA to inflamed tissue and immune cells could unleash its full therapeutic potential in autoimmune diseases. A pyroptotic&#8208;spatiotemporally selective siRNA delivery system (PMRC@siGSDME) selectively targets inflammatory tissues, responds to pyrotosis, and exhibits therapeutic efficacy against various autoimmune diseases.








Abstract
Small&#8208;interfering RNAs (siRNAs) offer promising prospects for treating pyroptosis&#8208;related autoimmune diseases. However, poor stability and off&#8208;target effects during in vivo transportation hinder their practical clinical applications. Precision delivery and adaptive release of siRNAs into inflamed tissues and immune cells could unleash their full therapeutic potential. This study establishes a pyroptotic&#8208;spatiotemporally selective siRNA delivery system (PMRC@siGSDME) that selectively targets inflammatory tissues, responds to pyroptosis, and exhibits remarkable therapeutic efficacy against various autoimmune diseases. Novel hybrid nanovesicles (NVs) are designed as a combination of pyroptotic macrophage membranes (PMs) and R8&#8208;cardiolipin&#8208;containing nanovesicles (RC&#8208;NVs). Evidence provides that PM&#8208;derived proteins involved in cell&#8211;cell interactions and membrane trafficking may contribute to the specificity of NVs to inflammatory tissue. In addition, cardiolipin anchored in the hybrid NVs increases its affinity for activated gasdermin E (GSDME) and achieves pyroptosis&#8208;adaptive release of siGSDME for the spatiotemporally selective suppression of immune responses. More importantly, PMRC@siGSDME displays significant anti&#8208;inflammatory and therapeutic effects in multiple mouse autoimmune disease models, including arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Collectively, an innovative siRNA delivery strategy precisely tailored for pyroptotic cells has been developed, paving the way for new treatments for autoimmune inflammatory diseases with minimal side effects and wide clinical applicability.

         <title>Jellyfish&#8208;Inspired Artificial Spider Silk for Luminous Surgical Sutures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking inspiration from the spinning process of spider silk and the luminescence mechanism of jellyfish, the luminous artificial spider silks are prepared by employing highly hydrated segments and polyhydroxyl segments. Furthermore, a luminescent surgical suture is prepared by coating the fiber with an additional polymer layer. This work provides a new design strategy for performing luminescent and robust surgical sutures.








Abstract
The development of functional surgical sutures with excellent mechanical properties, good fluorescence, and high cytocompatibility is highly required in the field of medical surgeries. Achieving fibers that simultaneously exhibit high mechanical robustness, good spinnability, and durable fluorescence emission has remained challenging up to now. Taking inspiration from the spinning process of spider silk and the luminescence mechanism of jellyfish, this work reports a luminous artificial spider silk prepared with the aim of balancing the fiber spinnability and mechanical robustness. This is realized by employing highly hydrated segments with aggregation&#8208;induced luminescence for enhancing the fiber spinnability and polyhydroxyl segments for increasing the fiber mechanical robustness. Twist insertion during fiber spinning improves the fiber strength, toughness, and fluorescence emission. Furthermore, coating the fiber with an additional polymer layer results in a &#8220;sheath&#8211;core&#8221; architecture with improved mechanical properties and capacity to withstand water. This work provides a new design strategy for performing luminescent and robust surgical sutures.

         <title>Polyphenol&#8208;Derived Carbonaceous Frameworks with Multiscale Porosity for High&#8208;Power Electrochemical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the fluid dynamic behavior within carbonaceous porous structures, linking structural characteristics to electrolyte transport and electrochemical performance. Specifically, it quantitatively assesses the effect of polyphenol derivatives&#8208;harnessed multiscale pore structures on active surface utilization and electrochemical activity for advancements in high&#8208;power electrochemical applications.








Abstract
With the escalating global demand for electric vehicles and sustainable energy solutions, increasing focus is placed on developing electrochemical systems that offer fast charging and high&#8208;power output, primarily governed by mass transport. Accordingly, porous carbons have emerged as highly promising electrochemically active or supporting materials due to expansive surface areas, tunable pore structures, and superior electrical conductivity, accelerating surface reaction. Yet, while substantial research has been devoted to crafting various porous carbons to increase specific surface areas, the optimal utilization of the surfaces remains underexplored. This review emphasizes the critical role of the fluid dynamics within multiscale porous carbonaceous electrodes, leading to substantially enhanced pore utilization in electrochemical systems. It elaborates on strategies of using sacrificial templates for incorporating meso/macropores into microporous carbon matrix, while exploiting the unique properties of polyphenol moieties such as sustainable carbons derived from biomass, inherent adhesive/cohesive interactions with template materials, and facile complexation capabilities with diverse materials, thereby enabling adaptive structural modulations. Furthermore, it explores how multiscale pore configurations influence pore&#8208;utilization efficiency, demonstrating advantages of incorporating multiscale pores. Finally, synergistic impact on the high&#8208;power electrochemical systems is examined, attributed to improved fluid&#8208;dynamic behavior within the carbonaceous frameworks, providing insights for advancing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;power electrochemical applications.

         <title>A Long&#8208;Range Planar Polymer with Efficient &#960;&#8208;Electron Delocalization for Superior Proton Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polymer material with a planar imine&#8208;rich configuration is developed, in which the overall molecular rigidity, efficient &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, and optimized electronic structure endow the polymer material with a rapid, ultra&#8208;stable and unrivaled proton&#8208;storage capability. For real applications, an all&#8208;organic aqueous proton battery (APB) is constructed with high energy/power density and an ultralong lifespan of over 30&#160;000 cycles.








Abstract
Due to the unique &#8220;Grotthus mechanism&#8221;, aqueous proton batteries (APBs) are promising energy devices with intrinsic safety and sustainability. Although polymers with tunable molecular structures are ideal electrode materials, their unsatisfactory proton&#8208;storage redox behaviors hinder the practical application in APB devices. Herein, a novel planar phenazine (PPHZ) polymer with a robust and extended imine&#8208;rich skeleton is synthesized and used for APB application for the first time. The long&#8208;range planar configuration achieves ordered molecular stacking and reduced conformational disorder, while the high conjugation with strong &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization optimizes energy bandgap and electronic properties, enabling the polymer with low proton diffusion barriers, high redox activity, and superior electron affinity. As such, the PPHZ polymer as an electrode material exhibits fast, stable, and unrivaled proton&#8208;storage redox behaviors with a large capacity of 273.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 (1 C) in 1&#160;M H2SO4 electrolyte, which is the highest value among proton&#8208;inserted electrodes in aqueous acidic electrolytes. Dynamic in situ techniques confirm the high redox reversibility upon proton uptake/removal, and the corresponding protonation pathways are elucidated by theoretical calculations. Moreover, a pouch&#8208;type APB cell using PPHZ electrode exhibits an ultralong lifespan over 30&#160;000 cycles, further verifying its promising application prospect.

         <title>High&#8208;Detectivity All&#8208;Polymer Photodiode Empowers Smart Vitality Surveillance and Computational Imaging Rivaling Silicon Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;polymer organic photodiode with broadband competence is introduced with a newly designed acceptor material. The significantly&#160;improved OPD figures of merit with the polymer third component is investigated, focusing on exciton dynamics, morphology evolution, and trap characteristics. The OPD demonstrates competitive performance in machine learning&#8208;based blood pressure (BP) estimation and single&#8208;pixel imaging (SPI) in complex imaging environments, rivaling commercial silicon diodes.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic photodetectors (OPDs), particularly all&#8208;polymer&#8208;based ones, hold substantial commercial promise in the healthcare and imaging sectors. However, the process of optimizing their active layer composition to achieve highly competitive figures of merit lacks a clear direction and methodology. In this work, celebrity polymer acceptor PY&#8208;IT into a more NIR absorbing host system PBDB&#8208;T:PZF&#8208;V, to significantly enhance the photodetection competence, is introduced. The refined all&#8208;polymer ternary broadband photodetector demonstrates superior performance metrics, including experimentally measured noise current as low as 6 fA Hz&#8722;1/2, specific detectivity reaching 8&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones, linear dynamic range (LDR) of 145 dB, and swift response speed surpassing 200 kHz, striking a fair balance between sensitivity and response speed. Comprehensive morphological and photophysical characterizations elucidate the mechanisms behind the observed performance enhancements in this study, which include reduced trap density, enhanced charge transport, diminished charge recombination, and balanced electron/hole mobilities. Moreover, the practical deployment potential of the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device in self&#8208;powered mode is demonstrated through their application in a machine learning&#8208;based cuffless blood pressure (BP) estimation system and in high&#8208;resolution computational imaging across complex environments, where they are found to quantitatively rival commercial silicon diodes.

         <title>Cascaded Heteroporous Nanocomposites for Thermo&#8208;Adaptive Passive Radiation Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascaded heteroporous nanocomposite films with multistage optical scattering exhibit excellent subambient radiative cooling performance, achieving an enhanced average emissivity of 96.5% within the atmospheric window and a high reflectivity of 97.3% in the sunlight spectra. Combined with phase transition properties, these films possess thermal dissipation and absorption capabilities, effectively counteracting thermal shocks in device heating systems.








Abstract
Passive radiative cooling is a promising technology for heat dissipation that does not consume energy. However, current radiative cooling materials can only exhibit subambient cooling under atmospheric conditions and struggle to process specific heat accumulation. Thus, a passive thermal regulation mechanism adapted to wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range applications is required to match device heating systems. Herein, a heteroporous nanocomposite film (HENF) with thermo&#8208;adaptive radiation cooling performance is reported. Compared to conventional porous cooling films with limited scattering efficiencies, the HENFs with multistage scattering have a strong emissivity of 96.5% (8&#8211;13&#160;&#181;m) and a high reflectivity of 97.3% (0.3&#8211;2.5&#160;&#181;m), resulting in an ultrahigh cooling power of 114&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2. In such HENFs, theoretical analyses have confirmed the spectrum management superiority of the heteroporous unit in terms of the scattering efficiency strength, with their cascading effect enhancing the overall film&#8208;cooling efficiency. The high mechanical performance, phase&#8208;transition features, and environmental adaptive properties of HENFs are also exhibited. Importantly, HENFs synergistically couple thermal dissipation and absorption to effectively process heat accumulation and counteract thermal shock in heating devices. It is anticipated that thermo&#8208;adaptive HENFs will act as a promising platform for device surface thermal regulation over a wide temperature range.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Aided Design of Highly Conductive Anion Exchange Membranes for Fuel Cells and Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly conductive anion exchange membrane (AEM) structures are identified from a pool of 180000 AEM variations through a trained fully connected neural network (FCNN) model. Under the guidance of machine learning, synthesized AEMs with anilinium cation domain facilitate the formation of continuous ion channels, showing potential applications in AEM&#8208;based energy devices.








Abstract
Alkaline anion exchange membrane (AEM)&#8208;based fuel cells (AEMFCs) and water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) are vital for enabling the efficient and large&#8208;scale utilization of hydrogen energy. However, the performance of such energy devices is impeded by the relatively low conductivity of AEMs. The conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach to designing membrane structures has proven to be both inefficient and costly. To address this challenge, a fully connected neural network (FCNN) model is developed based on acid&#8208;catalyzed AEMs to analyze the relationship between structure and conductivity among 180,000 AEM variations. Under machine learning guidance, anilinium cation&#8208;type membranes are designed and synthesized. Molecular dynamics simulations and Mulliken charge population analysis validated that the presence of a large anilinium cation domain is a result of the inductive effect of N+ and benzene rings. The interconnected anilinium cation domains facilitated the formation of a continuous ion transport channel within the AEMs. Additionally, the incorporation of the benzyl electron&#8208;withdrawing group heightened the inductive effect, leading to high conductivity AEM variant as screened by the machine learning model. Furthermore, based on the highly active and low&#8208;cost monomers given by machine learning, the large&#8208;scale synthesis of anilinium&#8208;based AEMs confirms the potential for commercial applications.

The development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries offers higher specific energies and lower costs compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, a lack of mechanistic understanding hinders advancement.

Abstract
The development of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) toward large&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage is driven by the higher specific energies and lower cost in comparison with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ion batteries. Yet, insufficient mechanistic understanding and quantitative parameters of the key components in sulfur&#8208;based cathode hinders the advancement of the ASSLSB technologies. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of electrode parameters, including specific capacity, voltage, S mass loading and S content toward establishing the specific energy (Wh kg&#8722;1) and energy density (Wh L&#8722;1) of the ASSLSBs. Additionally, this work critically evaluates the progress in enhancing lithium ion and electron percolation and mitigating electrochemical&#8208;mechanical degradation in sulfur&#8208;based cathodes. Last, a critical outlook on potential future research directions is provided to guide the rational design of high&#8208;performance sulfur&#8208;based cathodes toward practical ASSLSBs.

         <title>Boosting All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells by Revitalizing the Buried Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetylcholine acts as a proficient &#8220;diver,&#8221; aiding in the reconstruction of the buried interface and significantly improving the overall quality of the top narrow&#8208;bandgap mixed tin&#8211;lead perovskite layers. As a result, single&#8208;junction narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells and their 2&#8208;terminal tandems achieve stabilized power conversion efficiencies of 22.98% and 27.54%, respectively.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) mixed tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) serve as crucial top subcells in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs). However, the prevalent use of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) hole transport layers (HTLs) in NBG PSCs compromises device efficiency and stability. To address this, the study proposes a revitalizing strategy for the buried interface of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites by directly immersing acetylcholine chloride (ACh) into PEDOT: PSS. ACh acts as a proficient &#8220;diver,&#8221; not only modulating the bottom PEDOT: PSS HTLs but also facilitating the reconstruction of the buried interface and significantly enhancing the quality of the top perovskite layers. This intervention with ACh prevents Sn2+ oxidation, mitigates buried defects, and encourages the growth of large, densely packed grains within Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites. Consequently, the optimized NBG PSCs exhibit significantly improved hole transport and reduced carrier recombination, achieving a steady&#8208;state efficiency of 22.98% with enhanced stability. Furthermore, these optimized NBG Sn&#8208;Pb cells enable highly efficient two&#8208;terminal and four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite TSCs, boasting steady&#8208;state efficiencies of 27.54% (certified at 26.41%) and 28.01%, respectively. This study emphasizes the importance of optimizing NBG PSCs through buried interface reconstruction, propelling the advancement of all&#8208;perovskite TSCs.

         <title>Gold Nanoparticle Transport in the Injured Kidneys with Elevated Renal Function Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using X&#8208;ray imaging to track the kidney transport of renal&#8208;clearable gold nanoparticles, the study finds that inner strip of outer medulla is the most significant site in accumulating glomerular filtered nanoparticles in cisplatin&#8208;injured kidney: formation of gold&#8211;protein casts in the lumen of the loop of Henle increases as proximal tubular injury progresses, which is undetectable by renal function biomarkers BUN and creatinine in mild injury stages.








Abstract
Renal function biomarkers such as serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) serve as key indicators for guiding clinical decisions before administering kidney&#8208;excreted small&#8208;molecule agents. With engineered nanoparticles increasingly designed to be renally clearable to expedite their clinical translation, understanding the relationship between renal function biomarkers and nanoparticle transport in diseased kidneys becomes crucial to their biosafety in future clinical applications. In this study, renal&#8208;clearable gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are used as X&#8208;ray contrast agents to noninvasively track their transport and retention in cisplatin&#8208;injured kidneys with varying BUN and Cr levels. The findings reveal that AuNP transport is significantly slowed in the medulla of severely injured kidneys, with BUN and Cr levels elevated to 10 times normal. In mildly injured kidneys, where BUN and Cr levels only four to five times higher than normal, AuNP transport and retention are not predictable by BUN and Cr levels but correlate strongly with the degree of tubular injury due to the formation of gold&#8211;protein casts in the Henle's loop of the medulla. These results underscore the need for caution when employing renal&#8208;clearable nanomedicines in compromised kidneys and highlight the potential of renal&#8208;clearable AuNPs as X&#8208;ray probes for&#160;assessing kidney injuries noninvasively.

         <title>Mussel&#8208;Bioinspired Lignin Adhesive for Wearable Bioelectrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Demethylation combined with intramolecular amino acid synergy endows biomass lignin with mussel&#8208;like, strong, reversible, and biocompatible adhesion. Excellent adhesion is confirmed at the molecular level, analyzed using molecular dynamics and density functional theory simulations, and tested in organohydrogel&#8208;based wearable bioelectronics at low dosages.








Abstract
As a natural &#8220;binder,&#8221; lignin fixes cellulose in plants to foster growth and longevity. However, isolated lignin has a poor binding ability, which limits its biomedical applications. In this study, inspired by mussel adhesive proteins, acidic/basic amino acids (AAs) are introduced in alkali lignin (AL) to form ionic&#8208;&#960;/spatial correlation interactions, followed by demethylation to create catechol residues for enhanced adhesion activity. Atomic force microscopy reveals that catechol residues are the primary adhesion structures, with basic AAs exhibiting superior synergistic effects compared to acidic AAs. Demethylated lysine&#8208;grafted AL exhibits the strongest adhesion force toward skin tissue. Molecular dynamic simulation and density functional theory calculations indicate that adhesion against skin tissue mainly results from hydrogen bonds and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, with the adhesion mechanism being based on the Gibbs free energy of the Schiff base reaction. In summary, a biomimetic electrode based on lignin inspired by mussel adhesive proteins is prepared; the presented method offers a straightforward strategy for the development of biomimetic adhesives. Furthermore, this mussel&#8208;inspired adhesive can be used as a wearable bioelectrode in biomedical applications.

         <title>Extracellular Vesicles from Nanomedicine&#8208;Trained Intestinal Microbiota Substitute for Fecal Microbiota Transplant in Treating Ulcerative Colitis</title>

Gut microbiota from CN@Lp127&#8208;trained healthy mice secrete extracellular vesicles (Gm&#8208;EVs) that regulate intestinal microbiota, colonic immune environment, and purine metabolism. These Gm&#8208;EVs significantly improve the treatment outcomes against ulcerative colitis by reducing inflammation, restoring colonic barrier function, and rebalancing intestinal microbiota, offering an alternative to fecal microbiota transplant.








Abstract
The biosafety concerns associated with fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) limit their clinical application in treating ulcerative colitis (UC). Gut microbiota secrete abundant extracellular vesicles (Gm&#8208;EVs), which play a critical role in bacteria&#8208;to&#8208;bacteria and bacteria&#8208;to&#8208;host communications. Herein, intestinal microbiota are trained using tea leaf lipid/pluronic F127&#8208;coated curcumin nanocrystals (CN@Lp127s), which can maintain stability during transit through the gastrointestinal tract. Compared with FMT, Gm&#8208;EVs derived from healthy mice significantly improve treatment outcomes against UC by reducing colonic inflammatory responses, restoring colonic barrier function, and rebalancing intestinal microbiota. Strikingly, Gm&#8208;EVs obtained from CN@Lp127&#8208;trained healthy mice exhibit a superior therapeutic effect on UC compared to groups receiving FMT from healthy mice, Gm&#8208;EVs from healthy mice, and FMT from CN@Lp127&#8208;trained healthy mice. Oral administration of Gm&#8208;EVs from CN@Lp127&#8208;trained healthy mice not only alleviates colonic inflammation, promotes mucosal repair, and regulates gut microbiota but also regulates purine metabolism to decrease the uric acid level, resulting in a robust improvement in the UC. This study demonstrates the UC therapeutic efficacy of Gm&#8208;EVs derived from nanomedicine&#8208;trained gut microbiota in regulating the immune microenvironment, microbiota, and purine metabolism of the colon. These EVs provide an alternative platform to replace FMT as a treatment for UC.

         <title>Rare&#8208;Earth (R) In&#8208;Plane Ordering in Novel (Mo, R, Nb)4AlC3 Quinary o&#8208;MAX Nanolaminates and their 2D Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>
In the history of MAX phase, in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ordered configurations are reported for n = 1 and n &#8805; 2 in Mn+1AlCn separately. Here, starting from the (Mo, Nb)4AlC3 o&#8208;MAX, the novel Mo3.33&#8208;xR0.67NbxAlC3 (R = Y, Gd&#8208;Tm, Lu) super&#8208;ordered (s&#8208;)MAX phase is synthesized with simultaneous R in&#8208;plane&#8208;ordering and Mo/Nb out&#8208;of&#8208;plane&#8208;ordering. The Pt&#8208;anchored 2D s&#8208;MXene shows supreme HER performance.








Abstract
Nanolamellar transition metal carbides are gaining increasing attentions because of the promising application in energy storage of their 2D derivatives. There are in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane atomic ordered occupations, which is thought to only be formed in separated systems due to totally different origins and crystallographic structure. In present work, starting from (Mo, Nb)4AlC3 o&#8208;MAX phase where out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ordered occupation is experimentally and theoretically proved for Mo/Nb atoms, rare&#8208;earth elements (R = Y, Gd&#8208;Tm, Lu) are introduced, and the novel Mo3.33&#8208;xR0.67NbxAlC3 (x = 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, and 2.5) super&#8208;ordered (s&#8208;) MAX phase is synthesized, where R is ordered at the outer layer in the strict stoichiometry meanwhile Mo/Nb maintains the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ordered occupation. By R introduction, s&#8208;MAX is easier to be delaminated to obtain the s&#8208;MXene with the topochemical ordered vacancies, leading into the enhanced supercapacitance of 114.9 F g&#8722;1 in Mo1.33Nb2C3 s&#8208;MXene compared with 95.1 F g&#8722;1 in Mo2Nb2C3 o&#8208;MXene. By Pt anchoring, very low overpotential of 22&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved for HER applications. This study demonstrates a novel variety of s&#8208;MAX phase and seeks to inspire further exploration of the ordered MAX and MXene families.

         <title>Homo&#8208;Site Nucleation Growth of Twisted Bilayer MoS2 with Commensurate Angles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal method, the gas&#8208;flow perturbation CVD approach to directly synthesis bilayer MoS2 homostructures with a clean interface and versatile twist angles ranging from 8&#176; to 56&#176; is developed. Enhanced moir&#233; excitons in the twisted bilayer MoS2 with a commensurate angle of 22&#176; are evidenced by using the low&#8208;temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and density function theory (DFT) calculations.








Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices, composed of two layers of transition metal dichalcogenides with a relative twist angle, provide a novel platform for exploring the correlated electronic phases and excitonic physics. Here, a gas&#8208;flow perturbation chemical vapor deposition (CVD) approach is demonstrated to directly grow MoS2 bilayer with versatile twist angles. It is found that the formation of twisted bilayer MoS2 homostructures sensitively depends on the gas&#8208;flow perturbation modes, correspondingly featuring the nucleation sites of the second layer at the same (homo&#8208;site) as or at the different (hetero&#8208;site) from that of the first layer. The commensurate twist angle of &#8776;22&#176; in homo&#8208;site nucleation strategy accounts for &#8776;16% among the broad range of twist angles due to its low formation energy, which is in consistence with the theoretical calculation. More importantly, moir&#233; interlayer excitons with the enhanced photoluminescence (PL) intensity and the prolonged lifetime are evidenced in the twisted bilayer MoS2 with a commensurate angle of 22&#176;, which is owing to the reason that the strong moir&#233; potential facilitates the interlayer excitons to be trapped in the moir&#233; superlattices. The work provides a feasible route to controllably built twisted MoS2 homostructures with strong moir&#233; potential to investigate the correlated physics in twistronics systems.

Abstract
Tuberculosis, a fatal infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), is difficult to treat with antibiotics due to drug resistance and short drug half&#8208;life. Phototherapy represents a promising alternative to antibiotics in combating M.tb. Exploring an intelligent material allowing effective tuberculosis treatment is definitely appealing, yet a significantly challenging task. Herein, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one biomimetic therapeutic nanoparticle featured by aggregation&#8208;induced second near&#8208;infrared emission, granuloma&#8208;targeting, and self&#8208;oxygenation is constructed, which can serve for prominent fluorescence imaging&#8208;navigated combined phototherapy toward tuberculosis. After camouflaging the biomimetic erythrocyte membrane, the nanoparticles show significantly prolonged blood circulation and increased selective accumulation in tuberculosis granuloma. Upon laser irradiation, the loading photosensitizer of aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer elevates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing M.tb damage and death. The delivery of oxygen to relieve the hypoxic granuloma microenvironment supports ROS generation during photodynamic therapy. Meanwhile, the photothermal agent, Prussian blue nanoparticles, plays the role of good photothermal killing effect on M.tb. Moreover, the growth and proliferation of granuloma and M.tb colonies are effectively inhibited in the nanoparticle&#8208;treated tuberculous granuloma model mice, suggesting the combined therapeutic effects of enhancing photodynamic therapy and photothermal therapy.

Exploring an intelligent material allowing effective tuberculosis treatment is definitely appealing, yet a significantly challenging task. Herein, an all-in-one biomimetic therapeutic nanoparticle featured by aggregation-induced second near-infrared emission, granuloma-targeting, and self-oxygenation is constructed, which can serve for prominent fluorescence imaging-navigated combined phototherapy toward tuberculosis. After camouflaging the biomimetic erythrocyte membrane, the nanoparticles show significantly prolonged blood circulation and increased selective accumulation in tuberculosis granuloma. Upon laser irradiation, the loading photosensitizer of aggregation-induced emission photosensitizer elevates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing &lt;i&gt;M.tb&lt;/i&gt; damage and death. The delivery of oxygen to relieve the hypoxic granuloma microenvironment supports ROS generation during photodynamic therapy. Meanwhile, the photothermal agent, Prussian blue nanoparticles, plays the role of good photothermal killing effect on &lt;i&gt;M.tb&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, the growth and proliferation of granuloma and &lt;i&gt;M.tb&lt;/i&gt; colonies are effectively inhibited in the nanoparticle-treated tuberculous granuloma model mice, suggesting the combined therapeutic effects of enhancing photodynamic therapy and photothermal therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
The organic&#8208;inorganic lead halide perovskite materials have emerged as highly promising contenders in the field of photovoltaic technology, offering exceptional efficiency and cost&#8208;effectiveness. The commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics hinges on successfully transitioning from lab&#8208;scale perovskite solar cells to large&#8208;scale perovskite solar modules (PSMs). However, the efficiency of PSMs significantly diminishes with increasing device area, impeding commercial viability. Central to achieving high&#8208;efficiency PSMs is fabricating uniform functional films and optimizing interfaces to minimize energy loss. In this review, we shed light on the path towards large&#8208;scale PSMs, emphasizing the pivotal role of integrating cutting&#8208;edge scientific research with industrial technology. By exploring scalable deposition techniques and optimization strategies, we reveal the advancements and challenges in fabricating large&#8208;area perovskite films. Subsequently, we delve into the architecture and contact materials of PSMs while addressing pertinent interface issues. Crucially, we analyze efficiency loss during scale&#8208;up and stability risks encountered by PSMs. Furthermore, we highlight the advancements in industrial efforts towards perovskite commercialization, emphasizing the perspective of PSMs in revolutionizing renewable energy. By highlighting the scientific and technical challenges in developing PSMs, we stress the importance of combining science and industry to drive their industrialization and pave the way for future advancements.

         <title>Engineering Mesoscale T Cell Receptor Clustering by Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Play Nanotools</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
T&#160;cell receptor (TCR) clustering and formation of an immune synapse are crucial for TCR signaling. However, limited information is available about these dynamic assemblies and their connection to transmembrane signaling. Here, we controlled TCR clustering via plug&#8208;and&#8208;play nanotools based on an engineered irreversible conjugation pair and a peptide&#8208;loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecule to compare receptor assembly in a ligand (pMHC)&#8208;induced or ligand&#8208;independent manner. A streptavidin&#8208;binding peptide displayed in both tools enabled their anchoring in streptavidin&#8208;pre&#8208;structured matrices. Strikingly, pMHC&#8208;induced clustering in the confined regions exhibited higher density and dynamics than the ligand&#8208;free approach, indicating that the size and architecture of the pMHC ligand influences TCR assembly. Our approach enables the control of membrane receptor clustering with high specificity and provide the possibility to explore different modalities of receptor activation.

         <title>Atomic Confinement Empowered CoZn Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Nanotubes for H2O2 Production in Sequential Dual&#8208;Cathode Electro&#8208;Fenton Process</title>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are flourishing in various fields because of their 100% atomic utilization. However, their uncontrollable selectivity, poor stability and vulnerable inactivation remain critical challenges. According to theoretical predictions and experiments, a heteronuclear CoZn dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom confined in N/O&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanotube reactors (CoZnSA@CNTs) was synthesized via a spatial confinement growth strategy. CoZnSA@CNTs exhibited superior performance for H2O2 electrosynthesis over the entire pH range due to dual&#8208;confinement of the atomic sites and O2 molecule. CoZnSA@CNTs was favorable for H2O2 production mainly because the synergy of adjacent atomic sites, defect&#8208;rich feature and nanotube reactor promoted O2 enrichment and enhanced H2O2 reactivity/selectivity. The H2O2 selectivity reached nearly 100% in a range of 0.2 &#8764; 0.65&#160;V versus RHE and the yield achieved 7.50&#160;M gcat&#8722;1 with CoZnSA@CNTs/carbon fiber felt, which exceeded most of the reported SACs in H&#8208;type cells. The obtained H2O2 was converted directly to sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate in a safe way for H2O2 storage/transportation. The sequential dual&#8208;cathode electron&#8208;Fenton process promoted the formation of reactive oxygen species (&#8226;OH, 1O2 and &#8226;O2&#8722;) by activating the in&#8208;situ generated H2O2, enabling accelerated degradation of various pollutants and Cr(VI) detoxification in actual wastewater. This work proposes a promising confinement strategy for catalyst design and selectivity regulation of complex reactions.

         <title>Cu/CuxO/Graphdiyne Tandem Catalyst for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction reaction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to ammonia (NH3) is a feasible way to achieve artificial nitrogen cycle. However, the low yield rate and poor selectivity towards NH3 product is a technical challenge. Here we present a graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based tandem catalyst featuring Cu/CuxO nanoparticles anchored to GDY support (termed Cu/CuxO/GDY) for efficient electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction. We achieve a high NH3 yield rate of 25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 (25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) with a Faradaic efficiency of 99.8% at an applied potential of &#8208;0.8&#160;V versus RHE using the designed catalyst. These performance metrics outperform most reported NO3&#8722; to NH3 catalysts in the alkaline media. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory reveal that the NO3&#8722; preferentially attacks Cu/CuxO, and the GDY can effectively catalyze the reduction of NO2&#8722; to NH3. This work highlights the efficacy of GDY as a new class of tandem catalysts for the artificial nitrogen cycle and provides powerful guidelines for the design of tandem electrocatalysts.

         <title>Nanoengineering&#8208;Enhanced Capillary Cooling Achieves Sustained Thermal Protection for Ultra&#8208;High Heat Flux and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extreme thermal conditions with heat flux densities exceeding 1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2 or temperatures reaching up to 1000 &#176;C are prevalent in various situations. However, the ability of thermal protection either depends on specialized materials or is currently limited with existing cooling schemes. Herein, we propose an innovative cooling scheme that relies on evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow enhanced by nanoengineering&#8208;designed porous structures with common materials. Experimentally&#8208;obtained capillary flow cooling curve identifies critical heat flux corresponding to evaporation&#8208;driven flow stage, where coolants cool the surface and subsequent vapor impedes heat transfer from thermal boundaries. Nanoengineering provides opportunities for enhanced capillary flow, which proves to endow bronze, TC4, and Al2O3 with thermal protection ability 50%&#8722;180% higher than that without nanoengineering&#8208;designed. Our scheme achieves critical heat flux up to 2.0&#8208;3.1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2, and performs thermal dissipation capacity almost twice higher than inherent latent heat of coolant. Furthermore, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, our scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;heat&#8208;flux environments and paves the way for the development of lightweight, long&#8208;lasting, and large&#8208;scale solutions for thermal protection.

Experimentally-obtained capillary flow cooling curve identifies critical heat flux corresponding to evaporation-driven flow stage, where coolants cool the surface and subsequent vapor impedes heat transfer from thermal boundaries. Nanoengineering provides opportunities for enhanced capillary flow, which proves to endow bronze, TC4, and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with thermal protection ability 50%&#8722;180% higher than that without nanoengineering-designed. Our scheme achieves critical heat flux up to 2.0-3.1 MW&#183;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and performs thermal dissipation capacity almost twice higher than inherent latent heat of coolant. Furthermore, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, our scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering-enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high-temperature and high-heat-flux environments and paves the way for the development of lightweight, long-lasting, and large-scale solutions for thermal protection.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Topological Parametric Phonon Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological bosonic systems have recently aroused intense interests in exploring exotic phenomena that have no counterparts in electronic systems. The squeezed bosonic interaction in these systems is particularly interesting, because it can modify the vacuum fluctuations of topological states, drive them into instabilities, and lead to topological parametric oscillators. However, these phenomena remain experimentally elusive because of limited nonlinearities in most existing topological bosonic systems. Here, a topological parametric phonon oscillator is experimentally realized based on a nonlinear nanoelectromechanical Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity with strong squeezed interaction. Specifically, the Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity is parametrically driven to provide phase&#8208;sensitive amplification for topological phonons, leading to the observation of coherent parametric phonon oscillation above the threshold. Additionally, it is confirmed that the random frequency variation caused by fabrication disorders can be suppressed effectively by increasing the cavity size, while the free spectral range reduces at a much slower rate, which benefit the realization of large&#8208;area single&#8208;mode lasers. Our results represent an important advance in experimental investigations of topological physics with large bosonic nonlinearities and parametric gain.

         <title>Reorganizing Helmholtz Adsorption Plane Enables Sodium Layered&#8208;Oxide Cathode Beyond High Oxidation Limits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium layered&#8208;oxides (NaxTMO2) sustain severe interfacial stability issues when subjected to battery applications. Particularly at high potential, the oxidation limits including transition metal dissolution and SEI reformation are intertwined upon the cathode, resulting in poor cycle ability. Herein, by rearranging the complex and structure of Helmholtz absorption plane adjacent to NaxTMO2 cathodes, the mechanism of constructing stable cathode/electrolyte interphase to push up oxidation limits is clarified. The strong absorbent fluorinated anions replace the solvents into the inner Helmholtz plane, thereby reorganizing the Helmholtz absorption structure and spontaneously inducing an anion&#8208;dominated interphase to envelop more active sites for layered oxides. More importantly, such multi&#8208;component cathode/electrolyte interphase proves effective for long&#8208;term durability of a series of manganese&#8208;based oxide cathodes, which achieves 1500&#8208;cycles lifetime against high oxidation voltage limit beyond 4.3&#160;V. This work unravels the key role of breaking high&#8208;oxidation limits in attaining higher energy density of layered&#8208;oxide systems.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated DNA Nanotechnology in 3D: Structural Library by Templated Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
DNA double helices containing metal&#8208;mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs have been constructed from Ag+ and Hg2+ ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials has been impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, we explore the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self&#8208;assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination. We employed the tensegrity triangle to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X&#8208;ray diffraction and elucidated generalized design rules for mmDNA construction. We uncovered two binding modes: N3&#8208;dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5&#8208;position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations showed additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.
