      <title>An Ultraviolet Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence OLED with Total External Quantum Efficiency over 9%</title>
      <dc:description>
The first example of UV&#8208;emissive thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter, namely CZ&#8208;MPS, is demonstrated successfully. An organic light&#8208;emitting diode using CZ&#8208;MPS as the guest material can emit efficient UV light with emission maximum (&#955;EL) of 389&#160;nm as well as a record&#8208;breaking total external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 9.3%.








Abstract
Owing to the difficulty in acquiring compounds with combined high energy bandgaps and lower&#8208;lying intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer excited states, the development of ultraviolet (UV) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials is quite challenging. Herein, through interlocking of the diphenylsulfone (PS) acceptor unit of a reported deep&#8208;blue TADF emitter (CZ&#8208;PS) by a dimethylmethylene bridge, CZ&#8208;MPS, a UV&#8208;emissive TADF compound bearing a shallower LUMO energy level and a more rigid structure than those of CZ&#8208;PS is achieved. This represents the first example of a UV&#8208;emissive TADF compound. Organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) using CZ&#8208;MPS as the guest material can emit efficient UV light with emission maximum of 389&#160;nm and maximum total external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 9.3%. Note that this EQEmax value is twice as high as the current record EQEmax (4.6%) for UV&#8208;OLEDs. This finding may shed light on the molecular design strategy for high&#8208;performance UV&#8208;OLED materials.

      <title>In Situ Grazing&#8208;Incidence Wide&#8208;Angle Scattering Reveals Mechanisms for Phase Distribution and Disorientation in 2D Halide Perovskite Films</title>
      <dc:description>
The mechanism of 2D halide perovskite film formation is resolved using in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle scattering (GIWAXS). The film begins as a sol&#8211;gel precursor before first forming a 3D MAPbI3&#8208;like phase at the air/liquid interface. This acts as the template for the highly textured 2D phase with the layers perpendicular to the substrate, which grows closer to the substrate.








Abstract
2D hybrid halide perovskites with the formula (A&#8242;)2(A)n&#8208;1PbnI3n+1 have remarkable stability and promising efficiency in photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices, yet fundamental understanding of film formation, key to optimizing these devices, is lacking. Here, in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) is used to monitor film formation during spin&#8208;coating. This elucidates the general film formation mechanism of 2D halide perovskites during one&#8208;step spin&#8208;coating. There are three stages of film formation: sol&#8211;gel, oriented 3D, and 2D. Three precursor phases form during the sol&#8211;gel stage and transform to perovskite, first giving a highly oriented 3D&#8208;like phase at the air/liquid interface followed by subsequent nucleations forming slightly less oriented 2D perovskite. Furthermore, heating before crystallization leads to fewer nucleations and faster removal of the precursors, improving orientation. This outlines the primary causes of phase distribution and perpendicular orientation in 2D perovskite films and paves the way for rationally designed film fabrication techniques.

   &lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;+1&lt;/sub&gt; have remarkable stability and promising efficiency in photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices, yet fundamental understanding of film formation, key to optimizing these devices, is lacking. Here, in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) is used to monitor film formation during spin&#8208;coating. This elucidates the general film formation mechanism of 2D halide perovskites during one&#8208;step spin&#8208;coating. There are three stages of film formation: sol&#8211;gel, oriented 3D, and 2D. Three precursor phases form during the sol&#8211;gel stage and transform to perovskite, first giving a highly oriented 3D&#8208;like phase at the air/liquid interface followed by subsequent nucleations forming slightly less oriented 2D perovskite. Furthermore, heating before crystallization leads to fewer nucleations and faster removal of the precursors, improving orientation. This outlines the primary causes of phase distribution and perpendicular orientation in 2D perovskite films and paves the way for rationally designed film fabrication techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Device Postannealing Enabling over 12% Efficient Solution&#8208;Processed Cu2ZnSnS4 Solar Cells with Cd2+ Substitution</title>
      <dc:description>
A method of device annealing including an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer is proposed, acheiving an efficiency of 12.6% for Cd&#8208;alloyed Cu2ZnSnS4 thin&#8208;film solar cells. The VOC is increased by the reduction of both interface traps and deep&#8208;level defects, and fill factor enhancement is based on the favorable band alignment (conduction band offset) and ITO improvement after postannealing.








Abstract
Kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 is a promising photovoltaic material containing low&#8208;cost, earth&#8208;abundant, and stable semiconductor elements. However, the highest power conversion efficiency of thin&#8208;film solar cells based on Cu2ZnSnS4 is only about 11% due to low open&#8208;circuit voltage and fill factor mainly caused by antisite defects and unfavorable heterojunction interface. In this work, a postannealing procedure is proposed to complete a Cd&#8208;alloyed Cu2ZnSnS4 device. The postannealing to complete the device significantly enhances the performance of the indium tin oxide and promotes the moderate interdiffusion of elements between the layers in the device. As a result of the diffusion of Cu, Zn, In, and Sn, the interfacial electron and hole densities are improved, leading to the achievement of a suitable band alignment for carrier transport. The postannealing also reduces the interface traps and deep&#8208;level defects, contributing to decreased nonradiative recombination. Therefore, the open&#8208;circuit voltage and fill factor are both improved, and an efficiency over 12% for pure sulfide&#8208;based kesterite thin&#8208;film solar cells is obtained.

      <title>High&#8208;Performance Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells with Excellent Infrared Reflection and See&#8208;Through Functions</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance semitransparent organic solar cells are achieved through the combined design efforts on the formulation of near&#8208;infrared ternary blends and optical control over photonic reflectors, which exhibit excellent features of power generation, they being see&#8208;through, and infrared reflection.








Abstract
Clean energy production and saving play vital impacts on the sustainability of the global community. Herein, high&#8208;performance semitransparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) with excellent features of power generation, being see&#8208;through, and infrared reflection of heat dissipation, with promising perspectives for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) are reported. To simultaneously improve average visible transmittance (AVT) and power conversion efficiency (PCE), formally in a trade&#8208;off relationship, of ST&#8208;OSCs, new ternary blends with alloy&#8208;like near&#8208;infrared (NIR) acceptors are employed, which are effective to improve device efficiency while maintaining visible absorption unchanged, resulting in PCEs of 16.8% for opaque devices and 13.1% for semitransparent OSCs (AVT of 22.4% and infrared photon radiation rejection (IRR) of 77%). Further, multifunctional ST&#8208;OSCs are realized via introducing simple, yet effective photonic reflectors, together with optical simulation, leading to not only perfect fitting of the visible transmittance peak (555&#160;nm) to the photopic response of the human eye but also an excellent IRR of 90% (780&#8211;2500&#160;nm), along with 23% AVT and over 12% PCE. This is thought to be the best&#8208;performing multifunctional ST&#8208;OSC with promising prospects as BIPVs in terms of power generation, heat dissipation, and being see&#8208;through.

      <title>&#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 Bilayers via One&#8208;Step Deposition for Efficient and Stable All&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
A gradient grain&#8208;sized (GGS) CsPbI3 bilayer is developed to stabilize the &#945; phase via a single&#8208;step film&#8208;deposition process. The perovskite solar cell based on the GGS CsPbI3 bilayer shows an efficiency of 15.5% and operates stably for 1000 h under ambient conditions.








Abstract
The emerging inorganic CsPbI3 perovskites are promising wide&#8208;bandgap materials for application in tandem solar cells, but they tend to transit from a black &#945; phase to a yellow &#948; phase in ambient conditions. Herein, a gradient grain&#8208;sized (GGS) CsPbI3 bilayer is developed to stabilize the &#945; phase via a single&#8208;step film deposition process. The spontaneously upward migration of (adamantan&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methanammonium (ADMA) based on the hot&#8208;casting technique causes self&#8208;assembly of the hierarchical morphology for the perovskite layers. Due to the strong steric effect of the surficial ADMA cation, a self&#8208;assembly tiny grain&#8208;sized CsPbI3 layer is in situ formed at the surface site, which exhibits notably enhanced phase stability by its high surface energy. Meanwhile, a large grain&#8208;sized CsPbI3 layer is obtained at the bottom site with high charge mobility and low trap density of states, which benefits from the regulated growth rates by the interaction between ADMA and perovskites. The perovskite solar cell (PSC) based on the GGS CsPbI3 bilayer shows an efficiency of 15.5% and operates stably for 1000 h under ambient conditions. This work confirms that redistributing the surface energy of perovskite films is a facile strategy to stabilize metastable PSCs without the cost of efficiency loss.

      <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Chemical and Physical Microstructure of Li Metal Anodes Revealed through Synchrotron&#8208;Based Imaging Techniques</title>
      <dc:description>
The influence of temperature on the electrochemical behavior of Li metal anodes in carbonate electrolyte is revealed through a series of synchrotron&#8208;based imaging techniques. X&#8208;ray computed tomography as well as energy&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray fluorescence mappings coupled with micro&#8208;X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure are used to study the physical and chemical evolution of the Li metal anode from the micro to macroscales.








Abstract
The Li metal anode has been long sought&#8208;after for application in Li metal batteries due to its high specific capacity (3860 mAh g&#8722;1) and low electrochemical potential (&#8722;3.04 V vs the standard hydrogen electrode). Nevertheless, the behavior of Li metal in different environments has been scarcely reported. Herein, the temperature&#8208;dependent behavior of Li metal anodes in carbonate electrolyte from the micro&#8208; to macroscales are explored with advanced synchrotron&#8208;based characterization techniques such as X&#8208;ray computed tomography and energy&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray fluorescence mapping. The importance of testing methodology is exemplified, and the electrochemical behavior and failure modes of Li anodes cycled at different temperatures are discussed. Moreover, the origin of cycling performance at different temperatures is identified through analysis of Coulombic efficiencies, surface morphology, and the chemical composition of the solid electrolyte interphase in quasi&#8208;3D space with energy&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray fluorescence mappings coupled with micro&#8208;X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure. This work provides new characterization methods for Li metal anodes and serves as an important basis toward the understanding of their electrochemical behavior in carbonate electrolytes at different temperatures.

      <title>A Highly Conductive Titanium Oxynitride Electron&#8208;Selective Contact for Efficient Photovoltaic Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
TiOxNy films are demonstrated to be an excellent electron&#8208;selective contact for both crystalline silicon and organic solar cells. Remarkable efficiency of 22.3% and 17.02% is achieved for crystalline silicon and organic solar cells, respectively.








Abstract
High&#8208;quality carrier&#8208;selective contacts with suitable electronic properties are a prerequisite for photovoltaic devices with high power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this work, an efficient electron&#8208;selective contact, titanium oxynitride (TiOxNy), is developed for crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) and organic photovoltaic devices. Atomic&#8208;layer&#8208;deposited TiOxNy is demonstrated to be highly conductive with a proper work function (4.3&#160;eV) and a wide bandgap (3.4&#160;eV). Thin TiOxNy films simultaneously provide a moderate surface passivation and enable a low contact resistivity on c&#8208;Si surfaces. By implementation of an optimal TiOxNy&#8208;based contact, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PCE of 22.3% is achieved for a c&#8208;Si solar cell featuring a full&#8208;area dopant&#8208;free electron&#8208;selective contact. Simultaneously, conductive TiOxNy is proven to be an efficient electron&#8208;transport layer for organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. A remarkably high PCE of 17.02% is achieved for an OPV device with an electron&#8208;transport TiOxNy layer, which is superior to conventional ZnO&#8208;based devices with a PCE of 16.10%. Atomic&#8208;layer&#8208;deposited TiOxNy ETL on a large area with a high uniformity may help accelerate the commercialization of emerging solar technologies.

&lt;p&gt;TiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt;N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; films are demonstrated to be an excellent electron&#8208;selective contact for both crystalline silicon and organic solar cells. Remarkable efficiency of 22.3% and 17.02% is achieved for crystalline silicon and organic solar cells, respectively.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High&#8208;quality carrier&#8208;selective contacts with suitable electronic properties are a prerequisite for photovoltaic devices with high power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this work, an efficient electron&#8208;selective contact, titanium oxynitride (TiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt;N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt;), is developed for crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) and organic photovoltaic devices. Atomic&#8208;layer&#8208;deposited TiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt;N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; is demonstrated to be highly conductive with a proper work function (4.3&#160;eV) and a wide bandgap (3.4&#160;eV). Thin TiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt;N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; films simultaneously provide a moderate surface passivation and enable a low contact resistivity on c&#8208;Si surfaces. By implementation of an optimal TiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt;N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;based contact, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PCE of 22.3% is achieved for a c&#8208;Si solar cell featuring a full&#8208;area dopant&#8208;free electron&#8208;selective contact. Simultaneously, conductive TiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt;N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; is proven to be an efficient electron&#8208;transport layer for organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. A remarkably high PCE of 17.02% is achieved for an OPV device with an electron&#8208;transport TiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt;N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; layer, which is superior to conventional ZnO&#8208;based devices with a PCE of 16.10%. Atomic&#8208;layer&#8208;deposited TiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt;N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; 
&lt;/i&gt; ETL on a large area with a high uniformity may help accelerate the commercialization of emerging solar technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Plasmonic Microspheres: Plasmonic Janus Microspheres Created from Pickering Emulsion Drops (Adv. Mater. 26/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article 2001384, Shin&#8208;Hyun Kim and co&#8208;workers design plasmonic Janus microspheres using emulsion drops whose interface is decorated by particles. The emulsion drops made of acrylate resin are photopolymerized and the particles are removed. The directional deposition of the metal renders the top hemispheres as plasmonically colored and the position of the particles at the interface is precisely controlled by aging, which enables the tuning of the plasmonic property. The plasmonic colors can be switched on and off by controlling the orientation of the Janus microspheres with an external electric field.

      <title>Charge Transport: Photomodulation of Charge Transport in All&#8208;Semiconducting 2D&#8211;1D van der Waals Heterostructures with Suppressed Persistent Photoconductivity Effect (Adv. Mater. 26/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2001268, Paolo Samor&#236; and co&#8208;workers report the fabrication of all&#8208;semiconducting mixed&#8208;dimensional van der Waals heterostructures based on monolayer 2D MoS2 and bottom&#8208;up synthesized 1D graphene nanoribbons, which efficiently suppress the typical persistent photoconductivity effect of MoS2. Upon interfacing with physisorbed photochromic molecules, the charge transport of MoS2&#8211;graphene nanoribbons in field&#8208;effect transistors can be significantly photomodulated, which corresponds to multilevel output currents for high&#8208;performance optoelectronics.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.2020012682001268&lt;/a&gt;, Paolo Samor&#236; and co&#8208;workers report the fabrication of all&#8208;semiconducting mixed&#8208;dimensional van der Waals heterostructures based on monolayer 2D MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and bottom&#8208;up synthesized 1D graphene nanoribbons, which efficiently suppress the typical persistent photoconductivity effect of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Upon interfacing with physisorbed photochromic molecules, the charge transport of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;graphene nanoribbons in field&#8208;effect transistors can be significantly photomodulated, which corresponds to multilevel output currents for high&#8208;performance optoelectronics.

      <title>Surface Ligand Management Aided by a Secondary Amine Enables Increased Synthesis Yield of CsPbI3 Perovskite Quantum Dots and High Photovoltaic Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
Di&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine solution in methyl acetate as an efficient solid&#8208;state treatment for CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot (PQD) solar cells is successfully demonstrated, and a record power conversion efficiency of &#8776;15% and high reproducibility are achieved for CsPbI3 PQD solar cells.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) or more broadly, nanocrystals possess advantageous features for solution&#8208;processed photovoltaic devices. The nanocrystal surface ligands play a crucial role in the transport of photogenerated carriers and ultimately affect the overall performance of PQD solar cells. Significantly improved CsPbI3 PQD synthetic yield and solar&#8208;cell performance through surface ligand management are demonstrated. The treatment of a secondary amine, di&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (DPA), provides a mild and efficient approach to control the surface ligand density of PQDs, which has an apparently different working mechanism compared to previously reported surface treatments. Using an optimal DPA concentration, the treatment can simultaneously remove both long&#8208;chain insulating surface ligands of oleic acid and oleylamine, even for unpurified PQDs with high ligand density. As a result, the electrical coupling between PQDs is enhanced, leading to improved charge transport, reduced carrier recombination, and a high power conversion efficiency approaching 15% for CsPbI3&#8208;PQD&#8208;based solar cells. In addition, the production yield of CsPbI3 PQDs can be increased by a factor of 8. These results highlight the importance of developing new ligand&#8208;management strategies, specifically for emerging PQDs to achieve scalable and high&#8208;performance perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

      <title>An Iron&#8208;Decorated Carbon Aerogel for Rechargeable Flow and Flexible Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
The designed strategy of a mechanically integrated air electrode, realized by directional freeze&#8208;casting, generates a 3D honeycomb nanostructured Fe&#8208;decorated carbon aerogel with satisfactory mechanical stability and gas/electrolyte diffusion channels. Such an integrated monolith with superb bifunctional electrocatalytic activity shows a remarkable performance as the free&#8208;standing air cathode in a flow Zn&#8211;air battery (ZAB) and flexible solid&#8208;state ZAB.








Abstract
Mechanically stable and foldable air cathodes with exceptional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities are key components of wearable metal&#8211;air batteries. Herein, a directional freeze&#8208;casting and annealing approach is reported for the construction of a 3D honeycomb nanostructured, N,P&#8208;doped carbon aerogel incorporating in situ grown FeP/Fe2O3 nanoparticles as the cathode in a flexible Zn&#8211;air battery (ZAB). The aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries assembled with this carbon aerogel exhibit a remarkable specific capacity of 648 mAh g&#8722;1 at a current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a good long&#8208;term durability, outperforming those assembled with commercial Pt/C+RuO2 catalyst. Furthermore, such a foldable carbon aerogel with directional channels can serve as a freestanding air cathode for flexible solid&#8208;state Zn&#8211;air batteries without the use of carbon paper/cloth and additives, giving a specific capacity of 676&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 and an energy density of 517 Wh kg&#8722;1 at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 together with good cycling stability. This work offers a new strategy to design and synthesize highly effective bifunctional air cathodes to be applied in electrochemical energy devices.

      <title>3D Two&#8208;Photon Microprinting of Nanoporous Architectures</title>
      <dc:description>
Combining self&#8208;assembly on the nanoscale and two&#8208;photon 3D laser printing on the micrometer scale, complex nanoporous 3D architectures are achieved. The underlying photoresist relies on polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation between a polymer and a nonpolymerizable phase. Control of the porosity by the printing parameters is demonstrated by sample characterization based on ultramicrotomy, scanning electron microscopy, and optical transmission.








Abstract
A photoresist system for 3D two&#8208;photon microprinting is presented, which enables the printing of inherently nanoporous structures with mean pore sizes around 50&#8197;nm by means of self&#8208;organization on the nanoscale. A phase separation between polymerizable and chemically inert photoresist components leads to the formation of 3D co&#8208;continuous structures. Subsequent washing&#8208;out of the unpolymerized phase reveals the porous polymer structures. To characterize the volume properties of the printed structures, scanning electron microscopy images are recorded from ultramicrotome sections. In addition, the light&#8208;scattering properties of the 3D&#8208;printed material are analyzed. By adjusting the printing parameters, the porosity can be controlled during 3D printing. As an application example, a functioning miniaturized Ulbricht light&#8208;collection sphere is 3D printed and tested.

      <title>Polarized Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Anisotropic Excitons in Few&#8208;Layer ReS2</title>
      <dc:description>
Linearly polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes are demonstrated using few&#8208;layer ReS2, a 2D semiconductor with reduced in&#8208;plane symmetry. Two excitonic electroluminescence peaks exhibiting high degrees of linear polarization of &#8776;80% are observed in near&#8208;infrared frequencies. Hot hole injection through a hBN tunneling layer is shown to be key to the activation of hot exciton emission.








Abstract
An on&#8208;chip polarized light source is desirable in signal processing, optical communication, and display applications. Layered semiconductors with reduced in&#8208;plane symmetry have inherent anisotropic excitons that are attractive candidates as polarized dipole emitters. Herein, the demonstration of polarized light&#8208;emitting diode based on anisotropic excitons in few&#8208;layer ReS2, a 2D semiconductor with excitonic transition energy of 1.5&#8211;1.6 eV, is reported. The light&#8208;emitting device is based on minority carrier (hole) injection into n&#8208;type ReS2 through a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) tunnel barrier in a metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;semiconductor (MIS) van der Waals heterostack. Two distinct emission peaks from excitons are observed at near&#8208;infrared wavelength regime from few&#8208;layer ReS2. The emissions exhibit a degree of polarization of 80% reflecting the nearly 1D nature of excitons in ReS2.

      <title>A Self&#8208;Powered Angle Sensor at Nanoradian&#8208;Resolution for Robotic Arms and Personalized Medicare</title>
      <dc:description>
Sensing angular information via the most energy&#8208;efficient method is vitally important. After systematic optimization, a triboelectric self&#8208;powered angle sensor provides high&#8208;quality sensing signals while itself needing neither electric power supply nor a signal&#8208;amplification module. In addition, its feasibility is proved by practical application in a robotic arm, precisely duplicating traditional Chinese calligraphy as well as medical brace monitoring joint motions.








Abstract
As the dominant component for precise motion measurement, angle sensors play a vital role in robotics, machine control, and personalized rehabilitation. Various forms of angle sensors have been developed and optimized over the past decades, but none of them would function without an electric power. Here, a highly sensitive triboelectric self&#8208;powered angle sensor (SPAS) exhibiting the highest resolution (2.03 nano&#8208;radian) after a comprehensive optimization is reported. In addition, the SPAS holds merits of light weight and thin thickness, which enables its extensive integrated applications with minimized energy consumption: a palletizing robotic arm equipped with the SPAS can precisely reproduce traditional Chinese calligraphy via angular data it collects. In addition, the SPAS can be assembled in a medicare brace to record the flexion/extension of joints, which may benefit personalized orthopedic recuperation. The SPAS paves a new approach for applications in the emerging fields of robotics, sensing, personalized medicare, and artificial intelligence.

&lt;p&gt;Sensing angular information via the most energy&#8208;efficient method is vitally important. After systematic optimization, a triboelectric self&#8208;powered angle sensor provides high&#8208;quality sensing signals while itself needing neither electric power supply nor a signal&#8208;amplification module. In addition, its feasibility is proved by practical application in a robotic arm, precisely duplicating traditional Chinese calligraphy as well as medical brace monitoring joint motions.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the dominant component for precise motion measurement, angle sensors play a vital role in robotics, machine control, and personalized rehabilitation. Various forms of angle sensors have been developed and optimized over the past decades, but none of them would function without an electric power. Here, a highly sensitive triboelectric self&#8208;powered angle sensor (SPAS) exhibiting the highest resolution (2.03 nano&#8208;radian) after a comprehensive optimization is reported. In addition, the SPAS holds merits of light weight and thin thickness, which enables its extensive integrated applications with minimized energy consumption: a palletizing robotic arm equipped with the SPAS can precisely reproduce traditional Chinese calligraphy via angular data it collects. In addition, the SPAS can be assembled in a medicare brace to record the flexion/extension of joints, which may benefit personalized orthopedic recuperation. The SPAS paves a new approach for applications in the emerging fields of robotics, sensing, personalized medicare, and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advances in Antimicrobial Microneedle Patches for Combating Infections</title>
      <dc:description>
Antimicrobial microneedle (MN) patches are portable medical devices for combating skin infections. Contrary to conventional topical administration, MNs enhance the bioavailability of antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral therapeutics to skin and eye. These promising armaments release their cargo in controlled release. They can respond to biosignals such as changes in pH and microbial enzyme load at the infection site.








Abstract
Skin infections caused by bacteria, viruses and fungi are difficult to treat by conventional topical administration because of poor drug penetration across the stratum corneum. This results in low bioavailability of drugs to the infection site, as well as the lack of prolonged release. Emerging antimicrobial transdermal and ocular microneedle patches have become promising medical devices for the delivery of various antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral therapeutics. In the present review, skin anatomy and its barriers along with skin infection are discussed. Potential strategies for designing antimicrobial microneedles and their targeted therapy are outlined. Finally, biosensing microneedle patches associated with personalized drug therapy and selective toxicity toward specific microbial species are discussed.

      <title>Ion Exchange Gels Allow Organic Electrochemical Transistor Operation with Hydrophobic Polymers in Aqueous Solution</title>
      <dc:description>
Inserting an ion exchange gel between the hydrophobic polymer active layer of an organic transistor and the aqueous electrolyte enables volumetric doping of the active layer and operation as an organic electrochemical transistor, rather than as an electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect. With the ion gel, the transconductance increases by &#8776;10 000&#215;, enabling the recording of biological action potentials.








Abstract
Conjugated&#8208;polymer&#8208;based organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are being studied for applications ranging from biochemical sensing to neural interfaces. While new polymers that interface digital electronics with the aqueous chemistry of life are being developed, the majority of high&#8208;performance organic transistor materials are poor at transporting biologically relevant ions. Here, the operating mode of an organic transistor is changed from that of an electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistor (EGOFET) to that of an OECT by incorporating an ion exchange gel between the active layer and the aqueous electrolyte. This device works by taking up biologically relevant ions from solution and injecting more hydrophobic ions into the active layer. Using poly[2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;tetradecylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl) thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene] as the active layer and a blend of an ionic liquid, 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) as the ion exchange gel, four orders of magnitude improvement in device transconductance and a 100&#8208;fold increase in kinetics are demonstrated. The ability of the ion&#8208;exchange&#8208;gel OECT to record biological signals by measuring the action potentials of a Venus flytrap is demonstrated. These results show the possibility of using interface engineering to open up a wider palette of organic semiconductors as OECTs that can be gated by aqueous solutions.

      <title>Supramolecular Porous Organic Nanocomposites for Heterogeneous Photocatalysis of a Sulfur Mustard Simulant</title>
      <dc:description>
A supramolecular photosensitizer with efficient intersystem crossing is achieved by combining the spin&#8208;orbit coupling associated with heavy atoms and the photoinduced electron transfer in a donor&#8211;acceptor host&#8211;guest dyad. Incorporation of these supramolecular cationic photosensitizers with anionic polymer matrices generates porous nanocomposites with remarkable photocatalytic performances against sulfur mustard simulant.








Abstract
Efficient heterogeneous photosensitizing materials require both large accessible surface areas and excitons of suitable energies and with well&#8208;defined spin structures. Confinement of the tetracationic cyclophane (ExBox4+) within a nonporous anionic polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) matrix leads to a surface area increase of up to 225 m2 g&#8722;1 in ExBox&#8226;PSS. Efficient intersystem crossing is achieved by combining the spin&#8208;orbit coupling associated to Br heavy atoms in 1,3,5,8&#8208;tetrabromopyrene (TBP), and the photoinduced electron transfer in a TBP&#8834;ExBox4+ supramolecular dyad. The TBP&#8834;ExBox4+ complex displays a charge transfer band at 450 nm and an exciplex emission at 520 nm, indicating the formation of new mixed&#8208;electronic states. The lowest triplet state (T1, 1.89 eV) is localized on the TBP and is close in energy with the charge separated state (CT, 2.14 eV). The homogeneous and heterogeneous photocatalytic activities of the TBP&#8834;ExBox4+, for the elimination of a sulfur mustard simulant, has proved to be significantly more efficient than TBP and ExBox+4, confirming the importance of the newly formed excited&#8208;state manifold in TBP&#8834;ExBox4+ for the population of the low&#8208;lying T1 state. The high stability, facile preparation, and high performance of the TBP&#8834;ExBox&#8226;PSS nanocomposites augur well for the future development of new supramolecular heterogeneous photosensitizers using host&#8211;guest chemistry.

      <title>A High&#8208;Efficiency CoSe Electrocatalyst with Hierarchical Porous Polyhedron Nanoarchitecture for Accelerating Polysulfides Conversion in Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A high&#8208;efficiency CoSe electrocatalyst with hierarchical porous polyhedron nanoarchitecture (CS@HPP) is presented as a sulfur host for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The CS@HPP with high electrical conductivity and abundant active sites can catalytically accelerate capture/diffusion of polysulfides and precipitation/decomposition of Li2S. Consequently, excellent electrochemical performance is synchronously displayed for both slurry&#8208;bladed and freestanding cathodes.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are recognized as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation electrochemical energy storage systems owing to their high energy density and cost&#8208;effective raw materials. However, the sluggish multielectron sulfur redox reactions are the root cause of most of the issues for Li&#8211;S batteries. Herein, a high&#8208;efficiency CoSe electrocatalyst with hierarchical porous nanopolyhedron architecture (CS@HPP) derived from a metal&#8211;organic framework is presented as the sulfur host for Li&#8211;S batteries. The CS@HPP with high crystal quality and abundant reaction active sites can catalytically accelerate capture/diffusion of polysulfides and precipitation/decomposition of Li2S. Thus, the CS@HPP sulfur cathode exhibits an excellent capacity of 1634.9 mAh g&#8722;1, high rate performance, and a long cycle life with a low capacity decay of 0.04% per cycle over 1200 cycles. CoSe nanopolyhedrons are further fabricated on a carbon cloth framework (CC@CS@HPP) to unfold the electrocatalytic activity by its high electrical conductivity and large surface area. A freestanding CC@CS@HPP sulfur cathode with sulfur loading of 8.1 mg cm&#8722;2 delivers a high areal capacity of 8.1 mAh cm&#8722;2 under a lean electrolyte. This work will enlighten the rational design of structure&#8211;catalysis engineering of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based nanomaterials for diverse applications.

      <title>On&#8208;Demand Autophagy Cascade Amplification Nanoparticles Precisely Enhanced Oxaliplatin&#8208;Induced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
An on&#8208;demand autophagy cascade amplification nanoparticle (ASN) is established to intelligently boost oxaliplatin (OXA)&#8208;induced immunotherapy of cancer cells. Upon arrival at tumor site, ASN first releases OXA to trigger tumor immunogenic death and stimulates autophagy. Then ASN can respond to the OXA&#8208;induced autophagy and further overactivate autophagy, which not only leads tumor to autophagic death but also enhances immune cell recruitment.








Abstract
Chemoimmunotherapy&#8208;induced antitumor immune response is highly dependent on tumor autophagy. When tumor cells are treated with chemoimmunotherapy, timely overactivated autophagy can not only lead more tumor cells to death, but also participate in the endogenous antigen presentation and immune stimulators secretion of dying cells, thus plays a vital role. However, timely and accurately overactivated tumor autophagy during chemoimmunotherapy is of great difficulty. Here, an on&#8208;demand autophagy cascade amplification nanoparticle (ASN) is reported to boost oxaliplatin&#8208;induced cancer immunotherapy. ASN is prepared by self&#8208;assemble of autophagy&#8208;responsible C&#8208;TFG micelle and is followed by electrostatic binding of oxaliplatin prodrug (HA&#8208;OXA). After entering tumor cells, the HA&#8208;OXA shell of ASN first responds to the reduction microenvironment and releases oxaliplatin to trigger tumor immunogenic cell death and mildly stimulates tumor autophagy. Then, the exposed C&#8208;TFG micelle can sensitively respond to oxaliplatin&#8208;induced autophagy and release a powerful autophagy inducer STF&#8208;62247, which precisely transforms autophagy to &#8220;overactivated&#8221; condition, leading tumor cells to autophagic death and enhance subsequent tumor antigen processing of the dying cells. In CT26 tumor&#8208;bearing mice, ASN exhibits optimal immune stimulation and antitumor efficiency due to its on&#8208;demand autophagy induction ability.

      <title>Initiating a Reversible Aqueous Zn/Sulfur Battery through a &#8220;Liquid Film&#8221;</title>
      <dc:description>
The first reliable aqueous Zn/S system is activated by a &#8220;liquid film&#8221; comprising an ionic liquid (IL) encapsulated within PEDOT:PSS. CF3SO3&#8722; anions in the IL operate as Zn2+&#8208;transfer channels. The PEDOT:PSS network renders the polysulfide cathode with enhanced structural stability. The Zn/S system delivers extraordinary capacity of 1148 mAh g&#8722;1 and overwhelming energy density of 724.7&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1cathode at 0.3 Ag&#8722;1.








Abstract
Sulfur cathodes have been under intensive study in various systems, such as Li/S, Na/S, Mg/S, and Al/S batteries. However, to date, Zn/S chemistry has never been reported. The first reliable aqueous Zn/polysulfide system activated by a &#8220;liquid film&#8221; comprising 4&#8208;(3&#8208;butyl&#8208;1&#8208;imidazolio)&#8208;1&#8208;butanesulfoni ionic liquid (IL) encapsulated within PEDOT:PSS. CF3SO3&#8722; anions in the IL operating as Zn2+&#8208;transfer channels is reported. Moreover, the PEDOT:PSS network retains the IL, which renders Zn2+&#8208;transfer channels and a polysulfide cathode with enhanced structural stability. The Zn/polysulfide system delivers extraordinary capacity of 1148 mAh g&#8722;1 and overwhelming energy density of 724.7&#8201;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1cathode at 0.3 Ag&#8722;1. During the discharging phase, S62&#8722; is dominantly reduced by Zn to S2&#8722; (S6&#8197; &#8594; &#8197;S2&#8722;). During the charging phase, these short chains are oxidized to form long&#8208;chain ZnxLiyS3&#8208;6. A further optimized high&#8208;concentrated salt electrolyte is used to improve the reversibility of the battery, demonstrating an extended lifetime over 1600 cycles at 1 Ag&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 204 mAh g&#8722;1. This facile approach and the superior performance of the developed aqueous Zn/S chemistry provide a new platform for sulfur&#8208;based battery and potentially solve the problems of other metal/sulfur batteries.

      <title>Understanding the Effect of Crystalline Structural Transformation for Lead&#8208;Free Inorganic Halide Perovskites</title>
      <dc:description>
Silver atoms incorporated into the inorganic halide perovskite Cs3Bi2Br9 to form Cs2AgBiBr6 eliminates the strong localization of electron&#8211;hole pairs and makes the electronic bands distribution more dispersible and further changes the photoelectric properties including band structure, exciton binding energy, charge carrier mobility, and carrier relaxation lifetime, which lead to a remarkable enhancement in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible light.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free inorganic halide perovskites have triggered appealing interests in various energy&#8208;related applications including solar cells and photocatalysis. However, why perovskite&#8208;structured materials exhibit excellent photoelectric properties and how the unique crystalline structures affect the charge behaviors are still not well elucidated but essentially desired. Herein, taking inorganic halide perovskite Cs3Bi2Br9 as a prototype, the significant derivation process of silver atoms incorporation to induce the structural transformation from Cs3Bi2Br9 to Cs2AgBiBr6, which brings about dramatic differences in photoelectric properties is unraveled. It is demonstrated that the silver incorporation results in the co&#8208;operated orbitals hybridization, which makes the electronic distributions in conduction and valence bands of Cs2AgBiBr6 more dispersible, eliminating the strong localization of electron&#8211;hole pairs. As consequences of the electronic structures derivation, exhilarating changes in photoelectric properties like band structure, exciton binding energy, and charge carrier dynamics are verified experimentally and theoretically. Using photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity under visible light as a typical evaluation, such crystalline structure transformation contributes to a more than 100&#8208;fold enhancement in photocatalytic performances compared with pristine Cs3Bi2Br9, verifying the significant effect of structural derivations on the exhibited performances. The findings will provide evidences for understanding the origin of photoelectric properties for perovskites semiconductors in solar energy conversion.

      <title>A Highly Crystalline Perylene Imide Polymer with the Robust Built&#8208;In Electric Field for Efficient Photocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>
A crystalline perylene imide polymer photocatalyst with the highest oxygen evolution performance is achieved. The polymer can be reused over 100 h without any decrease in performance overcoming the poor stability of the organic photocatalysts. The superior photocatalytic performance comes from the suitable energy band and the robust built&#8208;in electric field contributed by the highly crystallinity and large molecular dipole.








Abstract
A highly crystalline perylene imide polymer (Urea&#8208;PDI) photocatalyst is successfully constructed. The Urea&#8208;PDI presents a wide spectrum response owing to its large conjugated system. The Urea&#8208;PDI performs so far highest oxygen evolution rate (3223.9 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) without cocatalysts under visible light. The performance is over 107.5 times higher than that of the conventional PDI supramolecular photocatalysts. The strong oxidizing ability comes from the deep valence band (+1.52 eV) which is contributed by the covalent&#8208;bonded conjugated molecules. Besides, the high crystallinity and the large molecular dipoles of the Urea&#8208;PDI contribute to a robust built&#8208;in electric field promoting the separation and transportation of photogenerated carriers. Moreover, the Urea&#8208;PDI is very stable and has no performance attenuation after 100 h continuous irradiation. The Urea&#8208;PDI polymer photocatalyst provides with a new platform for the use of photocatalytic water oxidation, which is expected to contribute to clean energy production.

      <title>A Graphdiyne Oxide&#8208;Based Iron Sponge with Photothermally Enhanced Tumor&#8208;Specific Fenton Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
A tumor targeting iron sponge (TTIS) based on graphdiyne oxide is fabricated with controlled iron release. The TTIS can accumulate in tumor tissue to achieve a photoacoustic&#8208; and magnetic resonance tumor imaging and simultaneously escort an efficient tumor therapy via photothermally enhanced Fenton chemistry.








Abstract
Fenton reaction&#8208;mediated oncotherapy is an emerging strategy which uses iron ions to catalytically convert endogenous hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radicals, the most reactive oxygen species found in biology, for efficient cancer therapy. However, Fenton reaction efficiency in tumor tissue is typically limited due to restrictive conditions. One strategy to overcome this obstacle is to increase the temperature specifically at the tumor site.

&lt;p&gt;A tumor targeting iron sponge (TTIS) based on graphdiyne oxide is fabricated with controlled iron release. The TTIS can accumulate in tumor tissue to achieve a photoacoustic&#8208; and magnetic resonance tumor imaging and simultaneously escort an efficient tumor therapy via photothermally enhanced Fenton chemistry.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fenton reaction&#8208;mediated oncotherapy is an emerging strategy which uses iron ions to catalytically convert endogenous hydrogen peroxide into hydroxyl radicals, the most reactive oxygen species found in biology, for efficient cancer therapy. However, Fenton reaction efficiency in tumor tissue is typically limited due to restrictive conditions. One strategy to overcome this obstacle is to increase the temperature specifically at the tumor site. Herein, a tumor&#8208;targeting iron sponge (TTIS) nanocomposite based on graphdiyne oxide, which has a high affinity for iron is described. TTIS can accumulate in tumor tissue by decoration with a tumor&#8208;targeting polymer to enable tumor photoacoustic and magnetic resonance imaging. With its excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (37.5%), TTIS is an efficient photothermal therapy (PTT) agent. Moreover, the heat produced in the process of PTT can accelerate the release of iron ions from TTIS and simultaneously enhance the efficiency of the Fenton reaction, thus achieving a combined PTT and Fenton reaction&#8208;mediated cancer therapy. This work introduces a graphdiyne oxide&#8208;based iron sponge that exerts an enhanced antitumor effect through PTT and Fenton chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Variant Solid Solutions Cs2Sn1&#8211;xTexCl6: Bright Luminescence and High Anti&#8208;Water Stability</title>
      <dc:description>
Cs2Sn1&#8722;xTexCl6 exhibits excellent moisture and thermal stability (upon 618 oC) and near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (95.4%), which is caused by the combination of Te luminescent center and Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8208;like self&#8208;trapped excitons. There is no photoluminescence degradation even after 360 min of soaking in water. The good stability is due to the large decomposition enthalpy and formation of amorphous alteration phase.








Abstract
Underwater lighting is important for the exploration of the underwater world in different areas. It is of great significance for developing underwater emitters with high penetrability, high luminous efficiency, good anti&#8208;water stability, and environmental friendliness. Stable lead&#8208;free perovskite luminescent materials, represented by vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskites, are worthy of research because they can almost meet the above requirements. Here, lead&#8208;free perovskite variant solid solutions with the formula of Cs2Sn1&#8722;xTexCl6 are reported. Upon the exchange of Sn/Te ions, strong Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion of octahedra occurs in the lattice structure. The combination of Te luminescent center and Jahn&#8211;Teller&#8208;like self&#8208;trapped excitons gives this material yellow&#8208;green luminescence with a wavelength of 580 nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 95.4%. Moreover, these solid solutions can withstand the extreme conditions of immersion in water probably due to the formation of amorphous alteration phase. Such good anti&#8208;water stability is also supported by the molecule dynamics simulation result that no reaction occurs on the water/Cs2SnCl6 interface. The high luminous, suitable wavelength, and good anti&#8208;water stability enable the solid solutions suitable for the application for underwater lighting.

      <title>Bulk Spin Torque&#8208;Driven Perpendicular Magnetization Switching in L10 FePt Single Layer</title>
      <dc:description>
Bulk spin torque&#8208;driven perpendicular magnetization switching in an L10 FePt single&#8208;layer arises from an inherent structural gradient and exhibits great potential for removing the fundamental obstacles faced by conventional spin&#8211;orbit torque devices, such as thermal stability issues and complexity issues regarding three&#8208;terminal operation.








Abstract
Due to its inherent superior perpendicular magnetocrystalline anisotropy, the FePt in L10 phase enables magnetic storage and memory devices with ultrahigh capacity. However, reversing the FePt magnetic state, and therefore encoding information, has proven to be extremely difficult. Here, it is demonstrated that an electric current can exert a large spin torque on an L10 FePt magnet, ultimately leading to reversible magnetization switching. The spin torque monotonically increases with increasing FePt thickness, exhibiting a bulk characteristic. Meanwhile, the spin torque effective fields and switching efficiency increase as the FePt approaches higher chemical ordering with stronger spin&#8211;orbit coupling. The symmetry breaking that generates spin torque within L10 FePt is shown to arise from an inherent structural gradient along the film normal direction. By artificially reversing the structural gradient, an opposite spin torque effect in L10 FePt is demonstrated. At last, the role of the disorder gradient in generating a substantial torque in a single ferromagnet is supported by theoretical calculations. These results will push forward the frontier of material systems for generating spin torques and will have a transformative impact on magnetic storage and spin memory devices with simple architecture, ultrahigh density, and readily application.

      <dc:description>
The impact of molecular/ionic fillers on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) blends&#8217; triboelectric performance is investigated through systematic material engineering, and characterization of PVA blends at different structure levels. Self&#8208;powered devices built with optimized PVA&#8211;gelatin composite films are capable of detecting the imperceptible degree of skin deformation induced by the human pulse and capture the cardiovascular information encoded in the pulse signals.








Abstract
The capability of sensor systems to efficiently scavenge their operational power from stray, weak environmental energies through sustainable pathways could enable viable schemes for self&#8208;powered health diagnostics and therapeutics. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) can effectively transform the otherwise wasted environmental, mechanical energy into electrical power. Recent advances in TENGs have resulted in a significant boost in output performance. However, obstacles hindering the development of efficient triboelectric devices based on biocompatible materials continue to prevail. Being one of the most widely used polymers for biomedical applications, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) presents exciting opportunities for biocompatible, wearable TENGs. Here, the holistic engineering and systematic characterization of the impact of molecular and ionic fillers on PVA blends&#8217; triboelectric performance is presented for the first time. Triboelectric devices built with optimized PVA&#8208;gelatin composite films exhibit stable and robust triboelectricity outputs. Such wearable devices can detect the imperceptible skin deformation induced by the human pulse and capture the cardiovascular information encoded in the pulse signals with high fidelity. The gained fundamental understanding and demonstrated capabilities enable the rational design and holistic engineering of novel materials for more capable biocompatible triboelectric devices that can continuously monitor vital physiological signals for self&#8208;powered health diagnostics and therapeutics.

      <title>Gradient&#8208;Concentration Design of Stable Core&#8211;Shell Nanostructure for Acidic Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Highly active Pt&#8211;Ni@PtD/G catalysts with extraordinary stability for acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are synthesized by a gradient&#8208;concentration strategy (i.e., starting with facile galvanic replacement followed by partial dealloying). The optimal &#8220;armor&#8221; with active and dense locally concave Pt atomic sites is responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity and stability in acidic ORR.








Abstract
Manipulating the surface structure of electrocatalysts at the atomic level is of primary importance to simultaneously achieve the activity and stability dual&#8208;criteria in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Here, a durable acidic ORR electrocatalyst with the &#8220;defective&#8208;armored&#8221; structure of Pt shell and Pt&#8211;Ni core nanoparticle decorated on graphene (Pt&#8211;Ni@PtD/G) using a facile and controllable galvanic replacement reaction to generate gradient distribution of Pt&#8211;Ni composition from surface to interior, followed by a partial dealloying approach, leaching the minor nickel atoms on the surface to generate defective Pt skeleton shell, is reported. The Pt&#8211;Ni@PtD/G catalyst shows impressive performance for ORR in acidic (0.1 m HClO4) electrolyte, with a high mass activity of threefold higher than that of Pt/C catalyst owing to the tuned electronic structure of locally concave Pt surface sites through synergetic contributions of Pt&#8211;Ni core and defective Pt shell. More importantly, the electrochemically active surface areas still retain 96% after 20&#8239;000 potential cycles, attributing to the Pt atomic shell acting as the protective &#8220;armor&#8221; to prevent interior Ni atoms from further dissolution during the long&#8208;term operation.

The extension of the conjugated antenna units relating transition from high order singlet excited states in heavy atom&#8208;free chromophores greatly enhances the phosphorescence rate (kp) without a large increase of vibration&#8208;based radiationless transition rate (knr(RT)) with large triplet yield, which results in the room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) yield (&#934;p(RT)) of 50% as well as the RTP lifetime (&#964;p(RT)) of 1.0 s.








Abstract
Persistent (lifetime &gt; 100 ms) room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (pRTP) is important for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art security and bioimaging applications. An unclear relationship between chromophores and physical parameters relating to pRTP has prevented obtaining an RTP yield of over 50% and a lifetime over 1 s. Here highly efficient pRTP is reported under ambient conditions from heavy atom&#8208;free chromophores. A heavy atom&#8208;free aromatic core substituted with a long&#8208;conjugated amino group considerably accelerates the phosphorescence rate independent of the intramolecular vibration&#8208;based nonradiative rate from the lowest excited triplet state. One of the designed heavy atom&#8208;free dopant chromophores presents an RTP yield of 50% with a lifetime of 1 s under ambient conditions. The afterglow brightness under strong excitation is at least 104 times stronger than that of conventional long&#8208;persistent luminescence emitters. Here it is shown that highly efficient pRTP materials allow for high&#8208;resolution gated emission with a size of the diffraction limit using small&#8208;scale and low&#8208;cost photodetectors.

      <title>2D Inorganic Bimolecular Crystals with Strong In&#8208;Plane Anisotropy for Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optics</title>
      <dc:description>
For the first time, 2D inorganic bimolecular crystals SbI3&#183;3S8 nanobelts are successfully prepared by a facile vertical microspacing sublimation strategy. The SbI3&#183;3S8 nanobelts show strong in&#8208;plane optical anisotropy with high dichroic ratio up to 3.9 due to the anisotropy of phonon vibrations and intramolecular vibrations. Moreover, the second harmonic generation intensity of SbI3&#183;3S8 nanobelts exhibits a great dependence on excitation wavelength and crystalline orientation.








Abstract
2D inorganic bimolecular crystals, consisting of two different inorganic molecules, are expected to possess novel physical and chemical properties due to the synergistic effect of the individual components. However, 2D inorganic bimolecular crystals remain unexploited because of the difficulties in preparation arising from non&#8208;typical layered structures and intricate intermolecular interactions. Here, the synthesis of 2D inorganic bimolecular crystal SbI3&#183;3S8 nanobelts via a facile vertical microspacing sublimation strategy is reported. The as&#8208;synthesized SbI3&#183;3S8 nanobelts exhibit strong in&#8208;plane anisotropy of phonon vibrations and intramolecular vibrations as well as show anisotropic light absorption with a high dichroism ratio of 3.9. Furthermore, it is revealed that the second harmonic generation intensity of SbI3&#183;3S8 nanobelts is highly dependent on the excitation wavelength and crystallographic orientation. This work can inspire the growth of more 2D inorganic bimolecular crystals and excite potential applications for bimolecular optoelectronic devices.

      <title>Mechanically Robust, Elastic, and Healable Ionogels for Highly Sensitive Ultra&#8208;Durable Ionic Skins</title>
      <dc:description>
Highly sensitive ultra&#8208;durable ionic skins are fabricated by impregnating ionic liquids into a mechanically robust poly(urea&#8208;urethane) network. Even after being stored in open air for 200 days, the I&#8208;skins exhibit a highly reproducible electrical response over 10 000 uninterrupted strain cycles. The fractured I&#8208;skin can be easily healed to regain their original sensing performance.








Abstract
The fabrication of highly durable skin&#8208;mimicking sensors remains challenging because of the unavoidable fatigue and physical damage that sensors are subjected to in practical applications. In this study, ultra&#8208;durable ionic skins (I&#8208;skins) with excellent healability and high sensitivity are fabricated by impregnating ionic liquids (ILs) into a mechanically robust poly(urea&#8208;urethane) (PU) network. The PU network is composed of crystallized poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) and flexible poly(ethylene glycol) that are dynamically cross&#8208;linked with hindered urea bonds and hydrogen bonds. Such a design endows the resultant ionogels with high mechanical strength, good elasticity, Young's modulus similar to that of natural skin, and excellent healability. The ionogel&#8208;based I&#8208;skins exhibit a high sensitivity to a wide range of strains (0.1&#8211;300%) and pressures (0.1&#8211;20 kPa). Importantly, the I&#8208;skins show a highly reproducible electrical response over 10 000 uninterrupted strain cycles. The sensing performance of the I&#8208;skins stored in open air for 200 days is almost the same as that of the freshly prepared I&#8208;skin. The fractured I&#8208;skins can be easily healed by heating at 65 &#176;C that restores their original ultra&#8208;durable sensing performance. The long&#8208;term durability of the I&#8208;skins is attributed to the combination of non&#8208;volatility of the ILs, excellent healability, and well&#8208;designed mechanical properties.

      <title>Heterostructures Built in Metal Hydrides for Advanced Hydrogen Storage Reversibility</title>
      <dc:description>
A facile strategy to effectively improve the reversible hydrogen storage performance of Mg(BH4)2 is realized herein by building heterostructures uniformly inside MgH2 nanoparticles. MgH2 acts as a hydrogen pump, which changes the nature of the initial formation of B&#63743;H bonds from endothermic to exothermic process via breaking stable B&#8211;B bonds and hence thermodynamically improves the reversibility of Mg(BH4)2.








Abstract
Hydrogen storage is a vital technology for developing on&#8208;board hydrogen fuel cells. While Mg(BH4)2 is widely regarded as a promising hydrogen storage material owing to its extremely high gravimetric and volumetric capacity, its poor reversibility poses a major bottleneck inhibiting its practical applications. Herein, a facile strategy to effectively improve the reversible hydrogen storage performance of Mg(BH4)2 via building heterostructures uniformly inside MgH2 nanoparticles is reported. The in situ reaction between MgH2 nanoparticles and B2H6 not only forms homogeneous heterostructures with controllable particle size but also simultaneously decreases the particle size of the MgH2 nanoparticles inside, which effectively reduces the kinetic barrier that inhibits the reversible hydrogen storage in both Mg(BH4)2 and MgH2. More importantly, density functional theory coupled with ab initio molecular dynamics calculations clearly demonstrates that MgH2 in this heterostructure can act as a hydrogen pump, which drastically changes the enthalpy for the initial formation of B&#63743;H bonds by breaking stable B&#63743;B bonds from endothermic to exothermic and hence thermodynamically improves the reversibility of Mg(BH4)2. It is believed that building heterostructures provides a window of opportunity for discovering high&#8208;performance hydrogen storage materials for on&#8208;board applications.

      <title>Metal Atom&#8208;Doped Co3O4 Hierarchical Nanoplates for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
Metal atom&#8208;doped Co3O4 hierarchical nanoplates constructed by ultrathin nanosheets are synthesized by a cooperative etching&#8722;coordination&#8722;reorganization approach. The method allows doping of 13 metal elements in total. With the structural and compositional advantages, as an example, the Fe&#8208;doped Co3O4 hierarchical nanoplates exhibit greatly enhanced electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution.








Abstract
Electrocatalysts based on hierarchically structured and heteroatom&#8208;doped non&#8208;noble metal oxide materials are of great importance for efficient and low&#8208;cost electrochemical water splitting systems. Herein, the synthesis of a series of hierarchical hollow nanoplates (NPs) composed of ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets doped with 13 different metal atoms is reported. The synthesis involves a cooperative etching&#8722;coordination&#8722;reorganization approach starting from zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) NPs. First, metal atom decorated ZIF&#8208;67 NPs with unique cross&#8208;channels are formed through a Lewis acid etching and metal species coordination process. Afterward, the composite NPs are converted to hollow Co3O4 hierarchical NPs composed of ultrathin nanosheets through a solvothermal reaction, during which the guest metal species is doped into the octahedral sites of Co3O4. Density functional theory calculations suggest that doping of small amount of Fe atoms near the surface of Co3O4 can greatly enhance the electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from the structural and compositional advantages, the obtained Fe&#8208;doped Co3O4 hierarchical NPs manifest superior electrocatalytic performance for OER with an overpotential of 262 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, a Tafel slope of 43 mV dec&#8722;1, and excellent stability even at a high current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 for 50 h.

First, metal atom decorated ZIF&#8208;67 NPs with unique cross&#8208;channels are formed through a Lewis acid etching and metal species coordination process. Afterward, the composite NPs are converted to hollow Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; hierarchical NPs composed of ultrathin nanosheets through a solvothermal reaction, during which the guest metal species is doped into the octahedral sites of Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Density functional theory calculations suggest that doping of small amount of Fe atoms near the surface of Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can greatly enhance the electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from the structural and compositional advantages, the obtained Fe&#8208;doped Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; hierarchical NPs manifest superior electrocatalytic performance for OER with an overpotential of 262 mV at 10 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a Tafel slope of 43 mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and excellent stability even at a high current density of 100 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 50 h.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Robust Fabrication of Hybrid Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Pellets for Stable X&#8208;Ray Detectors with Low Detection Limit</title>
      <dc:description>
MA3Bi2I9 polycrystalline pellets (PPs) are fabricated by the robust, cost effective, and scalable cold isostatic&#8208;pressing approach, and X&#8208;ray detectors based on MA3Bi2I9&#8208;PPs reach a limit of detection (LoD) of 9.3 nGyair s&#8722;1. The low LoD of the X&#8208;ray detectors can obviously decrease the radiation dose used, thereby reducing health risks in medical diagnostics and security screening.








Abstract
X&#8208;ray detectors are widely utilized in medical diagnostics and nondestructive product inspection. Halide perovskites are recently demonstrated as excellent candidates for direct X&#8208;ray detection. However, it is still challenging to obtain high quality perovskites with millimeter&#8208;thick over a large area for high performance, stable X&#8208;ray detectors. Here, methylammonium bismuth iodide (MA3Bi2I9) polycrystalline pellets (PPs) are developed by a robust, cost effective, and scalable cold isostatic&#8208;pressing for fabricating X&#8208;ray detectors with low limit of detection (LoD) and superior operational stability. The MA3Bi2I9&#8208;PPs possess a high resistivity of 2.28 &#215; 1011 &#937; cm and low dark carrier concentration of &#8776;107 cm&#8722;3, and balanced mobility of &#8776;2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for electrons and holes. These merits enable a sensitivity of 563 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, a detection efficiency of 28.8%, and an LoD of 9.3 nGyair s&#8722;1 for MA3Bi2I9&#8208;PPs detectors, and the LoD is much lower than the dose rate required for X&#8208;ray diagnostics used currently (5.5 &#956;Gyair s&#8722;1). In addition, the MA3Bi2I9&#8208;PPs detectors work stably under high working bias field up to 2000 V cm&#8722;1 after sensing an integrated dose &gt;320 Gyair with continuous X&#8208;ray radiation, demonstrating its competitive advantage in practical application. These findings provide an approach to explore a new generation of low LoD, stable and green X&#8208;ray detectors based on MA3Bi2I9&#8208;PPs.

      <title>Perovskite Granular Wire Photodetectors with Ultrahigh Photodetectivity</title>
      <dc:description>
Perovskite granular wires synthesized by a simple yet effective template&#8208;free self&#8208;assembly exhibit superior photodetecting performance with unprecedentedly high photodetectivity, originating from a low dark current due to band&#8208;edge modulation along the long axis of the granular wires.

Abstract
Control over the morphology and crystallinity of metal halide perovskite materials is of key importance to enable high&#8208;performance optoelectronics. Here, a simple yet effective template&#8208;free self&#8208;assembly synthesis of perovskite granular wires with ultrahigh photodetectivity (3.17 &#215; 1015 Jones) is reported. The 1D self&#8208;assembly of perovskite grains is driven by differences in the surface interaction energies of the granular facets. The superb photodetecting performance originates from extremely low dark current engendered by energetic barriers featuring unique band&#8208;edge modulation along the long axis of wire. Flexible photodetector arrays, fabricated by selectively placing perovskite granular wires onto pre&#8208;patterned electrode arrays on a transparent polymer substrate, show independently addressable photonic signal mapping with remarkably high detectivity, photoconductive gain, and responsivity. The &#8220;self&#8208;assembled nanograin engineering&#8221; strategy developed in this study provides a viable method for the development of high&#8208;performance perovskite photodetectors and can be extended to other integrated optoelectronic systems.

      <title>Nonvolatile Electrically Reconfigurable Integrated Photonic Switch Enabled by a Silicon PIN Diode Heater</title>
      <dc:description>
Nonvolatile electrically reconfigurable photonic switches based on phase&#8208;change material&#8208;clad silicon waveguides and microring resonators are demonstrated via in situ silicon PIN diode heaters. Low&#8208;energy, compact, low&#8208;loss, low&#8208;voltage, and high&#8208;cyclability operations at moderate speeds are obtained in a complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;compatible process, promising very large&#8208;scale programmable electronic&#8211;photonic systems such as optical neural networks and general&#8208;purpose integrated photonic processors.








Abstract
Reconfigurability of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has become increasingly important due to the growing demands for electronic&#8211;photonic systems on a chip driven by emerging applications, including neuromorphic computing, quantum information, and microwave photonics. Success in these fields usually requires highly scalable photonic switching units as essential building blocks. Current photonic switches, however, mainly rely on materials with weak, volatile thermo&#8208;optic or electro&#8208;optic modulation effects, resulting in large footprints and high energy consumption. As a promising alternative, chalcogenide phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) exhibit strong optical modulation in a static, self&#8208;holding fashion, but the scalability of present PCM&#8208;integrated photonic applications is still limited by the poor optical or electrical actuation approaches. Here, with phase transitions actuated by in situ silicon PIN diode heaters, scalable nonvolatile electrically reconfigurable photonic switches using PCM&#8208;clad silicon waveguides and microring resonators are demonstrated. As a result, intrinsically compact and energy&#8208;efficient switching units operated with low driving voltages, near&#8208;zero additional loss, and reversible switching with high endurance are obtained in a complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;compatible process. This work can potentially enable very large&#8208;scale CMOS&#8208;integrated programmable electronic&#8211;photonic systems such as optical neural networks and general&#8208;purpose integrated photonic processors.

      <title>Boosting Neutral Water Oxidation through Surface Oxygen Modulation</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel design of efficient neutral oxygen evolution reaction catalyst is demonstrated by incorporating hydrated metal cations (Ca2+) into Ru&#8211;Ir binary oxide. The obtained Ru&#8211;Ir&#8211;Ca oxide catalyst on glassy carbon electrode achieves 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at a low overpotential of 250 mV, and its turnover frequency is about 2&#8208;, 7&#8208;, and 45&#8208;times higher than those of Ru&#8211;Ir oxide, RuO2, and IrO2 catalysts, respectively.








Abstract
Developing efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in pH&#8208;neutral electrolyte is crucial for microbial electrolysis cells and electrochemical CO2 reduction. Unfortunately, the OER kinetics in neutral electrolyte is sluggish due to the low concentration of adsorbed reactants, with overpotentials of neutral OER at present much higher than that in acidic or alkaline electrolyte. Here, hydrated metal cations (Ca2+) are sought to be incorporated into the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ru&#8211;Ir binary oxide to tailor the surface oxygen environments (lattice&#8208;oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species) for efficient neutral OER. Using a sol&#8211;gel method, ternary Ru&#8211;Ir&#8211;Ca oxides are synthesized in atomically homogenous manner, and the obtained catalyst on glassy carbon electrode achieves 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at a low overpotential of 250 mV, with no degradation for 200 h of operation. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ 18O isotope&#8208;labeling differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, and 18O isotope&#8208;labeling secondary ion mass spectroscopy studies are carried out. The results reveal that incorporation of Ca2+ can enhance the covalency of metal&#8211;oxygen bonds and the electrophilic nature of surface metal&#8208;bonded oxygen sites; and simultaneously facilitate the adsorption of water molecules on catalyst surface, which accelerates the lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;involved reaction, thus improving the overall OER performance of RuIrCaOx catalyst.

In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O isotope&#8208;labeling differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O isotope&#8208;labeling secondary ion mass spectroscopy studies are carried out. The results reveal that incorporation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can enhance the covalency of metal&#8211;oxygen bonds and the electrophilic nature of surface metal&#8208;bonded oxygen sites; and simultaneously facilitate the adsorption of water molecules on catalyst surface, which accelerates the lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;involved reaction, thus improving the overall OER performance of RuIrCaO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;

      <title>High&#8208;Performance and Reliable Lead&#8208;Free Layered&#8208;Perovskite Transistors</title>
      <dc:description>
Universal approaches for high&#8208;performance and reliable p&#8208;channel lead&#8208;free phenethylammonium tin iodide perovskite&#8208;based transistors are developed, including self&#8208;passivation for grain boundary by excess phenethylammonium iodide, crystallization control by adduct, and iodide vacancy passivation through oxygen treatment. The first complementary inverter is also demonstrated combined with n&#8208;channel indium gallium zinc oxide transistors.








Abstract
Perovskites have been intensively investigated for their use in solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, research on their applications in thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) has drawn less attention despite their high intrinsic charge carrier mobility. In this study, the universal approaches for high&#8208;performance and reliable p&#8208;channel lead&#8208;free phenethylammonium tin iodide TFTs are reported. These include self&#8208;passivation for grain boundary by excess phenethylammonium iodide, grain crystallization control by adduct, and iodide vacancy passivation through oxygen treatment. It is found that the grain boundary passivation can increase TFT reproducibility and reliability, and the grain size enlargement can hike the TFT performance, thus, enabling the first perovskite&#8208;based complementary inverter demonstration with n&#8208;channel indium gallium zinc oxide TFTs. The inverter exhibits a high gain over 30 with an excellent noise margin. This work aims to provide widely applicable and repeatable methods to make the gate more open for intensive efforts toward high&#8208;performance printed perovskite TFTs.

      <title>Controlling Enamel Remineralization by Amyloid&#8208;Like Amelogenin Mimics</title>
      <dc:description>
The amyloid&#8208;like proteinaceous nanofilm entrapping peptide can mimic amelogenin matrix in nature, mediating the oriented array of amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles and their transformation to ordered enamel&#8208;like hydroxyapatite (HAp) crystals. This technology can reproduce the growth of ordered HAp crystals, with the nearly identical mechanical strength to natural enamel, thus providing a promising strategy for treating dental caries.








Abstract
In situ regeneration of the enamel&#8208;like structure of hydroxyapatite (HAp) crystals under oral conditions is significant for dental caries treatment. However, it is still a challenge for dentists to duplicate the elegant and well&#8208;aligned apatite structure bonding to the surface of demineralized enamel. A biocompatible amelogenin&#8208;inspired matrix, a phasetransited lysozyme (PTL) film mimicking an N&#8208;terminal amelogenin with central domain (N&#8208;Ame) combined with synthetic peptide (C&#8208;AMG) based on the functional domains of C&#8208;terminal telopeptide (C&#8208;Ame) is shown here, which is formed by amyloid&#8208;like lysozyme aggregation at the enamel interface through a rapid one&#8208;step aqueous coating process. In the PTL/C&#8208;AMG matrix, C&#8208;AMG facilitated the oriented arrangement of amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) nanoparticles and their transformation to ordered enamel&#8208;like HAp crystals, while PTL served as a strong interfacial anchor to immobilize the C&#8208;AMG peptide and PTL/C&#8208;AMG matrix on versatile substrate surfaces. PTL/C&#8208;AMG film&#8208;coated enamel induced both of the in vivo and in vitro synthesis of HAp crystals, facilitated epitaxial growth of HAp crystals and recovered the highly oriented structure and mechanical properties to levels nearly identical to those of natural enamel. This work underlines the importance of amyloid&#8208;like protein aggregates in the biomineralization of enamel, providing a promising strategy for treating dental caries.

      <title>Self&#8208;Repairing Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells with a Breakthrough Efficiency Over 11%</title>
      <dc:description>
Phenylhydrazine hydrochloride is introduced into FASnI3 (FA = NH2CH = NH2+)&#8208;based perovskite solar cells in order to reduce the existing Sn4+ and prevent the further degradation of FASnI3. Consequently, the champion device shows a high power conversion efficiency up to 11.4%, a long&#8208;term storage stability over 2300 h, and an efficiency recovery capability after being exposed to air.








Abstract
The development of tin (Sn)&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is hindered by their lower power conversion efficiency and poorer stability compared to the lead&#8208;based ones, which arise from the easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+. Herein, phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (PHCl) is introduced into FASnI3 (FA = NH2CH = NH2+) perovskite films to reduce the existing Sn4+ and prevent the further degradation of FASnI3, since PHCl has a reductive hydrazino group and a hydrophobic phenyl group. Consequently, the device achieves a record power conversion efficiency of 11.4% for lead&#8208;free PSCs. Besides, the unencapsulated device displays almost no efficiency reduction in a glove box over 110 days and shows efficiency recovery after being exposed to air, due to a proposed self&#8208;repairing trap state passivation process.

      <title>Stable and Biocompatible Carbon Nanotube Ink Mediated by Silk Protein for Printed Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
A highly stable and biocompatible conductive ink is developed based on carbon nanotubes and natural silk sericin. Owing to its high electrical conductivity, high colloidal stability, and good biocompatibility, this ink holds great potential in flexible and wearable electronics.








Abstract
Ink&#8208;based processes, which enable scalable fabrication of flexible devices based on nanomaterials, are one of the practical approaches for the production of wearable electronics. However, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which possess great potential for flexible electronics, are facing challenges for use in inks due to their low dispersity in most solvents and suspicious cytotoxicity. Here, a stable and biocompatible CNT ink, which is stabilized by sustainable silk sericin and free from any artificial chemicals, is reported. The ink shows stability up to months, which can be attributed to the formation of sericin&#8211;CNT (SSCNT) hybrid through non&#8208;covalent interactions. It is demonstrated that the SSCNT ink can be used for fabricating versatile circuits on textile, paper, and plastic films through various techniques. As proofs of concept, electrocardiogram electrodes, breath sensors, and electrochemical sensors for monitoring human health and activity are fabricated, demonstrating the great potential of the SSCNT ink for smart wearables.

      <title>Unveiling the Fine Structural Distortion of Atomically Thin Bi2O2Se by Third&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
      <dc:description>
Unveiling fine structural distortions, especially the oxygen rotation/tilt, is important to in&#8208;depth understanding of the physical properties of complex oxides. However, most available techniques are either time consuming or requiring tedious sample treatment. This work reports a noninvasive and highly&#8208;sensitive method based on third&#8208;harmonic generation to successfully reveal the oxygen square rotation &lt;1.4&#176; in 2D centrosymmetric Bi2O2Se.








Abstract
Bismuth oxyselenide (Bi2O2Se), a new type of 2D material, has recently attracted increased attention due to its robust bandgap, stability under ambient conditions, and ultrahigh electron mobility. In such complex oxides, fine structural distortion tends to play a decisive role in determining the unique physical properties, such as the ferrorotational order, ferroelectricity, and magnetoelasticity. Therefore, an in&#8208;depth investigation of the fine structural symmetry of Bi2O2Se is necessary to exploit its potential applications. However, conventional techniques are either time consuming or requiring tedious sample treatment. Herein, a noninvasive and high&#8208;throughput approach is reported for characterizing the fine structural distortion in 2D centrosymmetric Bi2O2Se by polarization&#8208;dependent third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG). Unprecedentedly, the divergence between the experimental results and the theoretical prediction of the perpendicular component of polarization&#8208;dependent THG indicates a fine structural distortion, namely, a &lt;1.4&#176; rotation of the oxygen square in the tetragonal (Bi2O2) layers. This rotation breaks the intrinsic mirror symmetry of 2D Bi2O2Se, eventually reducing the symmetry from the D4h to the C4h point group. The results demonstrate that THG is highly sensitive to even fine symmetry variations, thereby showing its potential to uncover hidden phase transitions and interacting polarized sublattices in novel 2D material systems.

Unprecedentedly, the divergence between the experimental results and the theoretical prediction of the perpendicular component of polarization&#8208;dependent THG indicates a fine structural distortion, namely, a &amp;lt;1.4&#176; rotation of the oxygen square in the tetragonal (Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) layers. This rotation breaks the intrinsic mirror symmetry of 2D Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se, eventually reducing the symmetry from the D&lt;sub&gt;4h&lt;/sub&gt; to the C&lt;sub&gt;4h&lt;/sub&gt; point group. The results demonstrate that THG is highly sensitive to even fine symmetry variations, thereby showing its potential to uncover hidden phase transitions and interacting polarized sublattices in novel 2D material systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
Newly developed organic air&#8208;stable radicals and radical polymers, as well as their properties and applications in flexible electronic devices, are reviewed. Recently, these materials have shown high performance in batteries, photovoltaics, transistors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and photothermal devices. A short perspective is also given.

      <title>Crystallization in Confinement</title>
      <dc:description>
The influence of confinement on crystallization processes, where effects on features including the crystal polymorph, morphology, and orientation are observed in environments with different length scales and geometries, is described. Understanding this phenomenon will therefore enable confinement to be used to control crystallization in multiple applications and to provide superior insight into crystallization in many real&#8208;world environments.








Abstract
Many crystallization processes of great importance, including frost heave, biomineralization, the synthesis of nanomaterials, and scale formation, occur in small volumes rather than bulk solution. Here, the influence of confinement on crystallization processes is described, drawing together information from fields as diverse as bioinspired mineralization, templating, pharmaceuticals, colloidal crystallization, and geochemistry. Experiments are principally conducted within confining systems that offer well&#8208;defined environments, varying from droplets in microfluidic devices, to cylindrical pores in filtration membranes, to nanoporous glasses and carbon nanotubes. Dramatic effects are observed, including a stabilization of metastable polymorphs, a depression of freezing points, and the formation of crystals with preferred orientations, modified morphologies, and even structures not seen in bulk. Confinement is also shown to influence crystallization processes over length scales ranging from the atomic to hundreds of micrometers, and to originate from a wide range of mechanisms. The development of an enhanced understanding of the influence of confinement on crystal nucleation and growth will not only provide superior insight into crystallization processes in many real&#8208;world environments, but will also enable this phenomenon to be used to control crystallization in applications including nanomaterial synthesis, heavy metal remediation, and the prevention of weathering.

      <title>Fiber&#8208;Reinforced Viscoelastomers Show Extraordinary Crack Resistance That Exceeds Metals</title>
      <dc:description>
Novel soft fiber&#8208;reinforced polymers (FRPs) are developed by using viscoelastic polymers that are adhesive, soft, and tough as matrices. The unique combination of these properties in the matrices ensures a strong component interface, which consequently maximizes the energy dissipation density and gives rise to a large force transfer length enabled by the extremely high fiber/matrix modulus ratio. As a result, the soft FRPs can achieve toughness of up to 2500 kJ m&#8722;2, exceeding any existing best&#8208;in&#8208;class materials.








Abstract
Soft fiber&#8208;reinforced polymers (FRPs), consisting of rubbery matrices and rigid fabrics, are widely utilized in industry because they possess high specific strength in tension while allowing flexural deformation under bending or twisting. Nevertheless, existing soft FRPs are relatively weak against crack propagation due to interfacial delamination, which substantially increases their risk of failure during use. In this work, a class of soft FRPs that possess high specific strength while simultaneously showing extraordinary crack resistance are developed. The strategy is to synthesize tough viscoelastic matrices from acrylate monomers in the presence of woven fabrics, which generates soft composites with a strong interface and interlocking structure. Such composites exhibit fracture energy, &#915;, of up to 2500 kJ m&#8722;2, exceeding the toughest existing materials. Experimental elucidation shows that the fracture energy obeys a simple relation, &#915; = W &#183; lT, where W is the volume&#8208;weighted average of work of extension at fracture of the two components and lT is the force transfer length that scales with the square root of fiber/matrix modulus ratio. Superior &#915; is achieved through a combination of extraordinarily large lT (10&#8211;100 mm), resulting from the extremely high fiber/matrix modulus ratios (104&#8211;105), and the maximized energy dissipation density, W. The elucidated quantitative relationship provides guidance toward the design of extremely tough soft composites.

      <title>Interfacial Molecular Doping of Metal Halide Perovskites for Highly Efficient Solar Cells</title>

A small molecule of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;,4&#8242;&#8243;&#8208;(pyrazine&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrayl) tetrakis (N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) aniline) (PT&#8208;TPA) is applied to effectively p&#8208;dope the FAxMA1&#8722;xPbI3 (FA:HC(NH2)2; MA:CH3NH3) perovskite surface, with obvious conductivity and carrier concentration increase. After applying PT&#8208;TPA into perovskite solar cells, the doping&#8208;induced band bending at perovskite surface facilitates hole extraction to hole transport layer and expels electrons toward cathode, which reduces the surface charge recombination.

Abstract
Tailoring the doping of semiconductors in heterojunction solar cells shows tremendous success in enhancing the performance of many types of inorganic solar cells, while it is found challenging in perovskite solar cells because of the difficulty in doping perovskites in a controllable way. Here, a small molecule of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;,4&#8243;&#8242;&#8208;(pyrazine&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrayl) tetrakis (N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) aniline) (PT&#8208;TPA) which can effectively p&#8208;dope the surface of FAxMA1&#8722;xPbI3 (FA: HC(NH2)2; MA: CH3NH3) perovskite films is reported. The intermolecular charge transfer property of PT&#8208;TPA forms a stabilized resonance structure to accept electrons from perovskites. The doping effect increases perovskite dark conductivity and carrier concentration by up to 4737 times. Computation shows that electrons in the first two layers of octahedral cages in perovskites are transferred to PT&#8208;TPA. After applying PT&#8208;TPA into perovskite solar cells, the doping&#8208;induced band bending in perovskite effectively facilitates hole extraction to hole transport layer and expels electrons toward cathode side, which reduces the charge recombination there. The optimized devices demonstrate an increased photovoltage from 1.12 to 1.17 V and an efficiency of 23.4% from photocurrent scanning with a stabilized efficiency of 22.9%. The findings demonstrate that molecular doping is an effective route to control the interfacial charge recombination in perovskite solar cells which is in complimentary to broadly applied defect passivation techniques.

      <title>Consolidating Lithiothermic&#8208;Ready Transition Metals for Li2S&#8208;Based Cathodes</title>
      <dc:description>
A series of Li2S/transition metal nanocomposites is synthesized by lithiothermic reduction reaction. On one hand, incorporation of W, Mo, or Ti greatly increases electronic and ionic conductivity, decreased activation potential, and inhibited polysulfide dissolution of Li2S. On the other hand, integrating Co, Mn, and Zn turns Li2S into prelithiation agents.








Abstract
Li2S holds a promising role as a high&#8208;capacity Li&#8208;containing cathode, circumventing use of metallic lithium in constructing next&#8208;generation batteries to replace current Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, progress of Li2S cathode has been plagued by its intrinsic drawbacks, including high activation potentials, poor rate performance, and rapid capacity fading during long cycling. Herein, a series of Li2S/transition metal (TM) nanocomposites are synthesized via a lithiothermic reduction reaction, and it is realized that the presence of TMs in Li2S matrix can transform electrochemical behaviors of Li2S. On the one hand, the incorporation of W, Mo, or Ti greatly increases electronic and ionic conductivity of Li2S composites and inhibits the polysulfide dissolution via the TM&#63743;S bond, effectively addressing the drawbacks of Li2S cathodes. In particular, Li2S/W and Li2S/Mo exhibit the highest ionic conductivity of solid&#8208;phase Li&#8208;ion conductors ever&#8208;reported: 5.44 &#215; 10&#8722;2 and 3.62 &#215; 10&#8722;2 S m&#8722;1, respectively. On the other hand, integrating Co, Mn, and Zn turns Li2S into a prelithiation agent, forming metal sulfides rather than S8 after the full charge. These interesting findings may shed light on the design of Li2S&#8208;based cathode materials.

&lt;p&gt;A series of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/transition metal nanocomposites is synthesized by lithiothermic reduction reaction. On one hand, incorporation of W, Mo, or Ti greatly increases electronic and ionic conductivity, decreased activation potential, and inhibited polysulfide dissolution of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. On the other hand, integrating Co, Mn, and Zn turns Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S into prelithiation agents.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S holds a promising role as a high&#8208;capacity Li&#8208;containing cathode, circumventing use of metallic lithium in constructing next&#8208;generation batteries to replace current Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, progress of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S cathode has been plagued by its intrinsic drawbacks, including high activation potentials, poor rate performance, and rapid capacity fading during long cycling. Herein, a series of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/transition metal (TM) nanocomposites are synthesized via a lithiothermic reduction reaction, and it is realized that the presence of TMs in Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S matrix can transform electrochemical behaviors of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. On the one hand, the incorporation of W, Mo, or Ti greatly increases electronic and ionic conductivity of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S composites and inhibits the polysulfide dissolution via the TM&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;S bond, effectively addressing the drawbacks of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S cathodes. In particular, Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/W and Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/Mo exhibit the highest ionic conductivity of solid&#8208;phase Li&#8208;ion conductors ever&#8208;reported: 5.44 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 3.62 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; S m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. On the other hand, integrating Co, Mn, and Zn turns Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S into a prelithiation agent, forming metal sulfides rather than S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; after the full charge. These interesting findings may shed light on the design of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&#8208;based cathode materials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Low&#8208;Bandgap Porphyrins for Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells: Materials, Morphology, and Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Porphyrin is a very promising unit to construct low&#8208;bandgap materials to harness solar photons in the near&#8208;infrared region. This can help organic solar cells (OSCs) maximize solar energy utilization. Recent progress of porphyrin&#8208;based materials, design and synthesis routes, morphology, and applications in OSCs is summarized, and future perspective and endeavors are discussed to facilitate higher performance for OSCs.








Abstract
With developments in materials, thin&#8208;film processing, fine&#8208;tuning of morphology, and optimization of device fabrication, the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) has improved markedly in recent years. Designing low&#8208;bandgap materials has been a focus in order to maximize solar energy conversion. However, there are only a few successful low&#8208;bandgap donor materials developed with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption that are well matched to the existing efficient acceptors. Porphyrin has shown great potential as a useful building block for constructing low&#8208;bandgap donor materials due to its large conjugated plane and strong absorption. Porphyrin&#8208;based donor materials have been shown to contribute to many record&#8208;high device efficiencies in small molecule, tandem, ternary, flexible, and OSC/perovskite hybrid solar cells. Specifically, non&#8208;fullerene small&#8208;molecule solar cells have recently shown a high power conversion efficiency of 12% using low&#8208;bandgap porphyrin. All these have validated the great potential of porphyrin derivatives as effective donor materials and made DPPEZnP&#8208;TRs a family of best low&#8208;bandgap donor materials in the OSC field so far. Here, recent progress in the rational design, morphology, dynamics, and multi&#8208;functional applications starting from 2015 will be highlighted to deepen understanding of the structure&#8211;property relationship. Finally, some future directions of porphyrin&#8208;based OSCs are presented.

      <title>Biodegradable Materials and Green Processing for Green Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent research progress of biodegradable materials and green processing for green electronics is comprehensively reviewed. The biodegradable materials used for different functional layers and green/non&#8208;toxic processing for solar cells, organic field&#8208;effect transistors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and other devices are discussed in detail. Future development and perspective of green electronics are also proposed and presented.








Abstract
There is little question that the &#8220;electronic revolution&#8221; of the 20th century has impacted almost every aspect of human life. However, the emergence of solid&#8208;state electronics as a ubiquitous feature of an advanced modern society is posing new challenges such as the management of electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) that will remain through the 21st century. In addition to developing strategies to manage such e&#8208;waste, further challenges can be identified concerning the conservation and recycling of scarce elements, reducing the use of toxic materials and solvents in electronics processing, and lowering energy usage during fabrication methods. In response to these issues, the construction of electronic devices from renewable or biodegradable materials that decompose to harmless by&#8208;products is becoming a topic of great interest. Such &#8220;green&#8221; electronic devices need to be fabricated on industrial scale through low&#8208;energy and low&#8208;cost methods that involve low/non&#8208;toxic functional materials or solvents. This review highlights recent advances in the development of biodegradable materials and processing strategies for electronics with an emphasis on areas where green electronic devices show the greatest promise, including solar cells, organic field&#8208;effect transistors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and other electronic devices.

      <title>Tubulin&#8208;Based Nanotubes as Delivery Platform for Microtubule&#8208;Targeting Agents</title>
      <dc:description>
Tubulin&#8208;based nanotubes are developed as novel delivery carriers for microtubule&#8208;targeting agents. This work proposes a new strategy of using a drug's target protein as a drug carrier. Upon loading microtubule&#8208;stabilizing/destabilizing agents, the drug&#8208;driven structural/functional transformations and anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo are investigated.








Abstract
Tubulin&#8208;based nanotubes (TNTs) to deliver microtubule&#8208;targeting agents (MTAs) for clinical oncology are reported. Three MTAs, docetaxel (DTX), laulimalide (LMD), and monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), which attach to different binding sites in a tubulin, are loaded onto TNTs and cause structural changes in them, including shape anisotropy and tubulin layering. This drug&#8208;driven carrier transformation leads to changes in the drug&#8208;loading efficiency and stability characteristics of the carrier. TNTs coloaded with DTX and LMD efficiently deliver dual drug cargoes to cellular tubulins by the endolysosomal pathway, and results in synergistic anticancer and antiangiogenic action of the drugs in vitro. In in vivo tests, TNTs loaded with a microtubule&#8208;destabilizing agent MMAE suppress the growth of tumors with much higher efficacy than free MMAE did. This work suggests a new concept of using a drug's target protein as a carrier. The findings demonstrate that the TNTs developed here can be used universally as a delivery platform for many MTAs.

      <title>Enhanced Thermoelectric Performance of N&#8208;Type Organic Semiconductor via Electric Field Modulated Photo&#8208;Thermoelectric Effect</title>
      <dc:description>
The electric field is demonstrated to enhance the photo&#8208;thermoelectric effect by promoting the exciton separation efficiency with a coupled modulation process. The increased photoinduced carrier concentration and abnormal trade&#8208;off relationship of the TE parameters together lead to a more than 500% enhancement in the PF to 11.2 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2.








Abstract
Modulating photophysical processes is a fundamental way for tuning performance of many organic devices. However, it has not been explored as an effective strategy to manipulate the thermoelectric (TE) conversion of organic semiconductors (OSCs) owing to their critical requirement to carrier concentration (&gt;1018 cm&#8722;3) and the fact of low exciton separation efficiency in single element OSCs. Here, an electric field modulated photo&#8208;thermoelectric (P&#8208;TE) effect in an n&#8208;type OSC is demonstrated to realize a significant improvement of TE performance. The electrical and spectroscopy characterizations reveal that the electric field gating generates combined modulation of exciton separation, charge screening, and carrier recombination, which produces a more than ten times improvement of photoinduced carrier concentration. These coupled processes contribute to the unconventional Seebeck coefficient (S)&#8208;electrical conductivity (&#963;) trade&#8208;off relationship of the photoexcited films, therefore leading to a more than 500% enhancement in the power factor for n&#8208;type OTE semiconductors. This work opens a unique way toward state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic P&#8208;TE materials for energy harvesting applications.

      <title>2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides: Design, Modulation, and Challenges in Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are considered to be promising candidates over noble metal catalysts for their electrochemical hydrogen production. The basic mechanism for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is introduced, followed by a description of the different synthesis methods and modulation approaches to enhance the catalytic performance of TMD&#8208;based catalysts toward HER.








Abstract
Hydrogen has been deemed as an ideal substitute fuel to fossil energy because of its renewability and the highest energy density among all chemical fuels. One of the most economical, ecofriendly, and high&#8208;performance ways of hydrogen production is electrochemical water splitting. Recently, 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (also known as 2D TMDs) showed their utilization potentiality as cost&#8208;effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts in water electrolysis. Herein, recent representative research efforts and systematic progress made in 2D TMDs are reviewed, and future opportunities and challenges are discussed.

&lt;p&gt;Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are considered to be promising candidates over noble metal catalysts for their electrochemical hydrogen production. The basic mechanism for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is introduced, followed by a description of the different synthesis methods and modulation approaches to enhance the catalytic performance of TMD&#8208;based catalysts toward HER.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen has been deemed as an ideal substitute fuel to fossil energy because of its renewability and the highest energy density among all chemical fuels. One of the most economical, ecofriendly, and high&#8208;performance ways of hydrogen production is electrochemical water splitting. Recently, 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (also known as 2D TMDs) showed their utilization potentiality as cost&#8208;effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts in water electrolysis. Herein, recent representative research efforts and systematic progress made in 2D TMDs are reviewed, and future opportunities and challenges are discussed. Furthermore, general methods of synthesizing 2D TMDs materials are introduced in detail and the advantages and disadvantages for some specific methods are provided. This explanation includes several important regulation strategies of creating more active sites, heteroatoms doping, phase engineering, construction of heterostructures, and synergistic modulation which are capable of optimizing the electrical conductivity, exposure to the catalytic active sites, and reaction energy barrier of the electrode material to boost the HER kinetics. In the last section, the current obstacles and future chances for the development of 2D TMDs electrocatalysts are proposed to provide insight into and valuable guidelines for fabricating effective HER electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

Recent progress of MNMs in overcoming biological barriers and in vivo motion&#8208;tracking imaging technologies are summarized.

Abstract
Self&#8208;propelled micro&#8208; and nanomotors (MNMs) have shown great potential for applications in the biomedical field, such as active targeted delivery, detoxification, minimally invasive diagnostics, and nanosurgery, owing to their tiny size, autonomous motion, and navigation capacities. To enter the clinic, biomedical MNMs request the biodegradability of their manufacturing materials, the biocompatibility of chemical fuels or externally physical fields, the capability of overcoming various biological barriers (e.g., biofouling, blood flow, blood&#8211;brain barrier, cell membrane), and the in vivo visual positioning for autonomous navigation. Herein, the recent advances of synthetic MNMs in overcoming biological barriers and in vivo motion&#8208;tracking imaging techniques are highlighted. The challenges and future research priorities are also addressed. With continued attention and innovation, it is believed that, in the future, biomedical MNMs will pave the way to improve the targeted drug delivery efficiency.

      <title>Wood&#8208;Derived Functional Polymeric Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Wood components are considered as important feedstocks to fabricate functional materials. An insightful summary of recent wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials is provided from the perspective of macromolecular engineering, including the structural characteristics of cellulose and lignin, molecular modification, and subsequent assembly behavior to generate distinctive functional materials.








Abstract
In recent years, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to developing wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials due to their distinctive properties, including environmental friendliness, renewability, and biodegradability. Thus, the uniqueness of the main components in wood (cellulose and lignin) has attracted enormous interest for both fundamental research and practical applications. Herein, the emerging field of wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials fabricated by means of macromolecular engineering is reviewed, covering the basic structures and properties of the main components, the design principle to utilize these main components, and the resulting wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials in terms of elastomers, hydrogels, aerogels, and nanoparticles. In detail, the natural features of wood components and their significant roles in the fabrication of materials are emphasized. Furthermore, the utilization of controlled/living polymerization, click chemistry, dynamic bonds chemistry, etc., for the modification is specifically discussed from the perspective of molecular design, together with their sequential assembly into different morphologies. The functionalities of wood&#8208;derived polymeric materials are mainly focused on self&#8208;healing and shape&#8208;memory abilities, adsorption, conduction, etc. Finally, the main challenges of wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials fabricated by macromolecular engineering are presented, as well as the potential solutions or directions to develop green and scalable wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials.

      <title>Bioactive&#8208;Tissue&#8208;Derived Nanocomposite Hydrogel for Permanent Arterial Embolization and Enhanced Vascular Healing</title>
      <dc:description>
A biohybrid hydrogel composed of cardiac&#8208;derived extracellular matrix (ECM) and nanoclay (NC) is developed as a multifunctional embolic biomaterial that offers both the biological activity and the mechanical support necessary for successful arterial embolization. The shear&#8208;thinning ECM&#8211;NC hydrogel exhibits excellent transcatheter injectability, retrievability, and proangiogenic characteristics to serve as a catheter&#8208;directed bioactive embolic agent for the treatment of a variety of vascular diseases.








Abstract
Transcatheter embolization is a minimally invasive procedure that uses embolic agents to intentionally block diseased or injured blood vessels for therapeutic purposes. Embolic agents in clinical practice are limited by recanalization, risk of non&#8208;target embolization, failure in coagulopathic patients, high cost, and toxicity. Here, a decellularized cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM)&#8208;based nanocomposite hydrogel is developed to provide superior mechanical stability, catheter injectability, retrievability, antibacterial properties, and biological activity to prevent recanalization. The embolic efficacy of the shear&#8208;thinning ECM&#8208;based hydrogel is shown in a porcine survival model of embolization in the iliac artery and the renal artery. The ECM&#8208;based hydrogel promotes arterial vessel wall remodeling and a fibroinflammatory response while undergoing significant biodegradation such that only 25% of the embolic material remains at 14 days. With its unprecedented proregenerative, antibacterial properties coupled with favorable mechanical properties, and its superior performance in anticoagulated blood, the ECM&#8208;based hydrogel has the potential to be a next&#8208;generation biofunctional embolic agent that can successfully treat a wide range of vascular diseases.

      <title>Micro&#8208; and Nanostructured Lead Halide Perovskites: From Materials to Integrations and Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent years have witnessed substantial progress in nanostructured&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based devices. Patterning and integration techniques for nanostructured perovskites are summarized and recent progress in novel nanostructured&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based applications is presented.








Abstract
In the past decade, lead halide perovskites have been intensively explored due to their promising future in photovoltaics. Owing to their remarkable material properties such as solution processability, nice defect tolerance, broad bandgap tunability, high quantum yields, large refractive index, and strong nonlinear effects, this family of materials has also shown advantages in many other optoelectronic devices including microlasers, photodetectors, waveguides, and metasurfaces. Very recently, the stability of perovskite devices has been improved with the optimization of synthesis methods and device architectures. It is widely accepted that it is the time to integrate all the perovskite devices into a real system. However, for integrated photonic circuits, the shapes and distributions of chemically synthesized perovskites are quite random and not suitable for integration. Consequently, controlled synthesis and the top&#8208;down fabrication process are highly desirable to break the barriers. Herein, the developments of patterning and integration techniques for halide perovskites, as well as the structure/function relationships, are systematically reviewed. The recent progress in the study of optical responses originating from nanostructured perovskites is also presented. Lastly, the challenges and perspective for nanostructured&#8208;perovskite devices are discussed.

      <title>A Garnet&#8208;Type Solid&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Based Molten Lithium&#8722;Molybdenum&#8722;Iron(II) Chloride Battery with Advanced Reaction Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>
A garnet&#8208;type Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based molten lithium&#8722;molybdenum&#8722;iron(II) chloride battery is reported. Different from the conventional reaction mechanism of batteries, this battery synchronizes the reversible Fe&#8722;Mo alloying&#8722;dealloying reactions with the delithiation&#8722;lithiation processes, meaning that the porous Mo skeleton derived from the dealloy reaction can suppress the growth of pure Fe particles. This approach is promising for other alkali&#8208;metal&#8722;metal&#8208;chloride battery systems.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based molten&#8208;metal batteries have attracted considerable attention for grid&#8208;scale energy storage. Although ZEBRA batteries are considered one of the promising candidates, they still have the potential concern of metal particle growth and ion exchange with the &#946;&#8221;&#8208;Al2O3 electrolyte. Herein, a Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based molten lithium&#8722;molybdenum&#8722;iron(II) chloride battery (denoted as Li&#8722;Mo&#8722;FeCl2) operated at temperature of 250 &#176;C, comprising a mixture of Fe and LiCl cathode materials, a Li anode, a garnet&#8208;type Li&#8208;ion ceramic electrolyte, and Mo additive, is designed to overcome these obstacles. Different from conventional battery reaction mechanisms, this battery revolutionarily synchronizes the reversible Fe&#8722;Mo alloying&#8722;dealloying reactions with the delithiation&#8722;lithiation processes, meaning that the porous Mo framework derived from Fe&#8722;Mo alloy simultaneously suppresses the growth of pure Fe particles. By adopting a Li anode and a Li&#8208;ion ceramic electrolyte, the corrosion problem between the cathode and the solid electrolyte is overcome. With similar battery cost ($12 kWh&#8722;1), the theoretical energy density of Li&#8722;Mo&#8722;FeCl2 battery surpasses that of a Na&#8722;FeCl2 ZEBRA battery over 25%, to 576 Wh kg&#8722;1 and 2216 Wh L&#8722;1, respectively. Experimental results further prove this cell has excellent cycling performance (472 mAh gLiCl&#8722;1 after 300 cycles, 50 mg active material) and strong tolerance against the overcharge&#8722;overdischarge (3&#8722;1.6 V) and freezing&#8722;thawing (25&#8722;250 &#176;C) incidents.

Different from the conventional reaction mechanism of batteries, this battery synchronizes the reversible Fe&#8722;Mo alloying&#8722;dealloying reactions with the delithiation&#8722;lithiation processes, meaning that the porous Mo skeleton derived from the dealloy reaction can suppress the growth of pure Fe particles. This approach is promising for other alkali&#8208;metal&#8722;metal&#8208;chloride battery systems.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based molten&#8208;metal batteries have attracted considerable attention for grid&#8208;scale energy storage. Although ZEBRA batteries are considered one of the promising candidates, they still have the potential concern of metal particle growth and ion exchange with the &#946;&#8221;&#8208;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte. Herein, a Li&lt;sub&gt;6.4&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;1.4&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based molten lithium&#8722;molybdenum&#8722;iron(II) chloride battery (denoted as Li&#8722;Mo&#8722;FeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) operated at temperature of 250 &#176;C, comprising a mixture of Fe and LiCl cathode materials, a Li anode, a garnet&#8208;type Li&#8208;ion ceramic electrolyte, and Mo additive, is designed to overcome these obstacles. Different from conventional battery reaction mechanisms, this battery revolutionarily synchronizes the reversible Fe&#8722;Mo alloying&#8722;dealloying reactions with the delithiation&#8722;lithiation processes, meaning that the porous Mo framework derived from Fe&#8722;Mo alloy simultaneously suppresses the growth of pure Fe particles. By adopting a Li anode and a Li&#8208;ion ceramic electrolyte, the corrosion problem between the cathode and the solid electrolyte is overcome. With similar battery cost ($12 kWh&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), the theoretical energy density of Li&#8722;Mo&#8722;FeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery surpasses that of a Na&#8722;FeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ZEBRA battery over 25%, to 576 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 2216 Wh L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Experimental results further prove this cell has excellent cycling performance (472 mAh g&lt;sub&gt;LiCl&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 300 cycles, 50 mg active material) and strong tolerance against the overcharge&#8722;overdischarge (3&#8722;1.6 V) and freezing&#8722;thawing (25&#8722;250 &#176;C) incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Structural and Ecofriendly Holocellulose Materials from Wood: Microscale Fibers and Nanoscale Fibrils</title>
      <dc:description>
Wood holocellulose fiber and nanofibrils with highly preserved native cellulose&#8722;hemicellulose structure can be obtained by mild delignification and low&#8208;energy mechanical treatment. Corresponding fiber network materials have excellent mechanical properties, high recycling ability, low embodied energy, and facile modification routes. The processing&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationships are discussed, giving more insights into cellulosic material design with the aim of broadening their application areas.








Abstract
Mildly delignified wood holocellulose fibers show well&#8208;preserved cellulose nanofibril (CNF) structure in the fiber cell wall. Fibers, paper, biocomposites, and compression&#8208;molded fiber materials demonstrate excellent mechanical properties. Here, wood holocellulose fibers and corresponding CNFs are discussed with respect to nanostructure, mechanical performance, and advanced materials potential. Functionalization routes are discussed, as well as materials selection, nanoscience of recycling, and the embodied energy in cellulosic candidates for multifunctional structural materials.

      <title>Chiral Assemblies of Laser&#8208;Printed Micropillars Directed by Asymmetrical Capillary Force</title>
      <dc:description>
Highly ordered chiral structures can be spontaneously assembled by a meniscus&#8208;directed capillary force arising in an evaporating liquid. The chirality is facilitated by rationally breaking the intrinsic symmetry in the unit cells through cooperative control of the geometry and spatial topology of the micropillars. The vortical dichroism of the assembled chiral architectures is investigated to show the potential in chiral photonics.








Abstract
Artificial microstructures composed of chiral building blocks are of great significance in the fields of optics and mechanics. Here, it is shown that highly ordered chiral structures can be spontaneously assembled by a meniscus&#8208;directed capillary force arising in an evaporating liquid. The chirality is facilitated by rationally breaking the intrinsic symmetry in the unit cells through cooperative control of the geometry and spatial topology of the micropillars. The interfacial dynamics of the assembly process are studied to show that the sequential self&#8208;organization of the micropillars is influenced by the geometries, stiffness, and spatial arrangements. A diversity of chiral assemblies with controlled handedness is yielded by varying the pillar number, height, cross&#8208;section, laser power, and spatial topology. Lastly, the differential reflectance of light carrying opposite orbital angular momentums on the assembled chiral architectures are investigated, showcasing their potential in the field of chiral photonics concerning enantioselective response and exceptional optical functions.
