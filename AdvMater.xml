         <title>Rising of Dynamic Polyimide Materials: A Versatile Dielectric for Electrical and Electronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polyimides (PIs) are widely used in circuit components, electrical insulators, and power systems in modern electronic devices, large electrical appliances, and aerospace applications. Electrical/mechanical damage and atomic oxygen corrosion of materials are important factors that threaten reliability and service lifetime. Dynamic (self&#8208;healable, recyclable and degradable) PIs, a promising class of materials that successfully improve electrical/mechanical properties after damage, are anticipated to solve this issue. We share our viewpoints and perspectives on the status and future trends of dynamic PI based on a few existing documents. The main damage forms of PI dielectric materials in the application process are first introduced, and initial strategies and schemes to solve these problems are proposed. Fundamentally, the bottleneck issues faced by the development of dynamic PIs are indicated, and the relationship between various damage forms and the universality of the method is evaluated. The potential mechanism of the dynamic PI to deal with electrical damage is highlighted and several feasible prospective schemes to address electrical damage are discussed. We conclude by presenting a short outlook and future improvements to systems, challenges, and solutions of dynamic PI in electrical insulation. The summary of theory and practice should encourage policy development favoring energy conservation and environmental protection and promoting sustainability

         <title>Chemotaxis&#8208;guided Self&#8208;propelled Macrophage Motor for Targeted Treatment of Acute Pneumonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Immune cells exhibit a great potential as carriers of nanomedicine, attributed to their high tolerance to internalized nanomaterials and targeted accumulation in inflammatory tissues. However, the premature efflux of internalized nanomedicine during systemic delivery and slow infiltration into inflammatory tissues have limited their translational applications. Herein, we report a motorized cell platform as a nanomedicine carrier for highly efficient accumulation and infiltration in the inflammatory lungs and effective treatment of acute pneumonia. &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin and adamantane respectively modified manganese dioxide nanoparticles are intracellularly self&#8208;assembled into large aggregates mediated via host&#8208;guest interactions, to effectively inhibit the efflux of nanoparticles, catalytically consume/deplete H2O2 to alleviate inflammation, and generate O2 to propel macrophage movement for rapid tissue infiltration. With curcumin loaded into MnO2 nanoparticles, macrophages carry the intracellular nano&#8208;assemblies rapidly into the inflammatory lungs via chemotaxis&#8208;guided, self&#8208;propelled movement, for effective treatment of acute pneumonia via immunoregulation induced by curcumin and the aggregates.

         <title>Encoded Structural Color Microneedle Patches for Multiple Screening of Wound Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Detection of biomarkers associated with wound conditions provides in&#8208;depth healthcare information and benefits wound healing treatment. The current aim of wound detection is to achieve in situ multiple detection. Here, we describe novel encoded structural color microneedle patches (EMNs) combining photonic crystals (PhCs) and microneedle arrays (MNs) for multiple wound biomarker detection in situ. Using a partitioned and layered casting strategy, the EMNs can be divided into different modules and each serves for the detection of small molecules associated with chronic hard&#8208;to&#8208;healing wounds, including pH, glucose and histamine. pH sensing is based on the interaction between hydrogen ions and carboxyl groups from hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (PAM); glucose sensing is achieved with the help of glucose&#8208;responsive fluorophenylboronic acid (FPBA); while histamine sensing relies on specific recognition of aptamers and target molecules. Owing to the responsive volume change of these three modules in the presence of target molecules, the EMNs can create structural color change and characteristic peak shift of the PhCs, thus realizing the qualitative measurement of target molecules with a spectrum analyzer. It is further demonstrated that the EMNs behave well in the multivariate detection of rat wound molecules. These features indicate that the EMNs can be valuable smart detection systems for wound status screening.

         <title>Density of States Engineering of n&#8208;Doped Conjugated Polymers for High Charge Transport Performances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Charge transport of conjugated polymers in functional devices closely relates to their density of states (DOS) distributions. However, systemic DOS engineering for conjugated polymers is challenging due to the need for modulated methods and the unclear relationship between DOS and electrical properties. Here, we engineered the DOS distribution of conjugated polymers to enhance their electrical performances. The DOS distribution of polymer films was tailored using three processing solvents with different Hansen solubility parameters. The highest n&#8208;type electrical conductivity (39 &#177; 3 S cm&#8722;1), the highest power factor (63 &#177; 11 &#956;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2), and the highest Hall mobility (0.14 &#177; 0.02 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1) of the polymer (FBDPPV&#8208;OEG) were obtained in three films with three various DOS distributions, respectively. Through theoretical and experimental exploration, we reveal that the carrier concentration and transport property of conjugated polymers could be efficiently controlled by DOS engineering, paving the way for rationally fabricating organic semiconductors.

         <title>Enhanced Superconductivity and Upper Critical Field in Ta&#8208;Doped Weyl Semimetal Td&#8208;MoTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides are promising platforms for next&#8208;generation electronics and spintronics. The layered Weyl semimetal (W,Mo)Te2 series features structural phase transition, nonsaturated magnetoresistance, superconductivity, and exotic topological physics. However, the superconducting critical temperature of the bulk (W,Mo)Te2 remains ultralow without applying a high pressure. Here, we observe the significantly enhanced superconductivity with a transition temperature as large as about 7.5 K in bulk Mo1&#8208;xTaxTe2 single crystals upon Ta doping (0 &#8804; x &#8804; 0.22), which is attributed to an enrichment of density of states at the Fermi level. In addition, an enhanced perpendicular upper critical field of 14.5 T exceeding the Pauli limit is also observed in Td&#8208;phase Mo1&#8208;xTaxTe2 (x = 0.08), indicating the possible emergence of unconventional mixed singlet&#8208;triplet superconductivity owing to the inversion symmetry breaking. Our work provides a new pathway for exploring the exotic superconductivity and topological physics in transition metal dichalcogenides.

         <title>Multiscale Architectured Membranes, Electrodes, and Transport Layers for Next&#8208;Generation Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the recent progress in the key components of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) based on a novel architecturing strategy is highlighted. Diverse multiscale architecture technologies for modifying and reconstructing the membrane, electrode, and transport layers for realizing high&#8208;performance and reliable PEMFCs, focusing on their structures and functions, are comprehensively presented.








Abstract
Over the past few decades, considerable advances have been achieved in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) based on the development of material technology. Recently, an emerging multiscale architecturing technology covering nanometer, micrometer, and millimeter scales has been regarded as an alternative strategy to overcome the hindrance to achieving high&#8208;performance and reliable PEMFCs. This review summarizes the recent progress in the key components of PEMFCs based on a novel architecture strategy. In the first section, diverse architectural methods for patterning the membrane surface with random, single&#8208;scale, and multiscale structures as well as their efficacy for improving catalyst utilization, charge transport, and water management are discussed. In the subsequent section, the electrode structures designed with 1D and 3D multiscale structures to enable low Pt usage, improve oxygen transport, and achieve high electrode durability are elucidated. Finally, recent advances in the architectured transport layer for improving mass transportation including pore gradient, perforation, and patterned wettability for gas diffusion layer and 3D structured/engineered flow fields are described.

         <title>Revival of Ferroelectric Memories Based on Emerging Fluorite&#8208;Structured Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorite&#8208;structured ferroelectrics are breakthrough materials for the development of ferroelectric memories for nanoscale electronic devices owing to their scalability and complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility as well as the availability of established deposition techniques. This review covers the history of ferroelectric memory based on conventional ferroelectric to recent research on fluorite&#8208;structured ferroelectrics and remaining issues to achieve large&#8208;scale integration for practical industrial applications.








Abstract
Over the last few decades, the research on ferroelectric memories has been limited due to their dimensional scalability and incompatibility with complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The discovery of ferroelectricity in fluorite&#8208;structured oxides revived interest in the research on ferroelectric memories, by inducing nanoscale nonvolatility in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art gate insulators by minute doping and thermal treatment. The potential of this approach has been demonstrated by the fabrication of sub&#8208;30&#160;nm electronic devices. Nonetheless, to realize practical applications, various technical limitations, such as insufficient reliability including endurance, retention, and imprint, as well as large device&#8208;to&#8208;device&#8208;variation, require urgent solutions. Furthermore, such limitations should be considered based on targeting devices as well as applications. Various types of ferroelectric memories including ferroelectric random&#8208;access&#8208;memory, ferroelectric field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistor, and ferroelectric tunnel junction should be considered for classical nonvolatile memories as well as emerging neuromorphic computing and processing&#8208;in&#8208;memory. Therefore, from the viewpoint of materials science, this review covers the recent research focusing on ferroelectric memories from the history of conventional approaches to future prospects.

         <title>Enzymatically Crosslinked Collagen as a Versatile Matrix for In Vitro and In Vivo Co&#8208;Engineering of Blood and Lymphatic Vasculature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel collagen biopolymer bearing enzyme&#8208;recognizable crosslinkers is developed to rapidly produce bulk hydrogels exhibiting strong (lymph&#8208;)angiogenic properties. Orthogonal crosslinking enables further modification of the collagen backbone. Using a second enzyme, the tethering of pro&#8208;angiogenic QK&#8208;peptides, the production of multimaterial scaffolds that enable spatially restricted vascularization as well as the biofabrication of annealed &#181;&#8208;gels is demonstrated.








Abstract
Adequate vascularization is required for the successful translation of many in vitro engineered tissues. This study presents a novel collagen derivative that harbors multiple recognition peptides for orthogonal enzymatic crosslinking based on sortase A&#160;(SrtA) and Factor XIII&#160;(FXIII). SrtA&#8208;mediated crosslinking enables the rapid co&#8208;engineering of human blood and lymphatic microcapillaries and mesoscale capillaries in bulk hydrogels. Whereas tuning of gel stiffness determines the extent of neovascularization, the relative number of blood and lymphatic capillaries recapitulates the ratio of blood and lymphatic endothelial cells originally seeded into the hydrogel. Bioengineered capillaries readily form luminal structures and exhibit typical maturation markers both in vitro and in vivo. The secondary crosslinking enzyme Factor XIII is used for in situ tethering of the VEGF mimetic QK peptide to collagen. This approach supports the formation of blood and lymphatic capillaries in the absence of exogenous VEGF. Orthogonal enzymatic crosslinking is further used to bioengineer hydrogels with spatially defined polymer compositions with pro&#8208; and anti&#8208;angiogenic properties. Finally, macroporous scaffolds based on secondary crosslinking of microgels enable vascularization independent from supporting fibroblasts. Overall, this work demonstrates for the first time the co&#8208;engineering of mature micro&#8208; and meso&#8208;sized blood and lymphatic capillaries using a highly versatile collagen derivative.

         <title>Priority and Prospect of Sulfide&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review expounds on why implementing a membrane&#8208;based electrolyte is the priority for mass production of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries and identifies critical criteria for capturing a high&#8208;quality thin sulfide electrolyte membrane. The challenges and associated strategies for achieving these criteria in terms of material availability, membrane processing, and cell integration are systematically analyzed and summarized.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) employing sulfide solid electrolytes (SEs) promise sustainable energy storage systems with energy&#8208;dense integration and critical intrinsic safety, yet they still require cost&#8208;effective manufacturing and the integration of thin membrane&#8208;based SE separators into large&#8208;format cells to achieve scalable deployment. This review, based on an overview of sulfide SE materials, is expounded on why implementing a thin membrane&#8208;based separator is the priority for mass production of ASSLBs and critical criteria for capturing a high&#8208;quality thin sulfide SE membrane are identified. Moreover, from the aspects of material availability, membrane processing, and cell integration, the major challenges and associated strategies are described to meet these criteria throughout the whole manufacturing chain to provide a realistic assessment of the current status of sulfide SE membranes. Finally, future directions and prospects for scalable and manufacturable sulfide SE membranes for ASSLBs are presented.

         <title>Fracture Detection in Bio&#8208;Glues with Fluorescent&#8208;Protein&#8208;Based Optical Force Probes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ratiometric protein optical force probes is designed and used to fabricate force&#8208;sensitive bio&#8208;glue. The visualization of stress concentrations, monitoring of fracture zones, and identification of adhesive or cohesive failure are achieved by fluorescence spectroscopy and lifetime imaging microscopy.








Abstract
Glues are being used to bond, seal, and repair in industry and biomedicine. The improvement of gluing performance is hence important for the development of new glues with better and balanced property spaces, which in turn necessitates a mechanistic understanding of their mechanical failure. Optical force probes (OFPs) allow the observation of mechanical material damage in polymers from the macro&#8208; down to the microscale, yet have never been employed in glues. Here, the development of a series of ratiometric OFPs based on fluorescent&#8208;protein&#8211;dye and protein&#8211;protein conjugates and their incorporation into genetically engineered bio&#8208;glues is reported. The OFPs are designed to efficiently modulate F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer&#160;upon force application thereby reporting on force&#8208;induced molecular alterations independent of concentration and fluorescence intensity both spectrally and through their fluorescence lifetime. By fluorescence spectroscopy in solution and in the solid state and by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, stress concentrations are visualized and adhesive and cohesive failure in the fracture zone is differentiated.

         <title>Photoinduced Dithiolane Crosslinking for Multiresponsive Dynamic Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disulfide&#8208;crosslinked adaptable hydrogels capable of multiple responses to stimuli are prepared using initiator&#8208;free photocrosslinking of 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes, which are inherently photoresponsive cyclic disulfides. Using a variety of stimuli, multiple dynamic transformations are demonstrated in these hydrogels; a series of complex cell culture experiments highlight the versatility of this system for studying effects of mechanical manipulation of the cellular microenvironment.








Abstract
While many hydrogels are elastic networks crosslinked by covalent bonds, viscoelastic hydrogels with adaptable crosslinks are increasingly being developed to better recapitulate time and position&#8208;dependent processes found in many tissues. In this work, 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes are presented as dynamic covalent photocrosslinkers of hydrogels, resulting in disulfide bonds throughout the hydrogel that respond to multiple stimuli. Using lipoic acid as a model dithiolane, disulfide crosslinks are formed under physiological conditions, enabling cell encapsulation via an initiator&#8208;free light&#8208;induced dithiolane ring&#8208;opening photopolymerization. The resulting hydrogels allow for multiple photoinduced dynamic responses including stress relaxation, stiffening, softening, and network functionalization using a single chemistry, which can be supplemented by permanent reaction with alkenes to further control network properties and connectivity using irreversible thioether crosslinks. Moreover, complementary photochemical approaches are used to achieve rapid and complete sample degradation via radical scission and post&#8208;gelation network stiffening when irradiated in the presence of reactive gel precursor.

     alt="Photoinduced Dithiolane Crosslinking for Multiresponsive Dynamic Hydrogels"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disulfide-crosslinked adaptable hydrogels capable of multiple responses to stimuli are prepared using initiator-free photocrosslinking of 1,2-dithiolanes, which are inherently photoresponsive cyclic disulfides. Using a variety of stimuli, multiple dynamic transformations are demonstrated in these hydrogels; a series of complex cell culture experiments highlight the versatility of this system for studying effects of mechanical manipulation of the cellular microenvironment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many hydrogels are elastic networks crosslinked by covalent bonds, viscoelastic hydrogels with adaptable crosslinks are increasingly being developed to better recapitulate time and position-dependent processes found in many tissues. In this work, 1,2-dithiolanes are presented as dynamic covalent photocrosslinkers of hydrogels, resulting in disulfide bonds throughout the hydrogel that respond to multiple stimuli. Using lipoic acid as a model dithiolane, disulfide crosslinks are formed under physiological conditions, enabling cell encapsulation via an initiator-free light-induced dithiolane ring-opening photopolymerization. The resulting hydrogels allow for multiple photoinduced dynamic responses including stress relaxation, stiffening, softening, and network functionalization using a single chemistry, which can be supplemented by permanent reaction with alkenes to further control network properties and connectivity using irreversible thioether crosslinks. Moreover, complementary photochemical approaches are used to achieve rapid and complete sample degradation via radical scission and post-gelation network stiffening when irradiated in the presence of reactive gel precursor. The results herein demonstrate the versatility of this material chemistry to study and direct 2D and 3D cell-material interactions. This work highlights dithiolane-based hydrogel photocrosslinking as a robust method for generating adaptable hydrogels with a range of biologically relevant mechanical and chemical properties that are varied on demand.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
As a widely used commodity chemical, ammonia is critical for producing nitrogen&#8208;containing fertilizers and serving as the promising zero&#8208;carbon energy carrier. Photoelectrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (PEC NRR) can provide a solar&#8208;powered green and sustainable route for synthesis of ammonia (NH3). Herein, we report an optimum PEC system with a Si&#8208;based hierarchically&#8208;structured PdCu/TiO2/Si photocathode and well&#8208;thought&#8208;out trifluoroethanol as the proton source for lithium&#8208;mediated PEC NRR, achieving a record high NH3 yield of 43.09&#160;&#956;g cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and an excellent faradaic efficiency of 46.15% under 0.12&#8208;MPa O2 and 3.88&#8208;MPa N2 at 0.07&#160;V versus lithium(0/+) redox couple (versus Li0/+). PEC measurements coupled with operando characterization revealed that the PdCu/TiO2/Si photocathode under N2 pressures facilitate the reduction of N2 to form lithium nitride (Li3N), which reacts with active protons to produce NH3 while releasing the Li+ to reinitiate the cycle of the PEC NRR. The Li&#8208;mediated PEC NRR process is further enhanced by introducing small amount of O2 or CO2 under pressure by accelerating the decomposition of Li3N. For the first time, this work provides mechanistic understanding of the lithium&#8208;mediated PEC NRR process and opens new avenues for efficient solar&#8208;powered green conversion of N2&#8208;to&#8208;NH3.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Semiconducting Graft Co&#8208;polymers to Achieve &#8220;clickable&#8221; Fluorescent Nanoparticles with Long Circulation and Specific Cancer Targeting</title>

Abstract
Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have been explored for applications in cancer theranostics because of their high absorption coefficients, photostability and biocompatibility. However, SPNs are susceptible to aggregation and protein fouling in physiological conditions, which can be detrimental for in vivo applications. Here, we describe a method for achieving colloidally stable and low&#8208;fouling SPNs by grafting PEG onto the backbone of the fluorescent semiconducting polymer, poly(9,9&#8242;&#8208;dioctylfluorene&#8208;5&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole) (F8BT&#8208;F), in a simple one&#8208;step substitution reaction, post&#8208;polymerisation. Further, by utilising azide&#8208;functionalised PEG we site&#8208;specifically &#8220;click&#8221; anti&#8208;HER2 antibodies, Fab fragments, or affibodies onto the SPN surface, which allows the functionalised SPNs to specifically target HER2&#8208;positive cancer cells. In vivo, our PEGylated SPNs were found to have excellent circulation efficiencies in zebrafish embryos for up to seven days post&#8208;injection. SPNs functionalised with affibodies were then shown to be able to target HER2 expressing cancer cells in a zebrafish xenograft model. The covalent PEGylated SPN system described herein shows great potential for cancer theranostics.

         <title>Realizing the heteromorphic superlattice: Repeated heterolayers of amorphous insulator and polycrystalline semiconductor with minimal interface defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
An unconventional &#8220;heteromorphic&#8221; superlattice (HSL) is realized, comprised of repeated layers of different materials with differing morphologies: semiconducting pc&#8208;In2O3 layers interleaved with insulating a&#8208;MoO3 layers. Originally proposed by Tsu in 1989, yet never fully realized, the high quality of the HSL heterostructure demonstrated here validates the intuition of Tsu, whereby the flexibility of the bond angle in the amorphous phase and the passivation effect of the oxide at interfacial bonds serve to create smooth, high&#8208;mobility interfaces. The alternating amorphous layers prevent strain accumulation in the polycrystalline layers while suppressing defect propagation across the HSL. For the HSL with 7:7&#160;nm layer thickness, the observed electron mobility of 71 cm2/Vs, matches that of the highest quality In2O3 thin films. The atomic structure and electronic properties of crystalline In2O3 / amorphous MoO3 interfaces are verified using ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations and hybrid functional calculations. This work generalizes the superlattice concept to an entirely new paradigm of morphological combinations.

         <title>Ceria Nanoparticles as Copper Chaperones that Activate SOD1 for Synergistic Antioxidant Therapy to Treat Ischemic Vascular Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ceria nanoparticles deposited with copper ions, cofactors for the indigenous antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), are synthesized for effective and synergistic antioxidant therapy to treat ischemic vascular diseases in which the imbalance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) aggravates the tissue damage. Ceria nanoparticles chaperone copper ions to elevate the expression of SOD1 to significantly reduce the ROS&#8208;induced damage.








Abstract
All exogenous nanomaterials undergo rapid biotransformation once injected into the body and fall short of executing the intended purpose. Here,&#160;it is reported that copper&#8208;deposited ceria nanoparticles (CuCe NPs) exhibit enhanced antioxidant effects over&#160;pristine ceria nanoparticles, as the released copper buffers the depletion of glutathione while providing the bioavailable copper as a cofactor for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase 1. The upregulated intracellular antioxidants along with the ceria nanoparticles synergistically scavenge reactive oxygen species and promote anti&#8208;inflammation and M2 polarization of macrophages by modulating signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and 6 (STAT1 and STAT6). The therapeutic effect of CuCe NPs is demonstrated in ischemic vascular diseases (i.e., murine models of hindlimb ischemia and myocardial infarction) in which the copper&#8208;deposition affords increased perfusion and alleviation in tissue damage. The results provide rationale that metal oxide nanomaterials can be designed in a way to induce the upregulation of specific biological factors for optimal therapeutic performance.

         <title>A Thrombin&#8208;Activated Peptide&#8208;Templated Nanozyme for Remedying Ischemic Stroke via Thrombolytic and Neuroprotective Actions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide&#8208;templated manganese dioxide nanozyme integrating thrombolytic and reactive oxygen species scavenging abilities is developed for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Through the self&#8208;assembled polypeptides that contain multiple functional motifs, the nanozyme binds fibrin in the thrombus, crosses the blood&#8211;brain barrier, and finally accumulates in the ischemic neuronal tissues, where the thrombolytic motif is &#8220;switched&#8208;on&#8221; by the action of thrombin.








Abstract
Ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the most common causes of disability and death. Thrombolysis and neuroprotection are two current major therapeutic strategies to overcome ischemic and reperfusion damage. In this work, a novel peptide&#8208;templated manganese dioxide nanozyme (PNzyme/MnO2) is designed that integrates the thrombolytic activity of functional peptides with the reactive oxygen species scavenging ability of nanozymes. Through self&#8208;assembled polypeptides that contain multiple functional motifs, the novel peptide&#8208;templated nanozyme is able to bind fibrin in the thrombus, cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier, and finally accumulate in the ischemic neuronal tissues, where the thrombolytic motif is &#8220;switched&#8208;on&#8221; by the action of thrombin. In mice and rat IS models, the PNzyme/MnO2 prolongs the blood&#8208;circulation time and exhibits strong thrombolytic action, and reduces the ischemic damages in brain tissues. Moreover, this peptide&#8208;templated nanozyme also effectively inhibits the activation of astrocytes and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. These data indicate that the rationally designed PNzyme/MnO2 nanozyme exerts both thrombolytic and neuroprotective actions. Giving its long half&#8208;life in the blood and ability to target brain thrombi, the biocompatible nanozyme may serve as a novel therapeutic agent to improve the efficacy and prevent secondary thrombosis during the treatment of IS.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Conversion of Silicon Nitride Nanopore&#160;to Nanonet for Single&#8208;Protein Trapping Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid&#8208;state nanonet sensing platform made via&#160;light irradiation of a silicon nitride nanopore&#160;enables single&#8208;protein analysis. As a model protein, bovine serum albumin produces collision and trapping flipping signals on the nanonet, providing more structural information than traditional nanopore sensing. Additionally, the nanonet allows for capture of the real&#8208;time UV&#8208;induced structure changes of the protein.








Abstract
The single&#8208;molecule technique for investigation of an unlabeled protein in solution is very attractive but with great challenges. Nanopore sensing as a label&#8208;free tool can be used for collecting the structural information of individual proteins, but currently offers only limited capabilities due to the fast translocation of the target. Here, a reliable and facile method is developed to convert the silicon nitride nanopore to a stable nanonet platform for single&#8208;entity sensing by electrophoretic or electroosmotic trapping. A nanonet is fabricated based on a material reorganization process caused by electron&#8208;beam and light&#8208;irradiation treatment. Using protein molecules as a model, it is revealed that the solid&#8208;state nanonet can produce collision and trapping flipping signals of the protein, which provides more structural information than traditional nanopore sensing. More importantly, thanks to the excellent stability of the solid&#8208;state silicon nitride nanonet, it is demonstrated that the ultraviolet&#8208;light&#8208;irradiation&#8208;induced structural&#8208;change process of an individual protein can be captured. The developed nanonet supplies a robust platform for single&#8208;entity studies but is not limited to proteins.

         <title>A Reflection on Sustainable Anode Materials for Electrochemical Chloride Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chloride oxidation is a key industrial electrochemical process in chlorine&#8208;based chemical production and water treatment. Over the past few decades, dimensionally stable anode (DSA) consisting of RuO2&#8208; and IrO2&#8208;based mixed&#8208;metal oxides has been successfully commercialized in the electrochemical chloride oxidation industry. For a sustainable supply of anode materials, considerable efforts both from the scientific and industrial aspects for developing earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts have been made. This review first describes history of commercial DSA fabrication and strategies to improve their efficiency and stability. Important features related to the electrocatalytic performance for chloride oxidation and reaction mechanism are then summarized. From the perspective of sustainability, recent progress in the design and fabrication of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free anode materials, as well as methods for evaluating the industrialization of novel electrocatalysts, are highlighted. Finally, future directions for developing highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for industrial chloride oxidation are proposed.

         <title>Principles for 2D Material Assisted Nitrides Epitaxial Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Beyond traditional heteroepitaxy, 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;assisted epitaxy opens opportunities to revolutionize future material integration methods. However, basic principles in 2D&#8208;material&#8208;assisted nitrides epitaxy remain unclear, which impedes understanding the essence, thus hindering the progress of it. Here, we theoretically establish the crystallographic information of nitrides/2D material interface, which is further confirmed experimentally. We find the atomic interaction at the nitrides/2D material interface is related to the nature of underlying substrates. For single&#8208;crystalline substrates, the heterointerface behaves like a covalent one and the epilayer inherits the substrate's lattice. While for amorphous substrates, the heterointerface tends to be a van der Waals (vdW) one and strongly relies on the properties of 2D materials. Therefore, modulated by graphene, the nitrides epilayer is polycrystalline. In contrast, single&#8208;crystalline GaN films are successfully achieved on WS2. These results provide suitable growth front construction strategy for high&#8208;quality 2D&#8208;material&#8208;assisted nitrides epitaxy. It also opens a pathway toward various semiconductors hetero&#8208;integration.

         <title>A Novel &#8220;Inside&#8208;Out&#8221; Intraocular Nanomedicine Delivery Mode for Nanomaterials&#8217; Biological Effect Enhanced Choroidal Neovascularization Occlusion and Microenvironment Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pt and Au nanoparticle decorated zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 nanoplatform is developed to load indocyanine green for precise choroidal neovascularization occlusion and microenvironment regulation. A novel &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; intraocular nanomedicine delivery mode is exploited to penetrate the internal limiting membrane through M&#252;ller cells endocytosis. The mRNA expressions of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF reduce by 90.2% and 81.7%, respectively, compared to verteporfin treatment.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is commonly used in choroidal neovascularization (CNV) treatment due to the superior light transmittance of the eye. However, PDT often leads to surrounding tissue damage and further microenvironmental deterioration, including exacerbated hypoxia, inflammation, and secondary neovascularization. In this work, Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and Au NPs decorated zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 nanoplatform is developed to load indocyanine green for precise PDT and microenvironment amelioration, which can penetrate the internal limiting membrane through M&#252;ller cells endocytosis and target to CNV by surface&#8208;grafted cyclo(Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp&#8211;d&#8208;Phe&#8211;Lys) after intravitreal injection. The excessive H2O2 in the CNV microenvironment is catalyzed by catalase&#8208;like Pt NPs for hypoxia relief and enhanced PDT occlusion of neovascular. Meanwhile, Au NPs show significant anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;angiogenesis properties in regulating macrophages and blocking vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Compared with verteporfin treatment, the mRNA expressions of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF in the nanoplatform group are downregulated by 90.2% and 81.7%, respectively. Therefore, the nanoplatform realizes a comprehensive CNV treatment effect based on the high drug loading capacity and biosafety. The CNV treatment mode developed in this work provides a valuable reference for treating other diseases with similar physiological barriers that limit drug delivery and similar microenvironment.

Raising the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors can increase the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and thus the photovoltaic performance of the current top performing polymer solar cells (PSCs). One of the viable routes is demonstrated by the successful Y6 derivative of L8&#8208;BO with the branched alkyl chains at the outer side. This will introduce steric hindrance and reduce intermolecular aggregation, thus open up the bandgap and raise the LUMO energy level. To take further advantages of the steric hindrance influence on optoelectronic properties of Y6 derivatives, two Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors of BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4F and BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4Cl are designed and synthesized by adopting outer branched side chains and inner cyclohexane side chains. An outstanding Voc of 0.937&#160;V is achieved in the D18:BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4F binary blend devices along with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.52%. With the addition of BTP&#8208;eC9 to extend the absorption spectral coverage, a remarkable PCE of 19.36% is realized finally in the related ternary blend devices, which is one of the highest values for single&#8208;junction PSCs at present. The results illustrate the great potential of cyclohexane side chains in constructing high&#8208;performance non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and their PSCs.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Transparent, Chiral Organic Photodiodes with Incident Direction&#8208;Dependent Selectivity for Circularly Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semi&#8208;transparent organic photodiodes containing chiral non&#8208;fullerene acceptor and achiral polymer donor respond differently to left and right circularly polarized light. The preference switches when changing the direction of the incoming light. Circular selective absorption in combination with selective collection of carriers from a narrow space charge region can account for the change in polarization.








Abstract
Detection of the circular polarization of light is possible using chiral semiconductors, yet the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Semi&#8208;transparent chiral photodiodes allow for a simple experiment to investigate the basis of their selectivity: changing the side from which the diode is illuminated. A reversal of circular selectivity is observed in photocurrent generation when changing the direction of illumination on organic, bulk&#8208;heterojunction cells. The change in selectivity can be explained by a space&#8208;charge limitation on the collection of photocarriers in combination with preferential absorption of one of the circular polarizations of near&#8208;infrared light by the chiral non&#8208;fullerene acceptor. The space&#8208;charge limitation is supported by detailed measurements of frequency and intensity dependence of dc and ac photocurrents.

         <title>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Mediated Drug Delivery for First Aid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)&#8208;mediated first&#8208;aid system is developed for targeted drug delivery (uFAST), which enables autonomous administration of emergency therapeutics via UAVs to achieve timely first aid. The implementability and safety of the uFAST with a dual&#8208;mode glucagon microneedle patch in emergency care is well demonstrated in a severe hypoglycemic pig disease model.








Abstract
Timely administration of key medications toward patients with sudden diseases is critical to saving lives. However, slow transport of first&#8208;aid therapeutics and the potential absence of trained people for drug usage can&#160;lead&#160;to severe injuries or even death. Herein, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)&#8208;mediated first&#8208;aid system for targeted delivery (uFAST) is developed. It allows unattended administration of emergency therapeutics&#8208;loaded transdermal microneedle (MN) patches toward patients to relieve symptoms by a contact&#8208;triggered microneedle applicator (CTMA). The implementability and safety of the uFAST for first aid is demonstrated in a severe hypoglycemic pig model by automatically delivering a glucagon patch with immediate and bioresponsive dual release modes. This platform technique may facilitate the development of UAV&#8208;mediated first&#8208;aid treatments for other sudden diseases.

         <title>Dislocated Bilayer MOF Enables High&#8208;Selectivity Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D monolayer and 2D bilayer metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed by a simple solvothermal method. The bilayer MOF is a novel dislocation 2D porphyrin&#8208;based MOF material that exhibits good structural stability as well as ultra&#8208;high CO selectivity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction (100% selectivity). This work offers a new strategy for the construction of bilayer MOFs and provides a new perspective for the customization of photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
The highly selective photoreduction of CO2 into valuable small&#8208;molecule chemical feedstocks such as CO is an effective strategy for addressing the energy crisis and environmental problems. However, it remains a challenge because the complex CO2 photoreduction process usually generates multiple possible products and requires a subsequent separation step. In this paper, 2D monolayer and bilayer porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are successfully constructed by adjusting the reaction temperature and solvent polarity with 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin as the light&#8208;harvesting ligand. The bilayer MOF is a low&#8208;dimensional MOF with a special structure in which the upper and lower layers are arranged in dislocation and are bridged by halogen ions. This bilayer MOF exhibits 100% ultra&#8208;high selectivity for the reduction of CO2 to CO under simulated sunlight without any cocatalyst or photosensitizer and can be recycled at least three times. The intrinsic mechanism of this photocatalytic CO2 reduction process is explored through experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work shows that the rational design of the number of layers in 2D MOF structures can tune the stability of these structures and opens a new avenue for the design of highly selective MOF photocatalysts.

         <title>Multifunctional 3D&#8208;Printed Pollen Grain&#8208;Inspired Hydrogel Microrobots for On&#8208;Demand Anchoring and Cargo Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional hydrogel microrobot is created by different stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels with pollen grain&#8208;inspired microstructures. The robot is capable of conducting temperature&#8208;responsive on&#8208;demand surface attachment, magnetic locomotion, and pH&#8208;responsive cargo delivery toward biomedical applications.








Abstract
While a majority of wireless microrobots have shown multi&#8208;responsiveness to implement complex biomedical functions, their functional executions are strongly dependent on the range of stimulus inputs, which curtails their functional diversity. Furthermore, their responsive functions are coupled to each other, which results in the overlap of the task operations. Here, a 3D&#8208;printed multifunctional microrobot inspired by pollen grains with three hydrogel components is demonstrated: iron platinum (FePt) nanoparticle&#8208;embedded pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA), poly N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAM), and poly N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide acrylic acid (pNIPAM&#8208;AAc) structures. Each of these structures exhibits their respective targeted functions: responding to magnetic fields for torque&#8208;driven surface rolling and steering, exhibiting temperature responsiveness for on&#8208;demand surface attachment (anchoring), and pH&#8208;responsive cargo release. The versatile multifunctional pollen grain&#8208;inspired robots conceptualized here pave the way for various future medical microrobots to improve their projected performance and functional diversity.

         <title>Conjugated Coordination Polymer as a New Platform for Efficient and Selective Electroreduction of Nitrate into Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy for simultaneous enhancement of activity and selectivity toward nitrate electroreduction into ammonia (NRA) is demonstrated by utilizing Ni&#8208;based conjugated coordination polymer catalysts for the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. Coordination modulation can tailor their electrostatic attractions with the metal&#8208;hydrated cations that can regulate proton migration at the catalyst surface, promoting the NRA and inhibiting the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).








Abstract
Electroreduction of nitrate into ammonia (NRA) provides a sustainable route to convert the widespread nitrate pollutants into high&#8208;value&#8208;added products under ambient conditions, which unfortunately suffers from unsatisfactory selectivity due to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Previous strategies of modifying the metal sites of catalysts often met a dilemma for simultaneously promoting activity and selectivity toward NRA. Here, a general strategy is reported to enable an efficient and selective NRA process through coordination modulation of single&#8208;atom catalysts to tailor the local proton concentration at the catalyst surface. By contrast, two analogous Ni&#8208;single&#8208;atom enriched conjugated coordination polymers (NiO4&#8208;CCP and NiN4&#8208;CCP) with different coordination motifs are investigated for the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. The NiO4&#8208;CCP catalyst exhibits an ammonia yield rate as high as 1.83&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 94.7% under a current density of 125&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming the NiN4&#8208;CCP catalyst. These experimental and theoretical studies both suggest that the strategy of coordination modulation can not only accelerate the NRA&#160;by adjusting the adsorption energies of NRA intermediates on the metal sites but also inhibit the HER through regulating the proton migration with contributions from the metal&#8208;hydrated cations adsorbed at the catalyst surface, thus achieving simultaneous enhancement of NRA selectivity and activity.

         <title>Unlocking High Capacity and Fast Na+ Diffusion of HxCrS2 by Proton&#8208;Exchange Pretreatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pretreatment of NaCrS2 to produce HxCrS2 results in a more robust and higher performing electrode by numerous measures. Proton exchange produces a heterostructure that permits fast diffusion while also seemingly unlocking reversible access to cationic redox, enabling high capacity. The unique biphasic structure of HxCrS2 may be generalizable to other materials, opening a new class of electrode materials.








Abstract
This study presents a new material, &#8220;HxCrS2&#8221; (denotes approximate composition) formed by proton&#8208;exchange of NaCrS2 which has a measured capacity of 728 mAh g&#8722;1 with significant improvements to capacity retention, sustaining over 700 mAh g&#8722;1 during cycling experiments. This is the highest reported capacity for a transition metal sulfide electrode and outperforms the most promising proposed sodium anodes to date. HxCrS2 exhibits a biphasic structure featuring alternating crystalline and amorphous lamella on the scale of a few nanometers. This unique structural motif enables reversible access to Cr redox in the material resulting in higher capacities than seen in the parent structure which features only S redox. Pretreatment by proton&#8208;exchange offers a route to materials such as HxCrS2 which provide fast diffusion and high capacities for sodium&#8208;ion&#160;batteries.

         <title>Ultrasensitive and Ultraprecise Pressure Sensors for Soft Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Making flexible sensors more precise is the focus of this research. It is found that by making the pressure sensing layer using pure materials&#160;and separating it from the rest of the sensor structure, the errors caused by the sensor's deformation can be reduced when it is subjected to external forces. This leads to improved precision and flexibility in sensing.








Abstract
Highly sensitive soft pressure sensors have attracted tremendous attention in recent years due to their great promise in robotics, healthcare, smart wearables, etc. Although high sensitivities can be realized by existing sensing mechanisms, they usually cause large random errors owing to inhomogeneous sensing layers, thus considerably reducing the sensing precision for practical applications. Herein, a pure&#8208;polymer and field emission bilayer structure (PFEBS)&#8208;based transduction mechanism is presented to successfully design an ultrasensitive and ultraprecise soft pressure sensor for the first time. This unique structure enables numerous tunneling electrons generated by field emission to be transmitted through the homogeneous sensing layer, which undergoes uniform deformation under subtle pressures, simultaneously achieving a sensing precision with variation &lt;1.62% and a sensitivity of 372.2 kPa&#8722;1. This study offers a new design strategy to develop next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance flexible pressure sensors for soft systems.

         <title>Highly Damping and Self&#8208;Healable Ionic Elastomer from Dynamic Phase Separation of Sticky Fluorinated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the heterogeneous structure of adipose tissue, the first example of damping self&#8208;healable ionic elastomer is reported, which features a dynamic phase&#8208;separated structure with energy&#8208;dissipating nanophases embedded in an elastic matrix. By virtue of phase separation and sticky liquid crystal assembly of fluorinated copolymers, this design reconciles elasticity and damping capacity, which are usually contradictive in previous ionic skins.








Abstract
Shock&#8208;induced low&#8208;frequency vibration damage is extremely harmful to bionic soft robots and machines that may incur the malfunction of fragile electronic elements. However, current skin&#8208;like self&#8208;healable ionic elastomers as the artificial sensing and protecting layer still lack the ability to dampen vibrations, due to their almost opposite design for molecular frictions to material's elasticity. Inspired by the two&#8208;phase structure of adipose tissue (the natural damping skin layer), here, a highly damping ionic elastomer with energy&#8208;dissipating nanophases embedded in an elastic matrix is introduced, which is formed by polymerization&#8208;induced dynamic phase separation of sticky fluorinated copolymers in the presence of lithium salts. Such a supramolecular design decouples the elastic and damping functions into two distinct phases, and thus reconciles a few intriguing properties including ionic conductivity, high stretchability, softness, strain&#8208;stiffening, elastic recovery, room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healability, recyclability, and most importantly, record&#8208;high damping capacity at the human motion frequency range (loss factor tan &#948;&#160;&gt;&#160;1 at 0.1&#8211;50&#160;Hz). This study opens the door for the artificial syntheses of high&#8208;performance damping ionic skins with robust sensing and protective applications in soft electronics and robotics.

         <title>Picoperovskites: The Smallest Conceivable Isolated Halide Perovskite Structures Formed within Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskites CsPbBr3 and lead&#8208;free CsSnI3 form &#8220;picoperovskites&#8221; in 1.2&#8211;1.6&#160;nm&#8208;diameter single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes with cross&#8208;sectional unit&#8208;cell or sub&#8208;unit&#8208;cell dimensions. The smallest of these are bilayer inorganic polymers retaining ABX3 stoichiometry while intermediate&#8208;scale Cs3PbBr3 preserves Pb2+ by forming ordered vacancies. The largest Cs4Sn4Ix form alternates Cs4 and Sn4Ix layers along the nanotube cavities.








Abstract
Halide perovskite structures are revolutionizing the design of optoelectronic materials, including solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and photovoltaics when formed at the quantum scale. Four isolated sub&#8208;nanometer, or picoscale, halide perovskite structures formed inside &#8776;1.2&#8211;1.6&#160;nm single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by melt insertion from CsPbBr3 and lead&#8208;free CsSnI3 are reported. Three directly relate to the ABX3 perovskite archetype while a fourth is a perovskite&#8208;like lamellar structure with alternating Cs4 and polyhedral Sn4Ix layers. In &#8776;1.4&#160;nm&#8208;diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr3 forms Cs3PbIIBr5 nanowires, one ABX3 unit cell in cross section with the Pb2+ oxidation state maintained by ordered Cs+ vacancies. Within &#8776;1.2&#160;nm&#8208;diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr3 and CsSnI3 form inorganic&#8208;polymer&#8208;like bilayer structures, one&#8208;fourth of an ABX3 unit cell in cross section with systematically reproduced ABX3 stoichiometry. Producing these smallest halide perovskite structures at their absolute synthetic cross&#8208;sectional limit enables quantum confinement effects with first&#8208;principles calculations demonstrating bandgap widening compared to corresponding bulk structural forms.

&lt;p&gt;Halide perovskites CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and lead-free CsSnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; form &#8220;picoperovskites&#8221; in 1.2&#8211;1.6&#160;nm-diameter single-walled carbon nanotubes with cross-sectional unit-cell or sub-unit-cell dimensions. The smallest of these are bilayer inorganic polymers retaining ABX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; stoichiometry while intermediate-scale Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; preserves Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; by forming ordered vacancies. The largest Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; form alternates Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Sn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; layers along the nanotube cavities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halide perovskite structures are revolutionizing the design of optoelectronic materials, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photovoltaics when formed at the quantum scale. Four isolated sub-nanometer, or picoscale, halide perovskite structures formed inside &#8776;1.2&#8211;1.6&#160;nm single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by melt insertion from CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and lead-free CsSnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are reported. Three directly relate to the ABX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite archetype while a fourth is a perovskite-like lamellar structure with alternating Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and polyhedral Sn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; layers. In &#8776;1.4&#160;nm-diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; forms Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; nanowires, one ABX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; unit cell in cross section with the Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oxidation state maintained by ordered Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; vacancies. Within &#8776;1.2&#160;nm-diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CsSnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; form inorganic-polymer-like bilayer structures, one-fourth of an ABX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; unit cell in cross section with systematically reproduced ABX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; stoichiometry.

         <title>Rational Design of Platinum&#8211;Bismuth Sulfide Schottky Heterostructure for Sonocatalysis&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of sonocatalytic hydrogen evolution is first proposed. The synthesized platinum&#8211;bismuth sulfide&#160;nanoparticles exhibit ultrasound&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen production, glutathione oxidation, relieve hypoxia in vitro and in vivo, and effectively kill cancer cells by inhibiting cancer cell energy metabolism, increasing intratumoral reactive oxygen species levels, and inducing DNA damage.








Abstract
Conventional sonodynamic therapy is unavoidably limited by the tumor microenvironment, although many sonosensitizers have been developed to improve them to a certain extent. Given this, a concept of sonocatalytic hydrogen evolution is proposed, which is defined as an oxygen&#8208;independent therapeutics. To demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, the narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) is selected as the sonocatalyst and platinum (Pt) nanoparticles are grown in situ to optimize their catalytic performance. In this nanocatalytic system, the Pt nanoparticles help to capture sonoexcited electrons, whereas intratumoral overexpressed glutathione (GSH), as a natural hole sacrificial agent, can consume sonoexcited holes, which greatly improves the charge&#8208;separation efficiency and promotes controllable and sustainable H2&#160;generation. Even under hypoxic conditions, the Pt&#8208;Bi2S3&#160;nanoparticles can also produce sufficient H2&#160;under ultrasound irradiation. Mechanistically, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by H2&#160;and intratumoral redox homeostasis destruction by GSH depletion synergistically damage DNA to induce tumor cells apoptosis. At the same time, the Pt nanoparticles and holes can also trigger the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into O2&#160;to relieve tumor hypoxia,&#160;thus&#160;being synergistic with GSH depletion to reverse tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. The proposed sonocatalysis&#8208;mediated therapy will provide a new direction to realize facile and efficient cancer therapy.

         <title>Dual/Triple Template&#8208;Induced Evolved Emulsion for Controllable Construction of Anisotropic Carbon Nanoparticles from Concave to Convex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual/triple template&#8208;induced evolved emulsion strategy is developed for the precise construction of anisotropic mesoporous carbon nanoparticles. It not only endows the concave structure with adjustable size and meso&#8208;structure but also realizes the innovative transformation from concave to convex in a one&#8208;pot method. Moreover, the well&#8208;designed basin&#8208;concave and mountain&#8208;convex nanoparticles manifest excellent performance for improving drug release rate and enzyme catalytic efficiency.








Abstract
Anisotropic mesoporous carbon (AMC) nanoparticles with asymmetric external morphologies, topological internal structure, and superior performance of carbon species are attracting great attention because of their seductive features differentiating them from symmetric nanoparticles. However, a bewildering challenge but crucial desire remains to endow them with flexibly tunable morphology and pore structure. Herein, a dual/triple&#8208;templating evolved emulsion strategy for tunable fabrication of AMC nanoparticles with distinctive defined structure by interface&#8208;energy&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly is first reported based on a brand&#8208;new mechanism. It describes the possible formation process of the concave&#8208;cavity structure and allows for manipulation of the longitudinal and lateral sizes systematically by adjusting emulsion polarity and sodium oleate dosage, respectively. Interestingly, the internal pore structure can be rearranged into radial channels and the external morphology can realize structural transformation from concave to convex by innovatively introducing the third template n&#8208;hexanol, which is unprecedented at nanoscale. Remarkably, due to the excellent properties of carbon species and unique structural characteristics, AMC nanoparticles not only demonstrate good biocompatibility but also exhibit splendid performance in improving the dissolution and release rates of insoluble drug and enhancing the enzyme catalytic efficiency. Generally, this approach provides new inspiration and insights for expanding exquisite anisotropic nanomaterials for many potential applications.

A breathable, passive&#8208;cooling, non&#8208;inflammatory, biodegradable, and flexible aerogel electronic skin is developed to monitor physical, electrophysiological, and metabolic biomarkers from the human body continuously and simultaneously.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of human health can be significantly improved by designing novel electronic skin (E&#8208;skin) platforms that mimic the characteristics and sensitivity of human skin. A high&#8208;quality E&#8208;skin platform that can simultaneously monitor multiple physiological and metabolic biomarkers without introducing skin discomfort or irritation is an unmet medical need. Conventional E&#8208;skins are either monofunctional or made from elastomeric films that do not include key synergistic features of natural skin, such as multi&#8208;sensing, breathability, and thermal management capabilities in a single patch. Herein, a biocompatible and biodegradable E&#8208;skin patch based on flexible gelatin methacryloyl aerogel (FGA) for non&#8208;invasive and continuous monitoring of multiple biomarkers of interest is engineered and demonstrated. Taking advantage of cryogenic temperature treatment and slow polymerization, FGA is fabricated with a highly interconnected porous structure that displays good flexibility, passive&#8208;cooling capabilities, and ultra&#8208;lightweight properties that make it comfortable to wear for long periods of time. It also provides numerous permeable capillary channels for thermal&#8208;moisture transfer, ensuring its excellent breathability. Therefore, the engineered FGA&#8208;based E&#8208;skin can simultaneously monitor body temperature, hydration, and biopotentials via electrophysiological sensors and detect glucose, lactate, and alcohol levels via electrochemical sensors. This work offers a previously unexplored materials strategy for next&#8208;generation E&#8208;skin platforms with superior practicality.

         <title>A Pseudocapacitor Diode Based on Ion&#8208;Selective Surface Redox Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pseudocapacitor diode is proposed for the first time, which is constructed by the ion&#8208;selective surface redox mechanism of spinel ZnCo2O4 in aqueous electrolyte KOH, thus successfully integrating the function of blocking the unidirectional current response of a diode into an aqueous pseudocapacitor with fast ion conduction capability.








Abstract
Supercapacitor diode (CAPode) is a novel device that integrates ion diode functionality into a conventional electrical double&#8208;layer capacitor and is expected to have great applications in emerging fields such as signal propagation, microcircuit rectification, logic operations, and neuromorphology. Here, a brand new pseudocapacitor diode is reported that has both high charge storage (50.2&#160;C&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mV&#160;s&#8722;1) and high rectification (the rectification ratio of 0.79 at 200&#160;mV&#160;s&#8722;1) properties, which is realized by the ion&#8208;selective surface redox reaction of spinel ZnCo2O4 in aqueous alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, an application of the integrated device is demonstrated in the logic gate of circuit system to realize the logic operations of &#8220;AND&#8221; and &#8220;OR&#8221;. This work not only expands the types of CAPodes, but also provides a train of thought for constructing high&#8208;performance capacitive ionic diodes.

&lt;p&gt;A pseudocapacitor diode is proposed for the first time, which is constructed by the ion-selective surface redox mechanism of spinel ZnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in aqueous electrolyte KOH, thus successfully integrating the function of blocking the unidirectional current response of a diode into an aqueous pseudocapacitor with fast ion conduction capability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supercapacitor diode (CAPode) is a novel device that integrates ion diode functionality into a conventional electrical double-layer capacitor and is expected to have great applications in emerging fields such as signal propagation, microcircuit rectification, logic operations, and neuromorphology. Here, a brand new pseudocapacitor diode is reported that has both high charge storage (50.2&#160;C&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20&#160;mV&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and high rectification (the rectification ratio of 0.79 at 200&#160;mV&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) properties, which is realized by the ion-selective surface redox reaction of spinel ZnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in aqueous alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, an application of the integrated device is demonstrated in the logic gate of circuit system to realize the logic operations of &#8220;AND&#8221; and &#8220;OR&#8221;. This work not only expands the types of CAPodes, but also provides a train of thought for constructing high-performance capacitive ionic diodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Locked Tandem Fluorescent Probe for Imaging of Pyroptosis in Cancer Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;locked and tandem activatable probe (DTAP) is presented for real&#8208;time near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of intratumoral pyroptosis during cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in living mice. It provides a non&#8208;invasive tool to study the regulatory mechanism of pyroptosis during cancer therapy and predict cancer therapeutic efficacy, hence capable of being applied to optimize cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapies for precision medicine.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time imaging of programmed cancer cell death (PCD) is imperative to monitor cancer therapeutic efficacy and tailor therapeutic regimens; however, specific in vivo detection of intratumoral pyroptosis remains challenging. Herein, a dual&#8208;locked and tandem activatable probe (DTAP) is reported for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of intratumoral pyroptosis during cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in living mice. The probe comprises a hemicyanine dye dual&#8208;locked with an enzyme&#8208;responsive moiety that can be tandemly cleaved by pyroptosis&#8208;related biomarker (Caspase&#8208;1) and cancer biomarker (GGT) to turn on its NIRF signal. As pyroptosis plays a vital role in triggering anti&#8208;tumor immune responses, the activated signal of DTAP correlates well with the population of tumor&#8208;infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes and tumor growth inhibition, consequently permitting the prediction of cancer therapeutic efficacy. This study also provides a non&#8208;invasive technique to study the regulatory mechanism of pyroptosis in cancer therapy and to optimize cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapies for precision medicine.

         <title>Graph Analysis with Multifunctional Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristive Crossbar Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graph analysis based on the desired sneak current is performed using a self&#8208;rectifying memristor and a &#8220;metal cell at diagonalcrossbar array (mCBA)&#8221; structure. mCBA effectively extracts hidden information from complex networks without preprocessing and loss of information. Three graph algorithms (pathfinding, link prediction, community detection) and brain network&#8208;based attention&#8208;deficit/hyperactivity disorder classification are performed effectively based on the mCBA.








Abstract
Many big data have interconnected and dynamic graph structures growing over time. Analyzing these graphical data requires the hidden relationship between the nodes in the graphs to be identified, which has conventionally been achieved by finding the effective similarity. However, graphs are generally non&#8208;Euclidean, which does not allow finding it. In this study, the non&#8208;Euclidean graphs are mapped to a specific crossbar array (CBA) composed of self&#8208;rectifying memristors and metal cells at the diagonal positions. The sneak current, an intrinsic physical property in the CBA, allows for the identification of the similarity function. The sneak&#8208;current&#8208;based similarity function indicates the distance between the nodes, which can be used to predict the probability that unconnected nodes will be connected in the future, connectivity between communities, and neural connections in a brain. When all bit lines of the CBA are connected to the ground, the sneak current is suppressed, and the CBA can be used to search for adjacent nodes. This work demonstrates the physical calculation methods applied to various graphical problems&#160;using the CBA composed of the self&#8208;rectifying memristor based on the HfO2 switching layer. Moreover, such applications suffer less from the memristors&#8217; inherent issues related to their stochastic nature.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Guaranteed High Carrier Mobility in Quasi&#8208;2D Thermoelectric Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The horizontal mirror symmetry in BaAgSb vanishes the electron&#8211;phonon coupling mediated by phonons with purely out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrational vectors, which weakens the phonon&#8208;induced carrier scattering and triggers a record hole mobility among polycrystalline quasi&#8208;2D thermoelectrics. Such high mobility accompanied with intrinsically low thermal conductivity gives rise to excellent p&#8208;type thermoelectric performance in polycrystalline BaAgSb.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors have garnered immense research interest for next&#8208;generation electronics and thermoelectrics due to their unique structural, mechanical, and transport properties. However, most quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors experimentally synthesized so far have relatively low carrier mobility, preventing the achievement of exceptional power output. To break through this obstacle, a route is proposed based on the crystal symmetry arguments to facilitate the charge transport of quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors, in which the horizontal mirror symmetry is found to vanish the electron&#8211;phonon coupling strength mediated by phonons with purely out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrational vectors. This is demonstrated in ZrBeSi&#8208;type quasi&#8208;2D systems, where the representative sample Ba1.01AgSb shows a high room&#8208;temperature hole mobility of 344 cm2 V&#8722;1 S&#8722;1, a record value among quasi&#8208;2D polycrystalline thermoelectrics. Accompanied by intrinsically low thermal conductivity, an excellent p&#8208;type zT of &#8776;1.3 is reached at 1012 K, which is the highest value in ZrBeSi&#8208;type compounds. This work uncovers the relation between electron&#8211;phonon coupling and crystal symmetry in quasi&#8208;2D systems, which broadens the horizon to develop high mobility semiconductors for electronic and energy conversion applications.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Photodetectors with Over 450 Days Stability Enabled by Synergistic Engineering for Pulse Oximetry System</title>

The multifunctional additive 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoic acid (ATFBA), with terminal amino and carboxyl groups, passivates the surface defects and enhances the stability of the Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite, therefore resulting in high sensitivity and highly stable Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetectors. In addition, the ATFBA&#8208;based photodetector has been integrated with a pulse oximetry visualization system, successfully yielding accurate blood oxygen saturation and heart rate.








Abstract
Low&#8208;bandgap tin (Sn)&#8208;lead (Pb) halide perovskites can achieve near&#8208;infrared response for photodetectors. However, the Sn&#8208;based devices suffer from notorious instability and high defect densities due to the oxidation propensity of Sn2+. Herein, a multifunctional additive 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoic acid (ATFBA) is presented, which can passivate surface defects and inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ through hydrogen bonds and chelation coordination from the terminal amino and carboxyl groups. The perfluorinated benzene ring structure of ATFBA affords the passivator assembled at the grain boundaries to enhance the water resistance. With the synergistical passivation of these functional groups, the Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetector exhibits a remarkable responsivity of 0.52&#160;A&#160;W&#8208;1 and an excellent specific detectivity of 5.34&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones at 850&#160;nm, along with remaining 97% of its initial responsivity over 450 days. Benefitting from high sensitivity, the photodetector is integrated into a pulse oximetry sensor visualization system, yielding accurate blood oxygen saturation and heart rate with less than 2% error. This work paves the avenue toward constructing high&#8208;performance and stable Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetectors for practical applications.

         <title>Electrochemical Replication and Transfer for Low&#8208;Cost, Sub&#8208;100&#160;nm Patterning of Materials on Flexible Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new additive patterning technique, named electrochemical replication and transfer, is developed to pattern a wide variety of metals, semiconductors, and polymers with resolutions spanning from sub&#8208;100&#160;nm to many centimeters on flexible substrates at low cost and high throughput.








Abstract
The fabrication of high&#8208;resolution patterns on flexible substrates is an essential step in the development of flexible electronics. However, the patterning process on flexible substrates often requires expensive equipment and tedious lithographic processing. Here, a bottom&#8208;up patterning technique, termed electrochemical replication and transfer (ERT) is reported, which fabricates multiscale patterns of a wide variety of materials by selective electrodeposition of target materials on a predefined template, and subsequent transfer of the electrodeposited materials to a flexible substrate, while leaving the undamaged template for reuse for over 100 times. The additive and parallel patterning attribute of ERT allows the fabrication of multiscale patterns with resolutions spanning from sub&#8208;100&#160;nm to many centimeters simultaneously, which overcomes the trade&#8208;off between resolution and throughput of conventional patterning techniques. ERT is suitable for fabricating a wide variety of materials including metals, semiconductors, metal oxides, and polymers into arbitrary shapes on flexible substrates at a very low cost.

         <title>Stem Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated Microribbon Scaffolds Induce Regenerative Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses in a Critical&#8208;Size Cranial Bone Defect Model</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell membrane coating represents a biomimetic strategy for modifying the surface of biomaterials. Coating macroporous microribbon scaffolds with mesenchymal stem cell membrane (MSCM) enhances cranial bone healing via immunomodulation. Primed MSCM&#8208;coating contains ligands that promote M&#966; polarization toward M2, induce Treg differentiation and TCD8+ apoptosis, and enhance MSC osteogenesis. MSCM coating synergizes with BMP&#8208;2 to further accelerate bone regeneration while suppressing inflammation.








Abstract
Naturally&#8208;derived cell membranes have shown great promise in functionalizing nanoparticles to enhance biointerfacing functions for drug delivery applications. However, its potential for functionalizing macroporous scaffolds to enhance tissue regeneration in vivo remains unexplored. Engineering scaffolds with immunomodulatory functions represents an exciting strategy for tissue regeneration but is largely limited to soft tissues. Critical&#8208;sized bone defects cannot heal on their own, and the role of adaptive immune cells in scaffold&#8208;mediated healing of cranial bone defects remains largely unknown. Here, mensenchymal stem cell membrane (MSCM)&#8208;coated microribbon (&#181;RB) scaffolds for treating critical size cranial bone defects via targeting immunomodulation are reported. Confocal imaging and proteomic analyses are used to confirm successful coating and characterize the compositions of cell membrane coating. It is demonstrated that MSCM coating promotes macrophage (M&#966;) polarization toward regenerative phenotype, induces CD8+ T cell apoptosis, and enhances regulatory T cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo. When combined with a low dosage of BMP&#8208;2, MSCM coating further accelerates bone regeneration and suppresses inflammation. These results establish cell membrane&#8208;coated microribbon scaffolds as a promising strategy for treating critical size bone defects via immunomodulation. The platform may be broadly used with different cell membranes and scaffolds to enhance regeneration of multiple tissue types.

         <title>Multiplexed Ultrasensitive Sample&#8208;to&#8208;Answer RT&#8208;LAMP Chip for the Identification of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Influenza Viruses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer chip operated by LED is developed to detect SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and influenza viruses simultaneously. The ultrafast target enrichment (&#8776;500&#215;) followed by autonomous elution and amplification via photothermal activation enables limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 0.5 copies &#181;L&#8722;1. The sensitive detection in point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings comparable to standard polymerase chain reaction allows timely management of various pandemic situations that may be faced shortly.








Abstract
Prompt on&#8208;site diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with other respiratory infections will have minimized the global impact of the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic through rapid, effective management. However, no such multiplex point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) chip has satisfied a suitable sensitivity of gold&#8208;standard nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Here, a rapid multiplexed ultrasensitive sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer loop&#8208;mediated isothermal amplification (MUSAL) chip operated by simple LED&#8208;driven photothermal amplification to detect six targets from single&#8208;swab sampling is presented. First, the MUSAL chip allows ultrafast on&#8208;chip sample preparation with &#8776;500&#8208;fold preconcentration at a rate of 1.2&#160;mL min&#8722;1. Second, the chip enables contamination&#8208;free amplification using autonomous target elution into on&#8208;chip reagents by photothermal activation. Finally, the chip accomplishes multiplexed on&#8208;chip diagnostics of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and influenza viruses with a limit of detection (LoD) of 0.5 copies &#181;L&#8722;1. The rapid, ultrasensitive, cost&#8208;effective sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer chip with a multiplex capability will allow timely management of various pandemics situations that may be faced shortly.

         <title>A Super Tough, Rapidly Biodegradable, Ultrafast Hemostatic Bioglue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bioglue is composed of amidated&#8208;gelatin and Tetra&#8208;PEG&#8208;SS for rapid hemostasis in massive hemorrhage. The amino terminals in gelatin quickly react with active ester moieties in the PEG&#8208;SS, endowing the amino&#8208;gelatin&#8208;PEG glue firm and indiscriminate adhesion with various moist tissues (e.g., adhesively sealing cardiac hemorrhagic wounds). The bioglue provides a fascinating hemostatic approach for clinical hemostasis and emergency rescue.








Abstract
Death happening due to massive hemorrhage has been involved in military conflicts, traffic accidents, and surgical injuries of various human disasters. Achieving rapid and effective hemostasis to save lives is crucial in urgent massive bleeding situations. Herein, a covalent cross&#8208;linked AG&#8208;PEG glue based on extracellular matrix&#8208;like amino&#8208;gelatin (AG) and PEG derivatives is developed. The AG&#8208;PEG glue gelatinizes fast and exhibits firm and indiscriminate close adhesion with various moist tissues upon being dosed. The formed glue establishes an adhesive and robust barrier to seal the arterial, hepatic, and cardiac hemorrhagic wounds, enabling it to withstand up to 380&#160;mmHg blood pressure in comparison with normal systolic blood pressure of 60&#8211;180&#160;mmHg. Remarkably, massive bleeding from a pig cardiac penetrating hole with 6&#160;mm diameter is effectively stopped using the glue within 60&#160;s. Postoperative indexes of the treated pig gradually recover and the cardiac wounds regrow significantly at 14&#160;days. Possessing on&#8208;demand solubility, self&#8208;gelling, and rapid degradability, the AG&#8208;PEG glue may provide a fascinating stop&#8208;bleeding approach for clinical hemostasis and emergency rescue.

A second&#8208;order nonlinear Hall effect response for high&#8208;efficiency terahertz rectification, is observed in the spin&#8208;polarized 1T&#8208;CoTe2, led by the zero&#8208;magnetic&#8208;field&#160;extrinsic contribution of topological electronic states. The Hall&#8208;rectifier, without invoking any semiconductor junctions or bias voltage, shows up room&#8208;temperature responsivity of over 0.1 A W&#8722;1, and a mean noise equivalent power of 1 pW Hz&#8722;1/2, opening up device implementation based on quantum&#8208;wavefunction engineering.








Abstract
The zero&#8208;magnetic&#8208;field nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) refers to the second&#8208;order transverse current induced by an applied alternating electric field; it indicates the topological properties of inversion&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking crystals. Despite several studies on the NLHE induced by the Berry&#8208;curvature dipole in Weyl semimetals, the direct current conversion by rectification is limited to very low driving frequencies and cryogenic temperatures. The nonlinear photoresponse generated by the NLHE at room temperature can be useful for numerous applications in communication, sensing, and photodetection across a high bandwidth. In this study, observations of the second&#8208;order NLHE in type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal CoTe2 under time&#8208;reversal symmetry are reported. This is determined by the disorder&#8208;induced extrinsic contribution on the broken&#8208;inversion&#8208;symmetry surface and room&#8208;temperature terahertz rectification without the need for semiconductor junctions or bias voltage. It is shown that remarkable photoresponsivity over 0.1 A W&#8722;1, a response time of approximately 710&#160;ns, and a mean noise equivalent power of 1 pW Hz&#8722;1/2 can be achieved at room temperature. The results open a new pathway for low&#8208;energy photon harvesting via nonlinear rectification induced by the NLHE in strongly spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled and inversion&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking systems, promising a considerable impact in the field of infrared/terahertz photonics.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Ionizable Iron Nanoadjuvant Augments STING Activation for Personalized Vaccination Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;ionizable iron nanoadjuvant (PEIM) is developed to potentiate cancer vaccination immunotherapy. PEIM nanoadjuvant is coassembled from acid&#8208;ionizable&#160;copolymers with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist. PEIM nanoadjuvant effectively delivers tumor antigens to lymph nodes, amplifies STING activation and type&#8208;I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) production, and ultimately&#160;elicits antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell response to inhibit tumor growth.








Abstract
The critical challenge for cancer vaccine&#8208;induced T&#8208;cell immunity is the sustained activation of antigen cross&#8208;presentation in antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) with innate immune stimulation. In this study, it is first discovered that the clinically used magnetic contrast agents, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), markedly augment the type&#8208;I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) production profile of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist MSA&#8208;2 and achieve a 16&#8208;fold dosage&#8208;sparing effect in the human STING haplotype. Acid&#8208;ionizable copolymers are coassembled with IONPs and MSA&#8208;2 into iron nanoadjuvants to concentrate STING activation in the draining lymph nodes. The top candidate iron nanoadjuvant (PEIM) efficiently delivers the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) to CD169+ APCs and facilitates antigen cross&#8208;presentation to elicit a 55&#8208;fold greater frequency of antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocyte response than soluble antigen. PEIM@OVA nanovaccine immunization induces potent and durable antitumor immunity to prevent tumor lung metastasis and eliminate established tumors. Moreover, PEIM nanoadjuvant is applicable to deliver autologous tumor antigen and synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade therapy for prevention of postoperative tumor recurrence and distant metastasis in B16&#8208;OVA melanoma and MC38 colorectal tumor models. The acid&#8208;ionizable iron nanoadjuvant offers a generalizable and readily translatable strategy to augment STING cascade activation and antigen cross&#8208;presentation for personalized cancer vaccination immunotherapy.

         <title>Hierarchical Porous Monoliths of Steel with Self&#8208;Reinforcing Adaptive Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous steel structures combining ultralow weight and high mechanical efficiency are manufactured by printing, reducing, and sintering wet foams containing iron oxide precursor particles. By forming new load&#8208;bearing struts when compressed, the porous structures are able to reversibly stiffen in response to nonuniform stresses, a behavior that conceptually resembles the unique adaptive properties of human bone.








Abstract
Porous structures offer an attractive approach to reduce the amount of natural resources used while maintaining relatively high mechanical efficiency. However, for some applications the drop in mechanical properties resulting from the introduction of porosity is too high, which has limited the broader utilization of porous materials in industry. Here, it is shown that steel monoliths can be designed to display high mechanical efficiency and reversible self&#8208;reinforcing properties when made with porous architectures with up to three hierarchical levels. Ultralight steel structures that can float on water and autonomously adapt their stiffness are manufactured by the thermal reduction and sintering of 3D printed foam templates. Using distinct mechanical testing techniques, image analysis, and finite element simulations, the mechanisms leading to the high mechanical efficiency and self&#8208;stiffening ability of the hierarchical porous monoliths are studied. The design and fabrication of mechanically stable porous monoliths using iron as a widely available natural resource is expected to contribute to the future development of functional materials with a more sustainable footprint.

         <dc:description>
Gold/aluminum micro&#8208;strips repeat along a specific direction and periodically form overlaps and gaps in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner like the patterns of a zebra. After compounding with semiconducting supramolecular nanowires, an output voltage of 140&#160;V can be achieved on a flexible substrate upon illumination.








Abstract
The mutual conversion between light and electricity lies at the heart of optoelectronic and photonic applications. Maximization of the photoelectric conversion is a long&#8208;term goal that can be pursued via the fabrication of devices with ad&#8208;hoc architectures. In this framework, it is of utter importance to harvest and transform light irradiation into high electric potential in&#160;specific area for driving functional dielectrics that respond to pure electric field. Here, a nano&#8208;fabrication technology has been devised featuring double self&#8208;alignment that is applied to construct zebra&#8208;like asymmetric heterojunction arrays. Such nanostructured composite, which covers a surface area of 5&#160;&#215;&#160;4&#160;mm2 and contains 500 periodic repeating units, is capable of photo generating voltages as high as 140&#160;V on a flexible substrate. This approach represents a leap over the traditional functionalization process based on simply embedding materials into devices by demonstrating the disruptive potential of integrating oriented nanoscale device components into meta&#8208;material.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Promoted Co&#8208;Production of Dihydroisoquinoline and H2O2 over Defective Zn3In2S6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;functional and defective Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst is developed for the simultaneous efficient photocatalytic co&#8208;syntheses of dihydroisoquinoline and H2O2, which shows the highest rate for both reactions up to date.








Abstract
One of the most sustainable and promising approaches for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production in a low&#8208;cost and environment&#8208;friendly way is photosynthesis, which, however, suffers from poor carrier utilization and low H2O2 productivity. The addition of proton donors such as isopropanol or ethanol can increase H2O2 production, which, unfortunately, will inevitably elevate the entire cost while wasting the oxidizing power of holes (h+). Herein, the tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs) is employed as a distinctive proton donor for the thermodynamically feasible and selective semi&#8208;dehydrogenation reaction to highly valuable dihydroisoquinolines (DHIQs), and meanwhile, to couple with and promote H2O2 generation in one photoredox reaction under the photocatalysis by dual&#8208;functional Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst. Surprisingly, the suitably defective Zn3In2S6 offers an excellent and near&#8208;stoichiometric co&#8208;production performance of H2O2 and DHIQs at unprecedentedly high rates of 66.4 and 62.1&#160;mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 under visible light (&#955;&#160;&#8805; 400&#160;nm), respectively, which outperforms all the previously available reports even though sacrificial agents&#160;were&#160;employed in those reports. Additionally, photocatalytic redox reaction mechanism demonstrates that H2O2 can be generated through multiple pathways, highlighting the synergistic effect among ROS (&#183;O2&#8208; and 1O2), h+ and proton donor, which has been ignored in previous studies.

&lt;p&gt;A dual-functional and defective Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; photocatalyst is developed for the simultaneous efficient photocatalytic co-syntheses of dihydroisoquinoline and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which shows the highest rate for both reactions up to date.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most sustainable and promising approaches for hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) production in a low-cost and environment-friendly way is photosynthesis, which, however, suffers from poor carrier utilization and low H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; productivity. The addition of proton donors such as isopropanol or ethanol can increase H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, which, unfortunately, will inevitably elevate the entire cost while wasting the oxidizing power of holes (h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Herein, the tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs) is employed as a distinctive proton donor for the thermodynamically feasible and selective semi-dehydrogenation reaction to highly valuable dihydroisoquinolines (DHIQs), and meanwhile, to couple with and promote H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation in one photoredox reaction under the photocatalysis by dual-functional Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; photocatalyst. Surprisingly, the suitably defective Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; offers an excellent and near-stoichiometric co-production performance of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and DHIQs at unprecedentedly high rates of 66.4 and 62.1&#160;mmol h&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; under visible light (&#955;&#160;&#8805; 400&#160;nm), respectively, which outperforms all the previously available reports even though sacrificial agents&#160;were&#160;employed in those reports. Additionally, photocatalytic redox reaction mechanism demonstrates that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be generated through multiple pathways, highlighting the synergistic effect among ROS (&#183;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and proton donor, which has been ignored in previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Wavelength Light&#8208;Responsive Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network&#8208;Based Microrobots for Reactive Species Scavenging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a hollow metal&#8211;phenolic network&#8208;based microrobot with spray&#8208;coated asymmetric capping is reported capable of moving under both near&#8208;infrared irradiation and ultraviolet irradiation without fuel. With multi&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;responsiveness, tunable size of the particles, and great reactive oxygen and nitrogen species scavenging capacity, the proposed microrobots can be ideal for future in vivo analytical sensing and medical treatment.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven microrobots with different propulsion mechanisms have attracted great attention in microrobot synthesis and applications. However, current systems rely heavily on precious metals, using a complex synthesis process and limited working wavelength. It is therefore of great interest to fabricate microrobots that can be driven by multi&#8208;wavelength irradiation and with simple components. Here, metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN)&#8208;based microrobots are synthesized using a sacrificial polystyrene bead template and an extra capping is added to regulate their symmetry. The hollow MPN microrobots with different layers of capping are capable of moving under both near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, without fuel. The velocity of the microrobots under irradiation is altered by the thickness of the asymmetric capping and their motion could be manipulated remotely by switching the NIR or UV irradiation on and off. With light&#8208;driven mobility, the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) scavenging activity of the microrobots is significantly increased. Therefore, this proposed microrobot system provides a synthesis strategy to develop asymmetric light&#8208;navigated microrobots for future medical treatment with tunable structure, multi&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;responsive mobility, and great RONS scavenging capacity.

         <title>Coordination Polymer Electrocatalysts Enable Efficient CO&#8208;to&#8208;Acetate Conversion</title>

Integrating a coordination polymer catalyst consisting of Cu(I) and benzimidazole units linked via Cu(I)&#8208;imidazole coordination bonds in a cation exchange membrane&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly enables stable acetate electrosynthesis for 190&#160;h, while achieving direct collection of concentrated acetate, an average single&#8208;pass utilization of 50%, and an average acetate full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 15% at 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Upgrading carbon dioxide/monoxide to multi&#8208;carbon C2+ products using renewable electricity offers one route to more sustainable fuel and chemical production. One of the most appealing products is acetate, the profitable electrosynthesis of which demands a catalyst with higher efficiency. Here, a coordination polymer (CP) catalyst is reported that consists of Cu(I) and benzimidazole units linked via Cu(I)&#8208;imidazole coordination bonds, which enables selective reduction of CO to acetate with a 61% Faradaic efficiency at &#8722;0.59 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode at a current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in flow cells. The catalyst is integrated in a cation exchange membrane&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly that enables stable acetate electrosynthesis for 190&#160;h, while achieving direct collection of concentrated acetate (3.3 molar) from the cathodic liquid stream, an average single&#8208;pass utilization of 50% toward CO&#8208;to&#8208;acetate conversion, and an average acetate full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 15% at a current density of 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Intracellular Glucose&#8208;Depriving Polymer Micelles for Antiglycolytic Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glucose&#8208;responsive polymer is designed, considering the unique metabolism of cancer cells. The polymer exhibits micellar&#8208;structure stability during blood circulation and accumulates in tumor tissues. Specific binding between the polymer and intracellular glucose induces glucose deprivation in tumor cells. Glucose metabolism is particularly inhibited; the lack of energy in tumor cells is intensified, leading to tumor suppression.








Abstract
A new anticancer strategy to exploit abnormal metabolism of cancer cells rather than to merely control the drug release or rearrange the tumor microenvironment is reported. An antiglycolytic amphiphilic polymer, designed considering the unique metabolism of cancer cells (Warburg effect) and aimed at the regulation of glucose metabolism, is synthesized through chemical conjugation between glycol chitosan (GC) and phenylboronic acid (PBA). GC&#8208;PBA derivatives form stable micellar structures under physiological conditions and respond to changes in glucose concentration. Once the micelles accumulate at the tumor site, intracellular glucose capture occurs, and the resultant energy deprivation through the inhibition of aerobic glycolysis remarkably suppresses tumor growth without significant side effects in vivo. This strategy highlights the need to develop safe and effective cancer treatment without the use of conventional anticancer drugs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Nanocrystalline Structures from Freestanding Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scientific exploration of nanomaterials has led to massive growth in understanding and applications of quantum materials at the nanoscale. A route for fabrication of nanocrystalline oxide structures of exceptional quality utilizing self&#8208;assembly of freestanding membranes transferred on appropriate substrates is presented. The microstructure of the nanocrystals exhibits exceptional quality, characterized by a pristine crystal structure and uniform stoichiometry after self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
The exploration of crystalline nanostructures enhances the understanding of quantum phenomena occurring in spatially confined quantum matter and may lead to functional materials with unforeseen applications. A novel route to fabricating nanocrystalline oxide structures of exceptional quality is presented. This is achieved by utilizing a self&#8208;assembly process of ultrathin membranes composed of the desired oxide. The thermally induced self&#8208;assembly of nanocrystalline structures is driven by dewetting the oxide membranes once they are lifted off and transferred onto sapphire surfaces. In three successive steps, the process provides nanovoids, nanowires, and nanocrystals. Regardless of substrate orientation, the nanostructures are highly anisotropic in shape due to material retraction favoring low&#8208;index crystalline lattice directions of the membranes. The orientation of the nanostructures is provided precisely by the crystal lattice of the transferred membrane. The microstructure of the nanocrystals exhibits exceptional quality, characterized by a pristine crystal structure and uniform stoichiometry, both maintained all the way down to the well&#8208;developed crystalline facets. The demonstrated self&#8208;assembly process holds the potential to improve the understanding of surface diffusion phenomena at the interface of materials, which is important for advancing epitaxial growth technology and paves the way to fabricating crystalline nanostructures by the transfer and self&#8208;assembly of membranes.

         <title>HACS: Helical Auxetic Yarn Capacitive Strain Sensors with Sensitivity Beyond the Theoretical Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capacitive strain sensors are theoretically limited in their sensitivity. In this work, stretchable and flexible strain sensors are fabricated using a helical auxetic yarn structure providing access to auxetic character in the fiber form. The helical auxetic capacitive sensors (HACS) are able to access sensitivity beyond the theoretical limit, determined to be because of an engulfment phenomenon that occurs as a result of the materials employed and the auxetic character.








Abstract
The development of flexible strain sensors over the past decade has focused on accessing high strain percentages and high sensitivity (i.e., gauge factors). Strain sensors that employ capacitance as the electrical signal to correlate to strain are typically restricted in sensitivity because of the Poisson effect. By employing auxetic structures, the limits of sensitivity for capacitive sensors have been exceeded, which has improved the competitiveness of this modality of sensing. In this work, the first employment of helical auxetic yarns as capacitive sensors is presented. It is found that the response of the helical auxetic yarn capacitive sensors (termed as HACS) is dependent on the two main fabrication variables&#8212;the ratio of diameters and the helical wrapping length. Depending on these variables, sensors that respond to strain with increasing or decreasing capacitance values can be obtained. A greater auxetic character results in larger sensitivities accessible at smaller strains&#8212;a characteristic that is not commonly found when accessing high gauge factors. In addition, the highest sensitivity for auxetic capacitive sensors reported thus far is obtained. A mechanism of sensor response that explains both the variable capacitance response and the high gauge factors obtained experimentally is proposed.

         <title>Fully Optical in Operando Investigation of Ambient Condition Electrical Switching in MoS2 Nanodevices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically thin MoS2 electrical switches are characterized for the first time in operando and in ambient conditions through a non&#8208;invasive spectroscopy&#8208;based method. The study sheds light on the &#8211; controversial and still debated &#8211; dynamics driving the switching mechanism. It reveals volatile metallic filaments percolating interatomic spacing in MoS2 and stresses the impact of transfer residues on the electrical performance of switches.








Abstract
MoS2 nanoswitches have shown superb ultralow switching energies without excessive leakage currents. However, the debate about the origin and volatility of electrical switching is unresolved due to the lack of adequate nanoimaging of devices in operando. Here, three optical techniques are combined to perform the first noninvasive in situ characterization of nanosized MoS2 devices. This study reveals volatile threshold resistive switching due to the intercalation of metallic atoms from electrodes directly between Mo and S atoms, without the assistance of sulfur vacancies. A &#8220;semi&#8208;memristive&#8221; effect driven by an organic adlayer adjacent to MoS2 is observed, which suggests that nonvolatility can be achieved by careful interface engineering. These findings provide a crucial understanding of nanoprocess in vertically biased MoS2 nanosheets, which opens new routes to conscious engineering and optimization of 2D electronics.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Reconstruction of Conductive Filaments in HfOx&#8208;Based Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive filaments (CFs) with different morphologies after forming, set, and reset operations are clearly revealed in HfOx&#8208;based memristors by the 3D reconstruction of c&#8208;AFM technique. Multiple conductive filaments are successfully observed in the devices with three different resistive states. The rupture location of CFs after reset is also observed clearly.








Abstract
HfOx&#8208;based memristor has been studied extensively as one of the most promising memories for the excellent nonvolatile data storage and computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory capabilities. However, the resistive switching mechanism, relying on the formation and rupture of conductive filaments (CFs) during device operations, is still under debate. In this work, the CFs with different morphologies after different operations&#8212;forming, set, and reset&#8212;are clearly revealed for the first time by 3D reconstruction of conductive atomic force microscopy (c&#8208;AFM) images. Intriguingly, multiple CFs are successfully observed in HfOx&#8208;based memristor devices with three different resistive states. CFs after forming, set, and reset exhibit the typical morphologies of hourglass, inverted&#8208;cone, and short&#8208;cone, respectively. The rupture location of CFs after the reset operation is also observed clearly. These findings reveal the microscopic behaviors underlying the resistive switching, which could pave the road to design and optimize oxide&#8208;based memristors for both memory and computing applications.

         <title>Dissolvable Self&#8208;Locking Microneedle Patches Integrated with Immunomodulators for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
An advanced projection micro&#8208;stereolithography 3D printer&#8208;based self&#8208;locking dissolvable microneedle is presented as a mass&#8208;producible and cost&#8208;effective transdermal drug delivery platform for precise microdose delivery of drugs in a minimally invasive manner. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a novel combination immunotherapy approach proposed to improve melanoma treatment efficacy shows a significantly higher efficacy when delivered via self&#8208;locking microneedles than intratumoral injection.








Abstract
Advancements in micro&#8208;resolution 3D printers have significantly facilitated the development of highly complex mass&#8208;producible drug delivery platforms. Conventionally, due to the limitations of micro&#8208;milling machineries, dissolvable microneedles (MNs) are mainly fabricated in cone&#8208;shaped geometry with limited drug delivery accuracy. Herein, to overcome the limitations of conventional MNs, a novel projection micro&#8208;stereolithography 3D printer&#8208;based self&#8208;locking MN for precise skin insertion, adhesion, and transcutaneous microdose drug delivery is presented. The geometry of self&#8208;locking MN consists of a sharp skin&#8208;penetrating tip, a wide skin interlocking body, and a narrow base with mechanical supports fabricated over a flexible hydrocolloid patch to improve the accuracy of skin penetration into irregular surfaces. Melanoma, a type of skin cancer, is selected as the model for the investigation of self&#8208;locking MNs due to its irregular and uneven surface. In vivo immunotherapy efficacy is evaluated by integrating SD&#8208;208, a novel transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; (TGF&#8208;&#946;) inhibitor that suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of tumors, and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 (aPD&#8208;L1 Ab), an immune checkpoint inhibitor that induces T cell&#8208;mediated tumor cell death, into self&#8208;locking MNs and comparing them with intratumoral injection. Evaluation of (aPD&#8208;L1 Ab)/SD&#8208;208 delivery effectiveness in B16F10 melanoma&#8208;bearing mice model confirms significantly improved dose efficacy of self&#8208;locking MNs compared with intratumoral injection.

         <title>Holographically Activatable Nanoprobe via Glutathione/Albumin&#8208;Mediated Exponential Signal Amplification for High&#8208;Contrast Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A holographically activatable nanoprobe caging manganese tetraoxide is reported for tumor&#8208;selective contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging, which is accomplished through both glutathione/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification in tumors and rapid elimination in normal tissues.








Abstract
Glutathione (GSH)&#8208;activatable probes hold great promise for in vivo cancer imaging, but are restricted by their dependence on non&#8208;selective intracellular GSH enrichment and uncontrollable background noise. Here, a holographically activatable nanoprobe caging manganese tetraoxide is shown for tumor&#8208;selective contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) through cooperative GSH/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification in tumors and rapid elimination in normal tissues.

&lt;p&gt;A holographically activatable nanoprobe caging manganese tetraoxide is reported for tumor-selective contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging, which is accomplished through both glutathione/albumin-mediated cascade signal amplification in tumors and rapid elimination in normal tissues.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glutathione (GSH)-activatable probes hold great promise for in vivo cancer imaging, but are restricted by their dependence on non-selective intracellular GSH enrichment and uncontrollable background noise. Here, a holographically activatable nanoprobe caging manganese tetraoxide is shown for tumor-selective contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) through cooperative GSH/albumin-mediated cascade signal amplification in tumors and rapid elimination in normal tissues. Once targeting tumors, the endocytosed nanoprobe effectively senses the lysosomal microenvironment to undergo instantaneous decomposition into Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; with threshold GSH concentration of &#8776; 0.12&#160;m&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; for brightening MRI signals, thus achieving high contrast tumor imaging and flexible monitoring of GSH-relevant cisplatin resistance during chemotherapy. Upon efficient up-regulation of extracellular GSH in&#160;tumor via exogenous injection, the relaxivity-silent interstitial nanoprobe remarkably evolves into Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; that are further captured/retained and re-activated into ultrahigh-relaxivity-capable complex by stromal albumin in the tumor, and simultaneously allows the renal clearance of off-targeted nanoprobe in the form of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; via lymphatic vessels for suppressing background noise to distinguish tiny liver metastasis.

         <title>Cooperative Electronic Structure Modulator of Fe Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst for High Energy and Long Cycle Li&#8211;S Pouch Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of electron exchangeable binding sites comprising thiophene S and oxidized S, adjacent to Fe single atom electrocatalysts, improves Li2S redox kinetics by modulating d&#8208;orbital level of Fe single atom via electron exchange. These specially designed electrocatalysts enable realization of a 1 A h level Li&#8211;S pouch cell with high gravimetric energy density and long cycle stability.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy and long cycle lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) pouch cells are limited by the insufficient capacities and stabilities of their cathodes under practical electrolyte/sulfur (E/S), electrolyte/capacity (E/C), and negative/positive (N/P) ratios. Herein, an advanced cathode comprising highly active Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is reported to form 320.2&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 multistacked Li&#8211;S pouch cells with total capacity of &#8776;1 A h level, satisfying low E/S (3.0), E/C (2.8), and N/P (2.3) ratios and high sulfur loadings (8.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). The high&#8208;activity Fe SAC is designed by manipulating its local environments using electron&#8208;exchangeable binding (EEB) sites. Introducing EEB sites comprising two different types of S species, namely, thiophene&#8208;like&#8208;S (&#8211;S) and oxidized&#8208;S (&#8211;SO2), adjacent to Fe SACs promotes the kinetics of the Li2S redox reaction by providing additional binding sites and modulating the Fe d&#8208;orbital levels via electron exchange with Fe. The &#8211;S donates the electrons to the Fe SACs, whereas &#8211;SO2 withdraws electrons from the Fe SACs. Thus, the Fe d&#8208;orbital energy level can be modulated by the different &#8211;SO2/&#8211;S ratios of the EEB site, controlling the electron donating/withdrawing characteristics. This desirable electrocatalysis is maximized by the intimate contact of the Fe SACs with the S species, which are confined together in porous carbon.

         <title>Modular Approach to Creating Functionalized Surface Arrays of Molecular Qubits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method to create 2D arrays of molecular spin qubits is reported. The quantum properties are retained and the quantum coherence times are improved compared to bulk conditions.








Abstract
The quest for developing quantum technologies is driven by the promise of exponentially faster computations, ultrahigh performance sensing, and achieving thorough understanding of many&#8208;particle quantum systems. Molecular spins are excellent qubit candidates because they feature long coherence times, are widely tunable through chemical synthesis, and can be interfaced with other quantum platforms such as superconducting qubits. A present challenge for molecular spin qubits is their integration in quantum devices, which requires arranging them in thin films or monolayers on surfaces. However, clear proof of the survival of quantum properties of molecular qubits on surfaces has not been reported so far. Furthermore, little is known about the change in spin dynamics of molecular qubits going from the bulk to monolayers. Here, a versatile bottom&#8208;up method is reported to arrange molecular qubits as functional groups of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on surfaces, combining molecular self&#8208;organization and click chemistry. Coherence times of up to 13 &#181;s demonstrate that qubit properties are maintained or even enhanced in the monolayer.

         <title>Solvation and Interfacial Engineering Enable &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C Operation of Graphite/NCM Batteries at Energy Density over 270 Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1</title>

         <dc:description>
Kinetic barriers related to Li+ transport at low temperatures is knocked down by formulating a weakly&#8208;solvated electrolyte containing Na+ as a hetero&#8208;cation additive, where a Li&#8208;Na hybrid SEI is identified to favor Li+ migration through the multiple LiF/NaF grain boundaries. As such, the electrolyte affords a 2 Ah, 270&#160;Wh&#160;Kg&#8722;1 graphite/NCM523 pouch cell with discharge capacity of 108.7 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) that can operate under low temperature (LT) conditions are essential for applications in orbital missions, subsea areas, and electric vehicles. Unfortunately, severe capacity loss is witnessed due to tremendous kinetic barriers that emerge at LT. Herein, to surmount such kinetic limitations, a low dielectric environment is tamed throughout the bulk electrolyte, which efficaciously brought the Li+ desolvation energy down to 30.76 kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1. At the meantime, the adoption of sodium cations (Na+) is proposed as a hetero&#8208;cation additive, and a Li&#8208;Na hybrid and fluoride&#8208;rich interphase is further identified via preferential reduction of Na+&#8208;(solvent/anion) clusters, which is found to efficiently facilitate Li+ migration through the LiF/NaF grain boundaries. Based on a N/P ratio of 1.1, the graphite/LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) full cell (cathode loading of &#8776;18.5&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) delivers a capacity as high as 125.1 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 under &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C with prolonged cycling to 100 cycles. Finally, a 270&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 graphite/NCM pouch cell is assembled, which affords a discharge capacity of 108.7 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 under &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C during the initial cycles. With an eye to both fundamental and practical aspects, this work will propel additional advancements and allow LIBs to fill more roles under extreme operation temperatures than ever before.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Reaction Heterogeneity During Calcination of Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature calcination used for Li&#8208;ion battery particle synthesis is chemically imaged. Various parallel and serial combinations of heterogeneous reactions, such as the thermal aerobic/anaerobic decomposition, Li2CO3 decomposition, Li2&#8208;O insertion/diffusion, and O2 insertion/diffusion, prevail during the calcination reaction. The anaerobic decomposition of the precursor core slows down Li2&#8208;O incorporation.








Abstract
During solid&#8208;state calcination, with increasing temperature, materials undergo complex phase transitions with heterogeneous solid&#8208;state reactions and mass transport. Precise control of the calcination chemistry is therefore crucial for synthesizing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides (LiNi1&#8208;x&#8208;yCoxMnyO2, NRNCM) as cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Although the battery performance depends on the chemical heterogeneity during NRNCM calcination, it has not yet been elucidated. Herein, through synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray, mass spectrometry microscopy, and structural analyses, it is revealed that the temperature&#8208;dependent reaction kinetics, the diffusivity of solid&#8208;state lithium sources, and the ambient oxygen control the local chemical compositions of the reaction intermediates within a calcined particle. Additionally, it is found that the variations in the reducing power of the transition metals (i.e., Ni, Co, and Mn) determine the local structures at the nanoscale. The investigation of the reaction mechanism via imaging analysis provides valuable information for tuning the calcination chemistry and developing high&#8208;energy/power density lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

&lt;p&gt;High-temperature calcination used for Li-ion battery particle synthesis is chemically imaged. Various parallel and serial combinations of heterogeneous reactions, such as the thermal aerobic/anaerobic decomposition, Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; decomposition, Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O insertion/diffusion, and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; insertion/diffusion, prevail during the calcination reaction. The anaerobic decomposition of the precursor core slows down Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O incorporation.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>In Situ Absorption Characterization Guided Slot&#8208;Die&#8208;Coated High&#8208;Performance Large&#8208;Area Flexible Organic Solar Cells and Modules</title>

         <dc:description>
In situ absorption measurement is used to investigate the aggregation behavior of acceptors during slot&#8208;die&#8208;coating. The 1 cm2 flexible device can reach a power conversion efficiency of 13.70%, with excellent shelf stability and upscaling ability. The connected modules (180 cm2) can effectively power a smartphone, showing great potential for future applications.








Abstract
Slot&#8208;die coating is recognized as the most compatible method for the roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) processing of large&#8208;area flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the photovoltaic performance of large&#8208;area flexible OSC lags significantly behind that of traditional spin&#8208;coating devices. In this work, two acceptors, Qx&#8208;1 and Qx&#8208;2, show quite different film&#8208;formation kinetics in the slot&#8208;die coating process. In situ absorption spectroscopy indicates that the excessive crystallinity of Qx&#8208;2 provides early phase separation and early aggregation, resulting in oversized crystal domains. Consequently, the PM6:Qx&#8208;1&#8208;based 1&#160;cm2 flexible device exhibits an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.70%, which is the best performance among the slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated flexible devices; in contrast, the PM6:Qx&#8208;2 blend shows a pretty poor efficiency, which is lower than 1%. Moreover, the 30 cm2 modules based on PM6:Qx&#8208;1, containing six 5 cm2 sub&#8208;cells, exhibit a PCE of 12.20%. After being stored in a glove box for over 6000&#160;h, the PCE remains at 103% of its initial values, indicating excellent shelf stability. Therefore, these results show a promising future strategy for the upscaling fabrication of flexible large&#8208;area OSCs.

         <title>Over 19% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells by Regulating Multidimensional Intermolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular interactions are ubiquitous and elusive in organic solar cells. Herein, the complicated relationship between multidimensional intermolecular interactions in active layers and photovoltaic performance is disclosed. The results show that complex interactions are critical to synergistically regulating comprehensive properties, including molecular assembly, stacking orientations, charge transport, and morphology management, which helps to achieve an efficiency over 19% in ternary devices.








Abstract
Research on organic solar cells (OSCs) has progressed through material innovation and device engineering. However, well&#8208;known and ubiquitous intermolecular interactions, and particularly their synergistic effects, have received little attention. Herein, the complicated relationship between photovoltaic conversion and multidimensional intermolecular interactions in the active layers is investigated. These interactions are dually regulated by side&#8208;chain isomerization and end&#8208;cap engineering of the acceptors. The phenylalkyl featured acceptors (LA&#8208;series) exhibit stronger crystallinity with preferential face&#8208;on interactions relative to the alkylphenyl attached isomers (ITIC&#8208;series). In addition, the PM6&#160;and LA&#8208;series acceptors exhibit moderate donor/acceptor interactions compared to those of the strongly interacting PM6/ITIC&#8208;series pairs, which helps to enhance phase separation and charge transport. Consequently, the output efficiencies of all LA series acceptors are over 14%. Moreover, LA&#8208;series acceptors show appropriate compatibility, host/guest interactions, and crystallinity relationships with BTP&#8208;eC9, thereby leading to uniform and well&#8208;organized &#8220;alloy&#8208;like&#8221; mixed phases. In particular, the highly crystalline LA23&#160;further optimizes multiple interactions and ternary microstructures, which results in a high efficiency of 19.12%. Thus, these results highlight the importance of multidimensional intermolecular interactions in the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

Capacitive Strain Sensors
In article number 2209321, Tyler J. Cuthbert, Carlo Menon, and co&#8208;workers present a novel capacitive strain sensor that accesses sensitivity beyond the theoretical limit. The helical auxetic capacitive sensor (HACS) employs a two&#8208;component yarn structure allowing tuneable sensitivity and accessible strain ranges. The HACS sensitivity is found to be from an engulfment phenomenon, which is predicted with a geometric model and analyzed by X&#8208;ray &#956;CT scanning.

The helical auxetic capacitive sensor (HACS) employs a two-component yarn structure allowing tuneable sensitivity and accessible strain ranges. The HACS sensitivity is found to be from an engulfment phenomenon, which is predicted with a geometric model and analyzed by X-ray &#956;CT scanning.

Nonlinear Hall Effect
As the heart and with the tremendous applications of terahertz technology, photodetectors suffer from considerable drawbacks imposed by weak optical absorption, and inefficient charge&#8208;separation mechanisms. In article number 2209557, Antonio Politano, Lin Wang, and co&#8208;workers report the nonlinear Hall effect operating at terahertz frequencies within strong spin&#8208;polarized topological states in CoTe2 without invoking any semiconductor junctions or bias voltage, opening up fascinating route toward quantum wavefunction engineering.

Cathode Calcination
In article number 2207076, Sugeun Jo, Keeyoung Jung, Jongwoo Lim, and co&#8208;workers show how solid&#8208;state reaction heterogeneity affects the high&#8208;temperature calcination of Li&#8208;ion battery particles. Various parallel and serial combinations of the thermal (an)aerobic decomposition and Li2&#8211;O insertion/diffusion are chemically imaged during the calcination reaction. The cover image features the calcination intermediates that facilitate the surface Li2&#8211;O incorporation, which is impeded by the anaerobically decomposed phase in the particle core.

         <title>As Fiber Meets with AIE: Opening a Wonderland for Smart Flexible Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) and fiber complement each other for making remarkble progress in smart flexible materials. This article provides a comprehensive and fundamental overview of the basic concepts, structure&#8208;function relationship, seminal and recent studies, and the potential directions for future developments regarding AIEgen&#8208;based fiber from the view of mesoscale and macroscale.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) have recently been developed at a tremendous pace in the area of organic luminescent materials by virtue of their superior properties. However, the practical applications of AIEgens still face the challenge of transforming AIEgens from molecules into materials. Till now, many AIEgens have been integrated into fiber, endowing the fiber with prominent fluorescence and/or photosensitizing capacities. AIEgens and fiber complement each other for making progress in flexible smart materials, in which the utilization of AIEgens creates new application possibilities for fiber, and the fiber provides an excellent carrier for AIEgens towards realizing the conversion from molecule to materials and an ideal platform to research the aggregate state of AIEgens in mesoscale and macroscale. This review begins with a brief summary of the recent advances related to some typical AIEgens with various functions and the technology for the fabrication of AIEgen&#8208;functionalized fiber. The most representative applications are then highlighted by focusing on energy conversion, personal protective equipment, biomedical, sensor, and fluorescence&#8208;related fields. Finally, the challenges, opportunities, and tendencies in future development are discussed in detail. This review hopes to inspire innovation in AIEgens and fiber from the view of mesoscale and macroscale.

         <title>Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers: From Light&#8208;Controlled Small Molecules to Smart Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control over supramolecular interactions is an important part of the toolbox for developing functional materials. The design of supramolecular polymers with light&#8208;triggered molecules allows remote control of supramolecular polymers and materials with high spatiotemporal precision. Here, a perspective review of various approaches and major advances toward photoresponsive supramolecular polymers with controlled functions is presented.








Abstract
Photoresponsive supramolecular polymers are well&#8208;organized assemblies based on highly oriented and reversible noncovalent interactions containing photosensitive molecules as (co&#8208;)monomers. They have attracted increasing interest in smart materials and dynamic systems with precisely controllable functions, such as light&#8208;driven soft actuators, photoresponsive fluorescent anticounterfeiting and light&#8208;triggered electronic devices. The present review discusses light&#8208;activated molecules used in photoresponsive supramolecular polymers with their main photo&#8208;induced changes, e.g., geometry, dipole moment, and chirality. Based on these distinct changes, supramolecular polymers formed by light&#8208;activated molecules exhibit photoresponsive disassembly and reassembly. As a consequence, photo&#8208;induced supramolecular polymerization, &#8220;depolymerization,&#8221; and regulation of the lengths and topologies are observed. Moreover, the light&#8208;controlled functions of supramolecular polymers, such as actuation, emission, and chirality transfer along length scales, are highlighted. Furthermore, a perspective on challenges and future opportunities is presented. Besides the challenge of moving from harmful UV light to visible/near IR light avoiding fatigue, and enabling biomedical applications, future opportunities include light&#8208;controlled supramolecular actuators with helical motion, light&#8208;modulated information transmission, optically recyclable materials, and multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular systems.

         <title>Upcycling of Waste Plastic into Hybrid Carbon Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed waste plastic can be efficiently upcycled to carbon nanotubes and hybrid nanomaterials. The products&#160;have controllable morphologies, and can be synthesized in solvent&#8208; and inert gas&#8208;free methods. These nanomaterials outperform commercial multiwalled carbon nanotubes in vinyl ester composites, and life&#8208;cycle assessment demonstrates 86&#8211;94% improvements in greenhouse gas emissions and energy demand, compared to current nanotube production routes.








Abstract
Graphitic 1D&#160;and hybrid nanomaterials represent a powerful solution in composite and electronic applications due to exceptional properties, but large&#8208;scale synthesis of hybrid materials has yet to be realized. Here, a rapid, scalable method to produce graphitic 1D materials from polymers using flash Joule heating (FJH) is reported. This avoids lengthy chemical vapor deposition and uses no solvent or water. The flash 1D materials (F1DM), synthesized using a variety of earth&#8208;abundant catalysts, have controllable diameters and morphologies by parameter tuning. Furthermore, the process can be modified to form hybrid materials, with F1DM bonded to turbostratic graphene. In nanocomposites, F1DM outperform&#160;commercially available carbon nanotubes. Compared to current 1D material synthetic strategies using life cycle assessment, FJH synthesis represents an 86&#8211;92% decrease in cumulative energy demand and 92&#8211;94% decrease in global&#8208;warming potential. This work suggests that FJH affords a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable route to upcycle waste plastic into valuable 1D and hybrid nanomaterials.

         <title>Realizing Photo&#8208;switchable Mechanoluminescence in Organic Crystals Based on Photochromism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic mechanoluminescent (ML) materials possessing photophysical properties that are sensitive to multiple external stimuli have shown great potential in many fields, including optic and sensing. Particularly, the photo&#8208;switchable ML property for these materials is fundamental to their applications but remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we successfully realize photo&#8208;switchable ML by endowing reversible photochromic properties to a ML molecule, namely 2&#8208;(1,2,2&#8208;triphenylvinyl) fluoropyridine (o&#8208;TPF). o&#8208;TPF shows both high&#8208;contrast photochromism with a distinct color change from white to purplish red, as well as bright blue ML (&#955;ML = 453&#160;nm). The ML property can be repeatedly switched between ON and OFF states under alternate UV and visible light irradiation. Impressively, the photo&#8208;switchable ML is of high stability and repeatability. The ML can be reversibly switched on and off by conducting alternate UV and visible light irradiation in cycles under ambient conditions. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the change of dipole moment of o&#8208;TPF during the photochromic process is responsible for the photo&#8208;switchable ML. These results outline a fundamental strategy to achieve for the control of organic ML, and pave the way to the development of expanded smart luminescent materials and their applications.

         <title>Exsolution Modeling and Control to Improve the Catalytic Activity of Nanostructured Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diffusion&#8208;determined exsolution behavior and its mechanism are demonstrated by controlling and modeling particle growth. Following this model, a highly active and durable nanostructured electrode for solid oxide fuel cells using an in situ exsolution method is developed. The particle growth of the exsolved Ni nanoparticles is enhanced by electrochemical switching,leading to a drastic improvement in cell performance.








Abstract
In situ exsolution for nanoscale electrode design has attracted considerable attention because of its promising activity and high stability. However, fundamental research on the mechanisms underlying particle growth remains insufficient. Herein, cation&#8208;diffusion&#8208;determined exsolution is presented using an analytical model based on classical nucleation and diffusion. In the designed perovskite system, the exsolution trend for particle growth is consistent with this diffusion model, which strongly depends on the initial cation concentration and reduction conditions. Based on the experimental and theoretical results, a highly Ni&#8208;doped anode and an electrochemical switching technique are employed to promote exsolution and overcome growth limitations. The optimal cell exhibits an outstanding maximum power density of 1.7&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 900&#160;&#176;C and shows no evident degradation when operating at 800&#160;&#176;C for 240&#160;h under wet H2. This study provides crucial insights into the developing and tuning of heterogeneous catalysts for energy&#8208;conversion applications.

         <title>Strong Interlayer Coupling in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Moir&#233; Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong interlayer&#8208;coupled WSe2/WSe2 homostructure is grown by chemical vapor deposition&#160;using a heteroatom&#8208;assisted approach to overcome the stacking&#8208;free energy, showing a uniform moir&#233; superlattice and strong interfacial coupling. The interlayer coupling can be adjusted by altering the twist angle, enabling the investigation of a variety of novel physical phenomena, which is expected to realize single&#8208;photon emission and promote the development of coherent quantum light emitters.








Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices in twisted van der Waals materials offer a powerful platform for exploring light&#8211;matter interactions. The periodic moir&#233; potentials in moir&#233; superlattices can induce strongly correlated quantum phenomena that depend on the moir&#233; potential associated with interlayer coupling at the interface. However, moir&#233; superlattices are primarily prepared by mechanical exfoliation and manual stacking, where the transfer methods easily cause interfacial contamination, and the preparation of high&#8208;quality bilayer 2D materials with small twist angles by growth methods remains a significant challenge. In this work, WSe2/WSe2 homobilayers with different twist angles by chemical vapor deposition (CVD),&#160;using a heteroatom&#8208;assisted growth technique, are synthesized. Using low&#8208;frequency Raman scattering, the uniformity of the moir&#233; superlattices is mapped to demonstrate the strong interfacial coupling of the CVD&#8208;fabricated twist&#8208;angle homobilayers. The moir&#233; potential depths of the CVD&#8208;grown and artificially stacked homostructures with twist angles of 1.5&#176; are 115 and 45 meV (an increase of 155%), indicating that the depth of moir&#233; potential can be modulated by the interfacial coupling. These results open a new avenue to study the modulation of moir&#233; potential by strong interlayer coupling and provide a foundation for the development of twistronics.

         <title>Improving OFF&#8208;State Bias&#8208;Stress Stability in High&#8208;Mobility Conjugated Polymer Transistors with an Antisolvent Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of the conjugated polymer indacenodithiophene&#8208;co&#8208;benzothiadiazole by acetonitrile (AN) or n&#8208;butyl acetate (NBA) antisolvent slightly enhances the crystallinity of the films as evidenced by grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction (left) and leads to an improved OFF&#8208;state bias&#8208;stress stability of organic field&#8208;effect transistors with respect to untreated reference films (right).








Abstract
Conjugated polymer field&#8208;effect transistors are emerging as an enabling technology for flexible electronics due to their excellent mechanical properties combined with sufficiently high charge&#8208;carrier mobilities and compatibility with large&#8208;area, low&#8208;temperature processing. However, their electrical stability remains a concern. ON&#8208;state (accumulation mode) bias&#8208;stress instabilities in organic semiconductors have been widely studied, and multiple mitigation strategies have been suggested. In contrast, OFF&#8208;state (depletion mode) bias&#8208;stress instabilities remain poorly understood despite being crucial for many applications in which the transistors are held in their OFF&#8208;state for most of the time. Here, a simple method of using an antisolvent treatment is presented to achieve significant improvements in OFF&#8208;state bias&#8208;stress and environmental stability as well as general device performance for one of the best performing polymers, solution&#8208;processable indacenodithiophene&#8208;co&#8208;benzothiadiazole (IDT&#8208;BT). IDT&#8208;BT is weakly crystalline, and the notable improvements to an antisolvent&#8208;induced, increased degree of crystallinity, resulting in a lower probability of electron trapping and the removal of charge traps is attributed. The work highlights the importance of the microstructure in weakly crystalline polymer films and offers a simple processing strategy for achieving the reliability required for applications in flexible electronics.

         <title>Hydration Activates Dual&#8208;Confined Shape&#8208;Memory Effects of Cold&#8208;Reprogrammable Photonic Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The water&#8208;activated dual confined shape&#8208;memory effects (CSMEs) of cold&#8208;programmable photonic crystals are revealed, manifesting ethanol&#8208;vapor&#8208;triggered selective shape recovery resulting from water&#8208;induced interchain H&#8208;bonds reconstruction and structural color locking derived from pressure&#8208;guided interchain H&#8208;bonds remodeling. Activatable CSME contributes to the expansion of nanophotonic technology in water printing, erasable watermarks, signal amplifiers, and information coding.








Abstract
Shape&#8208;memory photonic crystals (SMPCs) transform the nanoscale deformation of copolymers into structural color through an undifferentiated response to stimuli; however, activatable selective responses are extremely rare. Herein, activatable dual confined shape&#8208;memory effects (CSMEs) derived from the remodeling of the interchain hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) in cold&#8208;programmable SMPCs are revealed. The first level is the water&#8208;triggered reconstruction&#160;of interchain H&#8208;bonds, which can activate/lock the collapsed skeleton, showing shape recovery/retention in response to ethanol vapor. The second level is the pressure&#8208;induced reorganization of&#160;interchain H&#8208;bonds that results in the recovered skeleton being locked even when exposed to ethanol vapor or water, while the background porous structure can switch between collapse and recovery. Dual CSMEs result from the Laplace pressure difference and the binding effect of interchain H&#8208;bonds in the skeleton according to insights of swelling, in situ deformation tracking, multidimensional infrared spectra, and water wetting/evaporation simulations. The signal interference, source code extraction, and color enhancement of structurally colored patterns can be implemented using CSMEs. This work opens up a new method for fabricating activatable responsive structural color and contributes to the expansion of nanophotonic technology in water printing, erasable watermarks, signal amplifiers, and information coding.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetism in Two&#8208;Dimensional MnGa4&#8208;H Induced by Hydrogen Insertion</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) room&#8208;temperature magnetic materials are of great importance in future spintronic devices while only very few have been reported. Herein, we exploit a plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition approach to construct the 2D room&#8208;temperature magnetic MnGa4&#8208;H single crystal with a thickness down to 2.2&#160;nm. The employment of H2 plasma makes hydrogen atoms can be easily inserted into the MnGa4 lattice to modulate the atomic distance and charge state, thereby ferrimagnetism can be achieved without destroying the structural configuration. The as&#8208;obtained 2D MnGa4&#8208;H crystal is high&#8208;quality, air&#8208;stable, and thermo&#8208;stable, demonstrating robust and stable room&#8208;temperature magnetism with a high Curie temperature above 620 K. This work enriches the 2D room&#8208;temperature magnetic family and opens up the possibility for the development of spintronic devices based on 2D magnetic alloys.

         <title>When Polymorphism in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Enables Water Sorption Profile Tunability for Enhancing Heat Allocation and Water Harvesting Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The development of thermally driven water&#8208;sorption&#8208;based technologies relies on high&#8208;performing water vapor adsorbents. Here, polymorphism in Al&#8208;metal&#8208;organic frameworks is disclosed as a new strategy to tune the hydrophilicity of MOFs. This involves the formation of MOFs built from chains of either trans&#8208; or cis&#8208; &#956;&#8208;OH&#8208;connected corner&#8208;sharing AlO4(OH)2 octahedra. Specifically, [Al(OH)(muc)] or MIP&#8208;211, is made of trans, trans&#8208;muconate linkers and cis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;OH&#8208;connected corner&#8208;sharing AlO4(OH)2 octahedra giving a 3D network with sinusoidal channels. The polymorph MIL&#8208;53&#8208;muc had a tiny change in the chain structure that results in a shift of the step position of the water isotherm from P/P0 &#8764; 0.5 in MIL&#8208;53&#8208;muc, to P/P0 &#8764; 0.3 in MIP&#8208;211. Solid&#8208;state NMR and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo revealed that the adsorption occurs initially between two hydroxyl groups of the chains, favored by the cis&#8208;positioning in MIP&#8208;211, resulting in a more hydrophilic behavior. Finally, theoretical evaluations showed that MIP&#8208;211 would allow achieving a coefficient of performance for cooling (COPc) of 0.63 with an ultralow driving temperature of 60&#176;C, outperforming benchmarks sorbents for small temperature lifts. Combined with its high stability, easy regeneration, huge water uptake capacity, green synthesis, MIP&#8208;211 is among the best adsorbents for adsorption&#8208;driven air conditioning and water harvesting from the air.

         <title>Hierarchical Serpentine&#8208;helix Combination for Three&#8208;dimensional Stretchable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) stretchable electronics attract growing interests due to their new and more complex functionalities compared to 1D or 2D counterparts. Among all 3D configuration designs, 3D helical structure is commonly used as it can be designed to achieve outstanding stretching ratios as well as high robust mechanical performance. However, the stretching ratio that mainly focuses on the axis direction hinders its applications. Inspired by hierarchies in tendon, we propose a novel structural design of hierarchical 3D serpentine&#8208;helix combination. The structural design constructed by a sequence with repeating small units winding in a helical manner around the axis can enable large mechanical forces transferred down to a smaller scale with the dissipation of potentially damaging stresses by microscale buckling, thereby endowing the electronic components made from high&#8208;performance but hard&#8208;to&#8208;stretch materials with large stretchability (&#8805;200%) in x, y or z&#8208;axis direction, high structural stability and extraordinary electromechanical performance. Two applications including wireless charging patch and epidermal electronic system have been demonstrated. The epidermal electronic system made of several hierarchical 3D serpentine&#8208;helix combinations allows for high&#8208;fidelity monitoring of electrophysiological signals, galvanic skin response and finger&#8208;movement&#8208;induced electrical signals, which can achieve good tactile pattern recognition when combined with an artificial neural network.

         <title>Vacancy Defects in 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Electrocatalysts: From Aggregated to Atomic Configuration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamentals, progress, and prospects of vacancy engineering in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides toward electrocatalytic applications are reviewed. Vacancy manufacturing strategies, characterization techniques, and unique roles in electrocatalysis are considered, and the evolution of vacancy configuration from aggregated to atomic distribution is comprehensively discussed. The lifetime dynamic structure&#8211;performance correlations of vacancy&#8208;mediated electrocatalysts are also highlighted.








Abstract
Vacancy defect engineering has been well leveraged to flexibly shape comprehensive physicochemical properties of diverse catalysts. In particular, growing research effort has been devoted to engineering chalcogen anionic vacancies (S/Se/Te) of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) toward the ultimate performance limit of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In spite of remarkable progress achieved in the past decade, systematic and in&#8208;depth insights into the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art vacancy engineering for 2D&#8208;TMDs&#8208;based electrocatalysis are still lacking. Herein, this review delivers a full picture of vacancy engineering evolving from aggregated to atomic configurations covering their development background, controllable manufacturing, thorough characterization, and representative HER application. Of particular interest, the deep&#8208;seated correlations between specific vacancy regulation routes and resulting catalytic performance improvement are logically clarified in terms of atomic rearrangement, charge redistribution, energy band variation, intermediate adsorption&#8211;desorption optimization, and charge/mass transfer facilitation. Beyond that, a broader vision is cast into the cutting&#8208;edge research fields of vacancy&#8208;engineering&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysis and dynamic structure&#8211;performance correlations across catalyst service lifetime. Together with critical discussion on residual challenges and future prospects, this review sheds new light on the rational design of advanced defect catalysts and navigates their broader application in high&#8208;efficiency energy conversion and storage fields.

         <title>An In&#160;Situ Fabricated Graphene/Bipolar Polymer Hybrid Material Delivers Ultralong Cycle Life over 15&#160;000 Cycles as a High&#8208;Performance Electrode Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graphene/bipolar polymer hybrid material (Fc&#8208;DAB@3DG) is in&#160;situ fabricated through a simple one&#8208;step solvothermal method. The Fc&#8208;DAB component provides high capacity and stability, while the 3D interconnected conductive graphene network endows Fc&#8208;DAB@3DG with fast ions/electrons diffusion and thus improved rate performance. Therefore, combined together, the material exhibits simultaneously high capacity, ultralong cycle life, and superior rate performance.








Abstract
Organic electrode materials are promising for the future energy storage systems owing to their tunable structures, abundant resources, and environmental friendliness. Many advanced lithium&#8208;ion batteries with organic electrodes have been developed and show excellent performance. However, developing organic materials with overall superior performance still faces great challenges, such as low capacity, poor stability, inferior conductivity, and low utilization of active sites. To address these issues, a bipolar polymer (Fc&#8208;DAB) is designed and further polymerized in&#160;situ with three&#8208;dimensional graphene (3DG), offering a hybrid material (Fc&#8208;DAB@3DG) with a variety of merits. Fc&#8208;DAB possesses stable polymer backbone and multiple redox&#8208;active sites that can improve stability and capacity simultaneously. The embedded highly conductive 3DG network endows Fc&#8208;DAB@3DG with stable conductive framework, large surface area, and porous morphology all together, so the fast diffusion of ions/electrons can be achieved, leading to high utilization of active sites and enhanced electrochemical performance. As a result, Fc&#8208;DAB@3DG cathode delivers capacity of &#8776;260&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 25&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, ultra&#8208;long cycle life over 15&#160;000 cycles at 2000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 with retention of 99.999% per cycle, and remarkable rate performance. The quasi&#8208;solid Li&#8208;metal battery and full cell fabricated using this material also exhibit superior electrochemical performance.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Based Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese&#8208;based nanomaterials have unique features to be used in tumor traceable immunotherapy in the form of nanocarriers, immunomodulators, and immunoactivators. This review focuses on the recent progress of Mn&#8208;based immunotherapy, including immunotherapy alone, immunotherapy&#8208;involved multimodal synergistic therapy, and imaging&#8208;guided immunotherapy. It is highly anticipated that Mn&#8208;based immunotherapy can open up a promising avenue in nanomedicine.








Abstract
As an essential micronutrient, manganese (Mn) participates in various physiological processes and plays important roles in host immune system, hematopoiesis, endocrine function, and oxidative stress regulation. Mn&#8208;based nanoparticles are considered to be biocompatible and show versatile applications in nanomedicine, in particular utilized in tumor immunotherapy in the following ways: 1) acting as a biocompatible nanocarrier to deliver immunotherapeutic agents for tumor immunotherapy; 2) serving as an adjuvant to regulate tumor immune microenvironment and enhance immunotherapy; 3) activating host's immune system through the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway to trigger tumor immunotherapy; 4) real&#8208;time monitoring tumor immunotherapy effect by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) since Mn2+ ions are ideal MRI contrast agent which can significantly enhance the T1&#8208;weighted MRI signal after binding to proteins. This comprehensive review focuses on the most recent progress of Mn&#8208;based nanoplatforms in tumor immunotherapy. The characteristics of Mn are first discussed to guide the design of Mn&#8208;based multifunctional nanoplatforms. Then the biomedical applications of Mn&#8208;based nanoplatforms, including immunotherapy alone, immunotherapy&#8208;involved multimodal synergistic therapy, and imaging&#8208;guided immunotherapy are discussed in detail. Finally, the challenges and future developments of Mn&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy are highlighted.

         <title>Hexaindium Heptasulfide/Nitrogen and Sulfur Co&#8208;Doped Carbon Hollow Microspindles with Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate Sodium Storage through Stable Conversion and Alloying Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous and hollow In6S7/nitrogen and sulfur co&#8208;doped carbon microspindles with fast, reversible, and durable Na+&#8208;storage properties can bridge the kinetics gap with capacitive porous carbon, enabling a sodium&#8208;ion capacitor with an energy density up to 136.3&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and a power density up to 47.5&#160;kW&#160;kg&#8722;1 as well as a long&#8208;term cycling stability.








Abstract
Group IIIA&#8211;VA metal sulfides (GMSs) have attracted increasing attention because of their unique Na&#8208;storage mechanisms through combined conversion and alloying reactions, thus delivering large theoretical capacities and low working potentials. However, Na+ diffusion within GMSs anodes leads to severe volume change, generally representing a fundamental limitation to rate capability and cycling stability. Here, monodispersed In6S7/nitrogen and sulfur co&#8208;doped carbon hollow microspindles (In6S7/NSC HMS) are produced by morphology&#8208;preserved thermal sulfurization of spindle&#8208;like and porous indium&#8208;based metal organic frameworks. The resulting In6S7/NSC HMS anode exhibits theoretical&#8208;value&#8208;close specific capacity (546.2 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), ultrahigh rate capability (267.5&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 30.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), high initial coulombic efficiency (&#8776;93.5%), and &#8776;92.6% capacity retention after 4000 cycles. This kinetically favored In6S7/NSC HMS anode fills up the kinetics gap with a capacitive porous carbon cathode, enabling a sodium&#8208;ion capacitor to deliver an ultrahigh energy density of 136.3&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and a maximum power density of 47.5&#160;kW&#160;kg&#8722;1. The in situ/ex situ analytical techniques and theoretical calculation both show that the robust and fast Na+ charge storage of In6S7/NSC HMS arises from the multi&#8208;electron redox mechanism, buffered volume expansion, negligible morphological change, and surface&#8208;controlled solid&#8208;state Na+ transport.

         <title>Artificial Neuronal Devices Based on Emerging Materials: Neuronal Dynamics and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviews the latest research progress on artificial neuronal devices based on emerging volatile switching materials. The neuronal dynamics demonstrated in these devices, the hardware implementation of various artificial neural networks, and their potentials in computational and sensing applications are systematically summarized.








Abstract
Artificial neuronal devices are critical building blocks of neuromorphic computing systems and currently the subject of intense research motivated by application needs from new computing technology and more realistic brain emulation. Researchers have proposed a range of device concepts that can mimic neuronal dynamics and functions. Although the switching physics and device structures of these artificial neurons are largely different, their behaviors can be described by several neuron models in a more unified manner. In this paper, the reports of artificial neuronal devices based on emerging volatile switching materials are reviewed from the perspective of the demonstrated neuron models, with a focus on the neuronal functions implemented in these devices and the exploitation of these functions for computational and sensing applications. Furthermore, the neuroscience inspirations and engineering methods to enrich the neuronal dynamics that remain to be implemented in artificial neuronal devices and networks toward realizing the full functionalities of biological neurons are discussed.

         <title>Fluid Flow Templating of Polymeric Soft Matter with Diverse Morphologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile nanofabrication processes, where liquid flow templates polymer solvent&#8211;nonsolvent precipitation, can produce at least 12&#160;distinct soft matter morphologies at micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;scale. These structures range from spheroids, rods, fibers, ribbons, and dendricolloids, to sheets. Systematic understanding of fluid templating enables robust control over the resulting micro&#8208; and macro&#8208;structures, which can be produced from a broad variety of (bio) polymers.








Abstract
It is challenging&#160;to find a conventional nanofabrication technique that can consistently produce soft polymeric matter of high surface area and nanoscale morphology in a way that is scalable, versatile, and easily tunable. Here, the capabilities of a universal method for fabricating diverse nano&#8208; and micro&#8208;scale morphologies based on polymer precipitation templated by the fluid streamlines in multiphasic flow are explored. It is shown that while the procedure is operationally simple, various combinations of its intertwined mechanisms can controllably and reproducibly lead to the formation of an extraordinary wide range of colloidal morphologies. By systematically investigating the process conditions, 12&#160;distinct classes of polymer micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;structures including particles, rods, ribbons, nanosheets, and soft dendritic colloids (dendricolloids) are identified. The outcomes are interpreted by delineating the physical processes into three stages: hydrodynamic shear, capillary and mechanical breakup, and polymer precipitation rate. The insights into the underlying fundamental mechanisms provide guidance toward developing a versatile and scalable nanofabrication platform. It is verified that the liquid shear&#8208;based technique is versatile and works well with many chemically diverse polymers and biopolymers, showing potential as a universal tool for simple and scalable nanofabrication of many morphologically distinct soft matter classes.

         <title>Reshaping the Endogenous Electric Field to Boost Wound Repair via Electrogenerative Dressing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A noninvasive electrogenerative dressing (EGD) is designed by integrating triboelectric nanogenerators with negative&#8208;pressure wound therapy, which makes a great breakthrough in wound repair and scar prevention with clinical transformation potential. The EGD accelerates the polarization of macrophages to M2 macrophages, strengthens cell proliferation and migration, augments angiogenesis and reepithelialization, enhances orientation of collagen, and reduces scars.








Abstract
The endogenous electric field (EF) generated by transepithelial potential difference plays a decisive role in wound reepithelialization. For patients with large or chronic wounds, negative&#8208;pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is the most effective clinical method in inflammation control by continuously removing the necrotic tissues or infected substances, thus creating a proproliferative microenvironment beneficial for wound reepithelialization. However, continuous negative&#8208;pressure drainage causes electrolyte loss and weakens the endogenous EF, which in turn hinders wound reepithelialization. Here, an electrogenerative dressing (EGD) is developed by integrating triboelectric nanogenerators with NPWT. By converting the negative&#8208;pressure&#8208;induced mechanical deformation into electricity, EGD produces a stable and high&#8208;safety EF that can trigger a robust epithelial electrotactic response and drive the macrophages toward a reparative M2 phenotype in vitro. Translational medicine studies confirm that EGD completely reshapes the wound EF weakened by NPWT, and promotes wound closure by facilitating an earlier transition of inflammation/proliferation and guiding epithelial migration and proliferation to accelerate reepithelialization. Long&#8208;term EGD therapy remarkably advances tissue remodeling with mature epithelium, orderly extracellular matrix, and less scar formation. Compared with the golden standard of NPWT, EGD orchestrates all the essential wound stages in a noninvasive manner, presenting an excellent prospect in clinical wound therapy.

         <title>Controlled Distributed Ti3C2Tx Hollow Microspheres on Thermally Conductive Polyimide Composite Films for Excellent Electromagnetic Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible (Fe3O4/polyimide (PI))&#8211;Ti3C2Tx&#8211;(Fe3O4/PI) composite films with controllable pore sizes and distribution of Ti3C2Tx hollow microspheres show electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness of 85 dB owing to the magnetic loss in Fe3O4/PI fiber film, multiple reflection, ohmic loss, and polarization loss in Ti3C2Tx hollow microspheres.








Abstract
Flexible multifunctional polymer&#8208;based electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding composite films have important applications in the fields of 5G communication technology, wearable electronic devices, and artificial intelligence. Based on the design of a porous/multilayered structure and using polyimide (PI) as the matrix and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) microspheres as the template, flexible (Fe3O4/PI)&#8211;Ti3C2Tx&#8211;(Fe3O4/PI) composite films with controllable pore sizes and distribution of Ti3C2Tx hollow microspheres are successfully prepared by sacrificial template method. Owing to the porous/multilayered structure, when the pore size of the Ti3C2Tx hollow microspheres is 10&#160;&#181;m and the mass ratio of PMMA/Ti3C2Tx is 2:1, the (Fe3O4/PI)&#8211;Ti3C2Tx&#8211;(Fe3O4/PI) composite film has the most excellent EMI shielding performance, with EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of 85&#160;dB. It is further verified by finite element simulation that the composite film has an excellent shielding effect on electromagnetic waves. In addition, the composite film has good thermal conductivity (thermal conductivity coefficient of 3.49&#160;W (m&#183;K)&#8722;1) and mechanical properties (tensile strength of 65.3&#160;MPa). This flexible (Fe3O4/PI)&#8211;Ti3C2Tx&#8211;(Fe3O4/PI) composite film with excellent EMI shielding performance, thermal conductivity, and mechanical properties has demonstrated great potential for applications in EMI shielding protection for high&#8208;power, portable, and wearable flexible electronic devices.

         <title>Shaping a Soft Future: Patterning Liquid Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shaping liquid metals down to the sub&#8208;micrometer scale has enabled a wide range of novel soft and stretchable devices. This review highlights patterning techniques such as injection/vacuum filling, direct ink writing, selective adhesion, and stenciling. Applications are highlighted, followed by a summary of present&#8208;day challenges and opportunities for future development.








Abstract
This review highlights the unique techniques for patterning liquid metals containing gallium (e.g., eutectic gallium indium, EGaIn). These techniques are enabled by two unique attributes of these liquids relative to solid metals: 1) The fluidity of the metal allows it to be injected, sprayed, and generally dispensed. 2) The solid native oxide shell allows the metal to adhere to surfaces and be shaped in ways that would normally be prohibited due to surface tension. The ability to shape liquid metals into non&#8208;spherical structures such as wires, antennas, and electrodes can enable fluidic metallic conductors for stretchable electronics, soft robotics, e&#8208;skins, and wearables. The key properties of these metals with a focus on methods to pattern liquid metals into soft or stretchable devices are summari.

The key properties of these metals with a focus on methods to pattern liquid metals into soft or stretchable devices are summari.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Manipulating Polymer Backbone Configuration via Halogenated Asymmetric End&#8208;Groups Enables Over 18% Efficiency All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Two analogous asymmetric polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors of PYFCl&#8208;T and PYF&amp;PYCl&#8208;T are synthesized based on small&#8208;molecule acceptors with different halogenated end groups to explore their effects on the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). The ternary all&#8208;PSC based on PM6:PY&#8208;IT:PYFCl&#8208;T reaches a high power conversion efficiency of 18.12%, benefitting from the miscibility&#8208;driven optimization of active layer morphology by asymmetric PYFCl&#8208;T.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) deeply rely on the joint contributions of desirable optical absorption, adaptive energy levels, and appropriate morphology. Herein, two structural analogous polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors (PSMAs), PYFCl&#8208;T and PYF&amp;PYCl&#8208;T, are synthesized, and then incorporated into the PM6:PY&#8208;IT binary blends to construct ternary all&#8208;PSCs. Due to the superior compatibility of PY&#8208;IT and PYFCl&#8208;T, the&#160;ternary all&#8208;PSC based on PM6:PY&#8208;IT:PYFCl&#8208;T with 10 wt% PYFCl&#8208;T, presents higher and more balanced charge mobility, suppressed charge recombination, and faster charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, resulting in an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.12% with enhanced Jsc and FF, which is much higher than that (PCE of 16.09%) of the binary all&#8208;PSCs based on PM6:PY&#8208;IT. Besides, the ternary all&#8208;PSCs also exhibit improved photostability. The conspicuous performance enhancement principally should give the credit to the miscibility&#8208;driven phase optimization of the donor and acceptor. These findings highlight the significance of polymer&#8208;backbone configuration modulation of PSMAs in morphology optimization toward boosting the device properties of all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>A Tunable Single&#8208;Molecule Light&#8208;Emitting Diode with Single&#8208;Photon Precision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functional electroluminescent molecular bridge is covalently integrated into nanogapped graphene electrodes to build a high&#8208;performance single&#8208;molecule light&#8208;emitting diode with unprecedented levels of stability and reproducibility. Precise tunability of its emission efficiency, color purity, linear polarization, emitted photon number, and energy is achieved upon application of electric inputs, rational molecular engineering, and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer, affording a new practical single&#8208;photon emitter.








Abstract
A robust single&#8208;molecule light&#8208;emitting diode (SM&#8208;LED) with high color purity, linear polarization, and efficiency tunability is prepared by covalently integrating one fluorescent molecule into nanogapped graphene electrodes. Furthermore, single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the electroluminescent center to different accepters is achieved through rational molecular engineering, enabling construction of a multicolor SM&#8208;LED. All these characterizations are accomplished in the photoelectrical integration system with high temporal/spatial/energy resolution, demonstrating the capability of the single&#8208;photon emission of SM&#8208;LEDs. The success in developing high&#8208;performance SM&#8208;LEDs inspires the development of the next generation of commercial display devices and promises a single&#8208;photon emitter for use in quantum computation and quantum communication.

         <title>Tunable Mesoscopic Collagen Island Architectures Modulate Stem Cell Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A collagen&#8208;I&#8208;based hydrogel system that mimics physiologically relevant tissue architectures is developed, called collagen islands. These island hydrogels are facile to generate by modulating the&#160;shearing frequency and have tunable architectures and mechanical properties. It is found that the&#160;island architecture is able to modulate osteogenic commitment in mesenchymal stem cells and mesodermal differentiation in pluripotent stem cells.








Abstract
The extracellular matrix is the biophysical environment that scaffolds mammalian cells in the body. The main constituent is collagen. In physiological tissues, collagen network topology is diverse with complex mesoscopic features. While studies have explored the roles of collagen density and stiffness, the impact of complex architectures remains not well&#8208;understood. Developing in vitro systems that recapitulate these diverse collagen architectures is critical for understanding physiologically relevant cell behaviors. Here, methods are developed to induce the formation of heterogeneous mesoscopic architectures, referred to as collagen islands, in collagen hydrogels. These island&#8208;containing gels have highly tunable inclusions and mechanical properties. Although these gels are globally soft, there is regional enrichment in the collagen concentration at the cell&#8208;scale. Collagen&#8208;island architectures are utilized to study mesenchymal stem cell behavior, and it is demonstrated that cell migration and osteogenic differentiation are altered. Finally, induced pluripotent stem cells are cultured in island&#8208;containing gels, and it is shown that the architecture is sufficient to induce mesodermal differentiation. Overall, this work highlights complex mesoscopic tissue architectures as bioactive cues in regulating cell behavior and presents a novel collagen&#8208;based hydrogel that captures these features for tissue engineering applications.

         <title>Exciton Manipulation for Enhancing Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Wrinkled 2D Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local variation of strain in atomically thin wrinkled 2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)&#160; generates a laterally varying band structure, which&#160;manipulates the exciton generation and dissociation mechanism and enhances its photoelectrochemical performance with a reduced Tafel value of 49&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 outperforming planar 2D catalysts.








Abstract
2D materials&#8217; junctions have demonstrated capabilities as metal&#8208;free alternatives for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). To date, the HER has been limited to heterojunctions of different compositions or band structures. Here, the potential of local strain modulation based on wrinkled 2D heterostructures is demonstrated, which&#160;helps&#160;to realize photoelectrocatalytically active junctions. By forming regions of high and low tensile strain in wrinkled WS2 monolayers, local modification of their band structure and internal electric field due to piezoelectricity is realized in the lateral direction. This structure produces efficient electron&#8211;hole pair generation due to light trapping and exciton funneling toward the crest of the WS2 wrinkles and enhances exciton separation. Additionally, the formation of wrinkles induces an air gap in&#8208;between the 2D layer and substrate, which reduces the interfacial scattering effect and consequently improves the charge&#8208;carrier mobility. A detailed study of the strain&#8208;dependence of the photocatalytic HER process demonstrates&#160;a 2&#8208;fold decrease in the Tafel slope and a 30&#8208;fold enhancement in exchange current density. Finally, optimization of the light absorption through functionalization with quantum dots produces unprecedented photoelectrocatalytic performance and provides a route toward the scalable formation of strain&#8208;modulated WS2 nanojunctions for future green energy generation.

         <title>Scalable Polyimide&#8208;Organosilicate Hybrid Films for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>

Abstract
High&#8208;temperature polymer dielectrics have broad application prospects in next&#8208;generation microelectronics and electrical power systems. However, the capacitive energy densities of dielectric polymers at elevated temperatures are severely limited by carrier excitation and transport. Herein, we present a molecular engineering strategy to regulate the bulk&#8208;limited conduction in the polymer by bonding amino polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (NH2&#8208;POSS) with the chain ends of polyimide (PI). Experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the terminal group NH2&#8208;POSS with a wide&#8208;bandgap of Eg&#8764;6.6&#160;eV increases the band energy levels of the PI and induces the formation of local deep traps in the hybrid films, which significantly restrains carrier transport. At 200&#160;&#176;C, the hybrid film exhibits concurrently an ultrahigh discharged energy density of 3.45 J&#183;cm&#8722;3 and a high gravimetric energy density of 2.74 J&#183;g&#8722;1, with the charge&#8208;discharge efficiency &gt;90%, far exceeding those achieved in the dielectric polymers and nearly all other polymer nanocomposites. Moreover, the NH2&#8208;POSS terminated PI film exhibits excellent charge&#8208;discharge cyclability (&gt;50000) and power density (0.39 MW&#183;cm&#8722;3) at 200&#160;&#176;C, making it a promising candidate for high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;energy&#8208;density capacitors. This work represents a novel strategy to scalable polymer dielectrics with superior capacitive performance operating in harsh environments.

Experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the terminal group NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-POSS with a wide-bandgap of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&#8764;6.6&#160;eV increases the band energy levels of the PI and induces the formation of local deep traps in the hybrid films, which significantly restrains carrier transport. At 200&#160;&#176;C, the hybrid film exhibits concurrently an ultrahigh discharged energy density of 3.45 J&#183;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a high gravimetric energy density of 2.74 J&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, with the charge-discharge efficiency &amp;gt;90%, far exceeding those achieved in the dielectric polymers and nearly all other polymer nanocomposites. Moreover, the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-POSS terminated PI film exhibits excellent charge-discharge cyclability (&amp;gt;50000) and power density (0.39 MW&#183;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) at 200&#160;&#176;C, making it a promising candidate for high-temperature high-energy-density capacitors. This work represents a novel strategy to scalable polymer dielectrics with superior capacitive performance operating in harsh environments.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Stable Hyperfluorescence Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Improved Color Purities and Ultrahigh Power Efficiencies Based on Low&#8208;Polar Sensitizing Systems</title>

Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance (MR) molecules with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are emerging as promising candidates for high&#8208;definition displays because of their narrow emission spectra. However, the electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies and spectra of MR&#8208;TADF molecules are highly sensitive to hosts and sensitizers when applied to organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), and the highly polar environments in devices often lead to significantly broadened EL spectra. In this study, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept TADF sensitizer (BTDMAC&#8208;XT) with low polarity, high steric hindrance, and concentration&#8208;quenching free feature is constructed, which acts as a good emitter in doped and non&#8208;doped OLEDs with high external quantum efficiencies (&#951;exts) of 26.7% and 29.3%, respectively. By combining BTDMAC&#8208;XT with conventional low&#8208;polarity hosts, low&#8208;polarity sensitizing systems with a small carrier injection barrier and full exciton utilization are constructed for the MR&#8208;TADF molecule BN2. Hyperfluorescence (HF) OLEDs employing the low&#8208;polar sensitizing systems successfully improve the color quality of BN2 and afford an excellent &#951;ext of 34.4%, a record&#8208;high power efficiency of 166.3&#160;lm W&#8722;1 and long operational lifetime (LT50 = 40309&#160;h) at an initial luminance of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2. These results provide instructive guidance for the sensitizer design and device optimization for energy&#8208;efficient and stable HF&#8208;OLEDs with high&#8208;quality light.

Abstract
The development of photo&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials is essential to address emerging demands in encryption security. Here, we report a novel photo&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive dual&#8208;emitting luminescent material ZJU&#8208;128&#8835;SP (SP = spiropyran), which was obtained by encapsulating spiropyran molecule into a cadmium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), [Cd3(TCPP)2]&#183;4DMF&#183;4H2O (ZJU&#8208;128, H4TCPP = 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)pyrazine). This MOF/dye composite ZJU&#8208;128&#8835;SP exhibits a blue emission from ligand of ZJU&#8208;128 at 447&#160;nm and a red emitting around 650&#160;nm of spiropyran. Utilizing the photoisomerization of spiropyran from ring&#8208;closed to ring&#8208;open form under UV light irradiation, significant fluorescence resonance energy transfer process between ZJU&#8208;128 and spiropyran is achieved. As a result, the blue emission of ZJU&#8208;128 is gradually decreased while the red emission of spiropyran increased. This dynamic fluorescent behavior can fully recover to original state when exposed to visible light (&gt; 405&#160;nm). By taking advantage of the time&#8208;dependent fluorescence, dynamical anti&#8208;counterfeiting pattern and multiplexed coding are successfully developed based on ZJU&#8208;128&#8835;SP film. This work provides an inspiring point for the design of information encryption materials with higher security requirements.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Incorporated Mg&#8208;Ion Solvation Modulation Enables Fast Magnesium Storage Kinetics of Conversion&#8208;Type Cathode Materials</title>

Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMB) have emerged as one of the most promising alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the prominent advantages of magnesium metal anodes. Nevertheless, their application is hindered by sluggish Mg&#8208;ion storage kinetics in cathodes, although various structural modifications of cathode materials have been performed. Herein, an electrolyte design using an anion&#8208;incorporated Mg&#8208;ion solvation structure is developed to promote the Mg&#8208;ion storage reactions of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials. The addition of the trifluoromethanesulfonate anion (OTf&#8722;) in the ether&#8208;based Mg&#8208;ion electrolyte modulates the solvation structure of Mg2+ from [Mg(DME)3]2+ to [Mg(DME)2.5OTf]+ (DME = dimethoxy ethane), which facilitates Mg&#8208;ion desolvation and thus significantly expedites the charge transfer of the cathode material. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared CuSe cathode material on copper current collector exhibits a considerable increase in magnesium storage capacity from 61% (228 mAh g&#8722;1) to 95% (357 mAh g&#8722;1) of the theoretical capacity at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 and a more than twofold capacity increase at a high current density of 1.0 A g&#8722;1. This work provides an efficient strategy via electrolyte modulation to achieve high&#8208;rate conversion&#8208;type cathode materials for RMBs.

&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMB) have emerged as one of the most promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries due to the prominent advantages of magnesium metal anodes. Nevertheless, their application is hindered by sluggish Mg-ion storage kinetics in cathodes, although various structural modifications of cathode materials have been performed. Herein, an electrolyte design using an anion-incorporated Mg-ion solvation structure is developed to promote the Mg-ion storage reactions of conversion-type cathode materials.

         <title>Thermally Enhanced and Long Lifetime Red TADF Carbon Dots via Multi&#8208;confinement and Phosphorescence Assisted Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, which can harvest both singlet and triplet excitons for high&#8208;efficiency emission, have attracted widespread concern for their enormous applications. Nevertheless, luminescence thermal quenching severely limits the efficiency and operating stability in TADF materials and devices at high temperature. Herein, a surface engineering strategy has been adopted to obtain unique carbon dots (CDs)&#8208;based thermally enhanced TADF materials with &#8764; 250% enhancement from 273 to 343 K via incorporating seed CDs into ionic crystal network. The rigid crystal network can simultaneously boost reverse intersystem crossing process via enhancing spin&#8208;orbit coupling between singlet and triplet states and suppressing non&#8208;radiative transition rate, contributing to the thermally enhanced TADF character. Benefiting from efficient energy transfer from triplet states of phosphorescence center to singlet states of CDs, TADF emission at around 600&#160;nm in CDs displays a long lifetime up to 109.6&#160;ms, outperforming other red organic TADF materials. Thanks to variable decay rates of the delayed emission centers, time and temperature&#8208;dependent delayed emission color has been first realized in CDs&#8208;based delayed emission materials. The CDs with thermally enhanced and time&#8208;/temperature&#8208;dependent emission in one material system can offer new opportunities in information protection and processing.

         <title>Ultrabroadband Imaging Based on Wafer&#8208;Scale Tellurene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;resolution imaging is at the heart of the revolutionary breakthroughs of intelligent technologies, and it has been established as an important approach toward high&#8208;sensitivity information extraction/storage.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-resolution imaging is at the heart of the revolutionary breakthroughs of intelligent technologies, and it has been established as an important approach toward high-sensitivity information extraction/storage. However, due to the incompatibility between non-silicon optoelectronic materials and traditional integrated circuits as well as the lack of competent photosensitive semiconductors in the infrared region, the development of digital image sensors for ultrabroadband imaging has been severely impeded. Herein, the monolithic integration of wafer-scale tellurene photoelectric functional units by exploiting room-temperature pulsed-laser deposition is realized. Taking advantage of the intrinsic surface plasmon polaritons of tellurene, which results in the thermal perturbation promoted high-efficiency exciton separation, in-situ formation of out-of-plane homojunction and negative expansion promoted carrier transport, as well as the band bending promoted electron&#8211;hole pair separation enabled by the unique interconnected nanostrip morphology, the tellurene photodetectors demonstrate wide-spectrum photoresponse from 370.6 to 2240&#160;nm and unprecedented photosensitivity with the optimized responsivity, external quantum efficiency and detectivity of 2.7 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; A/W, 8.2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;% and 4.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Jones. An ultrabroadband image sensor is demonstrated and high-resolution photoelectric imaging is realized. The proof-of-concept wafer-scale tellurene based ultrabroadband photoelectric imaging system depicts a fascinating paradigm for the development of advanced 2D imaging platform toward the next-generation intelligent equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Maximum Emission Peak over 1500&#160;nm of Organic Assembly for Blood&#8208;brain Barrier&#8208;crossing NIR&#8208;IIb Phototheranostics of Orthotopic Glioblastoma</title>

Abstract
The development of blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB)&#8208;crossing phototheranostic agents in second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II), especially in the range of 1500&#8764;1700&#160;nm (NIR&#8208;IIb), affords great opportunities for glioblastoma (GBM) management. Herein, we designed an organic assembly (denoted as LET&#8208;12) with the maximum absorption peak at 1400&#160;nm and emission peak at 1512&#160;nm with trailing over 1700&#160;nm through the self&#8208;assembly of organic small molecule IR&#8208;1064 and subsequently decorated with choline and acetylcholine analogues. The LET&#8208;12 could effectively cross BBB through the brain's choline&#8208;like receptors&#8208;mediated transcytosis and accumulated in tumor tissues, thus achieving fluorescence/photoacoustic (FL/PA) duplex imaging of orthotopic GBM with &#8764;3.0&#160;mm depth and a superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal tissue ratio (20.93 &#177; 0.59 for FL imaging and 32.63 &#177; 1.16 for PA imaging, respectively). Owing to its good light&#8208;heat conversion ability, the LET&#8208;12 also could serve as a photothermal conversion agent, achieving obvious tumor repression of orthotopic murine GBM model after once treatment. Our findings indicated the LET&#8208;12 holds great potential for BBB&#8208;crossing NIR&#8208;IIb phototheranostics of orthotopic GBM. This self&#8208;assembly strategy of organic small molecules opens a new avenue for the construction of NIR&#8208;IIb phototheranostics.

&lt;p&gt;The development of blood-brain barrier (BBB)-crossing phototheranostic agents in second near-infrared window (NIR-II), especially in the range of 1500&#8764;1700&#160;nm (NIR-IIb), affords great opportunities for glioblastoma (GBM) management. Herein, we designed an organic assembly (denoted as LET-12) with the maximum absorption peak at 1400&#160;nm and emission peak at 1512&#160;nm with trailing over 1700&#160;nm through the self-assembly of organic small molecule IR-1064 and subsequently decorated with choline and acetylcholine analogues. The LET-12 could effectively cross BBB through the brain's choline-like receptors-mediated transcytosis and accumulated in tumor tissues, thus achieving fluorescence/photoacoustic (FL/PA) duplex imaging of orthotopic GBM with &#8764;3.0&#160;mm depth and a superior tumor-to-normal tissue ratio (20.93 &#177; 0.59 for FL imaging and 32.63 &#177; 1.16 for PA imaging, respectively).

         <title>Blood&#8208;Glucose&#8208;Powered Metabolic Fuel Cell for Self&#8208;Sufficient Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Currently available bioelectronic devices consume too much power to be continuously operated on rechargeable batteries, and are often powered wirelessly, with attendant issues regarding reliability, convenience and mobility. Thus, the availability of a robust, self&#8208;sufficient, implantable electrical power generator that works under physiological conditions would be transformative for many applications, from driving bioelectronic implants and prostheses to programing cellular behaviour and patients' metabolism. Here, capitalizing on a new copper&#8208;containing, conductively tuned three&#8208;dimensional carbon nanotube composite, we designed an implantable blood&#8208;glucose&#8208;powered metabolic fuel cell that continuously monitors blood&#8208;glucose levels, converts excess glucose into electrical power during hyperglycemia and produces sufficient energy (0.7&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, 0.9&#160;V, 50&#160;mM glucose) to drive opto&#8208; and electro&#8208;genetic regulation of vesicular insulin release from engineered beta cells. We show that this integration of blood&#8208;glucose monitoring with elimination of excessive blood glucose by combined electro&#8208;metabolic conversion and insulin&#8208;release&#8208;mediated cellular consumption enables the metabolic fuel cell to restore blood&#8208;glucose homeostasis in an automatic, self&#8208;sufficient and closed&#8208;loop manner in an experimental model of type&#8208;1 diabetes.

         <title>Patterning Quantum Dots via Photolithography: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Pixelating patterns of red, green, and blue quantum dots (QDs) is a critical challenge for realizing high&#8208;end displays with bright and vivid images for virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. Since QDs must be processed from a solution, their patterning process is completely different from the conventional techniques used in the OLED and LCD industries. Although innovative QD patterning technologies are being developed, photopatterning based on the light&#8208;induced chemical conversion of QD films is considered one of the most promising methods for forming micrometer&#8208;scale QD patterns that satisfy the precision and fidelity required for commercialization. Moreover, the practical impact will be significant, as it directly exploits mature photolithography technologies and facilities that are widely available in the semiconductor industry. This article reviewed recent progress in the effort to form QD patterns via photolithography. The review begins with a general description of the photolithography process. Subsequently, different types of photolithographical methods applicable to QD patterning are introduced, followed by recent achievements using these methods in forming high&#8208;resolution QD patterns. The paper also discusses prospects for future research directions.

         <title>True Nonvolatile High&#8208;speed DRAM Cells Using Tailored Ultrathin IGZO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Severe power consumption in the continuous scaling of Si&#8208;based DRAM technology quests for a transistor technology with a much lower off&#8208;state leakage current. Wide bandgap amorphous oxide semiconductors, especially IGZO exhibit many orders of magnitude lower off&#8208;state leakage. However, they are typically heavily n&#8208;doped and require negative gate voltage to turnoff, which prevent them from true nonvolatile operation. The efforts on doping density reduction typically result in mobility degradation and high Schottky barriers at contacts, causing severe degradation of on&#8208;current and operation speed of the DRAM cells. Here, we successfully demonstrate high&#8208;speed true nonvolatile DRAM cells by deep suppression of doping density in the IGZO channel using in&#8208;situ oxygen ion beam treatment and ohmic contact engineering by inserting a thin In&#8208;rich ITO at contact regions. A record high on&#8208;current of 40&#160;&#956;A/&#956;m with a large positive threshold voltage of 1.78&#160;V enables the first true nonvolatile DRAM with a fastest write speed of 10&#160;ns and data retention up to 25 hours under power interruption, five orders of magnitude higher than the previously projected values.

         <title>Launching and Manipulation of Higher&#8208;Order In&#8208;Plane Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in Low&#8208;Dimensional Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) are stimulated by coupling infrared (IR) photons with the polar lattice vibrations. Such HPhPs offer low&#8208;loss, highly confined light propagation at subwavelength scales with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane or in&#8208;plane hyperbolic wavefronts. For HPhPs, while a hyperbolic dispersion implies multiple propagating modes with a distribution of wavevectors at a given frequency, so far it has been challenging to experimentally launch and probe the higher&#8208;order modes that offer stronger wavelength compression, especially for in&#8208;plane HPhPs. In this work, we report the experimental observation of higher&#8208;order in&#8208;plane HPhP modes stimulated on a 3C&#8208;SiC nanowire (NW)/&#945;&#8208;MoO3 heterostructure where leveraging both the low&#8208;dimensionality and low&#8208;loss nature of the polar NWs, higher&#8208;order HPhPs modes within two&#8208;dimensional &#945;&#8208;MoO3 crystal are launched by the one&#8208;dimensional 3C&#8208;SiC NW. We further study the launching mechanism and determine the requirements for efficiently launching of such higher&#8208;order modes. In addition, by altering the geometric orientation between the 3C&#8208;SiC NW and &#945;&#8208;MoO3 crystal, we demonstrate the manipulation of higher&#8208;order HPhP dispersions as a method of tuning. This work illustrates an extremely anisotropic low dimensional heterostructure platform to confine and configure electromagnetic waves at the deep&#8208;subwavelength scales for a range of infrared applications including sensing, nano&#8208;imaging, and on&#8208;chip photonics.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concepts of water harvesting from air are discussed and correlated with the properties required for covalent organic framework (COF) water harvesters. Strategies for designing water harvesting COFs are also summarized.








Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting using reticular materials is an innovation that has the potential to change the world. Using covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for capturing water holds great promise because COFs are metal&#8208;free, stable under working conditions, and their structure can be intentionally designed to meet the requirements for this application. To promote the chemistry and use of COFs for atmospheric water harvesting, important features for synthesizing suitable water&#8208;harvesting COFs are discussed. The achievements of using COFs as water harvesters are then highlighted, showing how the water harvesting properties are related to the structural design. Finally, perspectives and research directions for further studies in COF chemistry are provided.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Trapping Management in X&#8208;Ray Storage Phosphors for Flexible 3D Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultralong&#8208;lived X&#8208;ray trapping in CsCdCl3:Mn2+, R4+ (R = Ti, Zr, Hf, and Sn) is demonstrated for flexible 3D X&#8208;ray imaging. Mn2+ site occupation manipulation and heterovalent substitution significantly improve their energy&#8208;trapping capability and thermal stability. X&#8208;ray imaging with the resolution of 12.5 lp mm&#8722;1 is further demonstrated, and convenient time&#8208;lapse 3D X&#8208;ray imaging is realized for the curved objects.








Abstract
X&#8208;ray imaging has received sustained attention for healthcare diagnostics and nondestructive inspection. To develop photonic materials with tunable photophysical properties in principle accelerates radiation detection technologies. Here the rational design and synthesis of doped halide perovskite CsCdCl3:Mn2+, R4+ (R = Ti, Zr, Hf, and Sn) are reported as next generation X&#8208;ray storage phosphors, and the capability is greatly improved by trap management via Mn2+ site occupation manipulation and heterovalent substitution. Specially, CsCdCl3:Mn2+, Zr4+ displays zero&#8208;thermal&#8208;quenching (TQ) radioluminescence and anti&#8208;TQ X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated persistent luminescence even up to 448 K, further revealing the charge&#8208;carrier compensation and redeployment mechanisms. X&#8208;ray imaging with the resolution of 12.5 lp mm&#8722;1 is demonstrated, and convenient 3D X&#8208;ray imaging for the curved objects is realized in a time&#8208;lapse manner. This work demonstrates efficient modulation of energy traps to achieve high storage capacities and promote future research into flexible X&#8208;ray detectors.

         <title>Biomimetic Gradient Bouligand Structure Enhances Impact Resistance of Ceramic&#8208;Polymer Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biological materials relied on multiple synergistic structural design elements typically exhibit excellent comprehensive mechanical properties. Hierarchical incorporation of different biostructural elements into a single artificial material is a promising approach to enhance mechanical properties, but remains challenging. Herein, we propose a biomimetic structural design strategy by coupling gradient structure with twisted plywood Bouligand structure, attempting to improve the impact resistance of ceramic&#8208;polymer composites. Via robocasting and sintering, kaolin ceramic filaments reinforced by coaxially aligned alumina nanoplatelets are arranged into Bouligand structure with a gradual transition in filament spacing along the thickness direction. After the following polymer infiltration, biomimetic ceramic&#8208;polymer composites with a gradient Bouligand (GB) structure are eventually fabricated. Experimental investigations reveal that the incorporation of gradient structure into Bouligand structure improves both the peak force and total energy absorption of the obtained ceramic&#8208;polymer composites. Computational modeling further suggests the substantial improvement in impact resistance by adopting GB structure, and clarifies the underlying deformation behavior of the biomimetic GB structured composites under impact. This biomimetic design strategy may provide valuable insights for developing lightweight and impact&#8208;resistant structural materials in the future.

Abstract
Living organisms have a very mysterious and powerful sensory computing system based on ion activity. Interestingly, study on iontronic devices in the past few years have proposed a promising platform for simulating the sensing and computing functions of living organisms, because: (1) iontronic devices can generate, store, and transmit a variety of signals by adjusting the concentration and spatiotemporal distribution of ions, which analogs to how the brain performs intelligent functions by alternating ion flux and polarization; (2) through ionic&#8208;electronic coupling, iontronic devices can bridge the biosystem with electronics and offer profound implications for soft electronics; (3) with the diversity of ions, iontronic devices can be designed to recognize specific ions or molecules by customizing the charge selectivity, and the ionic conductivity and capacitance can be adjusted to respond to external stimuli for a variety of sensing schemes, which can be more difficult for electron&#8208;based devices. This review provides a comprehensive overview of emerging neuromorphic sensory computing by iontronic devices, highlighting representative concepts of both low&#8208;level and high&#8208;level sensory computing and introducing important material and device breakthroughs. Moreover, iontronic devices as a means of neuromorphic sensing and computing are discussed regarding the pending challenges and future directions.

         <title>Ultrathin Nitride Ferroic Memory with Large ON/OFF Ratios for Analog In&#8208;memory Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Computing in the analog regime using nonlinear ferroelectric resistive memory arrays can potentially alleviate the energy constraints and complexity/footprint challenges imposed by digital von Neumann systems. Yet the current ferroelectric resistive memories suffer from either low ON/OFF ratios/imprint or limited compatibility with mainstream semiconductors. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, ferroelectric and analog resistive switching in an epitaxial nitride heterojunction comprising ultrathin (&#8764;5&#160;nm) nitride ferroelectrics, i.e., ScAlN, with potentiality to bridge the gap between performance and compatibility. High ON/OFF ratios (up to 105), high uniformity, good retention (&lt; 20% variation after &gt;&#160;105 s) and cycling endurance (&gt;104) are simultaneously demonstrated in a metal/oxide/nitride ferroelectric junction. We further demonstrate that the memristor can provide programmability to enable multistate operation and linear analogue computing as well as image processing with high accuracy. Neural network simulations based on the weight update characteristics of the nitride memory yielded an image recognition accuracy of 92.9% (baseline 96.2%) on the images from Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology. The non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;level programmability and analog computing capability provide first&#8208;hand and landmark evidence for constructing advanced memory/computing architectures based on emerging nitride ferroelectrics, and promote homo and hybrid integrated functional edge devices beyond silicon.

         <title>Hardware and Information Security Primitives Based on 2D Materials and Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review of hardware security solutions using novel electronics, optical, and material properties of 2D materials and their corresponding heterostructure device configurations for Internet of Things platforms. The five quintessential security domains for discussion are physically unclonable functions, true random number generators, logic locking, hardware watermarking and anticounterfeiting, and hardware camouflaging.








Abstract
Hardware security is a major concern for the entire semiconductor ecosystem that accounts for billions of dollars in annual losses. Similarly, information security is a critical need for the rapidly proliferating edge devices that continuously collect and communicate a massive volume of data. While silicon&#8208;based complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor technology offers security solutions, these are largely inadequate, inefficient, and often inconclusive, as well as resource intensive in time, energy, and cost, leading to tremendous room for innovation in this field. Furthermore, silicon&#8208;based security primitives have shown vulnerability to machine learning (ML) attacks. In recent years, 2D materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides have been intensely explored to mitigate these security challenges. In this review, 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;based hardware security solutions such as camouflaging, true random number generation, watermarking, anticounterfeiting, physically unclonable functions, and logic locking of integrated circuits (ICs) are summarized with accompanying discussion on their reliability and resilience to ML attacks. In addition, the role of native defects in 2D materials in developing high entropy hardware security primitives is also examined.

     alt="Hardware and Information Security Primitives Based on 2D Materials and Devices"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A review of hardware security solutions using novel electronics, optical, and material properties of 2D materials and their corresponding heterostructure device configurations for Internet of Things platforms. The five quintessential security domains for discussion are physically unclonable functions, true random number generators, logic locking, hardware watermarking and anticounterfeiting, and hardware camouflaging.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardware security is a major concern for the entire semiconductor ecosystem that accounts for billions of dollars in annual losses. Similarly, information security is a critical need for the rapidly proliferating edge devices that continuously collect and communicate a massive volume of data. While silicon-based complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology offers security solutions, these are largely inadequate, inefficient, and often inconclusive, as well as resource intensive in time, energy, and cost, leading to tremendous room for innovation in this field. Furthermore, silicon-based security primitives have shown vulnerability to machine learning (ML) attacks. In recent years, 2D materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides have been intensely explored to mitigate these security challenges. In this review, 2D-materials-based hardware security solutions such as camouflaging, true random number generation, watermarking, anticounterfeiting, physically unclonable functions, and logic locking of integrated circuits (ICs) are summarized with accompanying discussion on their reliability and resilience to ML attacks. In addition, the role of native defects in 2D materials in developing high entropy hardware security primitives is also examined. Finally, the existing challenges for 2D materials, which must be overcome for large-scale deployment of 2D ICs to meet the security needs of the semiconductor industry, are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>MOF&#8208;Based Chemiresistive Gas Sensors: Toward New Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are being designed with more sophisticated and tailored strategies by the development of computer sciences, and the unlimited versatility of MOFs provides potential to be used in gas sensors as sensing materials, heterostructures, and templates. These MOF&#8208;based gas sensors will increase the diversity of gas&#8208;sensing libraries, and are expected to achieve novel functionalities.








Abstract
The sensing performances of gas sensors must be improved and diversified to enhance quality of life by ensuring health, safety, and convenience. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which exhibit an extremely high surface area, abundant porosity, and unique surface chemistry, provide a promising framework for facilitating gas&#8208;sensor innovations. Enhanced understanding of conduction mechanisms of MOFs has facilitated their use as gas&#8208;sensing materials, and various types of MOFs have been developed by examining the compositional and morphological dependences and implementing catalyst incorporation and light activation. Owing to their inherent separation and absorption properties and catalytic activity, MOFs are applied as molecular sieves, absorptive filtering layers, and heterogeneous catalysts. In addition, oxide&#8208; or carbon&#8208;based sensing materials with complex structures or catalytic composites can be derived by the appropriate post&#8208;treatment of MOFs. This review discusses the effective techniques to design optimal MOFs, in terms of computational screening and synthesis methods. Moreover, the mechanisms through which the distinctive functionalities of MOFs as sensing materials, heterostructures, and derivatives can be incorporated in gas&#8208;sensor applications are presented.

         <title>Funnel Devices Based on Asymmetrically Strained Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Funnel devices are developed using WS2 and MoS2 transferred onto a fork&#8208;shaped SU&#8208;8 microstructure. Atomic force microscope, Raman, and photoluminescence measurements indicate that asymmetric strains are introduced to the transferred transition metal dichalcogenides. The scanning photocurrent mapping images acquired from various funnel devices follow a fork&#8208;shaped pattern, demonstrating that funneled excitons can be converted to electrical currents.








Abstract
The strain applied to transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) reduces their energy bandgap, and local strains result in a funnel&#8208;like band structure in which funneled excitons move toward the most strained region. Herein, a funnel device based on asymmetrically strained WS2 and MoS2 is reported. Asymmetric strains are induced by transferring the TMD flakes onto a fork&#8208;shaped SU&#8208;8 microstructure. Raman and photoluminescence spectra peaks are shifted according to the morphology of the SU&#8208;8 microstructure, indicating the application of asymmetric strains to the TMDs. To investigate whether funneled excitons can be converted to electrical currents, various devices are constructed by depositing symmetric and asymmetric electrodes onto the strained TMDs. The scanning photocurrent mapping images follow a fork&#8208;shaped pattern, indicating probable conversion of the funneled excitons into electrical currents. In the case of the funnel devices with asymmetric Au and Al electrodes, short&#8208;circuit current (ISC) of WS2 is enhanced by the strains, whereas ISC of MoS2 is suppressed because the Schottky barrier lowers with increasing strain for the MoS2. These results demonstrate that the funnel devices can be implemented using asymmetrically strained TMDs and the effect of strains on the Schottky barrier is dependent on the TMD used.

         <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Spin&#8208;Valve with van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2/Graphene Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The room&#8208;temperature operation of spin&#8208;valve devices using the van der Waals itinerant ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 in heterostructures with graphene is demonstrated. Lateral spin&#8208;valve, Hanle spin precession measurements, and theoretical calculations provide unique insights by probing the Fe5GeTe2/graphene interface spintronic properties via spin&#8208;dynamics measurements, revealing multidirectional spin polarization.








Abstract
The discovery of van der Waals (vdW) magnets opened a new paradigm for condensed matter physics and spintronic technologies. However, the operations of active spintronic devices with vdW ferromagnets are limited to cryogenic temperatures, inhibiting their broader practical applications. Here, the robust room&#8208;temperature operation of lateral spin&#8208;valve devices using the vdW itinerant ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 in heterostructures with graphene is demonstrated. The room&#8208;temperature spintronic properties of Fe5GeTe2 are measured at the interface with graphene with a negative spin polarization. Lateral spin&#8208;valve and spin&#8208;precession measurements provide unique insights by probing the Fe5GeTe2/graphene interface spintronic properties via spin&#8208;dynamics measurements, revealing multidirectional spin polarization. Density functional theory calculations in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulations reveal significantly canted Fe magnetic moments in Fe5GeTe2 along with the presence of negative spin polarization at the Fe5GeTe2/graphene interface. These findings open opportunities for vdW interface design and applications of vdW&#8208;magnet&#8208;based spintronic devices at ambient temperatures.

         <title>Even&#8211;Odd&#8208;Layer&#8208;Dependent Ferromagnetism in 2D Non&#8208;van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals CrCuSe2</title>

         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals 2D CuCrSe2 nanosheets with thickness down to monolayer are produced using a redox&#8208;controlled exfoliation route. Differing from its bulk form with antiferromagnetic order, the CuCrSe2 nanosheets exhibit intriguing even&#8211;odd&#8208;layer&#8208;dependent magnetism evolution, which can be attributed to the orbital shift of Cr layers due to Cu&#8208;induced centrosymmetry breaking.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) layered materials with strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy have attracted significant interest as the long&#8208;range magnetic order in these systems can survive even when their thicknesses is reduced to the 2D limit. Even though the interlayer coupling between the neighboring magnetic layers is very weak, it has a determining effect on the magnetism of these atomic&#8208;thickness materials. Herein, a new 2D ferromagnetic material, namely, non&#8208;vdW CuCrSe2 nanosheets with even&#8211;odd&#8208;layer&#8208;dependent ferromagnetism when laminated from an antiferromagnetic bulk is reported. Monolayer and even&#8208;layer CuCrSe2 exhibit the anomalous Hall effect and a significantly enhanced magnetic ordering temperature of more than 125 K. In contrast, the linear Hall effect exists in the odd&#8208;layer samples. Theoretical calculations indicate that the layer&#8208;dependent magnetic coupling is attributable to the orbital shift of the Cr atoms in the CrSe2 layers owing to the Cu&#8208;induced breaking of the centrosymmetry. Thus, this work sheds light on the exotic magnetic properties of layered materials that exhibit phenomena beyond weak interlayer interactions.

Abstract
Further enhancing the operational lifetime of the inverted&#8208;structure perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is crucial for their commercialization, and the design of hole&#8208;selective contacts at the illumination side has played a key role on operational stability. In this work, we develop the self&#8208;anchoring benzo[rst]pentaphene (SA&#8208;BPP) as a new type of hole&#8208;selective contact toward long&#8208;term operationally stable inverted PSCs. The SA&#8208;BPP molecule with a graphene&#8208;like conjugated structure shows a higher photostability and mobility than that of the frequently&#8208;used triphenylamine and carbazole&#8208;based hole&#8208;selective molecules. Besides, the anchoring groups of SA&#8208;BPP promote the formation of a large&#8208;scale uniform hole contact on ITO substrate and efficiently passivate the perovskite absorbers. Benefiting from these merits, the champion efficiencies of 22.03% for the small&#8208;sized cells and 17.08% for 5&#160;cm &#215; 5&#160;cm solar modules on an aperture area of 22.4 cm2 are achieved based on this SA&#8208;BPP contact. Also, the SA&#8208;BPP&#8208;based device exhibits a promising operational stability, with an efficiency retention of 87.4% after 2,000&#8208;hour continuous operation at the maximum power point under simulated 1&#8208;sun illumination, which indicates an estimated T80 lifetime of 3,175 hours. This novel design concept of hole&#8208;selective contacts provides a potential strategy for further improving the PSC stability.

         <title>Liquid Metal Droplets&#8208;based Elastomers from Electric Toothbrush&#8208;inspired Revolving Microfluidics</title>

Abstract
Liquid metal (LM)&#8208;based elastomers have a demonstrated value in flexible electronics. Attempts in this area include the development of multifunctional LM&#8208;based elastomers with controllable morphology, superior mechanical performances, and great stability. Herein, inspired by the working principle of electric toothbrushes, we present a revolving microfluidic system for the generation of LM droplets and construction of desired elastomers. The system involves revolving modules assembled by a needles array and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microfluidic channels. LM droplets can be generated with controllable size in a high&#8208;throughput manner due to the revolving motion&#8208;derived drag force. We have demonstrated that by employing a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) matrix as the collection phase, the generated LM droplets can act as conductive fillers for the construction of flexible electronics directly. The resultant LM droplets&#8208;based elastomers exhibit high mechanical strength, stable electrical performance, as well as superior self&#8208;healing property benefiting from the dynamic exchangeable urea bond of the polymer matrix. Notably, due to the flexible programmable feature of the LM droplets embedded within the elastomers, various patterned LM droplets&#8208;based elastomers can be easily achieved. These results indicate that the proposed microfluidic LM droplets&#8208;based elastomers have a great potential for promoting the development of flexible electronics.

         <title>Harnessing Nanomaterials for Cancer Sonodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Immunotherapy has made remarkable strides in cancer therapy over the past decade. However, such emerging therapy still suffers from the low response rates and immune&#8208;related adverse events. Various strategies have been developed to overcome these serious challenges. Thereinto, sonodynamic therapy (SDT), as a non&#8208;invasive treatment, has received ever&#8208;increasing attention especially in the treatment of deep&#8208;seated tumors. Significantly, SDT can effectively induce immunogenic cell death to trigger systemic anti&#8208;tumor immune response, termed sonodynamic immunotherapy. The rapid development of nanotechnology has revolutionized SDT effects with robust immune response induction. As a result, more and more innovative nanosonosensitizers and synergistic treatment modalities were established with superior efficacy and safe profile. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in cancer sonodynamic immunotherapy with a particular emphasis on how nanotechnology can be explored to harness SDT for amplifying anti&#8208;tumor immune response. Moreover, the current challenges in this field and the prospects for its clinical translation are also presented. We anticipate that this review can provide rational guidance and facilitate the development of nanomaterials&#8208;assisted sonodynamic immunotherapy, helping to pave the way for next&#8208;generation cancer therapy and eventually achieve a durable response in patients.

         <title>Oxyanion Engineering Suppressed Iron Segregation in Nickel&#8208;Iron Catalysts Toward Stable Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nickel&#8208;iron catalysts represent an appealing platform for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media because of their high adjustability in component and activity. However, their long&#8208;term stabilities under high current density still remain unsatisfactory due to undesirable Fe segregation. Herein, we developed a nitrate ion (NO3&#8722;) tailored strategy to mitigate Fe segregation, and thereby improve the OER stability of nickel&#8208;iron catalyst. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations indicate that introducing Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4 with stable NO3&#8722; in the lattice is conducive to constructing the stable interface of FeOOH/Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4 via the strong interaction between Fe and incorporated NO3&#8722;. Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and wavelet transformation analysis demonstrate that the NO3&#8722; tailored nickel&#8208;iron catalyst greatly alleviates Fe segregation, exhibiting a considerably enhanced long&#8208;term stability with a six&#8208;fold improvement over FeOOH/Ni(OH)2 without NO3&#8722; modification. Our work represents a momentous step toward regulating Fe segregation for stabilizing the catalytic performances of nickel&#8208;iron catalysts.

         <title>Flexible Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Device for Emerging Multifunctional and Smart Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), owing to their exceptional performances in device efficiency, color purity/tunability in the visible region, and solution&#8208;processing ability on various substrates, become a potential candidate for flexible and ultrathin electroluminescent (EL) lighting and display. Moreover, beyond the lighting and display, flexible QLEDs are enabled with endless possibilities in the era of the internet of things and artificial intelligence by acting as input/output ports in wearable integrated systems. Challenges remain in the development of flexible QLEDs with the goals for high performance, excellent flexibility/even stretchability, and emerging applications. In this paper, we review the recent developments of QLEDs including quantum dot materials, working mechanism, flexible/stretchable strategies, and patterning strategies, and highlight its emerging multifunctional integrations and smart applications covering wearable optical medical devices, pressure&#8208;sensing EL devices, and neural smart EL devices. We also summarize the remaining challenges and make an outlook on the future development of flexible QLEDs. The review is expected to offer a systematic understanding and valuable inspiration for flexible QLEDs to simultaneously satisfy optoelectronic and flexible properties for emerging applications.

         <title>Gadolinium (III)&#8208;Chelated Deformable Mesoporous Organosilica Nanoparticles as Magnetic Resonance Imaging Contrast Agent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, such as Gd&#8208;DTPA (Magnevist), have been routinely used for detecting tumors at an early stage. However, the rapid clearance by the kidney of Gd&#8208;DTPA leads to short blood circulation time, which limits further improvement of the contrast between tumorous and normal tissue. Inspired by the deformability of red blood cells, which improves their blood circulation, we fabricated a novel MRI contrast agent by incorporating Gd&#8208;DTPA into deformable mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (D&#8208;MON). In vivo distribution showed that the novel contrast agent was able to depress rapid clearance by the liver and spleen, and the mean residence time was 20 hours longer than Gd&#8208;DTPA. Tumor MRI showed that the D&#8208;MON&#8208;based contrast agent was highly enriched in the tumor tissue and achieved prolonged high&#8208;contrast imaging. D&#8208;MON significantly improved the performance of clinical contrast agent Gd&#8208;DTPA, exhibiting good potential in clinical applications.

         <title>Bioinspired Liquid Crystalline Spinning Enables Scalable Fabrication of High&#8208;Performing Fibrous Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired spinning technology is reported that allows for continuous, high&#8208;speed production of thin and aligned liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) microfibers combined with rapid deformation, powerful actuation, high response frequency, and long cycle life. This processing technology capable of scalable production of high&#8208;performing fibrous LCEs would benefit the development of smart fabrics, intelligent wearable devices, humanoid robotics, and other areas.








Abstract
Leveraging liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) to realize scalable fabrication of high&#8208;performing fibrous artificial muscles is of particular interest because these active soft materials can provide large, reversible, programmable deformations upon environmental stimuli. High&#8208;performing fibrous LCEs require the used processing technology to enable shaping LCEs into micro&#8208;scale fine fibers as thin as possible while achieving macroscopic LC orientation, which however remains a daunting challenge. Here, a bioinspired spinning technology is reported that allows for continuous, high&#8208;speed production (fabrication speed up to 8400&#160;m&#160;h&#8722;1) of thin and aligned LCE microfibers combined with rapid deformation (actuation strain rate up to 810% s&#8722;1), powerful actuation (actuation stress up to 5.3&#160;MPa), high response frequency (50&#160;Hz), and long cycle life (250&#8201;000 cycles without obvious fatigue). Inspired by liquid crystalline spinning of spiders that takes advantage of multiple drawdowns to thin and align their dragline silks, internal drawdown via tapered&#8208;wall&#8208;induced&#8208;shearing and external drawdown via mechanical stretching are employed to shape LCEs into long, thin, aligned microfibers with the desirable actuation performances, which few processing technologies can achieve. This bioinspired processing technology capable of scalable production of high&#8208;performing fibrous LCEs would benefit the development of smart fabrics, intelligent wearable devices, humanoid robotics, and other areas.

         <title>Arrested Phase Separation Enables High&#8208;Performance Keratoprostheses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrothermally treating a dense and transparent hydrophobic association hydrogel can confer synergetic optimization among multiple performance indexes essential for keratoprostheses, where the morphology is kinetically arrested via glass transition under isochoric conditions. Such a process can mediate porous structure at &#8776;100 nm, rendering a combination of multiple desired properties that equal or surpass those of current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art keratoprostheses.








Abstract
Corneal transplantation is impeded by donor shortages, immune rejection, and ethical reservations. Pre&#8208;made cornea prostheses (keratoprostheses) offer a proven option to alleviate these issues. Ideal keratoprostheses must possess optical clarity and mechanical robustness, but also high permeability, processability, and recyclability. Here, it is shown that rationally controlling the extent of arrested phase separation can lead to optimized multiscale structure that reconciles permeability and transparency, a previously conflicting goal by common pore&#8208;forming strategies. The process is simply accomplished by hydrothermally treating a dense and transparent hydrophobic association hydrogel. The examination of multiscale structure evolution during hydrothermal treatment reveals that the phase separation with upper miscibility gap evolves to confer time&#8208;dependent pore growth due to slow dynamics of polymer&#8208;rich phase which is close to vitrification. Such a process can render a combination of multiple desired properties that equal or surpass those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art keratoprostheses. In vivo tests confirm that the keratoprosthesis can effectively repair corneal perforation and restore a transparent cornea with treatment outcomes akin to that of allo&#8208;keratoplasty. The keratoprosthesis is&#160;easy to access and convenient to carry, and thus would be an effective temporary substitute for a corneal allograft in emergency conditions.

         <title>Regenerative Living 4D Printing via Reversible Growth of Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work is inspired by an &#8220;immortal&#8221; jellyfish, Turritopsis nutricula. A mature T. nutricula has the ability to rejuvenate under unusual circumstances. A regenerative living 4D printable material system is designed. After printing, the printed seed with complex geometries can not only grow by absorbing external monomers (nutrients), but also degrow to its original seed state.








Abstract
Living creatures possess complex geometries, exceptional adaptability, and continuous growing and regenerating characteristics, which are difficult for synthetic materials to imitate simultaneously. A living polymer network with these features is reported. The polymer can be digitally printed into arbitrary 3D shapes and subsequently undergoes growth via living polymerization of a monomer as the nutrient. This leads to macroscopic dimensional growth and transforms the printed amorphous network into a crystallizable network, resulting in geometric adaptability via a shape&#8208;memory mechanism. By controlling the localized growth, an initial homogeneous structure can be converted into a geometrically different heterogeneous structure composed of materials with different properties (crystallization and mechanical properties). After growth, the original network can be chemically regenerated for regrowth. With this regenerative living 4D printing, one 3D&#8208;printed seed template can be turned into different derivatives with distinct geometries and mechanical properties when repeated regeneration is conducted in different localized regions and the degree of regrowth is varied.

         <title>Building K&#8211;C Anode with Ultrahigh Self&#8208;Diffusion Coefficient for Solid State Potassium Metal Batteries Operating at &#8722;20 to 120&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin K&#8211;10% reduced graphene oxide anode is constructed, delivering promoted K diffusion kinetics and mechanical/thermal stability at 200&#160;&#176;C, which creates an interfacial resistance (&#8776;1.3 &#937; cm2) with a current density of 2.8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 25&#160;&#176;C and an areal capacity of 11.86 mAh cm&#8722;2, enabling solid state potassium metal batteries operating at &#8722;20 to 120&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Solid state potassium (K) metal batteries are intriguing in grid&#8208;scale energy storage, benefiting from the low cost, safety, and high energy density. However, their practical applications are impeded by poor K/solid electrolyte (SE) interfacial contact and limited capacity caused by the low K self&#8208;diffusion coefficient, dendrite growth, and intrinsically low melting point/soft features of metallic K. Herein, a fused&#8208;modeling strategy using potassiophilic carbon allotropes molted with K is demonstrated that can enhance the electrochemical performance/stability of the system via promoting K diffusion kinetics (2.37 &#215; 10&#8722;8 cm2 s&#8722;1), creating a low interfacial resistance (&#8776;1.3 &#937; cm2), suppressing dendrite growth, and maintaining mechanical/thermal stability at 200&#160;&#176;C. A homogeneous/stable K stripping/plating is consequently implemented with a high current density of 2.8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (at 25&#160;&#176;C) and a record&#8208;high areal capacity of 11.86 mAh cm&#8722;2 (at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). The enhanced K diffusion kinetics contribute to sustaining intimate interfacial contact, stabilizing the stripping/plating at high current densities. Full cells coupling ultrathin K&#8211;C composite anodes (&#8776;50&#160;&#181;m) with Prussian blue cathodes and &#946;/&#946;&#8243;&#8208;Al2O3 SEs deliver a high energy density of 389&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with a retention of 94.4% after 150 cycles and fantastic performances at &#8722;20 to 120&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Compressible Polymer Composites with Enhanced Dielectric Temperature Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By constructing a microscale interconnected ferroelectric scaffold with a dielectric transition layer, relative dielectric constant close to the parallel model, as well as excellent mechanical compliance, are realized in polymer composites. An artificially designed composite ceramic scaffold with a compositional gradient enables the composite display high dielectric temperature stability within wide temperature ranges, offering a new approach for designing high&#8208;performance flexible dielectrics.








Abstract
High&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant polymer composites have broad application prospects in flexible electronics and electrostatic energy storage capacitors. Substantial enhancement in dielectric constants (&#949;r) of polymer composites so far can only be obtained at a high loading of nanofillers, resulting in high dielectric loss and high elastic modulus of polymer composites. Addressing the polarization shielding and the consequent polarization discontinuity at polymer/filler interfaces has been a long&#8208;standing challenge to achieve flexible polymer composite with high &#949;r. Herein, a polymer composite with interconnected BaTiO3 (BT) ceramic scaffold is proposed and demonstrated, which exhibits a high &#949;r of &#8776;210 at a low BT volume fraction of &#8776;18&#160;vol%, approaching the upper limit predicted by the parallel model.

Moreover, the dielectric performances remain stable under a compressive strain of up to 80%. This work provides a facile approach to construct large&#8208;scale polymer composites with robust dielectric performance against changes in thermal and mechanical conditions, which are promising for high&#8208;temperature applications in flexible electronics.

&lt;p&gt;By constructing a microscale interconnected ferroelectric scaffold with a dielectric transition layer, relative dielectric constant close to the parallel model, as well as excellent mechanical compliance, are realized in polymer composites. An artificially designed composite ceramic scaffold with a compositional gradient enables the composite display high dielectric temperature stability within wide temperature ranges, offering a new approach for designing high-performance flexible dielectrics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-dielectric-constant polymer composites have broad application prospects in flexible electronics and electrostatic energy storage capacitors. Substantial enhancement in dielectric constants (&#949;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) of polymer composites so far can only be obtained at a high loading of nanofillers, resulting in high dielectric loss and high elastic modulus of polymer composites. Addressing the polarization shielding and the consequent polarization discontinuity at polymer/filler interfaces has been a long-standing challenge to achieve flexible polymer composite with high &#949;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. Herein, a polymer composite with interconnected BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (BT) ceramic scaffold is proposed and demonstrated, which exhibits a high &#949;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; of &#8776;210 at a low BT volume fraction of &#8776;18&#160;vol%, approaching the upper limit predicted by the parallel model. By incorporating relaxor Ba(Zr&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; phase in BT scaffold, dielectric temperature stability is further achieved with &#916;&#949;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; below &#177;10% within a broad temperature range (25&#8211;140&#160;&#176;C). Moreover, the dielectric performances remain stable under a compressive strain of up to 80%.

         <title>Origin of the Anomalous Electrical Transport Behavior in Fe&#8208;Intercalated Weyl Semimetal Td&#8208;MoTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;intercalated Td&#8208;FexMoTe2 single crystals (0 &#8804; x &#8804; 0.15) are grown successfully. The Fe intercalation significantly tunes the structural instability and brings about exotic electronic properties for the Weyl semimetal MoTe2, including the first observed Kondo effect and spin&#8208;glass transition in its topologically nontrivial Td phase at low temperature.








Abstract
Weyl semimetal Td&#8208;MoTe2 has recently attracted much attention due to its intriguing electronic properties and potential applications in spintronics. Here, Fe&#8208;intercalated Td&#8208;FexMoTe2 single crystals (0 &lt; x&#160;&lt; 0.15 ) are grown successfully. The electrical and thermoelectric transport results consistently demonstrate that the phase transition temperature TS is gradually suppressed with increasing x. Theoretical calculation suggests that the increased energy of the Td phase, enhanced transition barrier, and more occupied bands in 1T&#8242; phase is responsible for the suppression in TS. In addition, a &#961;&#945;&#8211;lnT behavior induced by Kondo effect is observed with x &#8805; 0.08, due to the coupling between conduction carriers and the local magnetic moments of intercalated Fe atoms. For Td&#8208;Fe0.15MoTe2, a spin&#8208;glass transition occurs at &#8776;10 K. The calculated band structure of Td&#8208;Fe0.25MoTe2 shows that two flat bands exist near the Fermi level, which are mainly contributed by the dyz and dx2&#8722;y2${{\rm{d}}_{{x^2} - {y^2}}}$ orbitals of the Fe atoms. Finally, the electronic phase diagram of Td&#8208;FexMoTe2 is established for the first time. This work provides a new route to control the structural instability and explore exotic electronic states for transition&#8208;metal&#160;dichalcogenides.

         <title>Heteroepitaxial Control of Fermi Liquid, Hund Metal, and Mott Insulator Phases in Single&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Layer Ruthenates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interface control of electronic structure in single&#8208;atomic&#8208;layer ruthenates is demonstrated. Combining thin film epitaxy and photoemission spectroscopy, a method to study interfacial electronic phases of ultrathin heterostructures is developed. Fermi liquid, Hund metal, and Mott insulator phases of SrRuO3 are discovered, exclusively in the single&#8208;atomic&#8208;layer limit. This work suggests a general way to investigate ultrathin interfacial electronic systems.








Abstract
Interfaces between dissimilar correlated oxides can offer devices with versatile functionalities, and great efforts have been made to manipulate interfacial electronic phases. However, realizing such phases is often hampered by the inability to directly access the electronic structure information; most correlated interfacial phenomena appear within a few atomic layers from the interface. Here, atomic&#8208;scale epitaxy and photoemission spectroscopy are utilized to realize the interface control of correlated electronic phases in atomic&#8208;scale ruthenate&#8211;titanate heterostructures. While bulk SrRuO3 is a ferromagnetic metal, the heterointerfaces exclusively generate three distinct correlated phases in the single&#8208;atomic&#8208;layer limit. The theoretical analysis reveals that atomic&#8208;scale structural proximity effects yield Fermi liquid, Hund metal, and Mott insulator phases in the quantum&#8208;confined SrRuO3. These results highlight the extensive interfacial tunability of electronic phases, hitherto hidden in the atomically thin correlated heterostructure. Moreover, this experimental platform suggests a way to control interfacial electronic phases of various correlated materials.

Abstract
Immunotherapy has achieved revolutionary success in clinics, but it remains challenging for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) characterized by high vascularization. Here, it is reported that metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;801 (MOF&#8208;801) can be employed as a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) through Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 (TLR4) not just as a drug delivery carrier. Notably, cytosine&#8211;phosphate&#8211;guanine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs) and 5, 6&#8208;dimethylxanthenone&#8208;4&#8208;acetic acid (DMXAA) STING agonist with vascular disrupting function coordinates with MOF&#8208;801 to self&#8208;assemble into a nanoparticle (MOF&#8208;CpG&#8208;DMXAA) that effectively delivers CpG ODNs and DMXAA to cells for synergistically improving the tumor microenvironment by reprogramming tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), promoting dendritic cells (DCs) maturation, as well as destroying tumor blood vessels. In HCC&#8208;bearing mouse models, it is demonstrated that MOF&#8208;CpG&#8208;DMXAA triggers systemic immune activation and stimulates robust tumoricidal immunity, resulting in a superior immunotherapeutic efficiency in orthotopic and recurrent HCC.

         <title>Spacer&#8208;Engineered Ionic Channels in Covalent Organic Framework Membranes toward Ultrafast Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ionic covalent organic framework with moderate&#8208;length spacer exhibits the highest through&#8208;plane proton conductivity attributed to the synergistic contribution from the spacers and the &#8211;SO3H groups.








Abstract
Side&#8208;chain engineering of covalent organic frameworks as advanced ion conductors is a critical issue to be explored. Herein, ionic covalent organic framework membranes (iCOFMs) with spacer&#8208;engineered ionic channel are de novo designed and prepared. The ionic channels are decorated with side chains comprising spacers having different carbon chain lengths and the &#8211;SO3H groups at the end. Attributed to the synergistic contribution from the spacers and the &#8211;SO3H groups, the iCOFM with moderate&#8208;length spacer exhibit the highest through&#8208;plane proton conductivity of 889 mS cm&#8208;1 at 90&#160;&#176;C.

The ionic channels are decorated with side chains comprising spacers having different carbon chain lengths and the &#8211;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H groups at the end. Attributed to the synergistic contribution from the spacers and the &#8211;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H groups, the iCOFM with moderate-length spacer exhibit the highest through-plane proton conductivity of 889 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; at 90&#160;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergetic Lithium and Hydrogen Bonds Endow Liquid&#8208;free Photonic Ionic Elastomer with Mechanical Robustness and Electrical/optical Dual&#8208;output</title>

Abstract
Photonic ionic elastomers (PIEs) capable of multiple signal outputs is intriguing in flexible interactive electronics. However, fabricating PIEs with simultaneous mechanical robustness, good ionic conductivity and brilliant structure color still remains challenging. Here, we break the limitations through introducing synergistic effect of lithium and hydrogen bonds into an elastomer. In virtue of lithium bonding between lithium ions and carbonyl groups in the polymer matrix as well as hydrogen bonding between silanol on the surface of silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) and ether groups along polymer chains, the PIEs demonstrate mechanical strength up to 4.3&#160;MPa and toughness up to 8.6&#160;MJ m&#8722;3. Meanwhile, the synchronous electrical and optical output under mechanical strains could be achieved in the PIEs with the presence of dissociated ions contributed by lithium bond and non&#8208;close&#8208;packed SiNPs stabilized by hydrogen bond. Moreover, due to their liquid&#8208;free nature, the PIEs exhibit extraordinary stability and durability, which could withstand extreme conditions including both high and low temperatures as well as high humidity. This work provides a promising molecular engineering route to construct high performance photonic ionic conductors towards advanced ionotronic applications.

         <title>Intrinsic Dipole Arrangement to Coordinate Energy Levels for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite great progress in perovskite photovoltaics, it should be noted that the intrinsic disorder dipolar cations in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites exert negative effects on the energy band structure as well as the carrier separation and transfer dynamics. However, oriented polarization achieved by applying an external electric field may cause irreversible damage to perovskites. Herein, a unique and efficient strategy is developed to modulate the intrinsic dipole arrangement in perovskite films for high&#8208;performance and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The spontaneous reorientation of dipolar cation MA+ is triggered by a polar molecule, constructing a vertical polarization during crystallization regulation. The oriented dipole determines a gradient energy&#8208;level arrangement in PSCs and more favorable energetics at interfaces, effectively enhancing the built&#8208;in electric field and suppressing the nonradiative recombination. Besides, the dipole reorientation induces a local dielectric environment to remarkably reduce exciton binding energy, leading to an ultralong carrier diffusion length of up to 1708&#160;nm. Accordingly, the n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs achieve a significant increase in power conversion efficiency, reaching 24.63% with negligible hysteresis and exhibiting outstanding stabilities. This strategy also provides a facile route to eliminate the mismatched energetics and enhance carrier dynamics for other novel photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Induced Chirality&#8208;Selective Routing of Valley Photons via Metallic Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Valleytronics in two&#8208;dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides has raised a great impact in nanophotonic information processing and transport as it provides the pseudospin degree of freedom for carrier control. The imbalance of carrier occupation in inequivalent valleys can be achieved by external stimulations such as helical light and electric field. With metasurfaces, it is feasible to separate the valley exciton in real space and momentum space, which is significant for logical nanophotonic circuits. However, the control of valley&#8208;separated far&#8208;field emission by a single nanostructure is rarely reported, despite the fact that it is crucial for subwavelength research of valley&#8208;dependent directional emission. Here, we demonstrate that the electron beam permits the chirality&#8208;selective routing of valley photons in a monolayer WS2 with Au nanostructures. The electron beam can locally excite valley excitons and regulate the coupling between excitons and nanostructures, hence controlling the interference effect of multipolar electric modes in nanostructures. Therefore, the separation degree can be modified by steering the electron beam, exhibiting the capability of subwavelength control of valley separation. Our work provides a novel method to create and resolve the variation of valley emission distribution in momentum space, paving the way for the design of future nanophotonic integrated devices.

         <title>Cartilage Lacuna&#8208;inspired Microcarriers Drive Hyaline Neocartilage Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cartilage equivalents from hydrogels containing chondrocytes exhibit excellent potential in hyaline cartilage regeneration, yet current approaches have limited success at reconstituting the architecture to culture nondifferentiated chondrocytes in vitro. In this study, we report specially designed lacunar hyaluronic acid microcarriers (LHAMC) with mechanotransductive conditions that rapidly form stable hyaluronic acid (HA) N&#8208;hydroxy succinimide ester (NHS&#8208;ester). Specifically, carboxyl&#8208;functionalized HA is linked to collagen type I via amide&#8208;crosslinking, and gas foaming produced by ammonium bicarbonate form concave surface of the microcarriers. The temporal three&#8208;dimensional culture of chondrocytes on LHAMC uniquely remodels the extracellular matrix to induce hyaline cartilaginous microtissue regeneration and prevents an anaerobic&#8208;to&#8208;aerobic metabolism transition in response to the geometric constraints. Furthermore, by inhibiting the canonical Wnt pathway, LHAMC prevent &#946;&#8208;catenin translocation to the nucleus, repressing chondrocyte dedifferentiation. Additionally, the subcutaneous implantation model indicates that LHAMC display favorable cytocompatibility and drive robust hyaline chondrocyte&#8208;derived neocartilage formation. Our findings reveal a novel strategy for regulating chondrocyte dedifferentiation. The current study paves the way for a better understanding of geometrical insight clues into mechanotransduction interaction in regulating cell fate, opening new avenues for advancing tissue engineering.

         <title>Triclinic&#8208;Phase Bismuth Chromate: A Promising Candidate for Photocatalytic Water Splitting with Broad Spectrum Ranges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and crystal structure verification of a novel triclinic bismuth chromate, Bi2CrO6, are reported. Detailed investigations on the electronic structure and the capability of both visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven water oxidation and reduction reactions, as well as the fabrication of a Z&#8208;scheme overall water splitting system are reported, demonstrating a huge potential of the triclinic Bi2CrO6 in photocatalysis.








Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting for solar energy conversion remains challenged by the lack of novel semiconductor photocatalysts with paramount parameters including wide light&#8208;harvesting ranges and suitable band structures. Here, a novel triclinic&#8208;phase bismuth chromate (Bi2CrO6) acting as a semiconductor photocatalyst candidate is reported. Triclinic Bi2CrO6 exhibits a broad absorption range of &#8776;650&#160;nm with a direct bandgap of 1.86&#160;eV and shows a suitable band structure for water splitting. Theoretical simulations of triclinic Bi2CrO6 reveal a high charge mobility,&#160;possibly owing to the strong hybridized covalent bonds, large elastic modulus, and small carrier effective mass. The triclinic Bi2CrO6 is demonstrated to work well toward photocatalytic water oxidation and hydrogen production reactions under visible light and match well with its absorption ranges. In particular, it exhibits decent photocatalytic water oxidation performance in the presence of various electron scavengers. Furthermore, the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven Z&#8208;scheme overall water splitting system is fabricated by coupling triclinic Bi2CrO6 as the oxygen evolution photocatalyst with SrTiO3:Rh as the hydrogen evolution photocatalyst, giving a stable overall water splitting with stoichiometric evolution of H2 and O2. This work presents a promising semiconductor material enabling wide&#8208;range light harvesting for photocatalytic and photo&#8208;electrochemical solar energy conversion.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Assisted Wet Annealing: A New Strategy for Superstrong, Tough, Stretchable, and Anti&#8208;Fatigue Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel solvent&#8208;exchange&#8208;assisted wet&#8208;annealing strategy is first proposed to develop superstrong and tough hydrogels with extremely high stretchability and excellent fatigue resistance. The hydrogels have extremely high tensile strength of 11.19 &#177; 0.27 MPa, a fracture toughness of 82.28 &#177; 2.89 MJ m&#8722;3 with stretchability up to 1879 &#177; 10%, and a fatigue threshold of &#8776;1233 J m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Hydrogels are widely used in tissue engineering, soft robots, wearable electronics, etc. However, it remains a great challenge to develop hydrogels possessing simultaneously high strength, large stretchability, great fracture energy, and good fatigue threshold to suit different applications. Herein, a novel solvent&#8208;exchange&#8208;assisted wet&#8208;annealing strategy is proposed to prepare high performance poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogels by extensively tuning the macromolecular chain movement and optimizing the polymer network. The reinforcing and toughening mechanisms are found to be &#8220;macromolecule crystallization and entanglement&#8221;. These hydrogels have large tensile strengths up to 11.19 &#177; 0.27&#160;MPa and extremely high fracture strains of 1879 &#177; 10%. In addition, the fracture energy and fatigue threshold can reach as high as 25.39 &#177; 6.64&#160;kJ m&#8722;2 and &#8776;1233 J m&#8722;2, respectively. These superb mechanical properties compare favorably to those of other tough hydrogels, organogels, and even natural tendons and synthetic rubbers. This work provides a new and effective method to fabricate superstrong, tough, stretchable, and anti&#8208;fatigue hydrogels with potential applications in artificial tendons and ligaments.

         <title>A General Strategy to Remove Metal Aggregates toward Metal&#8211;Nitrogen&#8211;Carbon Catalysts with Exclusive Atomic Dispersion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and efficient strategy is developed to obtain metal&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons (M&#63743;N&#63743;Cs) with exclusive atomic dispersion by making use of ammonium iodide as a high&#8208;temperature etchant to remove excessive crystalline metal aggregates, which eases the identification of the genuine catalytically active sites and enables the rational design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance M&#63743;N&#63743;C catalysts.








Abstract
Metal&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped nanocarbons (M&#63743;N&#63743;Cs) are promising alternatives to precious metals for catalyzing electrochemical energy conversion processes. However, M&#63743;N&#63743;Cs synthesized by high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis frequently suffer from compositional heterogeneity with the simultaneous presence of atomically dispersed M&#63743;Nx sites and crystalline metal nanoparticles (NPs), which hinders the identification of active sites and rational optimization in performance. Herein, a universal and efficient strategy is reported to obtain both precious&#8208; and nonprecious&#8208;metal&#8208;based M&#63743;N&#63743;Cs (M = Pt, Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Cu, Zn) with exclusive atomic dispersion by making use of ammonium iodide as the etchant to remove excessive metal aggregates at high temperature. Taking Pt&#63743;N&#63743;C as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, the complete removal of Pt NPs in Pt&#63743;N&#63743;C enables clarification on the contributions of the atomic Pt&#63743;Nx moieties and Pt NPs to the catalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction. Combined electrochemical measurements and theoretical calculations identify that the atomic Pt&#63743;Nx moieties by themselves possess negligible activity, but they can significantly boost the activity of the Pt NPs via the synergistic effect.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Electrochemical Glycerol Conversion over a Mie Scattering Effect Enhanced Porous BiVO4 Photoanode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mie scattering porous BiVO4 photoanode transformed from the well&#8208;documented porous BiVO4 photoanode by a facile annealing treatment in the air decreases the reflection of incident light and enables the reabsorbed ability of scattered light, leading to pronounced light&#8208;harvesting efficiency enhancement, which delivers a high dihydroxyacetone conversion rate of 325.2 mmol m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 from photo&#8208;electrochemical glycerol oxidation.








Abstract
The photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) oxidation of glycerol (GLY) to high&#8208;value&#8208;added dihydroxyacetone (DHA) can be achieved over a BiVO4 photoanode, while the PEC performance of most BiVO4 photoanodes is impeded due to the upper limits of the photocurrent density. Here, an enhanced Mie scattering effect of the well&#8208;documented porous BiVO4 photoanode is obtained with less effort by a simple annealing process, which significantly reduces the reflectivity to near zero. The great light absorbability increases the basic photocurrent density by 1.77 times. The selective oxidation of GLY over the BiVO4 photoanode results in a photocurrent density of 6.04 mA cm&#8722;2 and a DHA production rate of 325.2 mmol m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 that exceeds all reported values. This work addresses the poor ability of nanostructured BiVO4 to harvest light, paving the way for further improvements in charge transport and transfer to realize highly efficient PEC conversion.

         <title>Highly Reversible Lithium Metal Anode Enabled by 3D Lithiophilic&#8211;Lithiophobic Dual&#8208;Skeletons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A free&#8208;standing composite Li metal anode (Li&#8208;B@SSM) with hierarchical 3D lithiophilic&#8211;lithiophobic dual&#8208;skeletons is developed via a facile roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll mechanical pressing of stainless&#8208;steel mesh (SSM) and Li&#8208;B alloy. The coupling of micro&#8208;gridding SSM framework and LiB nanofibers enables site&#8208;selective Li stripping/plating processes, achieving excellent cycle performance and practically feasible Li metal anodes.








Abstract
Lithium metal is a promising anode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries, but its practical application is still hindered by intrinsic defects such as infinite volume expansion and uncontrollable dendrite growth. Herein, a dendrite&#8208;free 3D composite Li anode (Li&#8208;B@SSM) is prepared by mechanical rolling of lithiophilic LiB nanofibers supported by Li&#8211;B composite and lithiophobic stainless&#8208;steel mesh (SSM). Featuring hierarchical lithiophilic&#8211;lithiophobic dual&#8208;skeletons, the Li&#8208;B@SSM anode shows an ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency of 99.95% and a long lifespan of 900 h under 2 mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2. It is demonstrated that the abnormally reversible Li stripping/plating processes should be closely related to the site&#8208;selective plating behavior and spatial confinement effect induced by the robust lithiophilic&#8211;lithiophobic dual&#8208;skeletons, which alleviates the volume changes, suppresses the growth of Li dendrites, and reduces the accumulation of &#8220;dead&#8221; Li. More importantly, the application feasibility of the Li&#8208;B@SSM anode is also confirmed in full batteries, of which the Li&#8208;B@SSM|LiFePO4 full cell shows a high capacity retention of 97.5% after 400 cycles&#160;while the Li&#8208;B@SSM|S pouch battery exhibits good cycle stability even under practically harsh conditions. This work paves the way for the facile and efficient fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency Li metal anodes toward practical applications.

Piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis as an emerging mechano&#8208;to&#8208;chemistry energy conversion technique opens multiple innovative opportunities and draws great interest over the past decade. However, the two potential mechanisms in piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis, i.e., screening charge effect and energy band theory, generally coexist in the most piezoelectrics, making the essential mechanism remain controversial. Here, for the first time, we distinguish the two mechanisms in piezo&#8208;electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (PECRR) through a narrow&#8208;bandgap piezo&#8208;electrocatalyst strategy using MoS2 nanoflakes as demo. With conduction band of &#8208;0.12&#160;eV, the MoS2 nanoflakes are unsatisfied for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO redox potential of &#8208;0.53&#160;eV, yet they achieve an ultrahigh CO yield of &#8764; 543.1 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 in PECRR. Potential band position shifts under vibration are still unsatisfied with CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO potential verified by a combination analysis of theoretical investigation and piezo&#8208;photocatalytic experiment, further indicating that the mechanism of piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis is independent of band position. Besides, MoS2 nanoflakes exhibit unexpected intense &#8220;breathing&#8221; effect under vibration and enable the naked&#8208;eye&#8208;visible inhalation of CO2 gas, independently achieving the complete carbon cycle chain from CO2 capture to conversion. The CO2 inhalation and conversion processes in PECRR are revealed by a self&#8208;designed in situ reaction cell. This work brings new insights into the essential mechanism and surface reaction evolution of piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis.

         <title>Sound&#8208;Speed Modifying Acoustic Metasurfaces for Acoustic Holography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin metasurface approach utilizing planarized micropillars in discrete phase arrays is demonstrated, and&#160;which is easily fabricated by a&#160;single&#8208;step etching process. This metasurface demonstrates flexibility in the generation of complex acoustic patterns by acoustic holography and has broad potential in applications including high&#8208;frequency acoustic manipulation in microfluidics, cell/tissue engineering, and medical ultrasound.








Abstract
Acoustic metasurfaces offer unique capabilities to steer and direct acoustic fields, though these are generally composed of complex 3D structures, complicating their fabrication and applicability to higher frequencies. Here, an ultrathin metasurface approach is demonstrated,&#160;wherein&#160;planarized micropillars in a discretized phase array&#160;are&#160;utilized. This subwavelength metasurface is easily produced via a single&#8208;step etching process and is suitable for megahertz&#8208;scale applications. The flexibility of this approach is further demonstrated in the production of complex acoustic patterns via acoustic holography. This metasurface approach, with models used to predict their behavior, has broad potential in applications where robust, high&#8208;frequency acoustic manipulation is required, including microfluidics, cell/tissue engineering, and medical ultrasound.

         <title>Single&#8208;crystalline BaZr0.2Ti0.8O3 membranes enabled high energy density in PEI&#8208;based composites for high&#8208;temperature electrostatic capacitors</title>

Abstract
Dielectric capacitors are promising for high power energy storage, but their breakdown strength (Eb) and energy density (Ue) usually degrade rapidly at high temperatures. Adding boron nitride (BN) nanosheets could improve the Eb and high&#8208;temperature endurance but with a limited Ue due to its low dielectric constant. Here, we fabricate freestanding single&#8208;crystalline BaZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (BZT) membranes with high dielectric constant, and introduce them into BN doped polyetherimide (PEI) to obtain laminated PEI&#8208;BN/BZT/PEI&#8208;BN composites. At room temperature, the composite shows a maximum Ue of 17.94 J cm&#8722;3 with the highest Eb of 730 MV m&#8722;1, which is more than two times the pure PEI. Particularly, the composites exhibit excellent dielectric&#8208;temperature stability between 25 and 150&#176;C. An outstanding Ue = 7.90 J cm&#8722;3 is obtained at a relatively large electric field of 650 MV m&#8722;1 under 150&#176;C, which is superior to the most high&#8208;temperature dielectric capacitors reported so far. Phase&#8208;field simulation reveals that the depolarization electric field generated at the BZT/PEI&#8208;BN interfaces could effectively reduce carrier mobility, leading to the remarkable enhancement of the Eb and Ue over a wide temperature range. This work provides a promising and scalable route to develop sandwich&#8208;structured composites with prominent energy storage performances for high&#8208;temperature capacitive applications.

Abstract
Solar driven CO2 reduction by water with a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction affords an avenue to access energy storage and to alleviate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, yet the separation of charge carriers and the integrative regulation of water oxidation and CO2 activation sites remain challenging. Here, a BiVO4/g&#8208;C3N4 (BVO/CN) Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction as such a prototype has been constructed by spatially separated dual sites with CoOx clusters and imidazolium ionic liquids (IL) towards CO2 photoreduction. The optimized CoOx&#8208;BVO/CN&#8208;IL delivers a ca. 80&#8208;fold CO production rate without H2 evolution compared with urea&#8208;C3N4 counterpart, together with nearly stoichiometric O2 gas produced. Experimental results and DFT calculations unveil the cascade Z&#8208;scheme charge transfer and subsequently the prominent redox co&#8208;catalysis by CoOx and IL for holes&#8208;H2O oxidation and electrons&#8208;CO2 reduction, respectively. Moreover, in&#8208;situ &#956;s&#8208;transient absorption spectra clearly show the function of each cocatalyst and quantitatively reveal that the resulting CoOx&#8208;BVO/CN&#8208;IL reaches up to the electron transfer efficiency of 36.4% for CO2 reduction, far beyond those for BVO/CN (4.0%) and urea&#8208;CN (0.8%), underlining an exceptional synergy of dual reaction sites engineering. This work provides deep insights and guidelines to the rational design of highly efficient Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction with precise redox catalytic sites toward solar fuel production.

         <title>Unsaturated, Trialkyl Ionizable Lipids are Versatile Lipid&#8208;Nanoparticle Components for Therapeutic and Vaccine Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through rational design and structure&#8211;activity relationship analysis, a library of 16 novel ionizable lipids that use trialkyl structural motifs is screened. A potent trialkyl lipid (&#8220;Lipid 10&#8221;) that demonstrates broad spectrum activity in both therapeutic and vaccine applications is identified. In many cases, it outperforms the leading ionizable lipid benchmarks used in Onpattro, SpikeVax, and Comirnaty.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have proven a successful platform for the delivery of nucleic acid (NA)&#8208;based therapeutics and vaccines, with the ionizable lipid component playing a key role in modulating potency and tolerability. Here, a library of 16 novel ionizable lipids is screened hypothesizing that short, branched trialkyl hydrophobic domains can improve LNP fusogenicity or endosomal escape, and potency. LNPs formulated with the top&#8208;performing trialkyl lipid (Lipid 10) encapsulating transthyretin siRNA elicit significantly greater gene silencing and are better tolerated than those with the benchmark Onpattro lipid DLin&#8208;MC3&#8208;DMA. Lipid 10 also demonstrates superior liver delivery of mRNA when compared to other literature ionizable lipids, is well tolerated, and successfully repeat&#8208;doses in nonhuman primates. In a prime&#8208;boost hemagglutinin rodent vaccine model, intramuscular administration of Lipid&#8208;10 LNP elicits comparable or better antibody titers to the SM&#8208;102 and ALC&#8208;0315 lipid compositions used in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved mRNA COVID vaccines. These data suggest that Lipid 10 is a particularly versatile ionizable lipid, well&#8208;suited for both systemic therapeutic and intramuscular vaccine applications and able to successfully deliver diverse NA payloads.

         <title>Alloying of Cu with Ru Enabling the Relay Catalysis for Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Involving eight electron transfer process and multiple intermediates of nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) leads to a sluggish kinetic and low Faradic efficiency, therefore, it's essential to get an insight into the reaction mechanism to develop highly efficient electrocatalyst. Herein, a series of reduced graphene oxide supported RuCu alloy catalysts (RuxCuy/rGO) were fabricated and used for the direct reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3. It is found that the Ru1Cu10/rGO shows the ammonia formation rate of 0.38&#160;mmol cm&#8722;2h&#8722;1 (loading 1&#160;mg/cm2) and the ammonia Faradic efficiency (FE) of 98% under an ultralow potential of &#8722;0.05&#160;V versus RHE, which is comparable to Ru catalyst. The highly efficient activity of Ru1Cu10/rGO can be attributed to the synergetic effect between Ru and Cu sites via a relay catalysis, in which the Cu shows the exclusively efficient activity for the reduction of NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; and Ru exhibits the superior activity for NO2&#8722; to NH3. In addition, the doping of Ru into Cu tunes the d&#8208;band center of alloy and effectively modulates the adsorption energy of the NO3&#8722; and NO2&#8722;, which promotes the direct reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3. This synergetic electrocatalysis strategy opens a new avenue for developing highly efficient multifunctional catalysts.

         <title>Lipid Deposition Profiles Influence Foreign Body Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fibrosis remains a significant cause of failure in implanted biomedical devices and early absorption of proteins on implant surfaces has been shown to be a key instigating factor. However, lipids can also regulate immune activity and their presence may also contribute to biomaterial&#8208;induced foreign body responses (FBR) and fibrosis. Here we demonstrate that the surface presentation of lipids on implant affects FBR by influencing reactions of immune cells to materials as well as their resultant inflammatory/suppressive polarization. We employed time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF&#8208;SIMS) to characterize lipid deposition on implants that were surface&#8208;modified chemically with immunomodulatory small molecules. Multiple immunosuppressive phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin) were all found to deposit preferentially on implants with anti&#8208;FBR surface modifications in mice. Significantly, a set of 11 fatty acids was enriched on unmodified implanted devices that failed in both mice and humans, highlighting relevance across species. Phospholipid deposition was also found to upregulate the transcription of anti&#8208;inflammatory genes in murine macrophages, while fatty acid deposition stimulated the expression of pro&#8208;inflammatory genes. These results provide further insights into how to improve the design of biomaterials and medical devices to mitigate biomaterial material&#8208;induced FBR and fibrosis.

         <title>Realization and current&#8208;driven dynamics of fractional hopfions and their ensembles in a helimagnet FeGe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) topological spin textures&#8212;hopfions&#8212;have been predicted in helimagnetic systems but have not been experimentally confirmed thus far. By utilizing external magnetic field and electric current in the present study, 3D topological spin textures were realized, including fractional hopfions with nonzero topological index, in a skyrmion&#8208;hosting helimagnet FeGe. Microsecond current pulses were employed to control the dynamics of the expansion and contraction of a bundle composed of a skyrmion and fractional hopfion, as well as its current&#8208;driven Hall motion. This research approach has demonstrated the novel electromagnetic properties of fractional hopfions and their ensembles in helimagnetic systems.

         <title>Piezoresistive Free&#8208;standing Microfiber Strain Sensor for High&#8208;resolution Battery Thickness Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Highly sensitive microfiber strain sensors are promising for the detection of mechanical deformations in applications where limited space is available. In particular for in&#8208;situ battery thickness monitoring where high resolution and low detection limit are key requirements. Herein, we present the realization of a highly sensitive strain sensor for in&#8208;situ Li&#8208;ion battery thickness monitoring. The compliant fiber&#8208;shaped sensor is fabricated by an upscalable wet&#8208;spinning method employing a composite of microspherical core&#8208;shell conductive particles embedded in an elastomer. The electrical resistance of the sensor changes under applied strain, exhibiting a high strain sensitivity and extremely low strain detection limit of 0.00005 with high durability of 10000 cycles. To demonstrate the accuracy and ease of applicability of our sensor, the real&#8208;time thickness change of a Li&#8208;ion battery pouch cell is monitored during the charge and discharge cycles. Our work introduces a promising approach with the least material complexity for soft microfiber strain gauges.

         <title>Embedded 3D Printing of Architected Ceramics via Microwave&#8208;Activated Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microwave&#8208;activated, embedded 3D printing (EMB3D) method is developed to create complex ceramic lattices and interpenetrating architectures with tailored composition, density, and mechanical properties.








Abstract
Light&#8208; and ink&#8208;based 3D printing methods have vastly expanded the design space and geometric complexity of architected ceramics. However, light&#8208;based methods are typically confined to a relatively narrow range of preceramic and particle&#8208;laden resins, while ink&#8208;based methods are limited in geometric complexity due to layerwise assembly. Here, embedded 3D printing is combined with microwave&#8208;activated curing to generate architected ceramics with spatially controlled composition in freeform shapes. Aqueous colloidal inks are printed within a support matrix, rapidly cured via microwave&#8208;activated polymerization, and subsequently dried and sintered into dense architectures composed of one or more oxide materials. This&#160;integrated manufacturing method opens new avenues for the design and fabrication of complex ceramic architectures with programmed composition, density, and form for myriad applications.

         <title>An Engineered Living Intestinal Muscle Patch Produces Macroscopic Contractions that can Mix and Break Down Artificial Intestinal Contents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered intestinal muscle patch is created in vitro to generate three distinct contraction modes. It shows record strength of contractility, strong enough to mix and physically triturate viscoelastic gels that mimic the mechanical properties of the intestinal digesta. Generating such muscle patches depends on both biochemical signals from the medium and environmental cues from a bioscaffold.








Abstract
The intestinal muscle layers execute various gut wall movements to achieve controlled propulsion and mixing of intestinal content. Engineering intestinal muscle layers with complex contractile function is critical for developing bioartificial intestinal tissue to treat patients with short bowel syndrome. Here, the first demonstration of a living intestinal muscle patch capable of generating three distinct motility patterns and displaying multiple digesta manipulations&#160;is reported. Assessment of contractility, cellular morphology, and transcriptome profile reveals that successful generation of the contracting muscle patch relies on both biological factors in a serum&#8208;free medium and environmental cues from an elastic electrospun gelatin scaffold. By comparing gene&#8208;expression patterns among samples, it is shown that biological factors from the medium strongly affect ion&#8208;transport activities, while the scaffold unexpectedly regulates cell&#8211;cell communication. Analysis of ligandreceptor interactome identifies scaffold&#8208;driven changes in intercellular communication, and 78% of the upregulated ligand&#8211;receptor interactions are involved in the development and function of enteric neurons. The discoveries highlight the importance of combining biomolecular and biomaterial approaches for tissue engineering. The living intestinal muscle patch represents a pivotal advancement for building functional replacement intestinal tissue. It offers a more physiological model for studying GI motility and for preclinical drug discovery.

Generating such muscle patches depends on both biochemical signals from the medium and environmental cues from a bioscaffold.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intestinal muscle layers execute various gut wall movements to achieve controlled propulsion and mixing of intestinal content. Engineering intestinal muscle layers with complex contractile function is critical for developing bioartificial intestinal tissue to treat patients with short bowel syndrome. Here, the first demonstration of a living intestinal muscle patch capable of generating three distinct motility patterns and displaying multiple digesta manipulations&#160;is reported. Assessment of contractility, cellular morphology, and transcriptome profile reveals that successful generation of the contracting muscle patch relies on both biological factors in a serum-free medium and environmental cues from an elastic electrospun gelatin scaffold. By comparing gene-expression patterns among samples, it is shown that biological factors from the medium strongly affect ion-transport activities, while the scaffold unexpectedly regulates cell&#8211;cell communication. Analysis of ligandreceptor interactome identifies scaffold-driven changes in intercellular communication, and 78% of the upregulated ligand&#8211;receptor interactions are involved in the development and function of enteric neurons. The discoveries highlight the importance of combining biomolecular and biomaterial approaches for tissue engineering. The living intestinal muscle patch represents a pivotal advancement for building functional replacement intestinal tissue. It offers a more physiological model for studying GI motility and for preclinical drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electronic State and Microenvironment Modulation of Metal Nanoparticles Stabilized by MOFs for Boosting Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tiny PdCu nanoparticles are encapsulated into a representative metal&#8208;organic framework, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;SO3H, followed by post&#8208;synthetic coating of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer to afford PdCu@UiO&#8208;S@PDMS composite. Strikingly, the protonated and hydrophobic microenvironment&#160;and electron&#8208;rich PdCu sites endow PdCu@UiO&#8208;S@PDMS with high activity toward the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (Faraday efficiency: 13.16%, yield: 20.24&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1), far superior to the corresponding counterparts.








Abstract
Modulation of the local electronic structure and microenvironment of catalytic metal sites plays a critical role in electrocatalysis, yet remains a grand challenge. Herein, PdCu nanoparticles with an electron rich state are encapsulated into a sulfonate functionalized metal&#8208;organic framework, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;SO3H (simply as UiO&#8208;S), and their microenvironment&#160;is further modulated by coating a hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer, affording PdCu@UiO&#8208;S@PDMS. This resultant catalyst presents high activity toward the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR, Faraday efficiency: 13.16%, yield: 20.24&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1), far superior to the corresponding counterparts. Experimental and theoretical results jointly demonstrate that the protonated and hydrophobic microenvironment supplies protons for the NRR yet suppresses the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction reaction, and electron&#8208;rich PdCu sites in PdCu@UiO&#8208;S@PDMS are favorable to formation of the N2H* intermediate and reduce the energy barrier of NRR, thereby accounting for its good performance.

         <title>Nanoimprinted 2D&#8208;Chiral Perovskite Nanocrystal Metasurfaces for Circularly Polarized Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unmodified CsPbBr3 and CsPbBr1I2 perovskite nanocrystals exhibit intense circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) reaching glum values up to 0.15 and 0.3 (with a high index coating) when they are nanostructured into 2D chiral metasurfaces using soft nanoimprinting lithography. The approach is scalable and leads to large areas enabling CPL production from a variety of nanoemitters.








Abstract
The versatile hybrid perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are one of the most promising materials for optoelectronics by virtue of their tunable bandgaps and high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields. However, their inherent crystalline chemical structure limits the chiroptical properties achievable with the material. The production of chiral perovskites has become an active field of research for its promising applications in optics, chemistry, or biology. Typically, chiral halide perovskites are obtained by the incorporation of different chiral moieties in the material. Unfortunately, these chemically modified perovskites have demonstrated moderate values of chiral PL so far. Here, a general and scalable approach is introduced to produce chiral PL from arbitrary nanoemitters assembled into 2D&#8208;chiral metasurfaces. The fabrication via nanoimprinting lithography employs elastomeric molds engraved with chiral motifs covering millimeter areas that are used to pattern two types of unmodified colloidal perovskite NC inks: green&#8208;emissive CsPbBr3 and red&#8208;emissive CsPbBr1I2. The perovskite 2D&#8208;metasurfaces exhibit remarkable PL dissymmetry factors (glum) of 0.16 that can be further improved up to glum of 0.3 by adding a high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index coating on the metasurfaces. This scalable approach to produce chiral photoluminescent thin films paves the way for the seamless production of bright chiral light sources for upcoming optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Comprehensively Understanding the Role of Anion Vacancies on K&#8208;Ion Storage: A Case Study of Se&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Engineered VSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Se&#8208;vacancy&#8208;engineered VSe2 is proposed to reveal the role of anion vacancies on the K+ storage of conversion&#8208;type anode materials. The results reveal that Se vacancies boost the first potassiation by offering additional K+ adsorption sites and diffusion channels in the intercalation stage and weakening bond strength in the conversion stage. In addition, Se vacancies disappear&#160;after the first potassiation.








Abstract
Anion vacancy engineering (AVE) is widely used to improve the Li&#8208;ion and Na&#8208;ion storage of conversion&#8208;type anode materials. However, AVE is still an emerging strategy in K&#8208;ion batteries, which are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. In addition, the role of anion vacancies on ion storage is far from clear, despite several proposed explanations. Herein, by employing VSe2 as a model conversion&#8208;type anode material, Se vacancies are intentionally introduced (labeled as P&#8208;VSe2&#8722;x) to investigate their effect on K+ storage. The P&#8208;VSe2&#8722;x shows excellent cyclability in half cells (143&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 3.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles) and high energy density in coin&#8208;type full cells (206.8&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1). By applying various electrochemical techniques, the effects of Se vacancies on the redox potentials of K&#8208;ion insertion/extraction and the K&#8208;ion diffusion in electrodes upon cycling are uncovered. In addition, the structural evolution of Se vacancies during potassiation/de&#8208;potassiation using various operando and ex characterizations is revealed. Moreover, it is demonstrated that Se vacancies can facilitate the breaking of V&#63743;Se bonds upon the P&#8208;VSe2&#8722;x conversion using theoretical calculations. This work comprehensively explains the role of anion vacancies in ion storage for developing high&#8208;performance conversion&#8208;type anode materials.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Synthesis of &#63743;P&#63742;N&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanofibers for Single&#8208;Atom Catalytic Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone (NMP) as the carbon source, &#63743;P&#63742;N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers can be synthesized by NMP&#8211;P2O5 interaction, serving as a superior support to build the single&#8208;atom catalyst for hydrosilylation. Since NMP itself is an outstanding solvent, it is possible to regulate the structure of the carbon nanofibers by dissolving other chemicals/materials.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have become a popular choice in various catalysis applications, as they take advantages of both homogeneous catalysis (e.g., high efficiency) and heterogeneous catalysis (e.g., easy catalyst recovery). The atom support plays an indispensable role in anchoring atomic species and interplaying with them for ultimate catalytic performance. Therefore, development of new support materials for superior catalysis is of great importance. Here the synthesis of carbon nanofibers based on the reaction between phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) and N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone (NMP) is reported. The underlying reaction process is systematically investigated by Fourier&#8208;transform infrared&#160;(FTIR) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The carbon nanofibers have interesting &#63743;P&#63742;N&#63743; units in their chemical structure, which act as anchoring sites for the single&#8208;atom catalyst. The Pt atoms anchoring carbon nanofibers exhibit high activity for hydrosilylation with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 9.2&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;h&#8722;1 and a selectivity of &gt;99%. This research affords not only a new in situ chemical strategy to synthesize multiatom doped carbon nanofibers but also presents a potential superior support in catalysis, which opens a hopeful window in materials chemistry and catalysis applications.

The carbon nanofibers have interesting &lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;P&#63742;N&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt; units in their chemical structure, which act as anchoring sites for the single-atom catalyst. The Pt atoms anchoring carbon nanofibers exhibit high activity for hydrosilylation with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 9.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a selectivity of &amp;gt;99%. This research affords not only a new in situ chemical strategy to synthesize multiatom doped carbon nanofibers but also presents a potential superior support in catalysis, which opens a hopeful window in materials chemistry and catalysis applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Amphiphilic Pyridinium Salt and Its Application in the Visualization of Level 3 Details in Latent Fingerprints</title>

Abstract
Organic luminescent materials that can simultaneously achieve multimode mechanochromism and its water&#8208;vapor&#8208;induced recovery are desirable for practical applications but rarely reported. Herein, an amphiphilic compound, 4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;1&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium bromide (CPAB), was designed by integrating a lipophilic aromatic unit and hydrophilic end in the molecular architecture. Self&#8208;recovered mechanochromism from brown to cyan was observed upon mechanical grinding in air. Comprehensive research by X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal analysis revealed that the photoluminescence switch originated from the variation in intermolecular hydrogen bonds and molecular packing mode. The amphiphilic nature of CPAB allowed water molecules to enter the crystalline lattice, forming two polymorphs of the crystalline phase, namely CPAB&#8208;D and CPAB&#8208;W. The hydrosoluble CPAB exhibited excellent capability in probing the level 3 details of fingerprints because its lipophilic part could target the fatty acid residues of fingerprints, leading to strong aggregation&#8208;induced fluorescence. The research may inspire the design of latent fingerprint developers and application in forensics/anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Multileveled Hierarchical Hydrogel with Continuous Biophysical and Biochemical Gradients for Enhanced Repair of Full&#8208;thickness Osteochondral Defect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The repair of hierarchical osteochondral defect requires sophisticated gradient reestablishment; however, few current strategies for continuous gradient casting consider the relevance to clinical practice regarding cell adaptability, multiple gradient elements, and precise gradient mirroring native tissue. Here, a hydrogel with continuous gradients in nano&#8208;hydroxyapatite (HA) content, mechanical, and magnetism are developed using synthesized superparamagnetic HA nanorods (MagHA) that easily respond to a brief magnetic field. To precisely reconstruct osteochondral tissue, we calculate the optimized gradient mode according to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of healthy rabbit knees. Then, MagHA are patterned to form an evidence&#8208;based gradient, consequently generating incremental HA, mechanical, and electromagnetic cues under an external magnetic stimulus from top to bottom matching cartilage&#8208;bone interface. To make such depth&#8208;dependent biocues work, an adaptable hydrogel is developed to conform to cell infiltration. Furthermore, this approach is applied in rabbit full&#8208;thickness osteochondral defects equipped with a local magnetic field. Surprisingly, this multileveled gradient hydrogel repairs osteochondral unit in a perfect heterogeneous feature, which mimics the gradual cartilage&#8208;to&#8208;subchondral transition. Collectively, this is the first study that combines an adaptable hydrogel with magneto&#8208;driven MagHA gradients to achieve promising outcomes in osteochondral regeneration.

         <title>Topology Hierarchy of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides Built from Quantum Spin Hall Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The evolution of the physical properties of two&#8208;dimensional material from monolayer limit to the bulk reveals unique consequences from dimension confinement and provides a distinct tuning knob for applications. Monolayer 1T&#8217;&#8208;phase transition metal dichalcogenides (1T&#8217;&#8208;TMDs) with ubiquitous quantum spin Hall (QSH) states are ideal two&#8208;dimensional building blocks of various three&#8208;dimensional topological phases. However, the stacking geometry was previously limited to the bulk 1T&#8217;&#8208;WTe2 type. Here, we introduce the novel 2M&#8208;TMDs consisting of translationally stacked 1T&#8217;&#8208;monolayers as promising material platforms with tunable inverted bandgaps and interlayer coupling. By performing advanced polarization&#8208;dependent angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy as well as first&#8208;principles calculations on the electronic structure of 2M&#8208;TMDs, we revealed a topology hierarchy: 2M&#8208;WSe2, MoS2, and MoSe2 are weak topological insulators (WTIs), whereas 2M&#8208;WS2 is a strong topological insulator (STI). Further demonstration of topological phase transitions by tunning interlayer distance indicates that band inversion amplitude and interlayer coupling jointly determine different topological states in 2M&#8208;TMDs. We propose that 2M&#8208;TMDs are parent compounds of various exotic phases including topological superconductors and promise great application potentials in quantum electronics due to their flexibility in patterning with two&#8208;dimensional materials.

Abstract
The zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) have been well&#8208;documented as an excellent electron transport layer (ETL) in optoelectronic devices. However, the intrinsic surface flaw of the ZnO NPs can easily result in serious surface recombination of carriers. Exploring effective passivation methods of ZnO NPs is essential to maximize the device performance. Herein, we for the first time explore a hybrid strategy to improve the quality of ZnO ETL by incorporating stable organic open&#8208;shell donor&#8208;acceptor type diradicaloids. The high electron&#8208;donating feature of the diradical molecules can efficiently passivate the deep&#8208;level trap states and improve the conductivity of ZnO NP film. The unique advantage of the radical strategy is that its passivation effectiveness is highly correlated with the electron&#8208;donating ability of radical molecules, which can be precisely controlled by the rational design of molecular chemical structures. The well&#8208;passivated ZnO ETL is applied in lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solar cells, delivering a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.54%. More importantly, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, this work will inspire the exploration of general strategies using radical molecules to construct high&#8208;efficiency solution&#8208;processed optoelectronic devices.

Abstract
The limited selection pool of high&#8208;performance wide band gap (WBG) polymer donors is a bottleneck problem of the nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) based organic solar cells (OSCs) that impedes the further improvement of their photovoltaic performances. Herein, a series of new WBG polymers, namely PH&#8208;BTz, PS&#8208;BTz, PF&#8208;BTz, and PCl&#8208;BTz, were developed by using the bicyclic difluoro&#8208;benzo[d]thiazole (BTz) as the acceptor block and benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (BDT) derivatives as the donor units. By introducing S, F and Cl atoms to the alkylthienyl sidechains on BDT, the resulting polymers exhibited lowered energy levels and enhanced aggregation properties. The fluorinated PBTz&#8208;F not only exhibited a low&#8208;lying HOMO level, but also had stronger face&#8208;on packing order and resulted in more uniform fibril&#8208;like interpenetrating networks in the related PF&#8208;BTz:L8&#8208;BO blend. A high&#8208;power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.57% was achieved. Moreover, PBTz&#8208;F also exhibited a good batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility and general applicability. In addition, ternary blend OSCs based on the host PBTz&#8208;F:L8&#8208;BO blend and PM6 guest donor exhibited a further enhanced PCE of 19.54%, which is among the highest values of OSCs.

Abstract
Metallo&#8208;modulation cell death strategies have been extensively investigated for antitumor therapy, such as cuproptosis, ferroptosis, chemodynamic therapy (CDT), etc. Undoubtedly, the accurate and specific elevation of metal ions levels in cancer cells is key to boosting the therapeutic index of these strategies. Herein, a programmably controllable delivery system is developed based on croconium dye (Croc)&#8208;ferrous ion (Fe2+) nanoprobes (denoted as CFNPs) for multiscale dynamic imaging guided photothermal primed CDT. The Croc with kinds of electron&#8208;rich iron&#8208;chelating groups can form the Croc&#8208;Fe2+ complex with a precise stoichiometry of 1:1 to steadily maintain the valence state of Fe2+. The CFNPs could achieve pH&#8208;responsive visualization of cancerous tissues, and accurate release of Fe2+ in tumor tissues under the coactivation of &#8220;dual&#8208;key&#8221; stimulation of &#8220;acidity and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8221;. The acidic tumor microenvironment actuates NIR fluorescence/photoacoustic imaging and photothermal properties of CFNPs. Sequentially, under exogenous NIR light, the CFNPs enable the in vivo accurate visualization of Croc&#8208;Fe2+ complex delivery for photothermal primed Fe2+ release, thus achieving CDT of tumors. By leveraging multiscale dynamic imaging technologies, we not only sketch the complicated spatiotemporal release of Fe2+ in a programmably controllable manner, but also reveal the domino effect of tumor pH level, photothermal effect, and CDT, endowing the customized feedback of therapeutic panorama within disease microenvironment.

         <title>Hydrogel with Robust Adhesion in Various Liquid Environments by Electrostatic&#8208;Induced Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Polymer Chains Migration and Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pressure&#8208;sensitive hydrogel exhibits robust adhesion in aqueous solution and oil environments by electrostatic&#8208;induced hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer chains migration and rearrangement, which realizes the removal of the interfacial liquid layer and the effective interfacial bonding during wet adhesion. This polymer&#8208;chains&#8208;regulated hydrogel provides a new strategy for adhesion in liquid environments, broadening the application scenarios of adhesives.








Abstract
Hydrogels with wet adhesion are promising interfacial adhesive materials; however, their adhesion in water, oil, or organic solvents remains a major challenge. To address this, a pressure&#8208;sensitive P(AAm&#8208;co&#8208;C18)/PTA&#8208;Fe hydrogel is fabricated, which exhibits robust adhesion to various substrates in both aqueous solutions and oil environments. It is demonstrated that the key to wet adhesion under liquid conditions is the removal of the interfacial liquid, which can be achieved through rational molecular composition regulation. By complexing with hydrophilic polymer networks, phosphotungstic acid (PTA) is introduced into the hydrogel network as a physical cross&#8208;linker and anchor point to improve the cohesion strength and drive the migration of polymer chains. The migration and rearrangement of hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer chains on the hydrogel surface are induced by the electrostatic interactions of Fe3+, which create a surface with interfacial water&#8208; and oil&#8208;removing properties. By co&#8208;regulating the hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer chains, the P(AAm&#8208;co&#8208;C18)/PTA&#8208;Fe hydrogel is able to act as a pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesive under water and oils with adhesion strength of 92.6 and 90.0&#160;kPa, respectively. It is anticipated that this regulation strategy for polymer chains will promote the development of wet adhesion hydrogels, which can have a wide range of applications.

         <title>Dynamically Interfacial pH&#8208;Buffering Effect Enabled by N&#8208;Methylimidazole Molecules as Spontaneous Proton Pumps toward Highly Reversible Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamically interfacial pH&#8208;buffering strategy implemented by N&#8208;methylimidazole (NMI) which acts as a spontaneous proton pump, is proposed to remove the detrimental OH&#8722; at zinc/electrolyte interface in real&#8208;time. An in situ interfacial pH detection method with micro&#8208;sized spatial resolution based on the ultra&#8208;microelectrode technology is developed to probe pH evolution in the diffusion layer.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries have attracted extensive attention due to their outstanding merits of high safety and low cost. However, the intrinsic thermodynamic instability of zinc in aqueous electrolyte inevitably results in hydrogen evolution, and the consequent generation of OH&#8722; at the interface will dramatically exacerbate the formation of dead zinc and dendrites. Herein, a dynamically interfacial pH&#8208;buffering strategy implemented by N&#8208;methylimidazole (NMI) additive is proposed to remove the detrimental OH&#8722; at zinc/electrolyte interface in real&#8208;time, thus eliminating the accumulation of by&#8208;products fundamentally. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and molecular dynamics simulation results reveal the existence of an interfacial absorption layer assembled by NMI and protonated NMI (NMIH+), which acts as an ion pump for replenishing the interface with protons constantly. Moreover, an in situ interfacial pH detection method with micro&#8208;sized spatial resolution based on the ultra&#8208;microelectrode technology is developed to probe the pH evolution in diffusion layer, confirming the stabilized interfacial chemical environment in NMI&#8208;containing electrolyte. Accordingly, with the existence of NMI, an excellent cumulative plating capacity of 4.2 Ah cm&#8722;2 and ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency of 99.74% are realized for zinc electrodes. Meanwhile, the NMI/NMIH+ buffer additive can accelerate the dissolution/deposition process of MnO2/Mn2+ on the cathode, leading to enhanced cycling capacity.

         <title>Encapsulating High&#8208;Temperature Superconducting Twisted van der Waals Heterostructures Blocks Detrimental Effects of Disorder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method of fabricating high&#8208;temperature&#8208;superconductor&#8208;based van der Waals heterostructures is reported. The novel method utilizing the encapsulating heterostructure's interface overcomes detrimental effects of disorder and enables crucial improvement of the characteristics of the Josephson junction constituting the core of the proposed van der Waals material. The designed heterostructures operating at elevated temperatures holds potential for emerging quantum technologies.








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature cuprate superconductors based van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures hold high technological promise. One of the obstacles hindering their progress is the detrimental effect of disorder on the properties of the vdW&#8208;devices&#8208;based Josephson junctions (JJs). Here, a new method of fabricating twisted vdW heterostructures made of Bi2Sr2CuCa2O8+&#948;, crucially improving the JJ characteristics and pushing them up to those of the intrinsic JJs in bulk samples, is reported. The method combines cryogenic stacking using a solvent&#8208;free stencil mask technique and covering the interface by insulating hexagonal boron nitride crystals. Despite the high&#8208;vacuum condition down to 10&#8722;6 mbar in the evaporation chamber, the interface appears to be protected from water molecules during the in situ metal deposition only when fully encapsulated. Comparing the current&#8211;voltage curves of encapsulated and unencapsulated interfaces, it is revealed that the encapsulated interfaces&#8217; characteristics are crucially improved, so that the corresponding JJs demonstrate high critical currents and sharpness of the superconducting transition comparable to those of the intrinsic JJs. Finally, it is shown that the encapsulated heterostructures are more stable over&#160;time.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To obtain exceptional performance for industrial water splitting at high current densities, Pt&#8208;quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;modified NiFe layered double hydroxides are designed. Benefiting from optimized mass transfer and enhanced hydrogen release, its mass activity is 2.7 times higher than that of 40% Pt/C in hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Suitable electrocatalysts for industrial water splitting can veritably promote practical hydrogen applications. Rational surface design is exceptionally significant for electrocatalysts to bridge the gap between fundamental science and industrial expectation in water splitting. Here, Pt&#8208;quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;modified sulfur&#8208;doped NiFe layered double hydroxides (Pt@S&#8211;NiFe LDHs) are designed with eximious catalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under industrial&#160;condition. Benefiting from enhanced binding energy, mass transfer, and hydrogen release, Pt@S&#8211;NiFe LDHs exhibit outstanding activity in HER at high current densities. Notably, it obtains an impressively low overpotential of 71&#160;mV and long&#8208;term stability of 200 h at 100 mA cm&#8722;2, exceeding commercial 40% Pt/C and most reported Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Its mass activity is 2.7 times higher than that of 40% Pt/C with an overpotential of 100 mV. Furthermore, at industrial temperature (65&#160;&#176;C), the electrolyzer based on Pt@S&#8211;NiFe LDH needs just 1.62 V to reach the current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, superior to that of the commercial one of 40% Pt/C//IrO2.

     alt="Pt-Quantum-Dot-Modified Sulfur-Doped NiFe Layered Double Hydroxide for High-Current-Density Alkaline Water Splitting at Industrial Temperature"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To obtain exceptional performance for industrial water splitting at high current densities, Pt-quantum-dot-modified NiFe layered double hydroxides are designed. Benefiting from optimized mass transfer and enhanced hydrogen release, its mass activity is 2.7 times higher than that of 40% Pt/C in hydrogen evolution reaction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suitable electrocatalysts for industrial water splitting can veritably promote practical hydrogen applications. Rational surface design is exceptionally significant for electrocatalysts to bridge the gap between fundamental science and industrial expectation in water splitting. Here, Pt-quantum-dot-modified sulfur-doped NiFe layered double hydroxides (Pt@S&#8211;NiFe LDHs) are designed with eximious catalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under industrial&#160;condition. Benefiting from enhanced binding energy, mass transfer, and hydrogen release, Pt@S&#8211;NiFe LDHs exhibit outstanding activity in HER at high current densities. Notably, it obtains an impressively low overpotential of 71&#160;mV and long-term stability of 200 h at 100 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, exceeding commercial 40% Pt/C and most reported Pt-based electrocatalysts. Its mass activity is 2.7 times higher than that of 40% Pt/C with an overpotential of 100 mV. Furthermore, at industrial temperature (65&#160;&#176;C), the electrolyzer based on Pt@S&#8211;NiFe LDH needs just 1.62 V to reach the current density of 100&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, superior to that of the commercial one of 40% Pt/C//IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This work provides rational ideas to develop electrocatalysts with exceptional performance for industrial high-temperature water splitting at high current densities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Freshwater scarcity is a global challenge posing threats to the lives and daily activities of humankind such that two&#8208;thirds of the global population currently experience water shortages. Atmospheric water, irrespective of geographical location, is considered as an alternative water source. Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) has recently emerged as an efficient strategy for decentralized water production. SAWH thus opens up a self&#8208;sustaining source of freshwater that can potentially support the global population for various applications. In this review, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of SAWH, considering its operation principle, thermodynamic analysis, energy assessment, materials, components, different designs, productivity improvement, scale&#8208;up, and application for drinking water are first extensively explored. Thereafter, the practical integration and potential application of SAWH, beyond drinking water, for wide range of utilities in agriculture, fuel/electricity production, thermal management in building services, electronic devices, and textile are comprehensively discussed. The various strategies to reduce human reliance on natural water resources by integrating SAWH into existing technologies, particularly in underdeveloped countries, in order to satisfy the interconnected needs for food, energy, and water are also examined. This study further highlights the urgent need and future research directions to intensify the design and development of hybrid&#8208;SAWH systems for sustainability and diverse applications.

         <title>Achieving Ferroelectricity in a Centrosymmetric High&#8208;Performance Semiconductor by Strain Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Phase engineering by strain in 2D semiconductors is of great importance for a variety of applications. Here, we present a study of the strain&#8208;induced ferroelectric (FE) transition in bismuth oxyselenide (Bi2O2Se) films, a high&#8208;performance (HP) semiconductor for next&#8208;generation electronics. Bi2O2Se is not FE at ambient pressure. At a loading force of &#8819; 400 nN, the piezoelectric force responses exhibit butterfly loops in magnitude and 180o phase switching. By carefully ruling out extrinsic factors, these features are attributed to a transition to the FE phase. The transition is further supported by the appearance of a sharp peak in optical second harmonic generation under uniaxial strain. In general, solids with paraelectrics at ambient pressure and FE under strain are rare. The FE transition is discussed using first&#8208;principles calculations and theoretical simulations. The switching of FE polarization acts as a knob for Schottky barrier engineering at contacts and serves as the basis for a memristor with a huge on/off current ratio of 106. Our work adds a new degree of freedom to a HP electronic/optoelectronic semiconductor, and the integration of FE and HP semiconductivity paves the way for many exciting functionalities, including HP neuromorphic computing and bulk&#160;piezophotovoltaics.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Quenching NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;Aggregates of Benzo[c]thiophene Fluorophore for Highly Efficient Bioimaging and Phototheranostics</title>

Abstract
Molecular fluorophores with the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emission hold great potential for deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging owing to their excellent biocompatibility and high resolution. Recently, J&#8208;aggregates are used to construct long&#8208;wavelength NIR&#8208;II emitters as their optical bands show remarkable red shifts upon forming water&#8208;dispersible nano&#8208;aggregates. However, their wide applications in the NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging are impeded by the limited varieties of J&#8208;type backbone and serious fluorescence quenching. Herein, we report a bright benzo[c]thiophene (BT) J&#8208;aggregate fluorophore (BT6) with anti&#8208;quenching effect for highly efficient NIR&#8208;II bioimaging and phototheranostics. The BT fluorophores are manipulated to have Stokes shift over 400&#160;nm and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property for conquering the self&#8208;quenching issue of the J&#8208;type fluorophores. Upon forming BT6 assemblies in an aqueous environment, the absorption over 800&#160;nm and NIR&#8208;II emission over 1000&#160;nm are boosted for more than 41 and 26 folds, respectively. In vivo visualization of the whole&#8208;body blood vessel and imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy results verify that BT6 NPs are excellent agent for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and cancer phototheranostics. This work develops a strategy to construct bright NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates with precisely manipulated anti&#8208;quenching properties for highly efficient biomedical applications.

         <title>Achieving high quantum efficiency broadband NIR Mg4Ta2O9:Cr3+ phosphor through lithium ion compensation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ultra&#8208;efficient broadband near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs) are urgently needed to improve the detection sensitivity and spatial resolution of current smart NIR spectroscopy&#8208;based techniques. Nonetheless, the performance of NIR pc&#8208;LED have severely limited owing to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) bottleneck of NIR light&#8208;emitting materials. Herein, we advantageously modified a blue LED excitable Cr3+&#8208;doped tetramagnesium ditalate (Mg4Ta2O9, MT) phosphor through lithium ion as a key efficient broadband NIR emitter to achieve high optical output power of NIR light source. The emission spectrum encompasses the 700&#8211;1300&#160;nm electromagnetic spectrum of first biological window (&#955;max = 842&#160;nm) with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of &#8764;2280 cm&#8722;1 (&#8764;167&#160;nm), and achieves a record EQE of 61.25% detected at 450&#160;nm excitation through Li&#8208;ion compensation. A prototype NIR pc&#8208;LED was fabricated with MT:Cr3+, Li+ to evaluate its potential practical application, which revealed a NIR output power of 53.22&#160;mW at a driving current of 100&#160;mA, and a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 25.09% at 10&#160;mA. This work provides an ultra&#8208;efficient broadband NIR luminescent material, which shows great promise in practical applications and presents a novel option for the next generation of high&#8208;power compact NIR light sources.

         <title>Interface Engineering for Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have made dramatic advancements during the past decades owing to the innovative material design and device structure optimization, with power conversion efficiencies surpassing 19% and 20% for single&#8208;junction and tandem devices, respectively. Interface engineering, by modifying interface properties between different layers for OSCs, has become a vital part to promote the device efficiency. It is essential to elucidate the intrinsic working mechanism of interface layers, as well as the related physical and chemical processes that manipulate device performance and long&#8208;term stability. In this article, the advances in interface engineering aimed to pursue high&#8208;performance OSCs were reviewed. The specific functions and corresponding design principles of interface layers were summarized firstly. Then we discussed the anode interface layer (AIL), cathode interface layer (CIL) in single&#8208;junction OSCs, and interconnecting layer (ICL) of tandem devices in separate categories and analyzed the interface engineering&#8208;related improvements on device efficiency and stability. Finally, the challenges and prospects associated with application of interface engineering were discussed with the emphasis on large&#8208;area, high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost device manufacturing.

Then we discussed the anode interface layer (AIL), cathode interface layer (CIL) in single-junction OSCs, and interconnecting layer (ICL) of tandem devices in separate categories and analyzed the interface engineering-related improvements on device efficiency and stability. Finally, the challenges and prospects associated with application of interface engineering were discussed with the emphasis on large-area, high-performance and low-cost device manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>PIP2 Alteration Caused by Elastic Modulus and Tropism of Electrospun Scaffolds Facilitates Altered BMSCs Proliferation and Differentiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Aligned submicron fibers have played an essential role in inducing stem cell proliferation and differentiation in tissue engineering. However, it remains challenging to fully understand and modify the differences between stem cell proliferation and differentiation on aligned&#8208;random fibers. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to identify the differential causes of stem cell proliferation and differentiation between BMSCs on aligned&#8208;random fibers with different elastic modulus, and to change the differential levels between them through a regulatory mechanism mediated by BCL&#8208;6 and miR&#8208;126&#8208;5p. The results showed that the most significant PIP2 alterations were found in the aligned fibers compared with the random fibers, which had a regular and oriented structure, excellent elastic modulus and cytocompatibility, regular cytoskeleton and movement pattern, high differentiation potential, and the most differentiated PIP2 gene. The same trend was actual for the aligned fibers with a lower elastic modulus. The level of proliferative differentiation genes in cells on random fibers and high elastic modulus aligned fibers was altered by BCL&#8208;6 and miR&#8208;126&#8208;5p mediated regulatory mechanisms to make the apparent cell distribution nearly consistent with the cell state on low elastic modulus aligned fibers. This work demonstrates the reason for the difference of cells between the two kinds of fibers and on fibers with different elastic modulus. It provides more insights for understanding the gene&#8208;level regulation of cell growth in tissue engineering. These findings will greatly help the application and design of 3D tissue culture for tissue engineering.

         <title>Towards High Conversion Efficiency of Thermoelectric Modules Through Synergistical Optimization of Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Waste&#8208;heat electricity generation using high&#8208;efficiency solid&#8208;state conversion technology can significantly decrease dependence on fossil fuels. In this paper, we report a synergistical optimization of layered half&#8208;Heusler (hH) materials and module to improve thermoelectric conversion efficiency. This was realized by manufacturing multiple thermoelectric materials with major compositional variations and temperature&#8208;gradient&#8208;coupled carrier distribution by one&#8208;step spark plasma sintering. This strategy provides a solution to overcome the intrinsic concomitants of the conventional segmented architecture that only considers the matching of the figure of merit (zT) with the temperature gradient. The current design is dedicated to temperature&#8208;gradient coupled resistivity and compatibility matching, optimum zT matching, and reducing contact resistance sources. By enhancing the quality factor of the materials by Sb&#8208;vapor pressure&#8208;induced annealing, a superior zT of 1.47 at 973 K was achieved for (Nb, Hf)FeSb hH alloys. Along with the low&#8208;temperature high&#8208;zT hH alloys of (Nb, Ta, Ti, V)FeSb, the single stage layered hH modules were developed with efficiencies of &#8764;15.2% and &#8764;13.5% for the single&#8208;leg and unicouple thermoelectric modules, respectively, under &#916;T of 670 K. Therefore, this work has a transformative impact on the design and development of next&#8208;generation thermoelectric generators for any thermoelectric materials families.

&lt;p&gt;Waste-heat electricity generation using high-efficiency solid-state conversion technology can significantly decrease dependence on fossil fuels. In this paper, we report a synergistical optimization of layered half-Heusler (hH) materials and module to improve thermoelectric conversion efficiency. This was realized by manufacturing multiple thermoelectric materials with major compositional variations and temperature-gradient-coupled carrier distribution by one-step spark plasma sintering.

         <title>Two Functions from a Single Photoresist: Tuning Microstructure Degradability from Light&#8208;Stabilized Dynamic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We introduce a photoresist &#8212; based on a light&#8208;stabilized dynamic material driven by an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium photo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of triazolinediones with naphthalenes &#8212; whose ability to intrinsically degrade post&#8208;printing can be tuned by a simple adjustment of laser intensity during 3D laser lithography. Our resist's ability to form stable networks under green light irradiation that degrade in the dark was transformed into a tuneable degradable 3D printing materials platform. In&#8208;depth characterization of the printed microstructures via AFM before and during degradation revealed the high dependency of the final structures&#8217; properties on the writing parameters. Upon identifying the ideal writing parameters and their effect on the network structure, we are able to selectively toggle between stable and fully degradable structures simplifying the direct laser writing manufacturing process of multi&#8208;functional materials significantly, which typically requires the use of separate resists and consecutive writing efforts to achieve degradable and non&#8208;degradable material sections.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The interface tailoring is crucial for the efficiency and stability of Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs). The reported interface engineering primarily focuses on the energy level turning and trap states passivation to improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. In this review, we have classified molecule modifications according to the basics of electron transfer mechanisms for the interface tailoring of materials. An in&#8208;depth analysis of energy level modification and trap passivation, as well as the universal the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method employed in interface tailoring. In addition, strategies to address environmental protection and large&#8208;scale mini&#8208;modules fabrication by interface engineering are also discussed. This review will guide the researchers in understanding interface engineering to design interface materials for efficient, stable, and eco&#8208;friendly PSCs.

         <title>Unraveling the Plasma Protein Corona by Ultrasonic Cavitation Augments Active&#8208;Transporting of Liposome in Solid Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transcytosis&#8208;targeting peptide&#8208;decorated reconfigurable liposome (LPGL) is capable of ultrasound&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly and protein&#8208;corona decortication. Ultrasound irradiation induces size&#8208;transformation of the LPGL and decorticates the surface protein corona by lipid membrane reassembly, whereby the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization is regained, ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis is initiated, and efficient tumor accumulation and penetration is achieved, leading to potent antitumor activity.








Abstract
Ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated targeted drug delivery has been widely recognized as a promising strategy for improving the clinical efficacy of&#160;nanomedicines but is attenuated by the binding of plasma protein on the surface of nanoparticles to form a protein corona. Here, it is shown that ultrasonic cavitation can be used to unravel surface plasma coronas on liposomal nanoparticles through ultrasound (US)&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method, transcytosis&#8208;targeting&#8208;peptide&#8208;decorated reconfigurable liposomes (LPGLs) loaded with gemcitabine (GEM) and perfluoropentane (PFP) are developed for cancer&#8208;targeted therapy. In the blood circulation, the targeting peptides are deactivated by the plasma corona and lose their targeting capability. Once they reach tumor blood vessels, US irradiation induces transformation of the LPGLs from nanodrops into microbubbles via liquid&#8211;gas phase transition and decorticate the surface corona by reassembly of the lipid membrane. The activated liposomes regain the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization, initiate ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis, achieve efficient tumor accumulation and penetration, and lead to potent antitumor activity in multiple tumor models of patient&#8208;derived tumor xenografts. This study presents an effective strategy to tackle the fluid biological barriers of the protein corona and develop transcytosis&#8208;targeting liposomes for active tumor transport and efficient cancer therapy.

Ultrasound irradiation induces size-transformation of the LPGL and decorticates the surface protein corona by lipid membrane reassembly, whereby the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization is regained, ligand/receptor-mediated transcytosis is initiated, and efficient tumor accumulation and penetration is achieved, leading to potent antitumor activity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ligand/receptor-mediated targeted drug delivery has been widely recognized as a promising strategy for improving the clinical efficacy of&#160;nanomedicines but is attenuated by the binding of plasma protein on the surface of nanoparticles to form a protein corona. Here, it is shown that ultrasonic cavitation can be used to unravel surface plasma coronas on liposomal nanoparticles through ultrasound (US)-induced liposomal reassembly. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method, transcytosis-targeting-peptide-decorated reconfigurable liposomes (LPGLs) loaded with gemcitabine (GEM) and perfluoropentane (PFP) are developed for cancer-targeted therapy. In the blood circulation, the targeting peptides are deactivated by the plasma corona and lose their targeting capability. Once they reach tumor blood vessels, US irradiation induces transformation of the LPGLs from nanodrops into microbubbles via liquid&#8211;gas phase transition and decorticate the surface corona by reassembly of the lipid membrane. The activated liposomes regain the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization, initiate ligand/receptor-mediated transcytosis, achieve efficient tumor accumulation and penetration, and lead to potent antitumor activity in multiple tumor models of patient-derived tumor xenografts. This study presents an effective strategy to tackle the fluid biological barriers of the protein corona and develop transcytosis-targeting liposomes for active tumor transport and efficient cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Realizing Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Bactericidal Capability through the Phonon&#8211;Electron Coupling Effect Using Two&#8208;Dimensional Catalytic Planar Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D catalytic planar defects have been rationally designed and engineered for reversing the ultrasonic silence of Ti3C2, dramatically realizing the highly efficient sonodynamic bactericidal therapy. It is unveiled that the electron's origin, electron transfer, and the visible O2&#160;activation pathway triggered by ultrasound are attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect.








Abstract
Conferring catalytic defects in sonosensitizers is of paramount importance in reinforcing sonodynamic therapy. However, the formation of such 0D defects is governed by the Schottky defect principle. Herein, 2D catalytic planar defects are designed within Ti3C2&#160;sheets to address this challenge. These specific planar slip dislocations with abundant Ti3+ species (Ti3C2&#8208;SD(Ti3+)) can yield surface&#8208;bound O due to the effective activation of O2, thus resulting in a substantial amount of 1O2&#160;generation and the 99.72%&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03% bactericidal capability subject to ultrasound (US) stimulation. It is discovered that the 2D catalytic planar defects can intervene in electron transfer through the phonon drag effect&#8212;a coupling effect between surface electrons and US&#8208;triggered phonons&#8212;that simultaneously contributes to a dramatic decrease in O2&#160;activation energy from 1.65&#160;to 0.06&#160;eV. This design has achieved a qualitative leap in which the US catalytic site has transformed from 0D to 2D. Moreover, it is revealed that the electron origin, electron transfer, and visible O2&#160;activation pathway triggered by US can be attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect. After coating with neutrophil membrane (NM) proteins, the NM&#8208;Ti3C2&#8208;SD(Ti3+) sheets further demonstrate a 6&#8208;log10&#160;reduction in methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus burden in the infected bony tissue.

         <title>Highly Stretchable and Biocompatible Wrinkled Nanoclay&#8208;Composite Hydrogel With Enhanced Sensing Capability for Precise Detection of Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bioinspired nanoclay&#8208;composite wrinkled hydrogel sensor is developed with excellent mechanical and biocompatible properties and high and reliable sensing capacity due to the structural&#8211;mechanical&#8211;electrical integrity of the wrinkle micropattern and nanoclay&#8208;reinforced interpenetrating crosslinked network. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, this hydrogel sensor can accurately localize the region where myocardial infarction occurs, showing promise for real&#8208;time monitoring of pathological heart tissue.








Abstract
It is challenging to balance high biocompability with good mechanical&#8211;electrical sensing performance, especially when triggering inflammatory stress response after in vivo implantation. Herein, a bioinspired wrinkle&#8208;reinforced adaptive nanoclay&#8208;interlocked soft strain&#8208;sensor based on a highly stretchable and elastic ionic&#8208;conductive hydrogel is reported. This novel nanoclay&#8208;composite hydrogel exhibits excellent tensile properties and high sensing capacity with steady and reliable sensing performance due to the structural&#8211;mechanical&#8211;electrical integrity of the nanoclay crosslinked and nano&#8208;reinforced interpenetrating network. The incorporation of amphiphilic ions provides the hydrogel with significant protein resistance, reducing its non&#8208;specific adsorption to proteins upon implantation, improving its biosafety as an implanted device, and maintaining the authenticity of the sensing results. Based on the revealed sensing enhanced mechanism based on hierarchical ordered structures as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, this hydrogel sensor is demonstrated to be able to&#160;accurately localize the region where myocardial infarction occurs and may become a novel strategy for real&#8208;time monitoring of pathological changes in heart disease.

         <title>Synergistic Surface Modification of Tin&#8211;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic surface modification of mixed Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite films by the combination of piperazine and C60 pyrrolidine tris&#8208;acid realizes narrow&#8208;bandgap solar cells with power conversion efficiencies up to 22.7% and substantially elongated stability.








Abstract
Interfaces in thin&#8208;film photovoltaics play a pivotal role in determining device efficiency and longevity. In this work, the top surface treatment of mixed tin&#8211;lead (&#8776;1.26&#160;eV) halide perovskite films for p&#8211;i&#8211;n solar cells is studied. Charge extraction is promoted by treating the perovskite surface with piperazine. This compound reacts with the organic cations at the perovskite surface, modifying the surface structure and tuning the interfacial energy level alignment. In addition, the combined treatment with C60 pyrrolidine tris&#8208;acid (CPTA) reduces hysteresis and leads to efficiencies up to 22.7%, with open&#8208;circuit voltage values reaching 0.90&#160;V, &#8776;92% of the radiative limit for the bandgap of this material. The modified cells also show superior stability, with unencapsulated cells retaining 96% of their initial efficiency after &gt;2000 h of storage in N2 and encapsulated cells retaining 90% efficiency after &gt;450 h of storage in air. Intriguingly, CPTA preferentially binds to Sn2+ sites at film surface over Pb2+ due to the energetically favored exposure of the former, according to first&#8208;principles calculations. This work provides new insights into the surface chemistry of perovskite films in terms of their structural, electronic, and defect characteristics and this knowledge is used to fabricate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells.

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmion Transistor Gated with Voltage&#8208;Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor is presented using spatially uniform voltage&#8208;controlled magnetic anisotropy. A gate operation can control the translational motion of a magnetic skyrmion. Utilizing the gate&#8208;controlled skyrmion motion technique, the authors expect various skyrmion logic devices to be demonstrated in the future.








Abstract
The paradigm shift of information carriers from charge to spin has long been awaited in modern electronics. The invention of the spin&#8208;information transistor is expected to be an essential building block for the future development of spintronics. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor working at room temperature, which has never been demonstrated experimentally, is introduced. With the spatially uniform control of magnetic anisotropy, the shape and topology of a skyrmion when passing the controlled area can be maintained. The findings will open a new route toward the design and realization of skyrmion&#8208;based spintronic devices in the near future.

By synthesizing a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF and combining a ternary blending strategy, favorable phase separation morphology featuring more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance can be attained. A maximum power conversion efficiency of 18.2% (certified value of 17.7%) with excellent mechanical properties in all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic cells is demonstrated.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells possessing high photovoltaic performance and mechanical robustness are promising candidates for flexible wearable devices. However, developing photoactive materials with good mechanical properties and photovoltaic performance so far remains challenging. In this work, a polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF with a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight (Mw) is introduced to enable highly efficient all&#8208;polymer OPV cells featuring excellent mechanical reliability. By incorporating the high&#8208;Mw PBDB&#8208;TF as a third component into the PBQx&#8208;TF:PY&#8208;IT blend, the bulk heterojunction morphology is finely tuned with a more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, affording efficient pathways for charge transport as well as mechanical stress dissipation. Hence, all&#8208;polymer OPV cells based on the ternary blend film demonstrate a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2% with an outstanding fill factor of 0.796. The flexible OPV cell delivers a decent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability. These results present a promising strategy to address the mechanical properties and boost the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.

         <title>Engineered Switchable&#8208;Wettability Surfaces for Multi&#8208;Path Directional Transportation of Droplets and Subaqueous Bubbles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D dumbbell&#8208;patterned functional surface featured by switchable wettability is proposed to achieve the multi&#8208;path parallel directional transportation of both water droplets and subaqueous bubbles. This programmable, easy&#8208;fabricable, highly&#8208;efficient, and cost&#8208;effective fluidic system with strong robustness against structural defects is ready for versatile fluid transportation supporting both liquid&#8208; and gas&#8208;phase matters.








Abstract
Conventional engineered surfaces for fluid manipulation are hindered by the set wettability, and thus they can only achieve spontaneous transport of single&#8208;phase fluid, namely liquid or gas. Moreover, fluid transport systems that are robust to path defects have yet to be fully explored. Here, unprecedentedly, a universal wettability switching strategy is developed for achieving programmable directional transport of both droplets and subaqueous bubbles on a dumbbell&#8208;patterned functional surface (DPFS), featuring in strong robustness, high efficiency, and effective cost. By tuning the superwettability of DPFS through octadecyltrichlorosilane treatment and ultraviolet&#8208;C selective irradiation, the transport fluid can alternate between liquid and gas. The material's switchable superwettability regulates the fluid directed dynamics within the confined pattern, in which the sustaining fluid propelling relies on the surface energy difference between the starting and terminal sites. This enables the construction of multiple channels, which works synergistically with ultralow&#8208;volume&#8208;loss transport to impart the fluidic system with strong robustness against path defects. Underlying the completion of complex microfluidics tasks, spatially&#8208;selective cooling devices and subaqueous gas microreactors are successfully demonstrated. This energy&#8208;consumption&#8208;free fluid transport system opens a new avenue for on&#8208;chip programmable fluid manipulation, promoting innovative applications requiring rational control of two&#8208;phase fluid transport.

         <title>Efficient Red Light Emitting Diodes Based on a Zero&#8208;Dimensional Organic Antimony Halide Hybrid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly luminescent zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic antimony bromide hybrid containing semiconducting organic cation is developed for the first time, with which electrically driven red light emitting diodes (LEDs) are fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2 cd A&#8722;1.








Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have recently emerged as a new class of light emitting materials with exceptional color tunability. While near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs) are routinely obtained for a large number of 0D OMHHs, it remains challenging to apply them as emitter for electrically driven light emitting diodes (LEDs), largely due to the low conductivity of wide bandgap organic cations. Here, the development of a new OMHH, triphenyl(9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl) phosphonium antimony bromide (TPPcarzSbBr4), as emitter for efficient LEDs, which consists of semiconducting organic cations (TPPcarz+) and light emitting antimony bromide anions (Sb2Br82&#8722;), is reported. By replacing one of the phenyl groups in a well&#8208;known tetraphenylphosphonium cation (TPP+) with an electroactive phenylcarbazole group, a semiconducting TPPcarz+ cation is developed for the preparation of red emitting 0D TPPcarzSbBr4 single crystals with a high PLQE of 93.8%. With solution processed TPPcarzSbBr4 thin films (PLQE of 86.1%) as light emitting layer, red LEDs are fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2&#160;cd A&#8722;1, which are the best values reported to date for electroluminescence devices based on 0D OMHHs.

         <title>Construction of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films via Crosslinking&#8208;Induced Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small clusters in the early growth steps of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors (denoted as preMOFs) with good processibility. Then, the removal of solvents and modulators will trigger the crosslinking of preMOFs and lead to the formation of continuous MOF films.








Abstract
The construction of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films is a crucial step for integrating them into technical applications. However, due to the crystallization nature, it is difficult to grow most MOFs spontaneously or process them into films. Here, a convenient strategy is demonstrated for constructing MOF films by using modulators to achieve homogeneous assembly of MOF clusters. Small clusters in the early growth steps of MOFs can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors with good processibility. Then, simple removal of modulators will trigger the crosslinking of MOF clusters and lead to the formation of continuous films. This strategy is universal for the fabrication of several types of MOF films with large scale and controllable thickness, which can be deposited on a variety of substrates as well as can be patterned in micro/nano resolution. Additionally, versatile composite MOF films can be easily synthesized by introducing functional materials during the crosslinking process, which brings them broader application prospects.

Microscale combinatorial libraries are introduced as a new method for exploration of polyelemental material systems. Composition gradients of quinary material systems are produced and characterized for crystal properties and electrocatalytic activity. The small dimensions of microscale combinatorial libraries enable efficient screening of thousands of compositions. Highly active electrocatalysts are identified in the systems Ru&#8211;Rh&#8211;Pd&#8211;Ir&#8211;Pt and Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Mo&#8211;Pd&#8211;Pt.








Abstract
Polyelemental material systems, specifically high&#8208;entropy alloys, promise unprecedented properties. Due to almost unlimited combinatorial possibilities, their exploration and exploitation is hard. This challenge is addressed by co&#8208;sputtering combined with shadow masking to produce a multitude of microscale combinatorial libraries in one deposition process. These thin&#8208;film composition spreads on the microscale cover unprecedented compositional ranges of high&#8208;entropy alloy systems and enable high&#8208;throughput characterization of thousands of compositions for electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions using nanoscale scanning electrochemical cell microscopy. The exemplary exploration of the composition space of two high&#8208;entropy alloy systems provides electrocatalytic activity maps for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution as well as oxygen reduction reactions. Activity optima in the system Ru&#8211;Rh&#8211;Pd&#8211;Ir&#8211;Pt are identified, and active noble&#8208;metal lean compositions in the system Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Mo&#8211;Pd&#8211;Pt are discovered. This illustrates that the proposed microlibraries are a holistic discovery platform to master the multidimensionality challenge of polyelemental systems.

         <title>Unusual Spectrally Reproducible and High Q&#8208;Factor Random Lasing in Polycrystalline Tin Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly spectrally reproducible multimode random lasing is observed in thin polycrystalline films of tin iodide perovskite that cannot be explained by a strong mode localization. The observed spectral reproducibility can be due to the strong inhomogeneous broadening of photoluminescence spectra measured in tin&#8208;based perovskites on the basis of a comparison with an analogous Pb&#8208;based counterpart.








Abstract
An unusual spectrally reproducible near&#8208;IR random lasing (RL) with no fluctuation of lasing peak wavelength is disclosed in polycrystalline films of formamidinium tin triiodide perovskite, which have been chemically stabilized against Sn2+ to Sn4+ oxidation. Remarkably, a quality Q&#8208;factor as high as &#8776;104 with an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold as low as 2&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2 (both at 20&#160;K) are achieved. The observed spectral reproducibility is unprecedented for semiconductor thin film RL systems and cannot be explained by the strong spatial localization of lasing modes. Instead, it is suggested that the spectral stability is a result of such an unique property of Sn&#8208;based perovskites as a large inhomogeneous broadening of the emitting centers, which is a consequence of an intrinsic structural inhomogeneity of the material. Due to this, lasing can occur simultaneously in modes that are spatially strongly overlapped, as long as the spectral separation between the modes is larger than the homogeneous linewidth of the emitting centers. The discovered mechanism of RL spectral stability in semiconductor materials, possessing inhomogeneous broadening, opens up prospects for their practical use as cheap sources of narrow laser lines.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Organohydrogel Artificial Muscle with Compartmentalized Anisotropic Actuation Under Microdomain Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organohydrogel actuator achieving the combination of high speed, high actuation strength, and large material size is proposed. The water is confined in hydrophobic microdomains in organohydrogel, thus realizing a compartmentalization actuation mode similar to muscle. This strategy can break through the limitations that originated from the traditional solvent diffusion actuation mechanism, inspiring gel actuator design.








Abstract
Current hydrogel actuators mostly suffer from weak actuation strength and low responsive speed owing to their solvent diffusion&#8208;induced volume change mechanism. Here a skeletal muscle&#8208;inspired organohydrogel actuator is reported in which solvents are confined in hydrophobic microdomains. Organohydrogel actuator is driven by compartmentalized directional network deformation instead of volume change, avoiding the limitations that originate from solvent diffusion. Organohydrogel actuator has an actuation frequency of 0.11&#160;Hz, 110 times that of traditional solvent diffusion&#8208;driven hydrogel actuators (&lt;10&#8722;3&#160;Hz), and can lift more than 85 times their own weight. This design achieves the combination of high responsive speed, high actuation strength, and large material size, proposing a strategy to fabricate hydrogel actuators comparable with skeletal muscle performance.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Liquid Organic Precursor into 3D Laser&#8208;Induced Graphene Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A goal in graphene synthesis is to establish routes for preparing graphene materials from liquids instead of conventional solid or gaseous sources. This work reports the production of graphene materials with tunable composition directly from liquid precursor. A fundamentally new graphene 3D&#8208;printing system is further developed for constructing 3D graphene materials with high structural integrity unachievable by traditional printing strategy.








Abstract
Among the different states of matter, liquids have particular advantages in terms of easy handling and recycling, which has been manifested in various chemosynthetic reactions, but remains underexplored in graphene synthesis. This work reports the direct conversion of liquid organic precursor into versatile 3D graphene materials using rapid laser irradiation. The liquid precursor allows for easy fabrication of graphene with significant 3D architectures, including powders, patterned composite structures, and substrate&#8208;free films. Taking advantage of the high compatibility of liquid precursor with a wide range of dopants, the 3D graphene can be further engineered together with various functional components, especially the high loading (&#8776;15 wt.%) and well&#8208;dispersed (an average diameter of less than 50&#160;nm) high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles. Furthermore, combined with the 3D printing strategy, the rapid construction of graphene with complex and accurate 3D shapes is demonstrated via a selective in situ laser transforming (SLT) strategy. With the high structural integrity unachievable by traditional 3D printing methods, the obtained objects show an electrical conductivity of 4380 S&#160;m&#8722;1 and a compressive modulus of 31.8&#160;MPa. The results reported in this work will open up a new way for the fabrication of functional carbon materials with customizable shapes and components.

         <title>Bioengineering of High Cell Density Tissues with Hierarchical Vascular Networks for Ex Vivo Whole Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method is shown to fabricate an in vitro model of millimeter&#8208;sized scaffold&#8208;free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&#8722;1, corresponding to those of native tissues. The supply of oxygen and nutrition is extremely significant for such tissues. Therefore, a hierarchical vascular network containing capillaries and an artificial channel for perfusion are formed.








Abstract
The development of tissue&#8208;like structures such as cell sheets, spheroids, and organoids has contributed to progress in regenerative medicine. Simultaneous achievement of scale up and high cell density of these tissues is challenging because sufficient oxygen cannot be supplied to the inside of large, high cell density tissues. Here, in vitro fabrication of vessels to supply oxygen to the inside of millimeter&#8208;sized scaffold&#8208;free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&#8722;1, corresponding to those of native tissues, is shown. Hierarchical vascular networks by anastomosis of capillaries and a large vessel are essential for oxygen supply, whereas a large vessel or capillary networks alone make negligible contributions to the supply. The hierarchical vascular networks are formed by a top&#8208;down approach, which offers a new option for ex vivo whole organs without decellularization and 3D&#8208;bioprinting.

A simple small molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine is developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL&#8208;MCz) via a facile and low&#8208;temperature cross&#8208;linking technology. The device with CL&#8208;MCz yields a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.9% along with an extremely low energy loss down to 0.41 eV.








Abstract
Poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hole transport material (HTM) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, unsatisfied surface properties of PTAA and high energy disorder in the bulk film hinder the further enhancement of device performance. Herein, a simple small molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine (MCz&#8208;VPOZ) is strategically developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL&#8208;MCz) via a facile and low&#8208;temperature cross&#8208;linking technology. The resulting polymer CL&#8208;MCz offers high energy ordering and improved electrical conductivity, as well as appropriate energy&#8208;level alignment, enabling efficient charge carrier collection in the devices. Meanwhile, CL&#8208;MCz synchronously provides satisfied surface wettability and interfacial functionalization, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with fewer bulk iodine vacancies and suppressed carrier recombination. Significantly, the device with CL&#8208;MCz yields a champion efficiency of 23.9% along with an extremely low energy loss down to 0.41 eV, which represents the highest reported efficiency for non&#8208;PTAA&#8208;based polymer HTMs in inverted PSCs. Furthermore, the corresponding unencapsulated devices exhibit competitive shelf&#8208;life stability under various operational stressors up to 2500 h, reflecting high promises of CL&#8208;MCz in the scalable PSC application. This work underscores the promising potential of the cross&#8208;linking approach in preparing low&#8208;cost, stable, and efficient polymer HTMs toward reliable PSCs.

         <title>A New Class of Cluster&#8211;Matrix Nanocomposite Made of Fully Miscible Components</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prospect for creating highly metastable nanocomposite materials made from fully miscible alloy systems, like Ni&#8211;Cu, is opened. The cluster ion beam deposition technique allows stabilization of 2000&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;clusters in a Cu&#8208;matrix with varying macroscopic concentration. Consequently, unique magnetic and magnetotransport properties are evident as a function of cluster concentration and enthalpy&#8208;driven cluster dissolution.








Abstract
Nanocomposite materials, consisting of two or more phases, at least one of which has a nanoscale dimension, play a distinctive role in materials science because of the multiple possibilities for tailoring their structural properties and, consequently, their functionalities. In addition to the challenges of controlling the size, size distribution, and volume fraction of nanometer phases, thermodynamic stability conditions limit the choice of constituent materials. This study goes beyond this limitation by showing the possibility of achieving nanocomposites from a bimetallic system, which exhibits complete miscibility under equilibrium conditions. A series of nanocomposite samples with different compositions are synthesized by the co&#8208;deposition of 2000&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;clusters and a flux of Cu&#8208;atoms using a novel cluster ion beam deposition system. The retention of the metastable nanostructure is ascertained from atom probe tomography (APT), magnetometry, and magnetotransport studies. APT confirms the presence of nanoscale regions with &#8776;100 at% Ni. Magnetometry and magnetotransport studies reveal superparamagnetic behavior and magnetoresistance stemming from the single&#8208;domain ferromagnetic Ni&#8208;clusters embedded in the Cu&#8208;matrix. Essentially, the magnetic properties of the nanocomposites can be tailored by the precise control of the Ni concentration. The initial results offer a promising direction for future research on nanocomposites consisting of fully miscible elements.

         <title>Efficient Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells on Industrially Compatible Textured Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an anion&#8208;engineered additive strategy is reported to modify the crystallization process of perovskite films on industrially feasible double&#8208;side textured silicon, which enables conformal deposition with improved film crystallinity and reduced trap density. This allows the fabrication of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with efficiencies of 28.9% (certified efficiency of 27.9%) and 25.1% for areas of 1 and 16&#160;cm2, respectively.








Abstract
Monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells promise power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit of single&#8208;junction solar cells. The conformal deposition of perovskites on industrially feasible textured silicon solar cells allows for both lowered manufacturing costs and a higher matched photocurrent density, compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art tandems using front&#8208;side flat or mildly textured silicon. However, the inferior crystal quality of perovskite films grown on fully&#8208;textured silicon compromises the photovoltaic performance. Here, an anion&#8208;engineered additive strategy is developed to control the crystallization process of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite films, which enables improved film crystallinity, reduced trap density, and conformal deposition on industrially textured silicon. This strategy allows the fabrication of 28.6%&#8208;efficient perovskite/silicon heterojunction tandem solar cells (certified 27.9%, 1&#160;cm2). This approach is compatible with the scalable fabrication of tandems on industrially textured silicon, demonstrating an efficiency of 25.1% for an aperture area of 16&#160;cm2. The anion&#8208;engineered additive significantly improves the operating stability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells, and the encapsulated tandem solar cells retain over 80% of their initial performance following 2000&#160;h of operation under full 1&#8208;sun illumination in ambient conditions.

         <title>Observation of Multi&#8208;Directional Energy Transfer in a Hybrid Plasmonic&#8211;Excitonic Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast charge and energy exchange across the interface of a hybrid plasmonic heterostructure are explored with momentum resolved electron spectroscopy and diffraction. The results identify a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal, driven by a non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction. Non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination, electron&#8211;phonon coupling, and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy backflow.








Abstract
Hybrid plasmonic devices involve a nanostructured metal supporting localized surface plasmons to amplify light&#8211;matter interaction, and a non&#8208;plasmonic material to functionalize charge excitations. Application&#8208;relevant epitaxial heterostructures, however, give rise to ballistic ultrafast dynamics that challenge the conventional semiclassical understanding of unidirectional nanometal&#8208;to&#8208;substrate energy transfer. Epitaxial Au nanoislands are studied on WSe2 with time&#8208; and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and femtosecond electron diffraction: this combination of techniques resolves material, energy, and momentum of charge&#8208;carriers and phonons excited in the heterostructure. A strong non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction that transfers the energy of sub&#8208;bandgap photons very efficiently to the semiconductor is observed, leaving the metal cold until non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination heats the nanoparticles on hundreds of femtoseconds timescales. The results resolve a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal. Electron&#8211;phonon coupling and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy flow. This complex dynamics opens perspectives for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications, while providing a constraining experimental testbed for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art&#160;modelling.

         <title>Multimorphic Materials: Spatially Tailoring Mechanical Properties via Selective Initiation of Interpenetrating Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two disparate polymer networks are created simultaneously using non&#8208;interacting chemical reactions and light as a stimulus. Upon turning the light on, the polymers want to phase&#8208;separate like oil and water, but the process is hindered as they interlock. Thus, the degree and location of phase separation, and in&#8208;turn mechanical properties, can be precisely controlled by the &#8220;flick of a switch&#8221;.








Abstract
Access to multimaterial polymers with spatially localized properties and robust interfaces is anticipated to enable new capabilities in soft robotics, such as smooth actuation for advanced medical and manufacturing technologies. Here, orthogonal initiation is used to create interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) with spatial control over morphology and mechanical properties. Base catalyzes the formation of a stiff and strong polyurethane, while blue LEDs initiate the formation of a soft and elastic polyacrylate. IPN morphology is controlled by when the LED is turned &#8220;on&#8221;, with large phase separation occurring for short time delays (&#8776;1&#8211;2 min) and a mixed morphology for longer time delays (&gt;5&#160;min), which is supported by dynamic mechanical analysis, small angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and atomic force microscopy. Through tailoring morphology, tensile moduli and fracture toughness can be tuned across &#8776;1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude. Moreover, a simple spring model is used to explain the observed mechanical behavior. Photopatterning produces &#8220;multimorphic&#8221; materials, where morphology is spatially localized with fine precision (&lt;100&#160;&#181;m), while maintaining a uniform chemical composition throughout to mitigate interfacial failure. As a final demonstration, the fabrication of hinges represents a possible use case for multimorphic materials in soft robotics.

         <title>Fast and Dynamic Mapping of the Protein Corona on Nanoparticle Surfaces by Photocatalytic Proximity Labeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein corona broadly affects the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo. Here, a photocatalytic proximity labeling technology in nanoparticles (nano&#8208;PPL) is developed for in situ labeling of corona proteins. Nano&#8208;PPL exhibits a significantly improved temporal resolution (5 s duration) and reveals precise dynamics of protein coronas on anionic and cationic nanoparticles. This technology represents a significant methodological advance toward nano&#8208;protein interactions.








Abstract
Protein corona broadly affects the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo. Although it has been widely studied by multiple strategies like centrifugal sedimentation, the rapidly forming mechanism and the dynamic structure of the protein corona at the seconds level remains challenging. Here, a photocatalytic proximity labeling technology in nanoparticles (nano&#8208;PPL) is developed. By fabricating a &#8220;core&#8208;shell&#8221; nanoparticle co&#8208;loaded with chlorin e6 catalyst and biotin&#8208;phenol probe, nano&#8208;PPL technology is validated for the rapid and precise labeling of corona proteins in situ. Nano&#8208;PPL significantly improves the temporal resolution of nano&#8208;protein interactions to 5 s duration compared with the classical centrifugation method (&gt;30 s duration). Furthermore, nano&#8208;PPL achieves the fast and dynamic mapping of the protein corona on anionic and cationic nanoparticles, respectively. Finally, nano&#8208;PPL is deployed to verify the effect of the rapidly formed protein corona on the initial interaction of nanoparticles with cells. These findings highlight a significant methodological advance toward nano&#8208;protein interactions in the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo.

         <title>Imaging Guided Endogenic H2&#8208;Augmented Electrochemo&#8208;Sonodynamic Domino Co&#8208;therapy of Tumor in Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective imaging&#8208;guided/&#8208;assessed H2&#8208;therapy of tumors based on a joint electrochemo&#8208;sonodynamic treatment (H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy) is developed. The endogenic H2&#8208;triggered &#8220;domino effect&#8221; in tumor tissue is clearly revealed. The developed H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy guided by US imaging in vivo will open up a feasible new way for green, economic, and effective treatment of cancer in the future.








Abstract
Precise and on&#8208;demand release of sufficient hydrogen (H2) to tumor sites remains a key challenge for emerging H2&#8208;oncotherapy, and little is known about the physiological effects of &#8220;abundant&#8221; H2 on complex tumor microenvironments (TME). Here, a highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective imaging&#8208;guided/&#8208;assessed H2&#8208;therapy of tumors based on a joint electrochemo&#8208;sonodynamic treatment (H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy) with strong &#8220;domino effect&#8221; triggered by endogenous H2 generation at tumor sites is reported to speedily eliminate tumor tissue (&#8804;80&#160;mm3) within 1&#160;day. Adequate H2 is controllably generated in tumor sites through mild electrochemistry in vivo due to acidic TME by using clinical acupuncture Fe needles as electrodes. Besides starvation damage due to gas blockage/destruction of vessels, nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;bubbles of H2 formed in situ can elevate the tumor's internal temperature and burst vessels to further destroy the tumor&#160;under ultrasound irradiation. Remarkably, vulnerable homeostasis of TME is disturbed as H2 also participates in the physiological activity of tumor cells, leading to tumor dysfunction. Last but not least, the body's inflammatory response to cancer is reduced after the treatment, which is beneficial for the body's immune system during post&#8208;treatment recovery. Based on all of these merits, the H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy provides a potentially safe and viable therapeutic strategy for future clinical applications.

         <title>Formation Mechanism and Bandgap Reduction of GaN&#8211;ZnO Solid&#8208;Solution Thin Films Fabricated by Nanolamination of Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanolamination of GaN and ZnO layers by atomic layer deposition is employed to fabricate (GaN)1&#8722;x(ZnO)x homogenous solid&#8208;solution films with 0.39 &#8806; x &#8806; 0.79 by varying the cycle ratios. The density functional theory calculations using a superlattice model are performed to evaluate and validate the reduction of bandgaps that results in enhanced visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Nanolamination of GaN and ZnO layers by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is employed to fabricate GaN&#8211;ZnO homogenous solid&#8208;solution thin films because it offers more precise control of the stoichiometry. By varying the ALD cycle ratios of GaN:ZnO from 5:10 to 10:5, the (GaN)1&#8722;x(ZnO)x films with 0.39 &#8806; x &#8806; 0.79 are obtained. The formation of solid solution is explained based on the atomic stacking and preferred orientation of the layers of GaN and ZnO. However, the growth rates of GaN and ZnO during the lamination process are different from those of pure GaN and ZnO films. It is found that GaN grows faster on ZnO, whereas ZnO grows slower on GaN. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed using a superlattice model for GaN and ZnO laminated layers fabricated by ALD to understand the difference of density of states (DOS) and evaluate the bandgaps for various atomic configurations in the solid&#8208;solution films. The band positions are experimentally defined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Significant bandgap reduction of the solid solutions is observed, which can be explained by the DOS from the DFT calculations. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is conducted to confirm the applicability of the solid&#8208;solution films.

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Induced Micrometer&#8208;Scale Charge&#8208;Carrier Diffusion in Organic Bulk Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;mobility fullerene liquid crystal is introduced into the active layer of organic solar cells (OSCs) to provide a fast channel for charge&#8208;carrier transport, reduce energetic disorder and trap density via enhancing crystallization, and then realize micrometer&#8208;scale charge&#8208;carrier diffusion, leading to the impressive power conversion efficiencies of 15.23% for OSCs with the thickness approaching 500 nm.








Abstract
The short charge&#8208;carrier diffusion length (LD) (100&#8211;300&#160;nm) in organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) impedes the further improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs), especially for thick&#8208;film (&gt;400&#160;nm) devices matching with industrial solution processing. Here a facile method is developed to efficiently increase LD and then improve PCEs of OSCs via introducing a fullerene liquid crystal, F1, into the active layer. F1 combines the inherent high electron mobility of fullerene and strong self&#8208;assembly capacity of liquid crystal, providing a fast channel for charge&#8208;carrier transport&#160;and reducing energetic disorder and trap density in BHJ film via enhancing crystallization. Typically, in PM6:Y6:F1 BHJ, the enhanced charge&#8208;carrier mobility (&gt;10&#8722;2 cm&#8722;2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and prolonged charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (55.3 &#181;s) are acquired to realize the record LD of 1.6 or 2.4&#160;&#181;m for electron or hole, respectively, which are much higher than those of the PM6:Y6 binary sample and comparable to or even better than those values reported for some inorganic/hybrid materials, such as CuInxGa(1&#8722;x)Se2 (CIGS) and perovskite thin films. Benefitting from the micrometer&#8208;scale LD, the PM6:Y6:F1 ternary OSCs sustain a remarkable PCE of 15.23% with the active layer thickness approaching 500&#160;nm.

         <title>Electron Conductive and Transparent Hydrogels for Recording Brain Neural Signals and Neuromodulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to break the current bottleneck of implantable materials, which demonstrate a suit of desirable performances including matched modulus, good transparency, and high conductivity. The hydrogel electrode is successfully utilized for optogenetic neuromodulation and simultaneously recording the brain's neural signals, establishing the correlation between brain neural signals and corresponding limb behavior.








Abstract
Recording brain neural signals and optogenetic neuromodulations open&#160;frontiers in decoding brain neural information and neurodegenerative disease therapeutics. Conventional implantable probes suffer from modulus mismatch with biological tissues and an irreconcilable tradeoff between transparency and electron conductivity. Herein, a strategy is proposed to address these tradeoffs, which generates conductive and transparent hydrogels with polypyrrole&#8208;decorated microgels as cross&#8208;linkers. The optical transparency of the electrodes can be attributed to the special structures that allow light waves to bypass the microgel particles and minimize their interaction. Demonstrated by probing the hippocampus of rat brains, the biomimetic electrode shows a prolonged capacity for simultaneous optogenetic neuromodulation and recording of brain neural signals. More importantly, an intriguing brain&#8211;machine interaction is realized, which involves signal input to the brain, brain neural signal generation, and controlling limb behaviors. This breakthrough work represents a significant scientific advancement toward decoding brain neural information and developing neurodegenerative disease therapies.

         <title>Strain Engineering of Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Enables Exceptional Cyclability in Pouch&#8208;Type Full Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a super&#8208;dispersed Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathode, which consists of the elongated and radially aligned primary particles with rich oxygen stable {001} planes. The resultant cathode effectively homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain and greatly inhibits the Li/Ni disordering and lattice oxygen loss during de&#8208;/lilthiation, leading to superior electrochemical performances at various rates and operating temperatures.








Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are at the forefront of the development of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries, yet the extensive applications are retarded by the deteriorative capacity and thermal instability. Herein, an in situ co&#8208;precipitation strategy is implemented to achieve the novel super&#8208;dispersed Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathode that consists of the elongated and radially aligned primary particles with increased oxygen stable {001} planes. The unique microstructure homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain distribution and stabilizes the spherical secondary particles, effectively inhibiting microcrack formation and propagation and surface degradation. The super&#8208;dispersed Nb doping prevents the Li/Ni disordering and lattice oxygen escape, thereby further strengthening the crystal structure and thermal stability. Accordingly, this cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 229.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C with much better retention at 55 &#176;C and 5 C after 100 cycles than the conventional Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. In a pouch&#8208;type full cell, it exhibits exceptionally long life with a capacity retention of 91.9% at 1 C after 500 cycles and 80.5% at 5 C after 2000 cycles within 3.0&#8211;4.2&#160;V, greatly prolonging the service period to cater to the lightweight and intelligence of electric vehicles.

         <title>Transparent Porous Conductive Substrates for Gas&#8208;Phase Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent gas diffusion electrodes are developed via the F&#8208;doped SnO2 coating of SiO2 fused fiber felts. These highly porous and conductive substrates are amenable to the disposition of various semiconductors and are employed herein to demonstrate photoelectrode membrane assemblies for solar&#8208;driven H2 production in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell.








Abstract
Gas diffusion electrodes are essential components of common fuel and electrolysis cells but are typically made from graphitic carbon or metallic materials, which do not allow light transmittance and thus limit the development of gas&#8208;phase based photoelectrochemical devices. Herein, the simple and scalable preparation of F&#8208;doped SnO2 (FTO) coated SiO2 interconnected fiber felt substrates is reported. Using 2&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m diameter fibers at a loading of 4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the resulting substrates have porosity of 90%, roughness factor of 15.8, and Young's Modulus of 0.2&#160;GPa. A 100 nm conformal coating of FTO via atmospheric chemical vapor deposition gives sheet resistivity of 20 &#177; 3 &#937; sq&#8722;1 and loss of incident light of 41% at illumination wavelength of 550&#160;nm. The coating of various semiconductors on the substrates is established including Fe2O3 (chemical bath deposition), CuSCN and Cu2O (electrodeposition), and conjugated polymers (dip coating), and liquid&#8208;phase photoelectrochemical performance commensurate with flat FTO substrates is confirmed. Finally, gas phase H2 production is demonstrated with a polymer semiconductor photocathode membrane assembly at 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent density on the order of 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency of 40%.

The results show that the surface electronic structure of the dual TSLs is highly tunable and well&#8208;regulated for quantum transport and photoexcitation, which shed light on engineering for opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic applications.








Abstract
Dual topological insulators, simultaneously protected by time&#8208;reversal symmetry and crystalline symmetry, open great opportunities to explore different symmetry&#8208;protected metallic surface states. However, the conventional dual topological states located on different facets hinder integration into planar opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic devices. Here, dual topological superlattices (TSLs) Bi2Se3&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N with limited stacking layer number N are constructed. Angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron emission spectra of the TSLs identify the coexistence and adjustment of dual topological surface states on Bi2Se3 facet. The existence and tunability of spin&#8208;polarized dual&#8208;topological bands with N on Bi2Se3 facet result in an unconventionally weak antilocalization effect (WAL) with variable WAL coefficient &#945; (maximum close to 3/2) from quantum transport experiments. Most importantly, it is identified that the spin&#8208;polarized surface electrons from dual topological bands exhibit circularly and linearly polarized photogalvanic effect (CPGE and LPGE). It is anticipated that the stacked dual&#8208;topology and stacking layer number controlled bands evolution provide a platform for realizing intrinsic CPGE and LPGE. The results show that the surface electronic structure of the dual TSLs is highly tunable and well&#8208;regulated for quantum transport and photoexcitation, which shed light on engineering for opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic applications.

         <title>Ferroelectric Domain Control of Nonlinear Light Polarization in MoS2 via PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 Thin Films and Free&#8208;Standing Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferroelectric domain patterning enabled approach is developed to achieve nanoscale reconfigurable modulation of the amplitude and polarization of SHG light in MoS2 interfaced with PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 thin films and membranes. The light polarization exhibits threefold symmetry at polar domains and twofold symmetry at domain walls. This study opens up new opportunities for developing smart nano&#8208;photonics and optical computing systems.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as MoS2 exhibit exceptionally strong nonlinear optical responses, while nanoscale control of the amplitude, polar orientation, and phase of the nonlinear light in TMDCs remains challenging. In this work, by interfacing monolayer MoS2 with epitaxial PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) thin films and free&#8208;standing PZT membranes, the amplitude and polarization of the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal are modulated via ferroelectric domain patterning, which demonstrates that PZT membranes can lead to in&#8208;operando programming of nonlinear light polarization. The interfacial coupling of the MoS2 polar axis with either the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polar domains of PZT or the in&#8208;plane polarization of domain walls tailors the SHG light polarization into different patterns with distinct symmetries, which are modeled via nonlinear electromagnetic theory. This study provides a new material platform that enables reconfigurable design of light polarization at the nanoscale, paving the path for developing novel optical information processing, smart light modulators, and integrated photonic circuits.

         <title>Fast and Durable Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction at the Electron&#8208;Deficient Ruthenium&#8211;Ruthenium Oxide Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure is designed as an efficient electrocatalyst toward the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). The interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively. The Ru domains are electron deficient and show substantially improved inoxidizability. The results highlight the significance of establishing robust and multifunctional heterointerfaces toward fast alkaline HOR and beyond.








Abstract
The slow hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics under alkaline conditions remain a critical challenge for the practical application of alkaline exchange membrane fuel cells. Herein, Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructures are designed with abundant active Ru&#8211;RuO2 interface domains as efficient electrocatalysts for the HOR in alkaline media. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains at Ru&#8211;RuO2 interfaces are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively, endowing the well&#8208;defined Ru(100)/RuO2(200) interface as the preferential region for fast alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. More importantly, the metallic Ru domains become electron deficient due to the strong interaction with RuO2 domains and show substantially improved inoxidizability, which is vital to maintain durable HOR electrocatalytic activity. The optimal Ru/RuO2 heterostructured electrocatalyst exhibits impressive alkaline HOR activity with an exchange current density of 8.86&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and decent durability. The exceptional electrocatalytic performance of Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure can be attributed to the robust and multifunctional Ru&#8211;RuO2 interfaces endowed by the unique metal&#8211;metal oxide domains.

         <title>Weakening Li+ De&#8208;solvation Barrier for Cryogenic Li&#8211;S Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antecedent theoretical simulations decipher the correlation between lithium salt concentration and Li+ desolvation barrier in the electrolyte, indicating dilute electrolytes can enhance kinetics of sulfur cathode effectively. This insight endows Li&#8211;S pouch cells with an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 350 Wh kg&#8208;1 at 0 &#176;C, demonstrating great&#160;potential for&#160;cryogenic&#160;Li&#8211;S&#160;batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8211;S batteries hold promise for pushing cell&#8208;level energy densities beyond 300&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 while operating at low temperatures (LTs, below 0&#160;&#176;C). However, the capacity release of existing Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs is still barely satisfactory, and there is almost no verification of the practicability of Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs in the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell. Here, antecedent molecular dynamics (MDs) combined with density functional theory analysis are used to systematically investigate Li+ solvation structure in conventional Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs, which unprecedentedly reveals the positive correlation between lithium salt concentration and Li+ de&#8208;solvation barrier, indicating dilute electrolytes can enhance the Li+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics and thus improve the capacity performance of cryogenic Li&#8211;S batteries. These insights derived from theoretical simulations invested Li&#8211;S batteries with a 67.34% capacity retention at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C compared to their room temperature performance. In particular, an Ah&#8208;level Li&#8211;S pouch cell using dilute electrolytes with a high sulfur loading (5.6&#160;mg cm&#8208;2) and lean electrolyte condition is fabricated, which delivers a discharge capacity of about 1000 mAh g&#8208;1 and ultra&#8208;high energy density of 350&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 at 0&#160;&#176;C, offering a promising route toward a practical high&#8208;energy cryogenic Li&#8211;S battery.

         <title>3D Cold&#8208;Trap Environment Printing for Long&#8208;Cycle Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative 3D cold trap environment printing technology (3DCEP) is proposed in this work to fabricate a MXene/Zn&#8208;P aerogel anode with highly aligned arrangement. Benefitting from unique high lattice matching and physical confinement effects inside the electrode, it can effectively inhibit the Zn dendrite growth and Zn&#8208;P corrosion in electrolytes. Finally, a 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P//MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF full cell with long cyclic life can be realized.








Abstract
Zn powder (Zn&#8208;P)&#8208;based anodes are always regarded as ideal anode candidates for zinc ion batteries owing to their low cost and ease of processing. However, the intrinsic negative properties of Zn&#8208;P&#8208;based anodes such as easy corrosion and uncontrolled dendrite growth have limited their further applications. Herein, a novel 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3DCEP) technology is proposed to achieve the MXene and Zn&#8208;P (3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P) anode with highly ordered arrangement. Benefitting from the unique inhibition mechanism of high lattice matching and physical confinement effects within the&#160;3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode, it can effectively homogenize the Zn2+ flux and alleviate the Zn deposition rate of the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode during Zn plating&#8211;stripping. Consequently, the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode exhibits a superior cycling lifespan of 1400&#160;h with high coulombic efficiency of &#8776;9.2% in symmetric batteries. More encouragingly, paired with MXene and Co doped MnHCF cathode via 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3 DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF), the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P//3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF full battery delivers high cyclic durability with the capacity retention of 95.7% after 1600 cycles. This study brings an inspired universal pathway to rapidly fabricate a reversible Zn anode with highly ordered arrangement in a cold environment for micro&#8208;zinc storage systems.

         <title>Many&#8208;Body Correlations and Exciton Complexes in CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many&#8208;body interactions in exciton complexes are crucial in many devices, for example, lasers, LEDs, and quantum light sources. Here, a combination of single quantum&#8208;dot photoluminescence spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures and configuration&#8208;interaction calculations reveals the size&#8208;dependent binding energies of trions (7&#8211;17&#160;meV) and biexcitons (15&#8211;30&#160;meV) in CsPbBr3&#160;quantum dots.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;halide perovskite (LHP) (CsPbX3, X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I) quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a competitive platform for classical light&#8208;emitting devices (in the weak light&#8211;matter interaction regime, e.g., LEDs and laser), as well as for devices exploiting strong light&#8211;matter interaction at room temperature. Many&#8208;body interactions and quantum correlations among photogenerated exciton complexes play an essential role, for example, by determining the laser threshold, the overall brightness of LEDs, and the single&#8208;photon purity in quantum light sources. Here, by combining cryogenic single&#8208;QD photoluminescence spectroscopy with configuration&#8208;interaction (CI) calculations, the size&#8208;dependent trion and biexciton binding energies are addressed. Trion binding energies increase from 7&#160;to 17&#160;meV for QD sizes decreasing from 30&#160;to 9&#160;nm, while the biexciton binding energies increase from 15&#160;to 30&#160;meV, respectively. CI calculations quantitatively corroborate the experimental results and suggest that the effective dielectric constant for biexcitons slightly deviates from the one of the single excitons, potentially as a result of coupling to the lattice in the multiexciton regime. The findings here provide a deep insight into the multiexciton properties in all&#8208;inorganic LHP QDs, essential for classical and quantum optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Engineering the Electronic Structure of Single&#8208;Atom Iron Sites with Boosted Oxygen Bifunctional Activity for Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to create a single&#8208;atom Fe catalyst on a mesoporous NC material by engineering the electronic structures of the metal sites is reported. This catalyst achieves remarkable electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction&#160;and oxygen evolution reaction, and demonstrates great potential in zinc&#8211;air batteries. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the optimized electronic structure of Fe1N4O1 moieties contributes to excellent electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries typically require efficient, durable, and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalysts to support oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). However, sluggish kinetics and mass transportation challenges must be addressed if the performance of these catalysts is to be enhanced. Herein, a strategy to fabricate a catalyst comprising atomically dispersed iron atoms supported on a mesoporous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support (Fe SAs/NC) with accessible metal sites and optimized electronic metal&#8211;support interactions is developed. Both the experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the engineered electronic structures of the metal active sites can regulate the charge distribution of Fe centers to optimize the adsorption/desorption of oxygenated intermediates. The Fe SAs/NC containing Fe1N4O1 sites achieves remarkable ORR activity over the entire pH range, with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.93, 0.83, and 0.75&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) in alkaline, acidic, and neutral electrolytes, respectively. In addition, it demonstrates a promising low overpotential of 320&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for OER in alkaline conditions. The zinc&#8211;air battery assembled with Fe SAs/NC exhibits superior performance than that of Pt/C+RuO2 counterpart in terms of peak power density, specific capacity, and cycling stability. These findings demonstrate the importance of the electronic structure engineering of metal sites in directing catalytic activity.

         <title>Initiating Reversible Aqueous Copper&#8211;Tellurium Conversion Reaction with High Volumetric Capacity through Electrolyte Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8211;tellurium conversion reaction with high volumetric capacity of 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3 and long discharge plateau are investigated. The thermodynamic&#8211;kinetic asymmetries of the Cu&#8211;Te multiphase&#8208;conversion and oxidation&#8208;failure mechanisms are systematically revealed. The developed precise electrolyte engineering overcomes inherent oxidative distress and extends the cycling life of the battery by about three orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Pursuing conversion&#8208;type cathodes with high volumetric capacity that can be used in aqueous environments remains rewarding and challenging. Tellurium (Te) is a promising alternative electrode due to its intrinsic attractive electronic conductivity and high theoretical volumetric capacity yet still to be explored. Herein, the kinetically/thermodynamically co&#8208;dominat copper&#8211;tellurium (Cu&#8211;Te) alloying phase&#8208;conversion process and corresponding oxidation failure mechanism of tellurium are investigated using in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and comprehensive ex situ characterization techniques. By virtue of the fundamental insights into the tellurium electrode, facile and precise electrolyte engineering (solvated structure modulation or reductive antioxidant addition) is implemented to essentially tackle the dramatic capacity loss in tellurium, affording reversible aqueous Cu&#8211;Te conversion reaction with an unprecedented ultrahigh volumetric capacity of up to 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3, a flat long discharge plateau (capacity proportion of &#8776;81%), and an extraordinary level of capacity retention of 80.4% over 2000 cycles at 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 of which lifespan thousand&#8208;fold longer than Cu&#8211;Te conversion using CuSO4&#8211;H2O electrolyte. This work paves a significant avenue for expanding high&#8208;performance conversion&#8208;type cathodes toward energetic aqueous multivalent&#8208;ion batteries.

         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;function colloidal quantum dot (QD) devices that operate as a high&#8208;current density light emitting diode and an optically excited laser are demonstrated. The device structure has been optimized to reduce optical losses and allow for efficient wave&#8208;guiding within the active QD layer. This demonstration represents an important milestone toward the practical implementation of a colloidal QD laser diode.








Abstract
Laser diodes based on solution&#8208;processable materials can benefit numerous technologies including integrated electronics and photonics, telecommunications, and medical diagnostics. An attractive system for implementing these devices is colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). The progress towards a QD laser diode has been hampered by rapid nonradiative Auger decay of optical&#8208;gain&#8208;active multicarrier states, fast device degradation at high current densities required for laser action, and unfavorable competition between optical gain and optical losses in a multicomponent device stack. Here&#160;we&#160;resolve some of these challenges and demonstrate optically excited lasing from fully functional high&#8208;current density electroluminescent (EL) devices with an integrated optical resonator. This advance has become possible due to excellent optical gain properties of continuously graded QDs and a refined device architecture, which allows for highly efficient light amplification in a thin, EL&#8208;active QD layer.

         <title>Macroscale Fabrication of Lightweight and Strong Porous Carbon Foams through Template&#8208;Coating Pair Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manufacturing of low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon materials on a macroscopic length scale has a significant impact on the construction, packaging, and transportation industries. Presented herein is a tunable platform for macroscale fabrication of lightweight and strong pyrolytic carbon foams through template&#8208;coating pair design.








Abstract
Manufacturing of low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon foams can benefit the construction, transportation, and packaging industries. One successful route to lightweight and mechanically strong carbon foams involves pyrolysis of polymeric architectures, which is inevitably accompanied by drastic volumetric shrinkage (usually &gt;98%). As such, a challenge of these materials lies in maintaining bulk dimensions of building struts that span orders of magnitude difference in length scale from centimeters to nanometers. This work demonstrates fabrication of macroscale low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon foams that feature exceptional dimensional stability through pyrolysis of robust template&#8208;coating pairs. The template serves as the architectural blueprint and contains strength&#8208;imparting properties (e.g., high node density and small strut dimensions); it is composed of a low char&#8208;yielding porous polystyrene backbone with a high carbonization&#8208;onset temperature. The coating serves to imprint and transcribe the template architecture into pyrolytic carbon; it is composed of a high char&#8208;yielding conjugated polymer with a relatively low carbonization&#8208;onset temperature. The designed carbonization mismatch enables structural inheritance, while the decomposition mismatch affords hollow struts, minimizing density. The carbons synthesized through this new framework exhibit remarkable dimensional stability (&#8776;80% dimension retention; &#8776;50% volume retention) and some of the highest specific strengths (&#8776;0.13&#160;GPa g&#8722;1 cm3) among reported carbon foams derived from porous polymer templates.

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined Fullerene Bisadducts Enable High&#8208;Performance Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;dependent effects of the four fullerene bisadduct regioisomers on the device performance of tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are systemically investigated. Benefiting from the favorable molecular packing, energy level alignment, and interfacial interaction, the trans&#8208;3&#8208;based devices yield a champion efficiency of 14.58% with a certified efficiency of 14.30%, representing one of the best&#8208;performing tin&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) are attracting intense research interest due to their excellent optoelectric properties and eco&#8208;friendly features. To further improve the device performance, developing new fullerene derivatives as electron transporter layers (ETLs) is highly demanded. Four well&#8208;defined regioisomers (trans&#8208;2, trans&#8208;3, trans&#8208;4, and e) of diethylmalonate&#8208;C60 bisadduct (DCBA) are isolated and well characterized. The well&#8208;defined molecular structure enables us to investigate the real structure&#8208;dependent effects on photovoltaic performance. It is found that the chemical structures of the regioisomers not only affect their energy levels, but also lead to significant differences in their molecular packings and interfacial contacts. As a result, the devices with trans&#8208;2, trans&#8208;3, trans&#8208;4, and e as ETLs yield efficiencies of 11.69%, 14.58%, 12.59%, and 10.55%, respectively, which are higher than that of the as&#8208;prepared DCBA&#8208;based (10.28%) device. Notably, the trans&#8208;3&#8208;based device also demonstrates a certified efficiency of 14.30%, representing one of the best&#8208;performing TPSCs.

         <title>Control of Molecular Orbital Ordering Using a van der Waals Monolayer Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling and tuning the orbital ordering in a single molecule using a monolayer ferroelectric substrate is realized. This is achieved by adsorbing transition metal phthalocyanine (TMPc) molecules on a ferroelectric monolayer SnTe. The orbital order is probed using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments, and it is demonstrated that it can be controllably changed by switching the polarization direction of the underlying ferroelectric monolayer.








Abstract
2D ferroelectric materials provide a promising platform for the electrical control of quantum states. In particular, due to their 2D nature, they are suitable for influencing the quantum states of deposited molecules via the proximity effect. Here, electrically controllable molecular states in phthalocyanine molecules adsorbed on monolayer ferroelectric material SnTe are reported. The strain and ferroelectric order in SnTe are found to create a transition between two distinct orbital orders in the adsorbed phthalocyanine molecules. By controlling the polarization of the ferroelectric domain using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), it is successfully demonstrated that orbital order can be manipulated electrically. The results show how ferroelastic coupling in 2D systems allows for control of molecular states, providing a starting point for ferroelectrically switchable molecular orbital ordering and ultimately, electrical control of molecular&#160;magnetism.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme with Asymmetric Electron Distribution for Tumor Catalytic Therapy by Disrupting Tumor Redox and Energy Metabolism Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the drawbacks of current nanozyme catalytic therapy, a novel Ir&#63743;N5 single&#8208;atom/Cer nanoagent with asymmetric electron distribution is developed, which can improve the efficiency of multienzyme&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions through a substrate&#8208;recyclable manner, thereby disrupting the intracellular redox and energy metabolism homeostasis to achieve efficient tumor therapy.








Abstract
Nanozyme catalytic therapy triggered by tumor&#8208;specific endogenous stimuli is an emerging tumor therapy that attracts wide attention. However, the current therapeutic efficacy of nanozyme catalytic therapy is severely limited by the catalytic efficiency of nanozymes and the concentration of endogenous reaction substrates. Herein, a novel and efficient Ir&#63743;N5 single&#8208;atom (Ir&#63743;N5 SA) nanozyme is developed with multiple enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activities. Due to the synergistic effect of central Ir single&#8208;atom and axial N coordination, Ir&#63743;N5 SA exhibits better enzymatic catalytic performance than Ir&#63743;N4 SA. At tumor sites, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can generate a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic activities. Moreover, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can also generate O2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through catalase (CAT)&#8208;like and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase (NOX)&#8208;like catalytic activities, realizing the efficient nanozyme catalytic therapy in a substrate&#8208;cycle manner. Additionally, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can effectively break the intracellular NADH/NAD+ cycle balance by mimicking NOX, and then cooperate with fatty acid synthase cerulenin (Cer) to interfere with the energy metabolism homeostasis of tumor cells. Consequently, the designed Ir&#63743;N5 SA/Cer nanoagent can disrupt redox and metabolic homeostasis in the tumor region through an enzyme&#8208;mimicking cascade reaction, effectively overcoming the shortcomings of current nanozyme catalytic therapy.

Due to the synergistic effect of central Ir single-atom and axial N coordination, Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; SA exhibits better enzymatic catalytic performance than Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; SA. At tumor sites, Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; SA can generate a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through oxidase (OXD)-like and peroxidase (POD)-like catalytic activities. Moreover, Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; SA can also generate O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) through catalase (CAT)-like and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase (NOX)-like catalytic activities, realizing the efficient nanozyme catalytic therapy in a substrate-cycle manner. Additionally, Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; SA can effectively break the intracellular NADH/NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cycle balance by mimicking NOX, and then cooperate with fatty acid synthase cerulenin (Cer) to interfere with the energy metabolism homeostasis of tumor cells. Consequently, the designed Ir&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; SA/Cer nanoagent can disrupt redox and metabolic homeostasis in the tumor region through an enzyme-mimicking cascade reaction, effectively overcoming the shortcomings of current nanozyme catalytic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monolithic Tandem Vertical Electrochemical Transistors for Printed Multi&#8208;Valued Logic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design of high&#8208;speed electrochemical ternary logic transistor is presented. A vertically stacked dual channel heterostructure enables a clear manifestation of multiple logic states in 1&#160;V input&#8211;output voltage ranges, through a simple chemical&#8208;tuning of semiconductor materials.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have recently emerged as a feasible candidate to realize the next generation of printable electronics. Especially, their chemical versatility and the unique redox&#8208;based operating principle have provided new possibilities in high&#8208;functioning logic circuitry beyond the traditional binary Boolean logic. Here, a simple strategy to electrochemically realize monolithic multi&#8208;valued logic transistors is presented, which is one of the most promising branches of transistor technology in the forthcoming era of hyper Moore's law. A vertically stacked heterogeneous dual&#8208;channel architecture is introduced with a patterned reference electrode, which enables a facile manifestation of stable and equiprobable ternary logic states with a reduced transistor footprint. The dual&#8208;ion&#8208;penetration mechanism coupled with ultrashort vertical channel even allows a very&#8208;high accessing frequency to multiple logic states reaching over 10&#160;MHz. Furthermore, printed arrays of ternary logic gates with full voltage swing within 1&#160;V are demonstrated.

         <title>Metal Anodes with Ultrahigh Reversibility Enabled by the Closest Packing Crystallography for Sustainable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy is reported to construct dendrite&#8208;free metal anodes with multiple crystal structures (hexagonal close&#8208;packed, face&#8208;centered cubic, and body&#8208;centered cubic) on single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates, which epitaxially match the closest packed facets of metals. The closest packed facets of metal anodes aligned horizontally with substrates, resulting in compact planar construction and excellent chemical stability. Consequently, the metal anodes display high reversibility and outstanding performance.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing annual electricity generated from sustainable and intermittent energy such as wind and solar power requires cost effective and reliable electrochemical energy storage. Rechargeable batteries based on multivalent metal anodes such as Zn, Al, and Fe, taking advantage of large&#8208;scale production and affordable cost, have emerged as promising candidates. However, the uncontrollable dendrite&#8208;like metal deposition on regular substrate caused by disordered metal crystallization usually leads to premature failure of batteries and even safety concerns when the dendrite bridges the electrodes. Here it is reported that a series of metal anodes (Zn, Co, Al, Ni, and Fe) with multiple crystal structures (hexagonal close&#8208;packed, face&#8208;centered cubic, and body&#8208;centered cubic) can achieve dendrite&#8208;free and epitaxial deposition on single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates enabled by the closest packing crystallography. Moreover, the closest packed facets are aligned horizontally with the substrates, resulting in compact planar construction and excellent chemical stability even at an unprecedented current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. The full cells under a practical anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio of 2.3 show a cycling life span of over 800 cycles with Coulombic efficiency of &gt;&#160;99.9%. The universal approach of regulating metal electrodeposition in this work is expected to boost the development of emerging sustainable energy storage/conversion devices.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Cation Composition Engineering of Hybrid Cs1&#8722;xFAxPbBr3 Nanocrystals for Self&#8208;Healing Electronics Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel post&#8208;synthesis cesium/formamidinium (Cs/FA) mixed&#8208;cation perovskite nanocrystals possess high structural and optoelectronic properties for integration in self&#8208;healing polymer composites. Entropic&#8208;driven self&#8208;healing not only enhances white backlight display performance, but also sustains the working performance of a shattered&#8211;repaired glass substrate laser, thereby representing potentially major advances in optoelectronics and photonics applications.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;cation hybrid perovskite nanocrystal (HPNC) with high crystallinity, color purity, and tunable optical bandgap offers a practical pathway toward next&#8208;generation&#160;displays. Herein, a two&#8208;step modified hot&#8208;injection combined with cation compositional engineering and surface treatment to synthesize high&#8208;purity cesium/formamidinium lead bromide HPNCs(Cs1&#8208;xFAxPbBr3) is presented. The optimized Cs0.5FA0.5PbBr3 light&#8208;emitting devices (LEDs) exhibit uniform luminescence of 3500&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a prominent current efficiency of 21.5&#160;cd A&#8722;1. As a proof of concept, a self&#8208;healing polymer (SHP) integrated with white LED backlight and laser prototypes exhibited 4 h autonomous self&#8208;healing through the synergistic effect of weak reversible imine bonds and stronger H&#8208;bonds. First, the SHP&#8208;HPNCs&#8208;initial and SHP&#8208;HPNCs&#8208;cut possess high long&#8208;term stability and dramatically suppressed lead leakage as low as 0.6&#160;ppm along with a low leakage rate of 1.11 &#215; 10&#8722;5 cm2 and 3.36 &#215; 10&#8722;5 cm2 even over 6 months in water. Second, the Cs0.5FA0.5PbBr3 HPNCs and SHP&#8208;induced shattered&#8211;repaired perovskite glass substrate show the lowest lasing threshold values of 1.24 and 8.58 &#181;J cm&#8722;2, respectively. This work provides an integrative and in&#8208;depth approach to exploiting SHP with intrinsic and entropic self&#8208;healing capabilities combined with HPNCs to develop robust and reliable soft&#8208;electronic backlight and laser applications.

Organic Metal Halide Hybrids
Efficient electroluminescent devices can now be fabricated using solution&#8208;processed thin films based on 0D organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs). In article number 2209417, Biwu Ma and co&#8208;workers develop a highly luminescent 0D OMHH containing organic semiconducting cations, which successfully addresses the issues of low conductivity and poor energy alignment of existing 0D OMHHs for electrically driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs).

An innovative 3D cold trap environment printing (3DCEP) technology is proposed by Yujie Li, Jingxin Zhao, Bingang Xu, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2209886 to fabricate a highly aligned aerogel anode with MXene and Zn powder (3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8211;P). Benefitting from the combined induction of laminar flow and ice crystals in the 3DCEP process, MXene and Zn&#8211;P can be arranged in the Zn anode to achieve a unique Zn&#8208;dendrite inhibition effect.

         <title>Resistive Switching Crossbar Arrays Based on Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resistive switching devices made of layered materials (LMs) have shown interesting performance. However, most studies employ fabrication methods and device structures that are not industry&#8208;relevant. In this review, the focus is on the status of crossbar arrays of LMs.








Abstract
Resistive switching (RS) devices are metal/insulator/metal cells that can change their electrical resistance when electrical stimuli are applied between the electrodes, and they can be used to store and compute data. Planar crossbar arrays of RS devices can offer a high integration density (&gt;108&#160;devices mm&#8722;2) and this can be further enhanced by stacking them three&#8208;dimensionally. The advantage of using layered materials (LMs) in RS devices compared to traditional phase&#8208;change materials and metal oxides is that their electrical properties can be adjusted with a higher precision. Here, the key figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit and procedures to implement LM&#8208;based RS devices are defined. LM&#8208;based RS devices fabricated using methods compatible with industry are identified and discussed. The focus is on small devices (size&#160;&lt;&#160;9&#160;&#181;m2) arranged in crossbar structures, since larger devices may be affected by artifacts, such as grain boundaries and flake junctions. How to enhance device performance, so to accelerate the development of this technology, is also discussed.
