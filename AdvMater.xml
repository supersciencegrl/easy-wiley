         <title>2D Indium Oxide at the Epitaxial Graphene/SIC Interface: Synthesis, Structure, Properties, and Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new monolayer insulator, InO2, is synthesized by intercalating indium beneath patterned epitaxial graphene on SiC, followed by high&#8208;temperature oxidation. This selective confinement yields large&#8208;area, uniform InO2 with a wide bandgap of 4.1 eV. Upon intercalation, the EG/n&#8208;SiC junction transitions from ohmic to Schottky, exhibiting a rectification ratio of &#8776;10&#8308;&#8212;promising for high&#8208;frequency vertical electronic devices.








Abstract
Scaled and high&#8208;quality insulators are crucial for fabricating 2D/3D hybrid vertical electronic devices such as metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (MOS) based Schottky diodes and hot electron transistors, the production of which is constrained by the scarcity of bulk layered wide bandgap semiconductors. In this research, the synthesis of a new 2D insulator, monolayer InO2, which differs in stoichiometry from its bulk form is presented, over a large area (&gt;300 &#181;m2) by intercalating at the epitaxial graphene (EG)/SiC interface. By adjusting the lateral size of graphene through optical lithography prior to the intercalation, the thickness of InO2 is tuned such that it is 85% monolayer. The preference for monolayer formation of InO2 is explained using molecular dynamics and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, the bandgap of InO2 is calculated to be 4.1&#160;eV, differing from its bulk form (2.7&#160;eV). Furthermore, MOS&#8208;based Schottky diode measurements on InO2 intercalated EG/n&#8208;SiC demonstrate that the EG/n&#8208;SiC junction transforms from ohmic to a Schottky junction upon intercalation, with a barrier height of 0.87&#160;eV and a rectification ratio of &#8776;105. These findings introduce a new addition to the 2D insulator family, demonstrating the utility of monolayer InO2 as a barrier in vertical electronic devices.

         <title>Key Issues and Strategies in Aqueous Static Zinc&#8211;Halogen Battery Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on static zinc&#8211;halogen battery design, addressing key issues of halogen cathode stability, reactivity, and cell configuration. It connects the basic halogen chemistries to practical strategies, highlights the recent breakthrough of zinc&#8211;halogen batteries, and discusses the key battery components toward practical zinc&#8211;halogen batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;halogen batteries have emerged as leading candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems, owing to their inherent advantages such as high theoretical energy density, enhanced safety, and cost&#8208;effectiveness derived from earth&#8208;abundant zinc and halogen elements. However, the practical implementation of halogen cathodes faces major challenges, including intrinsically low electrical conductivity, the pronounced shuttle effect of soluble polyhalide intermediates, severe corrosion, and competing hydrolysis reactions. These issues call for innovative and rational material design strategies across all battery components. Accordingly, realizing practical zinc&#8211;halogen batteries requires a comprehensive understanding that bridges fundamental halogen redox chemistry with targeted material engineering solutions. This review systematically examines the crucial connection between the electrochemistry of halogens and the practical design of battery materials in zinc&#8211;halogen systems. Key challenges are first addressed, including stabilizing halogen cathodes, managing reactive halogen species, and optimizing cell configurations. Subsequently, recent pivotal strategies are summarized, including the development of advanced halogen host materials, halogen complexing agents, catalysts for halogen electroactivity, multi&#8208;electron redox processes, and electrolyte/separator design. Finally, the essential practical considerations that influence achievable energy density are discussed: such as current collector stability, active halogen ratio, and electrolyte weight/cost, which are critical for realistic performance evaluation and the commercialization of zinc&#8211;halogen battery technologies.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Biomineral Nanofibers: 1D Inorganic Materials with a High Aspect Ratio and Anisotropic Self&#8208;Assembled Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of high aspect&#8208;ratio, electric&#8208;field&#8208;responsive, and single&#8208;crystalline fibrous nanomaterials are reported. These nanofibers are liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) biomineral based on fluorapatite, a naturally occurring biomineral found in shark teeth. These nanofibers exhibit an exceptionally high aspect ratio exceeding 150, which enables the formation of LC phases even at low concentrations. Notably, the LC biomineral nanofibers respond to electric fields by aligning into defect&#8208;free monodomain orientations.








Abstract
In nature, shark tooth enameloid exhibits an intricate anisotropic structure composed of high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio fluorapatite (FAp) fibrous nanocrystals, which impart exceptional mechanical properties. Mineral&#8208;based liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) colloids provide a promising strategy for constructing such anisotropic structural materials. However, fibrous nanoparticles with high aspect ratios are prone to irreversible aggregation and gelation due to their large surface area. Consequently, the development of 1D mineral&#8208;based LC colloids with a high aspect ratio (&gt;100) is largely limited to clay, carbon, boron nitride, and metal oxide&#8208;based systems. Herein, LC FAp nanofibers (FApNFs) are demonstrated as environmentally friendly, biocompatible, and stimuli&#8208;responsive fibrous nanomaterials. Well&#8208;dispersed FApNFs are synthesized using an elongated acidic macromolecular template to control crystal morphology. Their atomic&#8208;scale structures, self&#8208;assembled behavior, and electro&#8208;responsive properties are described. These LC FApNFs exhibit macroscopic alignment in response to external electric fields. Unidirectionally aligned FApNFs are successfully immobilized within the hydrogel network, enabling the formation of anisotropic nanocomposite hydrogels. The FApNFs&#8208;based hydrogels exhibit pronounced anisotropic stiffness and toughness with orientational dependency. Owing to their facile preparation, eco&#8208;friendliness, and stimuli&#8208;responsive nature, LC FApNFs have potentials as bio&#8208;friendly functional materials.

         <title>Ultrahigh Cell Density 3D Bioprinting by Acoustic Fluids&#8208;mediated Stereolithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acoustic fluids&#8208;mediated stereolithography (ASL) enables ultrahigh cell density 3D bioprinting by using surface acoustic waves to assemble cells for biomimetic constructs with hierarchical architectures. Integrated with acoustic&#8208;assisted medium exchange, ASL rapidly fabricates functional liver models, advancing disease modeling, regenerative medicine, and artificial organ engineering.








Abstract
Dense cell populations and their complex structures are the essentials of physiologically functional solid organs, but their biomimetic construction is challenging. Here, an ultrahigh cell density (UHCD) bioprinting system is presented for fabricating organ&#8208;analogous intricate architectures based on an acoustic fluids&#8208;mediated stereolithography (ASL) technique. The ASL can achieve cell aggregation on a prepolymerized solid&#8211;liquid interface with densities comparable to native tissues through focused surface acoustic waves&#8208;induced vortices. Meanwhile, the ASL&#8208;based UHCD bioprinting shows reduced light scattering in each ultrathin layer printing process, reaching cell densities of 1 billion cells&#160;mL&#8722;1. Additionally, by incorporating an acoustic&#8208;assisted medium exchange system, the ASL facilitates the bioprinting of multicellular components in arbitrary architectures. Based on these features, ASL's capability in fabricating structure&#8208;mimetic liver tissue models with regenerative functionalities is demonstrated. It is believed that the ASL technique achieves breakthroughs in UHCD bioprinting, opening new avenues in the development of artificial tissue and organ engineering.

         <title>Breaking Dilution Limits: Electrocatalytic Ammonia Production from Low&#8208;Concentration Nitrate Streams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
The conversion of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) in water to high&#8208;value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) using an electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (eNO3&#8722;RR) provides a viable technological pathway to address the imbalance in the global nitrogen cycle. Unfortunately, most of the existing studies have focused on the ideal conditions of high&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722;, but most of the polluted waters around the world are usually at low&#8208;concentration levels. Consequently, researching eNO3&#8722;RR under low&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722; is more practical. Although the study of low&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722; has gradually gained attention in recent years, a systematic review of the literature in this area has not yet been reported. To fill this research gap, this paper reviews recent advances in the electrocatalytic reduction of low&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722; to NH3. Initially, the nature of NO3&#8722; as a reactant, the reaction mechanism of eNO3&#8722;RR, and the factors affecting the efficiency are introduced. Subsequently, the key challenges of electrocatalytic reduction of low&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722; are analyzed, and various strategies to improve the performance of eNO3&#8722;RR are summarized on this basis. Additionally, the feasibility of large&#8208;scale ammonia recovery using eNO3&#8722;RR under low&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722; is assessed through application scenario exploration, economic analyses, and life cycle assessment. Ultimately, future research directions are outlined to inspire future work.

         <dc:description>
Current stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials face challenges in simultaneously achieving static multimodal and dynamic ulticolor emission for advanced photonic applications. In this study, Lanthanide(III) and manganese(II) co&#8208;doped Cs2NaLuCl6 perovskite halides is introduced, offering multi&#8208;excitation&#8208;sensitivity, tunable dynamic multicolor emission, high capacity, and scalability through spatial, spectral, temporal, and thermal controls, making them ideal for secure optical applications.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that react to various external triggers are in high demand for advanced interactive photonic applications. Despite progress in the development of multi&#8208;excitation&#8208;capable luminescent materials, challenges remain in creating systems that exhibit both static multimodal and dynamic multicolor luminescence. Here, A novel class of luminescent materials is reported based on lanthanide(III) and manganese(II) co&#8208;doped Cs2NaLuCl6 double perovskite halides, which feature dynamic emission modulation under various excitation conditions and time scales, enabling multilevel anticounterfeiting and multidimensional optical encoding with temporally sensitive characteristics. Upon ultraviolet (UV), near&#8208;infrared (NIR), X&#8208;ray, and mechanical stimulation, the resulting materials exhibit versatile multimodal luminescence. Moreover, Mn2+doping&#8208;induced multiple defect states endow the Cs2NaLuCl6:Mn2+/Er3+ crystals with controllable persistent luminescence as well as adjustable thermal&#8208; and photo&#8208;modulated luminescence, while Er3+ incorporation enables tunable, dynamic multicolor emission through energy from Mn2+ to Er3+. By utilizing spatial, spectral, temporal, and thermal controls, the perovskite&#8208;based systems is presented to offer a flexible and robust security solution with enhanced resistance to replication. These findings hold great promise for next&#8208;generation information encryption, providing high capacity, multifunctionality, and scalability, making them ideally suited for cutting&#8208;edge optical security systems.

         <title>Micelle&#8208;Induced Nucleation and Surface Chemical Polishing Co&#8208;Strategy for Efficient Tin&#8208;Lead Mixed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimolecular synergistic approach combining micelle&#8208;induced nucleation and surface chemical polishing was successfully to modulate perovskite crystallization and defect passivation of tin&#8208;lead mixed perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;lead mixed perovskite (TLP) solar cells, due to their tunable bandgap, have emerged as one of the most promising candidates for approaching the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit. However, the strong Lewis acidity of the tin&#8208;halide component in TLP increases the propensity for defect formation and phase separation during the fabrication process. In this study, a bimolecular synergistic regulation approach that combines micelle&#8208;induced nucleation and surface chemical polishing for crystallization control and defect passivation in TLP solar cells is introduced. The TLP precursor micelle&#8208;induced nucleation strategy modifies the characteristic of the micelles through hydrogen&#8208;bonding and selective coordination with 4&#8208;hydrazinylbenzonitrile hydrochloride (HBN), thereby lowering the critical nucleation concentration and accelerating the uniform and simultaneous nucleation of the perovskite. This crystallization control strategy significantly enhances the quality of TLP films and suppresses defect introduction during the uncontrollable film formation process. The surface chemical polishing strategy entails the passivation of TLP interface defects with hydrazine&#8208;based phenylsulfonamide hydrochloride (HSA), inhibiting the oxidation of divalent tin and optimizing charge carrier extraction at the interface. Ultimately, a TLP solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 24.01% is achieved, and the encapsulated device exhibits an T80 value of 391 h under prolonged illumination.

         <title>Lighting Up the Non&#8208;conjugated Polymers in Full Color via Domino&#8208;Effect Triggered Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;emissive polymers are &#8220;light up&#8221; by constructing a supramolecular domino statistically composed of a fluorophore (domino trigger) and multiple non&#8208;emissive polymers (dominoes). Introducing a trace amount of fluorophore into the polymer matrix results in new amplified, redshifted emissions. Notably, the higher the polymer concentration, the stronger the redshifted emissions, well resembling the signal amplification of a domino chain reaction.









Abstract
Non&#8208;conjugated polymers are typically non&#8208;emissive due to their wide energy gaps and limited light absorption. However, activating non&#8208;conjugated (bio)polymers with tunable emissions and dynamic responsive behaviors is essential for applications in diagnostics, data protection, and more. Conventional methods not only suffer harsh reaction conditions and undesirable by&#8208;products but also change the structural integrity of the original polymers. Here, non&#8208;emissive polymers are proposed to &#8220;light up&#8221; by constructing a supramolecular domino statistically composed of a fluorophore (domino trigger) and multiple non&#8208;emissive polymer chains (dominoes). Through&#8208;space conjugation of pendant unsaturated repeating units on the polymer chains promotes efficient electron delocalization and narrows the molecular energy gap. Introducing a trace amount of fluorophore into the polymer matrix triggers charge transfer between the fluorophore and polymers, resulting in new amplified and redshifted emissions compared to the intrinsic emission of fluorophores. Notably, the higher the polymer concentration, the stronger the redshifted emissions, well resembling the signal amplification of a domino chain reaction. Furthermore, the emission wavelength can be readily tuned by varying the fluorophore structure, polymer molecular weight, and chemical structure. This work opens a new door to creating fluorescent materials in a scalable and cost&#8208;effective manner, and finds broad potential applications in imaging, sensing, and data protection.

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Adaptive Structure Evolution Under Volume Fluctuation Toward High&#8208;Performance Silicon&#8208;Based Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural changes of silicon&#8208;based anode materials remain inevitable under significant volume fluctuations. By combining rational structure design and multi&#8208;scale characterizations, an advanced in situ adaptive evolution mechanism of silicon&#8208;based anode is demonstrated. Based on this mechanism, as&#8208;designed Si@h&#8208;SiOx/C delivers excellent electrochemical performances in both half and pouch cells.








Abstract
Alloy&#8208;type anodes have become the most promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;dense lithium&#8208;ion batteries, but structural collapse caused by intrinsic volume fluctuation is the key bottleneck to their practical applications. Herein, an innovative self&#8208;adaptive structural evolution strategy toward electrochemically stable Si&#8208;based alloy&#8208;type anode is proposed, which breaks the conventional ideas that pursue the immutability of the initial structure. Particularly, interconnected commercial Si nanoparticles are covalently coated by amorphous homogeneous composite SiOx/C (h&#8208;SiOx/C) layer, forming a &#8220;pea&#8208;like&#8221; core&#8211;shell structure. After charge&#8211;discharge cycling, as&#8208;designed Si@h&#8208;SiOx/C evolves into a more stable micro&#8208;sized &#8220;spherical&#8208;like&#8221; particle with Si always well protected by h&#8208;SiOx/C layer.

     alt="In Situ Self-Adaptive Structure Evolution Under Volume Fluctuation Toward High-Performance Silicon-Based Anode"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structural changes of silicon-based anode materials remain inevitable under significant volume fluctuations. By combining rational structure design and multi-scale characterizations, an advanced in situ adaptive evolution mechanism of silicon-based anode is demonstrated. Based on this mechanism, as-designed Si@h-SiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/C delivers excellent electrochemical performances in both half and pouch cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alloy-type anodes have become the most promising candidates for the next-generation energy-dense lithium-ion batteries, but structural collapse caused by intrinsic volume fluctuation is the key bottleneck to their practical applications. Herein, an innovative self-adaptive structural evolution strategy toward electrochemically stable Si-based alloy-type anode is proposed, which breaks the conventional ideas that pursue the immutability of the initial structure. Particularly, interconnected commercial Si nanoparticles are covalently coated by amorphous homogeneous composite SiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/C (h-SiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/C) layer, forming a &#8220;pea-like&#8221; core&#8211;shell structure. After charge&#8211;discharge cycling, as-designed Si@h-SiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/C evolves into a more stable micro-sized &#8220;spherical-like&#8221; particle with Si always well protected by h-SiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/C layer. Furthermore, inner SEI microdomains and cavities are also formed, which can provide rapid transport pathways for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and accommodation space for volume expansion, respectively. Accordingly, Si@h-SiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/C displays excellent performances in both half and full pouch cells. 3D reconstruction, in situ optical microscopy and finite element simulations have been conducted to deeply analyze the structural self-adaptive mechanism.

         <title>Neutrophil/Leukemia&#8208;Tropic Dual&#8208;Drug Nanomedicine Potentiates the Treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is fatal to most patients due to limited targeted treatments and inferior drug delivery to the bone marrow. This study presents a neutrophil/leukemia&#8208;tropic polymersome vincristine/volasertib dual&#8208;drug nanoformulation (NLP&#8208;Vi/Vo) that selectively binds to leukemia cells, homes to bone marrow by hitchhiking on neutrophils, and ratiometrically delivers drugs, leading to complete remission in different AML mouse models.








Abstract
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) poses severe clinical challenges due to its heterogeneity and the scattered nature of therapeutic targets. Moreover, suboptimal drug delivery to the bone marrow, combined with the protective effects of the niche that shelters residual leukemia cells, frequently underlies chemotherapy failure and relapse. Here, a neutrophil/leukemia&#8208;tropic polymersome vincristine/volasertib dual&#8208;drug nanoformulation (NLP&#8208;Vi/Vo) is reported to selectively bind to leukemia cells and neutrophils, and to ratiometrically release clinical chemotherapeutics and a polo&#8208;like kinase 1 inhibitor, thereby potentiating the treatment of AML. NLP&#8208;Vi/Vo induces synergistic anti&#8208;AML effects by sensitizing AML to chemotherapy, and homes to bone marrow by hitchhiking on neutrophils, cooperatively depleting leukemia in both the bloodstream and bone marrow. NLP&#8208;Vi/Vo shows excellent therapeutic efficacy in malignant murine AML and human AML xenograft models. Collectively, neutrophil/leukemia&#8208;directing dual&#8208;drug nanomedicines offer a promising treatment strategy for AML.

         <dc:description>
The integrated design strategy of &#8220;material&#8208;properties to geometry&#8208;fabrication to device&#8208;functionality&#8221; is realized based on 3D&#8208;printed PMN&#8208;PT ceramics for an ultrasonic transducer. The piezoelectric coefficient d33 reaches 1285 pC&#160;N&#8722;1, which represents the highest value reported in 3D&#8208;printed piezoelectric ceramics to date. Furthermore, the transducer demonstrates exceptional performance with a bandwidth of 60%, a peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak voltage of 952 mV, and improved imaging resolutions.








Abstract
3D printing has demonstrated irreplaceable advantages on rapid prototyping and flexible shaping of piezoelectric ceramic fabrication. However, several factors such as microstructure, densification, inferior electrical properties, and practical device design, significantly limit the applications of 3D&#8208;printed piezoelectric ceramics. In this work, a method of utilizing the digital light processing technique to manufacture high&#8208;performance piezoelectric Sm&#8208;PMN&#8208;PT ceramics with complex geometries for devices application is realized. The piezoelectric coefficient d33 of 1285 pC N&#8722;1 is achieved, which represents the highest value reported to date among all 3D&#8208;printed piezoelectric ceramics. Furthermore, an ultrasonic transducer annular array, which is challenging to achieve using traditional manufacture techniques, is designed and fabricated through 3D printing. The transducer demonstrates exceptional performance with a large bandwidth of 60%, a high peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak voltage of 952&#160;mV, and improved imaging resolutions. Notably, the superior performance establishes a new benchmark in the achievable device level for 3D&#8208;printed ultrasonic transducers. These results highlight the significant potential of 3D&#8208;printed piezoelectric ceramics and complex structures on devices, showcasing their capability to fulfill specific needs and requirements.

         <title>Dynamic Ni&#8211;O Bonding Induced by Orbital Degeneracy Breaking for Efficient Li2CO3 Decomposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a coordination symmetry strategy that breaks the Ni d&#8208;orbital degeneracy, elevating the dz2, dxz, and dyz orbitals for strong overlap with the Li2CO3 O&#8208;pz orbitals. The resulting dynamic Ni&#8211;O coupling governs the reversible Li2CO3 decomposition, enabling uniform nucleation and facile breakdown. This orbital&#8208;level regulation delivers low overpotentials and exceptional cycling stability in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.








Abstract
Lithium carbonate, the primary discharge product in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries with high thermodynamic stability and a wide band gap, leads to significant electrochemical inertness, limiting efficiency and cycle life. The strongly delocalized pz orbital at a lower&#8208;energy HOMO level in Li2CO3 causes weak coupling with the O&#8208;pz orbitals, increasing decomposition resistance owing to d&#8208;orbital degeneracy in high&#8208;local&#8208;symmetry catalysts. This study introduces metastable tetragonal&#8208;pyramidal nickel sulfide (tp&#8208;NiS) with low&#8208;symmetry NiS5 coordination, breaking d&#8208;orbital degeneracy and bringing dz2, dxz, and dyz orbitals closer to the Fermi level. Enhanced orbital overlap with Li2CO3 O&#8208;pz orbitals facilitates robust Ni&#8211;O bond formation. In situ spectroscopy confirms reversible Ni&#8211;O bond formation during cycling, ensuring electron transfer and complete Li2CO3 decomposition. Conversely, weak interfacial interactions in octahedral NiS with highly symmetric local coordination only allow decomposition&#8208;resistant Li2CO3 and interface passivation. Consequently, tp&#8208;NiS exhibits superior electrochemical performance, with the best reported reversibility and stability, a charge potential below 4.0&#160;V, and 92.03% capacity retention after 1800&#160;h. This metal redox&#8208;driven mechanism establishes a reversible geometric conversion pathway, emphasizing the critical role of symmetry&#8208;engineered Ni&#8211;O interactions in bifunctional catalysts.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Sulfite Electrolytes for Stable Sodium Metal Batteries with a Low N/P Ratio</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolytes for sodium metal batteries (SMBs) with a low N/P ratio are strategically designed by optimizing the electrolyte solvents and constructing a stable solid electrolyte interphase. The dual&#8208;sulfite electrolyte enables a higher solvent coordination number, promoting the formation of a favored solvent&#8208;derived, inorganic&#8208;dominant SEI, enabling stable operation of SMBs with a low N/P ratio.








Abstract
Grasping the intricacies of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on sodium (Na) metal anodes is critical for developing sodium metal batteries (SMBs). Conventional carbonate electrolytes suffer from poor Na compatibility, forming organic&#8208;rich SEIs that degrade cycling stability. Here, A dual&#8208;sulfite electrolyte (DSE) is presented, where the synergistic effect of sp3 hybridization in &#8211;SO3 and p2&#8211;pd hybridization in S&#9552;O enables a higher solvent coordination number, promoting the formation of a favored solvent&#8208;derived, inorganic&#8208;dominant SEI. The designed DSE accelerates the passivation process of Na anodes, yielding sulfide complexes in the SEI layer. As a result, paired with a high&#8208;loading layered oxide cathode (NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2, 2.6&#8201;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and thin Na (100&#8201;&#181;m), the DSE enables SMBs to achieve an 85% capacity retention after 450 cycles at an N/P ratio of 4.3. Even with thinner Na (50 &#181;m, N/P = 2.2), the cell retains 86% capacity after 200 cycles.

Here, A dual-sulfite electrolyte (DSE) is presented, where the synergistic effect of sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybridization in &#8211;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;pd hybridization in S&#9552;O enables a higher solvent coordination number, promoting the formation of a favored solvent-derived, inorganic-dominant SEI. The designed DSE accelerates the passivation process of Na anodes, yielding sulfide complexes in the SEI layer. As a result, paired with a high-loading layered oxide cathode (NaNi&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 2.6&#8201;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and thin Na (100&#8201;&#181;m), the DSE enables SMBs to achieve an 85% capacity retention after 450 cycles at an N/P ratio of 4.3. Even with thinner Na (50 &#181;m, N/P = 2.2), the cell retains 86% capacity after 200 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Characterization of Complex Stacking of Semiconductors Through Near Field Imaging and Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SNOM imaging and spectroscopy on a mechanically cleaved facet is used to characterize the different layers of complex epitaxial heterostructures composed of a type II superlattice and highly doped semiconductors. Both the geometrical parameters of the stack and the optical properties of the individual layers and of the interfaces are retrieved, as well as the doping level of the heavily doped semiconductors.








Abstract
While high operating temperature infrared photodetection remains a major technological objective, huge improvements have been obtained through the use of increasingly complex semiconductors epitaxies such as quantum cascade structures or III&#8211;V superlattice junction. However, the characterization of these layers is challenging and often requires the use of destructive processes. Here, SNOM imaging and spectroscopy on a mechanically cleaved facet is used to characterize the different layers of a complex epitaxial heterostructure composed of a type II superlattice and highly doped semiconductors. These near&#8208;field experimental data are compared to simulation in order to retrieve both the cut&#8208;off frequency of the superlattice and the doping level of each highly doped semiconductor layers. Additionally, information about interfaces is optically retrieved through hyperspectral characterization of plasmons propagating at these vertical interfaces. In parallel, all the materials and exact stacking of the epitaxy are confirmed through scanning transmission electron&#160;microscopy.

         <title>Field&#8208;Free Superconducting Diode Enabled by Geometric Asymmetry and Perpendicular Magnetization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong field&#8208;free superconducting diode effect (SDE) in Pt/Co/Nb heterostructures are demonstrated and achieved by combining engineered geometric asymmetry with stray fields from a perpendicularly magnetized Co layer. The devices reach 54% field&#8208;free diode efficiency&#8212;the highest reported for simple, fully CMOS&#8208;compatible ferromagnet/superconductor multilayers made by standard thin&#8208;film processes.








Abstract
The superconducting diode effect (SDE), which manifests as directional, dissipationless supercurrents, is pivotal for realizing energy&#8208;efficient superconducting logic and memory technologies. However, achieving high&#8208;efficiency SDE without external magnetic fields remains a fundamental challenge. In this study, a strongly enhanced, field&#8208;free SDE in Pt/Co/Nb heterostructures are proposed, enabled by the interplay of engineered geometric asymmetry and stray fields from a perpendicularly magnetized Co layer. This configuration promotes directional vortex entry and spatially selective pinning, yielding diode efficiencies that exceed all previously reported field&#8208;free values in ferromagnet/superconductor multilayers. Temperature&#8208; and field&#8208;dependent transport measurements, supported by micromagnetic simulations, reveal that the enhanced nonreciprocity results from three cooperative mechanisms: asymmetric vortex entry, localized magnetic pinning, and Lorentz&#8208;force imbalance. These findings establish a CMOS&#8208;compatible platform for high&#8208;performance superconducting rectifiers, offering new opportunities for cryogenic spintronics and quantum electronics.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Design Strategies for Efficient Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents advances in bioinspired atmospheric water harvesting systems, emphasizing how structural motifs such as wettability gradients, directional transport, and hierarchical porosity have been translated into engineered fog&#8208;collection and vapor&#8208;sorption strategies for enhanced water uptake, accelerated transport, and energy&#8208;efficient release. It outlines the design principles that bridge biological inspiration with practical, scalable solutions to address the global water challenges.








Abstract
The accelerating global scarcity of freshwater, driven by rapid economic growth, environmental degradation, and climate change, has heightened the urgency for the development of advanced atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) strategies. Earth's atmosphere contains an enormous reservoir of &#8776;13 trillion tons of water, exceeding the volume of all accessible surface freshwater, yet it remains vastly underutilized. Effectively utilizing the atmospheric water requires efficient capture and release strategies that can function under diverse climatic conditions. Through millions of years, organisms in both arid and humid environments have evolved specialized structures or surfaces to capture water directly from the atmosphere. This review highlights recent advances in bioinspired AWH systems, emphasizing how structural motifs such as wettability gradients, directional transport, and hierarchical porosity are translated into engineered fog&#8208;collection and vapor&#8208;sorption systems, leading to enhanced water uptake, accelerated transport, and energy&#8208;efficient release. By integrating insights from various complementary approaches, the design principles and fabrication strategies that bridge biological inspiration with practical, high&#8208;efficiency AWH for scalable solutions to address the global water challenges are outlined.

         <title>Facilitating Electrochemical Overall Water Splitting Through Tailoring Halloysite Nanoclay&#8208;Based Nanoarchitectonics of Ionic Environment and Gas&#8208;Bubble Wettability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current design introduces halloysite nanoclay&#8208;based nanoarchitectonics for tailoring ionic environment and gas&#8208;bubble wettability at electrode surface. Extremely bubble repellent coatings decorated with cationic moiety boosts HER by polarizing water around electrode surface, and anionic moiety improves OER via facilitating OH&#8722;availability, leading to a substantial reduction in overpotentials for respective gas evolution reactions. This strategy provides a facile and general principle for improving electrochemical overall water splitting by tailoring ionic environment and gas bubble wettability of working electrodes.








Abstract
Unwanted gas bubble adhesion at the electrode surface and its unfavorable microenvironment compromise water splitting performance by perturbing the access of electrolytes and electron transfer processes. While reported bubble&#8208;repellent coatings promote an early detachment of gas bubbles&#8212;they mostly fail to provide a favorable ionic microenvironment for overall electrochemical water&#8208;splitting. Here, it has experimentally and theoretically validated the impact of the synergistic association of bubble repellence and selective ionic environments on water splitting performance. Halloysite nanoclay&#8208;based coating with tailored ionic environment and gas&#8208;bubble wettability on nickel foam (NF) ensured a superior performance for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) in alkaline medium (1&#160;M KOH). Superaerophobic coatings on NF with cationic modifiers boost HER by polarizing water around the electrode surface, and anionic modifiers improve OER via facilitating OH&#8722; availability, leading to 42% and 30% lower overpotentials at a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Eventually, it improves gas production by &gt;60% compared to bare NF in alkaline conditions at a given potential. This strategy lowers the cell voltage required for overall water splitting by 500 &#177; 6&#160;mV while sustaining a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Micelle&#8208;Like Electrolyte Design for 4.6 V Li||NCM811 Cells Workable at 70&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the amphiphilic nature of surfactants, a micelle&#8208;like electrolyte is proposed by anchoring lithiophobic non&#8208;polar segments to lithiophilic polar solvents. The strong intramolecular interactions from anchoring segments not only markedly whittle the solvation ability of polar solvents, but also elevate their flash point. With the as&#8208;designed electrolyte, the Li||NCM811 full cell demonstrates significantly improved cycling stability and high&#8208;temperature tolerance.








Abstract
Localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCE) feature satisfactory anode compatibility for lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). However, their application under high charging cut&#8208;off voltages and elevated temperatures still remains limited due to the electrochemical and thermal instabilities of solvents within the solvation sheath. Herein, we design a micelle&#8208;like electrolyte (QMLE) with a low anion&#8208;to&#8208;solvent ratio (0.3) and diluent&#8208;to&#8208;solvent ratio (1.3), achieved by regulating the length and type of non&#8208;solvating alkyl and fluorinated segments grafted onto polar ethyltrimethoxysilane (ETMOS) solvents, pushing the performance boundaries of LHCE. In this electrolyte, strong intramolecular interactions from the &#8722;CF3 anchoring segments not only markedly whittle the solvation ability of the ETMOS but also elevate its flash point, thereby facilitating the formation of the anion&#8208;dominated solvation sheaths and the improvement of high&#8208;temperature tolerance of the QMLE. With the help of the QMLE, Li||Cu cell delivers a high coulombic efficiency of 98.5% at 3 mA cm&#8722;2 and 3 mAh cm&#8722;2. The newly assembled Li||NCM811 (11.5 mg cm&#8722;2) cell achieves stable operation under a high charging cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6 V and a high&#8208;temperature range from 30&#160;&#176;C to 70&#160;&#176;C. This study presents a versatile and scalable electrolyte design strategy for high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;temperature LMBs.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the amphiphilic nature of surfactants, a micelle-like electrolyte is proposed by anchoring lithiophobic non-polar segments to lithiophilic polar solvents. The strong intramolecular interactions from anchoring segments not only markedly whittle the solvation ability of polar solvents, but also elevate their flash point. With the as-designed electrolyte, the Li||NCM811 full cell demonstrates significantly improved cycling stability and high-temperature tolerance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Localized high-concentration electrolytes (LHCE) feature satisfactory anode compatibility for lithium (Li)-metal batteries (LMBs). However, their application under high charging cut-off voltages and elevated temperatures still remains limited due to the electrochemical and thermal instabilities of solvents within the solvation sheath. Herein, we design a micelle-like electrolyte (QMLE) with a low anion-to-solvent ratio (0.3) and diluent-to-solvent ratio (1.3), achieved by regulating the length and type of non-solvating alkyl and fluorinated segments grafted onto polar ethyltrimethoxysilane (ETMOS) solvents, pushing the performance boundaries of LHCE. In this electrolyte, strong intramolecular interactions from the &#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; anchoring segments not only markedly whittle the solvation ability of the ETMOS but also elevate its flash point, thereby facilitating the formation of the anion-dominated solvation sheaths and the improvement of high-temperature tolerance of the QMLE. With the help of the QMLE, Li||Cu cell delivers a high coulombic efficiency of 98.5% at 3 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 3 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The newly assembled Li||NCM811 (11.5 mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) cell achieves stable operation under a high charging cut-off voltage of 4.6 V and a high-temperature range from 30&#160;&#176;C to 70&#160;&#176;C. This study presents a versatile and scalable electrolyte design strategy for high-voltage and high-temperature LMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quasi&#8208;2D Morphologies of a Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptor Y6 by Interfacial Assembly via Langmuir&#8211;Schaefer Technique</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely assembled quasi&#8208;2D Y6 molecular layers at the air&#8208;water interface via the Langmuir&#8211;Schaefer technique yields ultrathin organic thin&#8208;film transistors with promising charge carrier mobilities, highlighting the potential of interfacial assembly for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Supramolecular organization governs the structure and optoelectronic properties of organic thin films. This study shows that films based on the non&#8208;fullerene acceptor Y6 can be precisely structured via assembly at the air&#8208;water interface. Theoretical cross&#8208;sectional areas, Langmuir isotherms, and Brewster angle microscopy reveal that Y6, despite its complex structure, is sufficiently amphiphilic to form well&#8208;defined 2D&#160;layers. Mechanical annealing through repeated compression&#8208;expansion cycles systematically improves structural uniformity, as evidenced by narrower in situ detected fluorescence spectra, while simultaneously shifting the maximum of the compressional modulus toward denser packing. Compared to spin&#8208;cast films, Langmuir&#8211;Schaefer (LS) layers exhibit a significantly reduced Stokes shift, suggesting less reorganization after photoexcitation and thus a higher supramolecular order. Organic thin&#8208;film transistors (OTFTs) fabricated using the LS technique achieve mobilities comparable to those of spin&#8208;cast films, despite being substantially thinner (&#8804;&#160;3&#160;nm, determined by atomic force microscopy), thus requiring considerably less material. Notably, Y6&#8208;LS OTFTs outperform previously reported polymer&#8208;based LS&#8208;OTFTs by one order of magnitude in charge carrier mobility. This work highlights the potential of interfacial assembly for thin film fabrication and underscores the advantages of mechanical annealing and in situ spectroscopy to enhance the performance of organic optoelectronic devices.

Abstract
The discovery of Bi2Te3 semiconducting alloys in the 1950s catalyzed advancements in the development of compact Peltier cooling devices for solid&#8208;state active temperature control. Recently, thermoelectric power generators based on the Seebeck effect have been explored as a means to recover ubiquitous waste heat for enhanced energy efficiency. However, it has become increasingly clear that the competitiveness and market viability of these devices are largely limited to near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature operation. In this perspective, a timely, application&#8208;oriented framework is provided for evaluating and selecting materials with favorable near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature Seebeck, Peltier, and Thomson effects. By integrating materials&#8208;level innovations, performance optimization strategies, and device&#8208;level considerations, promising candidates are highlighted, critical scientific challenges are identified, and actionable directions are proposed to accelerate the translation of thermoelectric materials into next&#8208;generation commercial devices with improved performance.

         <title>Tuning Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline Catalytic Interfaces by Mechanochemistry: Cu&#8208;Based Metallic Glasses Coupled with Ceria for CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ball&#8208;milling Cu&#8208;based metallic glasses with ceria creates a unique nanostructure where metallic glass particles are wrapped by CeO2 nanoparticles. The intimate integration triggers copper state reorganization during reaction and aging, boosting CO oxidation and COPrOx activity. This mechanochemical strategy opens new possibilities for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts from unconventional amorphous&#8208;crystalline interfaces.








Abstract
Amorphous metallic alloys, with their liquid&#8208;like atomic&#8208;scale structure, are promising candidates for developing unprecedented heterogeneous catalysts due to their non&#8208;equilibrium, highly disordered state. This study explores the combination of copper&#8208;based metallic glasses with crystalline ceria as catalysts for CO oxidation and preferential CO oxidation. The amorphous/crystalline interfaces are synthesized mechanochemically, offering a cost&#8208;effective alternative to the use of precious metals while maintaining high catalytic activity. Key parameters of the ball milling process are optimized, namely milling time and frequency, to enhance the interaction between the disordered metal and crystalline ceria, and the new catalysts are thoroughly characterized using ex situ techniques (XRD, DSC, HAADF&#8208;STEM&#8208;EDX, H2&#8208;TPR, Raman spectroscopy, and XPS), and under operando conditions (XAFS and NEXAFS). These analyses reveal that the amorphous/crystalline architectures play a crucial role in catalytic performance. The results show that combining amorphous Cu&#8208;based metallic glasses with crystalline CeO2 delivers remarkable catalytic activity in preferential CO oxidation (T50 = 115&#160;&#176;C; 43.1 &#177; 0.4&#160;mol CO2 min&#8722;1 gcatalyst&#8722;1), pointing to a sustainable and efficient design strategy of catalysts. This approach reduces reliance on noble metals while leveraging the synergy between structural disorder and crystallinity, thereby opening new directions for next&#8208;generation catalyst development.

         <title>Tannin&#8208;Mediated Ischemia&#8208;Homing&#8208;Angiogenesis Nanodots (IHAND) for Synergistic Angiogenesis and Heart Failure Prevention Post&#8208;Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nanomaterial (IHAND) synthesized in this study exhibits potent antioxidant properties. Following tail vein injection, IHAND precisely targets CD31 ligands on vascular endothelial cells (VECs) and macrophages within myocardial infarction tissue (a,b). It simultaneously restores VECs' luminal formation capacity, promotes secretion of angiogenic factors, and clears inflammatory factors. This approach continuously enhances cardiac function recovery while inhibiting fibrosis progression (c).








Abstract
Insufficient angiogenic response in the early stage of myocardial infarction (MI) mediates the progression from MI to heart failure. The angiogenic response mainly involves two key cell types: vascular endothelial cells (VECs) and macrophages. However, current efforts to restore angiogenesis cannot achieve co&#8208;intervention of VECs and macrophages, which limits their clinical application. This study presents the first ischemia&#8208;homing&#8208;angiogenesis nanodots (IHAND) that simultaneously modulate VECs and macrophages to achieve efficient angiogenesis in MI tissues. IHAND is a potent composite antioxidant nanomedicine coated with tannic acid (TA) that can simultaneously achieve synergistic effects of repairing the tube&#8208;forming ability of VECs, promoting the secretion of angiogenic factors, and eliminating inflammatory factors. For the first time it is revealed that TA can specifically and strongly bind to the same CD31 ligand in VECs and macrophages. Accordingly, IHAND can target VECs and macrophages in MI tissues, alleviate proliferation and migration disorders of VECs, induce phenotypic transformation of macrophages in early stages of MI, significantly reduce the storm of inflammatory factors, and promote the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF&#8208;A) and platelet&#8208;derived growth factor&#8208;BB (PDGF&#8208;BB). IHAND demonstrates strong angiogenic ability in MI, and its therapeutic effect is remarkably superior to that of N&#8208;acetylcysteine and canakinumab.

Addressing the scarcity of wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donors, this work develops a novel electron&#8208;accepting unit (BCE) via chlorination/esterification of benzo[1,2&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8220;:6,5&#8208;b&#8221;']trithiophene. Copolymerized with classical electron&#8208;donating unit (BDTT), an optimized copolymer, PBCE&#8208;2, demonstrates pronounced temperature&#8208;dependent aggregation characteristics and suitable energy levels. Finally, the PBCE&#8208;2&#8208;based device delivers an extremely high PCE of 20.4%, establishing PBCE&#8208;2 as a benchmark donor in the elite &#8220;20% Efficiency Club.&#8221;








Abstract
In the realm of high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs), the scarcity of wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donor materials poses a significant challenge. To tackle this issue, an innovative breakthrough is made by introducing a chlorine atom and an ester group into the benzo[1,2&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8242;:6,5&#8208;b&#8243;]trithiophene unit, namely BCE. Using BCE as the electron&#8208;accepting unit, benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene derivative (BDTT) as the electron&#8208;donating unit, and alkyl&#8208;substituted thiophene as the bridging unit, a new class of D&#8211;A type alternating conjugated polymers are successfully synthesized. Subsequently, after systematic optimizations of the side chain length of the BDTT unit and the proportion of fluorinated BDTT, a polymer donor material, PBCE&#8208;2 is ultimately obtained, which exhibits excellent solution processability, suitable energy levels, and temperature&#8208;dependent aggregation characteristics. The binary OSC based on PBCE&#8208;2 and the well&#8208;known acceptor L8&#8208;BO demonstrates an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.2%. When a fullerene acceptor, PC71BM, is incorporated to construct a ternary OSC, the corresponding PCE is further elevated to 20.4%. This achievement marks PBCE&#8208;2 as another promising polymer donor that has joined the exclusive &#8220;20% Efficiency Club,&#8221; following in the footsteps of notable&#160;polymer donors such as PM6, D18, and their derivatives.

         <title>Structural and Interfacial Design of Atomically Thin Materials and Their Heterostructures for Advancing Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of atomically thin materials (ATMs) and their heterostructures in key electrocatalytic reactions, discussing synthesis methods, structure&#8211;property relationships, and mechanism&#8208;driven design strategies. It also highlights future directions involving structural optimization, scalable fabrication, advanced characterization, and AI&#8208;assisted materials design for enhanced catalytic performance.








Abstract
Atomically thin materials (ATMs) with a thickness of less than 5 nm are emerging as prominent catalysts in electrocatalysis. Their monolayer or few&#8208;layer thickness enables remarkable activities, ultrahigh atomic utilization, and extraordinary electronic structure. The construction of ATMs into heterostructures further introduces unconventional interfacial behaviors that may even overcome the scaling relationship that governs trade&#8208;offs between thermodynamic and kinetic performance metrics. In this review, a comprehensive discussion on ATMs and their heterostructures primarily applies to oxygen reduction reactions (ORR), oxygen evolution reactions (OER), hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), and carbon dioxide reduction reactions (CO2RR) is given. Past achievements with a timeline are first highlighted, and then key methodologies for ATMs synthesis and characterization are outlined, followed by representative categories of ATMs applied in different reactions. Their structural and electronic properties&#160;are also systematically discussed, and a series of mechanism&#8208;driven design strategies, involving vacancy, doping, defects, coordination number, phase and structure, strain, and heterostructure and interface, are summarizad. Their electrocatalytic performances, along with mechanistic insight into how different strategies modulate adsorption and catalytic behaviors, are thoroughly investigated. Finally, future perspectives for ATMs are outlined, including thickness tuning, coordination structure regulation, novel heterostructures design, scalable synthesis, practical devices integration, in situ characterization advancement, and AI&#8208;assisted materials design.

         <title>Elucidating the Donor/Acceptor Regulatory Mechanism for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CO2RR&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 activity over the functionalized copper phthalocyanines (CuPc&#8208;R) shows approximately linear relationship with the Hammett constant of the substituents. The stronger electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent corresponding to higher Hammett constant induces the decreased electronic density at the phthalocyanine center of CuPc&#8208;R, which suppresses the HER side reaction owing to reduced hydricity but enhances the CO2RR activity to CH4.








Abstract
Catalysts with Cu&#9472;Nx active sites have shown promising performance in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), but it remains elusive to systematically modulate their CO2RR activity. Herein, a series of substituted copper phthalocyanines (CuPc&#8208;R) with various electron&#8208;withdrawing/donating groups are designed to study the relationship between the CO2RR activity and the electron density at the Cu&#9472;N4 center. Notably, a positive shift of +0.27&#160;V for the reduction potential of phthalocyanine ligands is observed by changing substituents from electron&#8208;donating to stronger electron&#8208;withdrawing effect (correlated to increasing Hammett constant), owing to the decreasing electron density of phthalocyanines center. Their CO2RR&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 activity displays approximately a linear relationship with the Hammett constant, while CuPc&#8208;Cl4, with the strongest electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent, shows the maximum FECH4 of 73.7% and related jCH4 of &#8722;147.4&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The DFT calculations and in situ spectroscopic characterizations illustrate that the decreased electron density of the Cu&#9472;N4 center via strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups for CuPc&#8208;R contributes to the reduced hydricity for restricted HER activity, thus promoting the CH4 selectivity.

         <title>A Zinc Ion Capacitor&#8208;Based Fluidic Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluidic memristor based on a zinc&#8208;ion capacitor is developed. It leverages nonlinear ion dynamics in carbon nanochannels to mimic synaptic functions, demonstrating paired&#8208;pulse facilitation and depression. This work merges energy storage with ionotronic memory for bio&#8208;inspired computing.








Abstract
The intersection of electrochemistry and neuroscience offers profound insights into ionotronic systems. Here, a zinc&#8208;ion capacitor&#8208;based fluidic memristor (ZIC&#8208;FM) is presented that emulates brain&#8208;like memory functions through nonlinear ion dynamics in electrochemical capacitors. This device functions through voltage&#8208;controlled nonlinear zinc ion plating (under negative bias) and stripping (under positive bias) within its nanoporous carbon electrode architecture, generating hysteretic and history&#8208;dependent resistive switching behavior. It is shown that the ZIC&#8208;FM successfully replicates two key forms of short&#8208;term synaptic plasticity, paired&#8208;pulse facilitation (PPF) and paired&#8208;pulse depression (PPD), closely mimicking biological neural behavior. This work advances the development of fluidic neuromorphic devices that unify energy storage and ionotronic memory, opening new avenues for bio&#8208;inspired computing systems.

         <title>Solution Plasma Synthesis of High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles with Self&#8208;Limiting Oxidation for Photothermal CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel solution plasma method enables direct synthesis of high&#8208;entropy catalysts in aqueous media. The typical FeCoNiCrMn catalyst exhibits a dual&#8208;phase core&#8208;shell structure, where CrMn&#8208;rich oxides promote H2 dissociation while CoNi/Fe regions drive CO2 reduction. This synergistic configuration achieves an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude higher CO production than single&#8208;metal catalysts in photothermal CO2 hydrogenation.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A novel solution plasma method enables direct synthesis of high-entropy catalysts in aqueous media. The typical FeCoNiCrMn catalyst exhibits a dual-phase core-shell structure, where CrMn-rich oxides promote H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissociation while CoNi/Fe regions drive CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. This synergistic configuration achieves an order-of-magnitude higher CO production than single-metal catalysts in photothermal CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation.

         <title>Proton Superhighways Enabled by Hofmeister&#8208;Electrostatic Synergy in All&#8208;Inorganic Polyoxometalate Hydrogels for Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general Hofmeister&#8208;electrostatic synergy platform directs salting&#8208;in anion&#8208;mediated isopolyoxometalate&#8208;cation superstructures, forging adaptable inorganic hydrogels for next&#8208;generation intelligent devices. 








Abstract
Constructing polyoxometalate&#8208;counterion systems capable of forming precise supramolecular nanostructures is critically important but highly challenging. Here ion&#8208;specific effects are exploited to orchestrate multiscale phase transitions in isopolyoxometalate&#8208;cation supramolecular assemblies, enabling on&#8208;demand transformation from macrophase separation to nanostructured hydrogels. Gelation proceeds through ion&#8208;pair&#8208;driven charge inversion of the clusters, facilitating 1D supramolecular polymerization mediated by salting&#8208;in anions through synergistic hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. Crucially, these ion&#8208;engineered hydrogels exhibit anomalous proton conduction over a wide temperature range, enabling temperature sensors with ultra&#8208;wide operational range, high sensitivity, and great stability. Integration of these sensors enabled real&#8208;time thermal hazard mitigation in a prototype battery safety system. This work pioneers salting&#8208;in anions encapsulation in isopolyoxometalate&#8208;counterion systems to achieve inorganic soft superstructures, uncovering a previously unrecognized general Hofmeister&#8208;electrostatic assembly principle in cluster chemistry.

         <title>Magnetic Field&#8208;Driven Spin State Transformation in Promoting the Catalytic Activity of Doped Single&#8208;Atom for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferromagnetic RuSAs/Ni2P@Fe3O4 material is designed via a synergistic strategy of single&#8208;atom doping and magnetic field&#8208;driven spin&#8208;state transformation. This strategy introduces new Ru single&#8208;atom active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction and facilitates the transition of Fe3+ (3d t2g) low&#8208;spin electrons to a high&#8208;spin state (3d eg). Consequently, electron transfer to the Ru single&#8208;atom is enhanced, boosting overall catalytic efficiency.








Abstract
Developing efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) requires innovative strategies to modulate electronic structures and reaction kinetics. Herein, a ferromagnetic RuSAs/Ni2P@Fe3O4 core&#8208;shell catalyst is designed, which synergizes Ru single&#8208;atoms (SAs) doping and external magnetic field excitation. Under a 0.3 T magnetic field, RuSAs/Ni2P@Fe3O4&#8722;0.3 T achieves a remarkably low overpotential of 38.9&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 39.5&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 in alkaline media, outperforming its counterparts without magnetic stimulation. Advanced characterization (XANES, M&#246;ssbauer, EPR, SQUID) and density functional theory calculations reveal that the magnetic field induces a spin&#8208;state transition in Fe3+ (from low&#8208;spin to high&#8208;spin), enhancing interfacial charge transfer and enriching electron density around Ru SAs. These effects optimize hydrogen adsorption free energy (&#916;GH*) and reaction kinetics. The Ru SAs serve as the dominant active sites, while the spin&#8208;state reconfiguration of the Fe3O4 core under magnetic fields stabilizes the structure and accelerates electron transfer. This work unveils a dual&#8208;regulation mechanism combining atomic doping and spin engineering, offering a novel pathway for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts via electronic and magnetic synergy.

In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202508453), Xue&#8208;Feng Zhu, Fei Li, Hai&#8208;Rong Zheng, and colleagues developed an innovative super&#8208;resolution ultrasound meta&#8208;lens. Through comprehensive parameter optimization, the lens successfully overcame the diffraction limit. Furthermore, the team enhanced its longitudinal resolution via frequency&#8208;domain reconstruction. This work challenges the conventional view that meta&#8208;lens inherently suffer from limited longitudinal resolution and demonstrates considerable potential for applications in functional ultrasound imaging.

Balancing CT and LE for Dual&#8208;Function Emitters
Synergistic control of charge transfer (CT) and locally excited (LE) characters enables a molecular design that unites thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA). This approach simultaneously advances OLED efficiency and opens avenues for high&#8208;performance bioimaging. More details can be found in the Research Article by Youhei Chitose, Ja&#8208;Hon Lin, Tzu&#8208;Chau Lin, Chihaya Adachi, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202509857).

         <title>Interface Engineering and Optimization Strategies for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Batteries Based on Polymer Composite Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here the interface challenges of composite polymer electrolytes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries are delved into, innovative improvement strategies are explored, and their future industrialization is envisioned. By offering comprehensive insights, it serves as a valuable reference for researchers and engineers in the energy storage domain.








Abstract
Polymer composite electrolytes (PCEs) offer significant advantages in enhancing the safety, stability, and energy density of batteries, making them a crucial component for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage systems. However, one of the primary bottlenecks in improving the performance of PCEs lies in the interface challenge, which can be exacerbated and manifested in interface instability, side reactions, and poor interface compatibility, ultimately leading to a significant decline in ion conduction efficiency and overall battery performance of high&#8208;voltage or high&#8208;energy&#8208;density systems. Therefore, systematically analyzing the critical technical narrowing and proposing targeted solutions under high&#8208;energy&#8208;density conditions is of great significance for advancing the development of next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. Although existing strategies have shown promising results, their applicability in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries remains uncertain. In this work, a comprehensive analysis of the interface challenges associated with high&#8208;energy&#8208;density polymer batteries is performed, the feasibility of existing approaches is evaluated, and practical optimization strategies are proposed to address these critical issues. Moreover, the insights presented here provide valuable guidance for the industrial&#8208;scale production of PCEs, helping to bridge the gap between laboratory innovations and practical applications.

         <title>Advances in &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Healing Materials: Molecular Design and Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the design and development of self&#8208;healing materials mediated by host&#8211;guest (HG) interactions, with particular emphasis on cyclodextrins (CDs). Furthermore, this review highlights cutting&#8208;edge applications of &#946;CD&#8208;based self&#8208;healing materials in sensors, 3D printing, tissue engineering, anti&#8208;corrosion coating, shape memory devices, and composites, demonstrating their adaptability to modern technological demands.








Abstract
Supramolecular self&#8208;healing (SH) materials have gained considerable attention for their ability to autonomously repair damage, thereby improving the longevity and performance of various systems. This review focuses on the design and development of SH materials mediated by host&#8211;guest (HG) interactions, with particular emphasis on cyclodextrins (CDs). Owing to their biocompatibility and excellent inclusion complexation capabilities, CDs&#8212;especially &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;CD)&#8212;play a key role in constructing HG&#8208;based SH systems. Recent progress in &#946;CD&#8208;based SH hydrogels for biomedical applications such as drug delivery, wound healing, and tissue engineering is discussed. In addition to healthcare, their application in smart coatings&#8212;including anti&#8208;fogging, fresh&#8208;keeping, and anti&#8208;corrosion layers&#8212;is reviewed. These materials are also integrated into sensors, demonstrating adaptability for real&#8208;time environmental and physiological monitoring. Emerging strategies involving 3D printing and shape memory functionalities further broaden their design potential. Despite these advances, challenges remain&#8212;particularly in scalability, environmental sensitivity, and achieving a balance between mechanical strength and healing efficiency. This review critically examines these limitations and highlights future directions, emphasizing the need for innovative fabrication approaches and interdisciplinary collaboration. By leveraging the unique properties of supramolecular interactions, &#946;CD&#8208;based SH materials offer promising solutions for a wide range of biomedical, industrial, and environmental applications.

         <title>Failure Mechanisms and Practical Optimizations for Ah&#8208;Scale Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, a comparative dissection of coin cells versus pouch cells is systematically conducted, identifying key challenges when scale&#8208;up. Furthermore, the multiscale failure mechanisms in pouch cells are deeply analyzed. Based on these insights, the practicality&#8208;oriented strategies are proposed to address the practical demands of Ah&#8208;scale pouch cells.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are emerging as a key technology for the safe, low&#8208;cost, and environmentally friendly large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. While the research on coin cells has achieved significant advancements, the failure mechanisms and design strategies of pouch cells that hold great practical potentiality, remain relatively underexplored. This review aims to fill this gap via providing an in&#8208;depth exploration of the failure mechanisms and practical optimizations of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion pouch cells. A comparative analysis between coin cells and pouch cells is conducted in terms of the research status, bridging principles, and configuration&#8208;specific distinctions. Further interpretation of failure mechanisms at both electrodes and device is systematically discussed; these include the instability associated with cathode and anode, and the device&#8208;scale failures such as current collector and binder degradation, interfacial mismatch, and packaging&#8208;induced defects. The practicality&#8208;oriented strategies for Ah&#8208;scale pouch cells are further proposed. The final section advocates that future research should emphasize high&#8208;loading and large&#8208;area design, enhancement of kinetic performance, and tolerance to extreme operating conditions. This review contributes the theoretical insight and practical guidance to Ah&#8208;scale aqueous zinc&#8208;ion pouch cell technologies, which are expected to promote their application in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems.

         <title>A Ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;Bottle Strategy: Crosslinking Amines and Epoxides inside MOF Pores for Enhanced CO2 Capture Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; strategy is used to grow oligomers inside of a MOF by crosslinking alkylamines with epoxides within the pores of Cr&#8208;BDC. When tested in postcombustion carbon capture applications, the composites show excellent performance with high CO2 adsorption capacity, exceptional CO2/N2 selectivity, and enhanced stability over 100 adsorption/desorption cycles. The crosslinking strategy effectively prevents amine leaching and degradation, making the composites more stable than the MOF containing non&#8208;crosslinked alkylamines amines.








Abstract
This study introduces a &#8220;ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle&#8221; technique to impregnate porous supports with amines via a straightforward in situ polymerization process. Specifically, alkylamines&#8212;tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (TAEA) and tetraethylene pentamine (TEPA)&#8212;are crosslinked with epoxides&#8212;trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether (TMPTE) and 1,3&#8208;butadiene diepoxide (BDE)&#8212;within the pores of the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) Cr&#8208;BDC (also MIL&#8208;101(Cr), where BDC = 1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate), producing four distinct MOF&#8208;polymer composites. These composites are subsequently evaluated for their efficacy in postcombustion carbon capture, examining metrics such as CO2 capacity, CO2/N2 selectivity, isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption, kinetic breakthrough times, and cyclability. Among the composites, Cr&#8208;BDC&#8208;TAEA&#8208;BDE (branched&#8208;linear) demonstrates the most promising results, achieving a CO2 capacity of 2.2&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 0.15&#160;bar and 313 K, a CO2/N2 selectivity of 301, and an isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption of &#8722;110&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1. This composite also exhibits superior breakthrough performance, with N2/CO2 separation times of 103 and 143 min per gram under dry and humid conditions, respectively. Furthermore, the four MOF&#8208;polymer composites are subjected to up to 100 temperature swing adsorption/desorption&#160;cycles (at 313 and 393 K, respectively), revealing minimal amine leaching or degradation over time. Notably, the composites also show significantly enhanced cyclability compared to Cr&#8208;BDC impregnated with amines without epoxide crosslinking agents; this indicates that crosslinking inhibits amine leaching.

         <title>A Generalizable Fluorescence Sensor Platform for Sample Preparation&#8208;Free Protein Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular fluorescence sensor platform enables single&#8208;step, sample preparation&#8208;free detection of protein analytes in complex samples. The design uses HaloTag to tether a fluorogenic dye to a nanobody, where target binding promotes dye activation and fluorescence. This generalizable system achieves picomolar sensitivity across diverse targets and offers a simple, plug&#8208;and&#8208;play format for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics.








Abstract
Modern molecular detection assays such as enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) offer excellent sensitivity and specificity, but typically require multiple reagents and extensive sample preparation, limiting their usefulness as rapid diagnostics. A generalizable biosensor platform is introduced that enables single&#8208;step, sample preparation&#8208;free detection of protein analytes with high sensitivity in complex samples. The NanoFluor system employs Janelia Fluor dyes coupled to a nanobody via HaloTag conjugation with a flexible glycine&#8208;serine linker, where the dye undergoes a switch from a non&#8208;fluorescent to a fluorescent state when the coupled nanobody binds to its target. It is demonstrated that the NanoFluor design achieves detection limits as low as picomolar concentrations across diverse protein targets. Molecular dynamics simulations, coupled with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics computational models, reveal the mechanistic basis for the fluorescence change, and demonstrate the feasibility of multiplexed detection in complex samples including undiluted serum. This versatile, simple biosensor design can prove valuable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics and other molecular detection applications.

         <title>Robust Hydrogel Sensors Induced by Intermolecular Mechanical Interlocking of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Non&#8208;Invasive Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust hydrogel sensors have been constructed using covalent organic frameworks and polyacrylamide; the intermolecular mechanical interlocking promotes energy dissipation and ion transport, resulting in superior strength, high toughness, and high ionic conductivity, holding great promise for non&#8208;invasive health monitoring.








Abstract
The compromise of tensile strength and toughness is essential for conductive hydrogels to enhance their cycling stability and mechanical durability in wearable strain sensors. It is effective but challenging to balance energy dissipation. Herein, a new strategy based on the intermolecular mechanical interlocking of the hydrogels has been proposed for improving their tensile strength and toughness. The hydrogels are readily fabricated through non&#8208;covalently threading linear polymer chains into covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The mechanical interlocking between polyacrylamide and COFs significantly promotes the energy dissipation with synchronous increment of ion transport, which endows hydrogels with superior mechanical performance and high conductivity. The tensile strength, toughness, and ionic conductivity are as high as 0.19 &#177; 0.03 MPa, 2.11 &#177; 0.33 MJ m&#8722;3 and 2.30 &#177; 0.55 S m&#8722;1, respectively, which greatly surpass those in the polyacrylamide counterpart and rank the top in the reported hydrogels. The resultant hydrogel sensor achieves a fast strain response of 4.8 ms and high cyclic stability over 100 cycles, and could non&#8208;invasively monitor human health. This work provides one promising approach to the construction of robust hydrogels based on COFs for the development of advanced wearable sensors.

         <dc:description>
Tunable nucleation growth of large&#8208;area monolayer p&#8208;type semiconductor films is achieved by controlling the precursor evaporation area via atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition. The device array fabricated with as&#8208;grown monolayer film exhibits high electrical performance of 48&#160;&#177;&#160;16&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 mobilities and &#8776;108 on/off ratio, exhibiting competitive electrical performance compared with most of the reported TMDC&#8208;based transistors.








Abstract
2D semiconductors open new avenues in the post&#8208;Moore era for semiconductor technologies immune from the short&#8208;channel effect due to their atomic&#8208;scale thicknesses and dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surfaces. However, it still remains a big challenge to obtain large&#8208;area and high&#8208;quality monolayer p&#8208;type semiconductors so far. Herein, a controlled nucleation is realized by tuning the evaporation areas of Se precursors during the p&#8208;type WSe2 growth. By optimizing the nucleation density, centimeter&#8208;scale uniform monolayer WSe2 and Nb&#8208;incorporated WSe2 films are synthesized. The field effect transistor array based on WSe2 film exhibits p&#8208;type behavior with hole mobilities of 34&#160;&#177;&#160;17&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 and an average on/off ratio of 4&#160;&#215;&#160;107, which can be further improved by Nb incorporation with much higher hole mobility of 48&#160;&#177;&#160;16&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 with an average on/off ratio of &#8776;108. The work paves the way for synthesizing large&#8208;scale uniform 2D p&#8208;type semiconductors for electrical devices and integrated circuits.

         <title>Nonlinear Optical Response in Layer&#8208;Stacked Gallenene with Ferroelectric Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metals are utilized in applications ranging from soft robotics to conductive inks, owing to their physical properties providing distinct mechanical, electrical, and thermal advantages. This work uses classical material science techniques to characterize ferroelectric polarization in supercooled liquid gallium and utilizes second harmonic generation imaging for further perturbation analysis.








Abstract
Polar metals are very rare and challenging to realize due to the incompatibility of ferroelectricity and metallicity. Mobile electrons in polar metals effectively screen the static electric field and dipoles. Recent studies show that 2D van der Waals metals without an inversion center can have polar order due to specific layer stacking. However, room temperature reversible ferroelectricity and nonlinear second harmonic generation in non&#8208;centrosymmetric polar metals remain unrealized. Here, the experimental realization of AB&#8208;stacked gallenene (a100) nanocrystals with a room temperature ferroelectric polarization in a liquid gallium environment is reported. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, the origin of spontaneous polarization (Ps) due to a broken symmetry in multilayer gallenene structures, resulting in P1 (space group) and C1 (point group) symmetry is explained. The reversible polarization switching is characterized using piezoresponse force microscopy. This results demonstrate the reversible nonlinear optical response of the AB&#8208;stacked gallenene crystal through second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. The intensities of SHG signals are controlled via angular rotations and thermal heating, which indicate a phase transition at high temperatures. Furthermore, electrical perturbation enables the tunability of SHG intensity. Bipolar resistive switching is demonstrated in a two&#8208;terminal device. These findings open avenues for advancements in 2D ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, and topological superconductivity.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Forbidden Rectification via Dynamic Phase Transitions in the Weyl Metallic State of ZrTe5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite preserving inversion symmetry, ZrTe5 exhibits rectification and high harmonic generation through a current&#8208;driven dynamic phase transition. This symmetry&#8208;breaking bifurcation enables forbidden nonlinear responses, unveiling a new regime of topological transport. The work establishes ZrTe5 as a benchmark platform for studying nonequilibrium quantum dynamics, with broad implications for terahertz technologies, energy harvesting, and next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Weyl metals, known for their topological structure and chiral anomaly, exhibit nonlinear transport that defies conventional theory. In this study, ZrTe5, an inversion&#8208;symmetric Dirac semimetal tunable to a Weyl state by magnetic field, is investigated, and rectification (alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) conversion) and third harmonic generation in longitudinal configurations is revealed. Despite its bulk inversion symmetry, symmetry&#8208;forbidden rectification and a dynamic phase transition arising from the chiral anomaly are observed. Rectification shows threshold behavior at a critical current density (&#119869;&#119888;) and temperature (&#119879;* &#8776; 30 K), while third&#8208;harmonic generation remains threshold&#8208;free. In transverse setups, even harmonics up to sixth order and a DC response, also symmetry&#8208;forbidden and threshold&#8208;sensitive, are detected. These results highlight the role of topology and dynamic symmetry breaking in enabling nonlinear responses and establish ZrTe5 as a model for terahertz and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Capillary&#8208;Driven 3D Open Fluidic Networks for Versatile Continuous Flow Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capillary&#8208;driven 3D open fluidic networks (OFNs), composed of connected polyhedral frames, enable precise, programmable, and versatile manipulation of unary, binary, and multiple continuous flows in both spatial and temporal dimensions. OFNs represent a significant leap beyond conventional microfluidics, unlocking new possibilities for selective metallization, programmable mixing, spatiotemporal control of multi&#8208;step reactions, and enhanced mass and heat transfer.








Abstract
Human civilization hinges on the capability to manipulate continuous flows. However, continuous flows are often regulated in closed&#8208;pipe configurations to address their instability, isolating the flows from the environment and considerably restricting their functionality. Manipulating continuous flows in open systems remains challenging. Here, capillary&#8208;driven 3D open fluidic networks (OFNs) composed of connected polyhedral frames are reported. Each frame acts as a fluid chamber with free interfaces that enable fluid entry and exit; the connecting rods function as valves, allowing precise control over the direction, velocity, and path of the flow. The OFNs seamlessly adapt to various fluid systems, enabling precise 3D manipulation of multiple flows. Leveraging these distinctive features, a series of applications, including selective metallization, programmable mixing and diagnostics, and spatiotemporal control of multi&#8208;step reactions, are achieved. The OFNs&#8217; free fluid interfaces also facilitate controlled drug release and efficient heat exchange. These versatile OFNs will significantly advance technological innovations in engineering, microfluidics, interfacial chemistry, and biomedicine.

         <title>Exploiting Brownian Motion of Plasmonic Nanoparticles Using Optical Printing Approach for on&#8208;Demand Physical Unclonable Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stochastic&#8208;to&#8208;deterministic transformation of the optical printing approach is exploited as a robust and physically grounded entropy source for on&#8208;demand physical unclonable function (PUF) fabrication at mesoscopic scales. The designed ternary PUF consisting of as few as 25 gold nanoparticles provides ample security and high encoding density, demonstrating its feasibility for integration into microelectronic systems.








Abstract
An on&#8208;demand fabrication method for additive physical unclonable functions (PUFs), a hardware&#8208;based security primitive, is inevitably required, especially considering increasingly miniaturized microelectronic devices. An optical printing approach is regarded as an alternative method to fabricate functional nano/microscale patterns against conventional methods due to its superior fabrication flexibility. However, owing to the Brownian motion of nanoparticles, achieving highly precise and selective printing persists an ongoing obstacle for the applicability of optical printing methods. Here, it is shown that the optical printing approach possesses plenty of room to fabricate on&#8208;demand PUFs by exploiting the obstacle from the perspective of randomness. To demonstrate this, an optical PUF based on a mesoscopic lattice pattern consisting of optically printed gold nanoparticles is proposed. Comprehensive analyses on physical features occurring naturally and multi&#8208;modal keys generated from them reveal that both exhibit randomness. Through a ternary bit system and key integration approach, the capability of the physical unclonable function using as few as 25 nanoparticles can be ensured in terms of the amount of information, complexity, uniqueness, and encoding capacity. The versatility of optical printing regarding the usability of a broad range of substrates and the ability to create arbitrary patterns with tunable dimensions are also shown.

         <title>Additive&#8208;Regulated Interface Chemistry Enables Depolarization for Ultra&#8208;High Capacity LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2,4,6,8&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane (V4D4) forms interfacial atomic&#8208;scale adsorption bonding with the highly delithiated LiCoO2 surface during electrochemical processes, enabling in situ HF/H2O scavenging, and constructing a cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) rich in Si&#8208;based components and polymers with enhanced Li+ conductivity. Consequently, the CEI's depolarization effect allows the LiCoO2 cathode to achieve a ultra&#8208;high discharge capacity of 220 mA h g&#8722;1 at 4.55 V.








Abstract
Unlocking the capacity potential of mainstream LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode materials for stable cycling at a high upper cut&#8208;off voltage is undoubtedly one of the most economical approaches to achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, significant polarization issues induced by interfacial and interphase degradation during high&#8208;voltage cycling remain well known. This study demonstrates the efficient depolarization effects of cyclic organosiloxane additive 2,4,6,8&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;2,4,6,8&#8208;tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane (V4D4) at the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface, facilitating interfacial charge transfer and enhancing the capacity of LCO||Li cells to 220&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 even at 4.55&#160;V (vs Li/Li+). Specifically, V4D4 tends to adsorb onto the surface of highly delithiated LCO cathodes, and its preferential oxidation intermediates help stabilize lattice oxygen, eliminate harmful HF/H2O, and form an ultrathin cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI) that reduces interface resistance to Li+ diffusion and stabilizes the surface structure. Additionally, with the assistance of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), long&#8208;term cycling produces a homogeneous, chemo&#8208;mechanically stable CEI enriched in organic silicon&#8208;containing compounds and LiF. This CEI suppresses excessive bulk electrolyte decomposition, reinforces the reversibility of the significantly enhanced O3&#8212;H1&#8208;3 phase transition, and enables capacity retention of &#8776;97% after 200 cycles.

&lt;p&gt;The 2,4,6,8-tetramethyl-2,4,6,8-tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane (V4D4) forms interfacial atomic-scale adsorption bonding with the highly delithiated LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface during electrochemical processes, enabling in situ HF/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O scavenging, and constructing a cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) rich in Si-based components and polymers with enhanced Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity. Consequently, the CEI's depolarization effect allows the LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode to achieve a ultra-high discharge capacity of 220 mA h g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 4.55 V.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlocking the capacity potential of mainstream LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (LCO) cathode materials for stable cycling at a high upper cut-off voltage is undoubtedly one of the most economical approaches to achieving high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries. However, significant polarization issues induced by interfacial and interphase degradation during high-voltage cycling remain well known. This study demonstrates the efficient depolarization effects of cyclic organosiloxane additive 2,4,6,8-tetramethyl-2,4,6,8-tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane (V4D4) at the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface, facilitating interfacial charge transfer and enhancing the capacity of LCO||Li cells to 220&#160;mA h g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; even at 4.55&#160;V (vs Li/Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Specifically, V4D4 tends to adsorb onto the surface of highly delithiated LCO cathodes, and its preferential oxidation intermediates help stabilize lattice oxygen, eliminate harmful HF/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and form an ultrathin cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI) that reduces interface resistance to Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion and stabilizes the surface structure. Additionally, with the assistance of fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), long-term cycling produces a homogeneous, chemo-mechanically stable CEI enriched in organic silicon-containing compounds and LiF. This CEI suppresses excessive bulk electrolyte decomposition, reinforces the reversibility of the significantly enhanced O3&#8212;H1-3 phase transition, and enables capacity retention of &#8776;97% after 200 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs (dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF and tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based TPE&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF) with Kagome (kgm) topology are synthesized using imine&#8208;linked dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based COF (DBC&#8208;Imine&#8208;COF) as the template. DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF exhibits an impressive photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 172.93&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in water, especially 105.30 and 80.04&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in 3 wt.% saltwater and natural seawater, respectively. This work provides a rational strategy for the construction of COFs to enhance the photocatalytic HER.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have emerged as prominent photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. However, the exquisite design of linkage and topological structures is crucial for efficient charge generation, separation, and transfer in the planar periodic framework. Here, an imine&#8208;linked dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based COF (DBC&#8208;Imine&#8208;COF) is presented as a template for topology&#8208;templated synthesis of two 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs (dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF and tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based TPE&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF) with Kagome lattice to boost photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The fully conjugated DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF is highly luminescent and exhibits topology&#8208;dependent &#960;&#8208;electron transmission and charge carrier mobility. Significantly, DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF exhibits an impressive photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 172.93&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and excellent reusability in the presence of 0.8 wt.% Pt under light irradiation, with a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 14.9% at 420&#160;nm. More importantly, DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF demonstrates a hydrogen evolution rate of 105.30 and 80.04&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in 3 wt.% saltwater and natural seawater, respectively, highlighting its potential in real&#8208;world scenarios. DFT calculations and various spectroscopic analyses reveal that the highly coplanar structure of DBC&#8208;sp2c&#8208;COF strengthens donor&#8208;acceptor interactions, facilitating charge generation and separation. In summary, this work provides an effective strategy to construct highly planar and full &#960;&#8208;conjugated dibenzo[g,p]chrysene&#8208;based 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COF as a promising platform for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

Du et&#160;al. demonstrate field&#8208;free spin&#8211;orbit torque switching down to 0.8 ns in wafer&#8208;scale van der Waals ferromagnet/Pt heterostructures.

Abstract
Electrical manipulation of magnetism in 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet (FM) holds promise for next&#8208;generation spintronic devices. Investigating field&#8208;free, ultrafast switching at room temperature in wafer&#8208;scalable vdW heterostructures can advance the development of faster memories and enhance the understanding of magnetization switching mechanisms in 2D FMs. In this study, field&#8208;free, room temperature spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) switching at subnanosecond timescales in a wafer&#8208;scalable Fe3GaTe2/Pt heterostructure by epitaxial growth engineering is demonstrated. The introduction of a variable concentration gradient of Fe is used to establish the coexistence of in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) within the ferromagnetic layer. The field&#8208;free switching, driven by the SOT from Pt, is achieved by using the IMA component to break the in&#8208;plane symmetry during the switching process. This work paves the way for the integration of efficient 2D vdW materials in advanced spintronic devices and faster memory technologies.

         <dc:description>
Organic heterostructures of polycationic chains and anions and semiconducting polymers form artificial synapses that update their synaptic weights via anion redistribution under electrical stimulation. Memory effects depend on anion species, enabling synaptic plasticity modulation. Continuously programmable nonvolatile conductance states are utilized to emulate a neural network, achieving handwritten digit and fashion image recognitions with high accuracies by using only 16 discrete device states.








Abstract
An organic heterostructure, composed of an ionoelastomer that comprises polycationic chains and mobile anions, and a semiconducting polymer, forms a new class of artificial synapses. These ionoelastomer synapses update their synaptic weights by modifying device conductance through the spatial redistribution of anions in response to electrical stimuli. The memory effect of these synapses is highly dependent on the specific anion species present, providing a unique means to modulate synaptic plasticity simply through anion selection. The continuously programmable and nonvolatile states of the selected ionoelastomer synapse are harnessed to emulate a soft neural network and perform the handwritten digit and fashion image recognition tasks, which achieve high recognition accuracies comparable to ideal numeric model but only using 16 discrete device states.

Schematic illustration of MBSLS design and its application in spinal cord injury (SCI) treatment.








Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) repair represents an immense challenge globally. Despite various beneficial strategies having been attempted for SCI repair, the ideal therapy has not yet been achieved. In this study, a multidimensional biomimetic spinal cord&#8208;like scaffold (MBSLS) is designed with a hierarchical structure and embryonic neurogenetic microenvironment and neural regeneration in SCI repair. MBSLS successfully regulated the neural differentiation of loaded neural stem cells (NSCs) and regenerated spinal cord&#8208;like tissue in vitro by promoting neurogenesis, gliogenesis, axonogenesis, axon ensheathment, synapse organization, and calcium homeostasis. Moreover, the NSC&#8208;loaded scaffold achieves exceptional SCI repair through highly efficient axonal regeneration and neural circuit reconstruction, which significantly improves the recovery of motor function, sensory function, and autonomic function in vivo. Importantly, the MBSLS scaffold achieves seamless integration with the host spinal cord in only 5 min, allowing early cell infiltration and repair.

&lt;p&gt;Schematic illustration of MBSLS design and its application in spinal cord injury (SCI) treatment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) repair represents an immense challenge globally. Despite various beneficial strategies having been attempted for SCI repair, the ideal therapy has not yet been achieved. In this study, a multidimensional biomimetic spinal cord-like scaffold (MBSLS) is designed with a hierarchical structure and embryonic neurogenetic microenvironment and neural regeneration in SCI repair. MBSLS successfully regulated the neural differentiation of loaded neural stem cells (NSCs) and regenerated spinal cord-like tissue in vitro by promoting neurogenesis, gliogenesis, axonogenesis, axon ensheathment, synapse organization, and calcium homeostasis. Moreover, the NSC-loaded scaffold achieves exceptional SCI repair through highly efficient axonal regeneration and neural circuit reconstruction, which significantly improves the recovery of motor function, sensory function, and autonomic function in vivo. Importantly, the MBSLS scaffold achieves seamless integration with the host spinal cord in only 5 min, allowing early cell infiltration and repair. Finally, the feasibility of the minimally invasive implantation of human-sized MBSLS in a pig SCI model is confirmed, demonstrating its potential and prospects for clinical translation to treat SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Double Heterostructures for Monolayer Materials with Record Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a lateral double&#8208;heterostructure leveraging type&#8208;I band alignment in a double&#8208;gate design, where carriers transport through a wide indirect&#8208;bandgap WSe2 multilayer and are confined in a narrow direct&#8208;bandgap MoTe2 monolayer for efficient emission. The device achieves record 1% external quantum efficiency among TMDC p&#8208;n junctions and 24&#8208;fold power efficiency that of single MoTe2 counterpart, enabling silicon&#8208;integrated light sources.








Abstract
2D semiconductor materials have shown great potential and advantages for a wide variety of optoelectronic devices, especially compact and integrated light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers. However, the lack of a type&#8208;I double&#8208;heterostructure has severely hindered the development of efficient LEDs and lasers based on 2D materials. In this article, a lateral double&#8208;heterostructure is proposed based on a single type&#8208;I heterostructure composed of multilayer WSe2 and monolayer MoTe2 with double back&#8208;gates. This design synergizes the high mobility of the multilayer and the direct bandgap of the monolayer: carrier injection and transport are facilitated in the WSe2 barrier layer, while they are transferred and confined in the MoTe2 well layer for efficient radiative recombination through type&#8208;I band alignment. Therefore, the double&#8208;heterostructure reaches an external quantum efficiency of 1% level, a new record for p&#8208;n junctions based on transition metal dichalcogenides. Additionally, the heterostructure device achieves a 40&#8208;fold enhancement of the maximum electroluminescent intensity and a 24&#8208;fold enhancement of power efficiency compared with the single monolayer MoTe2 counterpart at room temperature. This promising strategy can also be extended to other 2D&#8208;semiconductor LEDs and could bring 2D&#8208;materials devices into practical applications of micro&#8208;LED displays, electrically injected 2D&#8208;materials lasers, and silicon&#8208;based on&#8208;chip light sources.

This study presents an Ir1@FA@MOFs nanocomposite that exploits copper&#8208;coordination and glutathione reduction to trigger an in situ Type II&#8208;to&#8208;Type I photodynamic switch, effectively alleviating tumor hypoxia while simultaneously inducing cuproptosis, ferroptosis, and PANoptosis, thereby potentiating immunogenic cell death for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.

Abstract
The clinical translation of photodynamic therapy (PDT) faces dual challenges of tumor hypoxia and antioxidant defense mechanisms. To address these limitations, herein tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;adaptive nanoparticles are rationally designed that enable oxygen&#8208;independent PDT while reprogramming immunosuppressive TME. An Ir(III) complex (Ir1) is engineered to achieve copper&#8208;mediated and glutathione (GSH)&#8208;activated switching of photodynamic modes from oxygen&#8208;dependent Type II to hypoxia&#8208;tolerant Type I PDT via coordination&#8208;induced modulation of electron transfer. This dynamic photosensitizer is precisely integrated into folate receptor&#8208;targeted azomidazole&#8208;bridged Cu(II)&#8208;MOFs, creating an &#8220;AND logic&#8221; responsive nanoplatform (Ir1@FA@MOFs) that simultaneously depletes GSH and generates hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) and superoxide anion (O2&#8226;&#8210;) under light irradiation. Mechanistic studies reveal that Ir1@FA@MOFs orchestrate multimodal cell death induction including cuproptosis, ferroptosis, and PANoptosis through mitochondrial damage. In 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice, Ir1@FA@MOFs demonstrate high tumor growth inhibition while converting &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors to immunogenic hotspots. The work pioneers a TME&#8208;responsive photodynamic modality switching strategy that overcomes traditional PDT limitations through metal&#8208;coordination and GSH&#8208;activating immunogenic death programming, offering new dimensions for precision photo&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Lanthanide&#8208;Containing Bilayer Polymers With Programmable Wrinkling Dynamics Coherent With Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bilayer polymers comprising lanthanide&#8208;coordinated skins and polyurethane substrates exhibit programmable wrinkling dynamics during relaxation. The evolving surface topography modulates visible light, enabling transitions among scattering, iridescence, and transparency. Independently, the metallopolymer layer emits multicolor luminescence under UV light. These features offer a durable, rewritable, dual&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform with high adaptability and spatiotemporal control.








Abstract
A family of lanthanide metallopolymer/polyurethane bilayer polymers exhibiting multicolor luminescence and tunable wrinkling behavior are engineered to combat escalating challenges in information forgery and data leakage. These architectures are fabricated by spin&#8208;coating a lanthanide&#8208;coordinated metallopolymer skin layer onto a polyurethane substrate, facilitating strained&#8208;induced topographical transformations through a tensile&#8208;release process. During dynamic relaxation, the emergent wrinkled topographies modulate optical diffraction, yielding three distinct states: diffuse scattering (frosted glass effect), constructive interference (iridescent rainbow effect), and optical transparency. The metallopolymer skin layer demonstrates high&#8208;efficiency luminescence with broad&#8208;spectrum chromatic emission, while the polyurethane substrate confers exceptional mechanical robustness, optical transparency, and intrinsic self&#8208;healing properties. Consequently, a dual&#8208;mode anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform integrating luminescence and structural coloration is realized, offering facile activation, immediate visual verification, and enhanced durability with recyclability. These multifunctional materials exhibit superior performance metrics in encryption and hierarchical anti&#8208;counterfeiting paradigms, surpassing contemporary security technologies in adaptability and functional sophistication.

         <title>Modulating Interfacial Solvent Aggregation Chemistry to Enable Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature performance of sodium&#8208;ion batteries is hindered by solvent aggregation in the inner Helmholtz plane, leading to sluggish Na+ diffusion. This study reveals that a free&#8208;radical&#8208;mediated mechanism, in which polarization interactions induced by orbital overlap between solvent molecules and free radicals, disrupts solvent alignment. This strategy enhances cycling stability, maintaining performance at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C for 2400 cycles.








Abstract
The capability of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) to operate under extreme temperatures is highly desirable; however, achieving stable performance remains challenging due to limitations in interfacial dynamics. Here, it is revealed that at low temperatures, linear solvents tend to aggregate within the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), leading to the formation of a solvent&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) with sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics. To address this issue, it is proposed to leverage the polarization interaction induced by the orbital overlap between the solvent molecules and free radicals as an effective approach to breaking solvent aggregation. This interaction leads to a redistribution of electron density, reducing the electron cloud density and lowering molecular polarity. Significantly, the reduced polarity weakens intermolecular ordering, promoting interfacial restructuring that enhances mass transfer and facilitates the formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Herein, trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTF) is identified as an optimal electric double&#8208;layer regulator, which generates radicals in situ and interacts with the solvent to reconstruct the IHP layer. Consequently, commercial hard carbon paired with the TMSOTF&#8208;based electrolyte exhibits superior cycling stability, achieving a lifespan over 2400 cycles at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, whereas the conventional electrolyte fails to sustain cycling. This study provides critical insights into interfacial design strategy for advancing low&#8208;temperature battery technologies.

Herein, trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTF) is identified as an optimal electric double-layer regulator, which generates radicals in situ and interacts with the solvent to reconstruct the IHP layer. Consequently, commercial hard carbon paired with the TMSOTF-based electrolyte exhibits superior cycling stability, achieving a lifespan over 2400 cycles at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, whereas the conventional electrolyte fails to sustain cycling. This study provides critical insights into interfacial design strategy for advancing low-temperature battery technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Off&#8208;the&#8208;Shelf Granular Microtissue Bioinks: Long&#8208;Term Preserved Cellularized Porous Microgels with Enhanced Cell Activity for Shelf&#8208;Ready Biofabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces long&#8208;term preserved cellularized porous microgels that 1) achieve a considerably long preservation duration (up to 14&#160;months); 2) enable better cell and tissue growth due to the presence of internal interfaces; and 3) allow for injectable and 3D bioprinting use as a novel granular bioink. It advances the form of bioinks and represents a future trend of tissue engineering toward ready&#8208;to&#8208;use products.








Abstract
Off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf cellularized products greatly advance the therapeutic practice for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, it remains a challenge to achieve long&#8208;term preservation and superior biological outcomes. Here, the cryo&#8208;gelation methodology is optimized to develop a cellularized porous microgel platform that allows for long&#8208;term cryopreservation on the shelf (up to 14&#160;months) and favors tissue growth due to the presented subvoxel interfaces. The modular granular microtissues serve as an injectable formulation for non&#8208;invasive therapy and innovative printable bioinks for precise biofabrication, free of on&#8208;site operations on cell isolation and preparation. The internal biomaterial interfaces down to the microtissue building blocks significantly enhance cell growth and function, compared to the conventional bulk counterpart. The ready&#8208;to&#8208;use potential of months&#8208;preserved hMSC&#8208;laden modules is demonstrated through subcutaneous injection and critical&#8208;sized skull defect repair in rats, which confirms the benefits of subvoxel interfaces for tissue regeneration. These off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf granular cellularized blocks enable highly accessible and on&#8208;demand use in cell&#8208;based regenerative medicine.

         <title>Host Cell Membrane&#8208;Cloaked Nanomedicine Reprograms Endothelial Surface for Enhanced Patency in Allogeneic Vascular Grafts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developed a host red blood cell membrane&#8208;cloaked nanomedicine loaded with a TGF&#8208;&#946; signaling inhibitor for metabolically&#8208;guided cell surface reprogramming to enhance the patency of allogeneic vascular grafts via the synergistic combination of localized steric immune shielding and in situ therapeutic delivery.








Abstract
The endothelium serves as the first point of contact following the implantation of allogeneic vascular grafts (AGs) or organs. Rapid endothelial injury triggered by immunocytotoxicity, combined with subsequent endothelial dysfunction during vascular tissue remodeling, collectively exacerbates complications, including thrombosis, inflammation, and intimal hyperplasia, ultimately leading to graft failure. In this study, a nanomedicine, R&#8208;SB@PLGA, is developed for use in metabolically guided cell surface reprogramming (CSR) in AGs. R&#8208;SB@PLGA is fabricated by encapsulating SB431542 (SB)&#8208;loaded poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles within host red blood cell membranes (RBCM). Upon immobilization, this nanomedicine reprograms the epitope presentation of endothelial cells (ECs), establishing localized steric immune shielding to preserve endothelial integrity without the need for systemic immunosuppression. Concurrently, the nanomedicine releases SB to inhibit the transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; (TGF&#8208;&#946;)&#8208;mediated endothelial&#8208;to&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EndMT), thereby preventing endothelial dysfunction during vascular tissue remodeling. In animal models of allogeneic carotid artery transplantation, R&#8208;SB@PLGA showed significant efficacy in enhancing graft patency by reducing vascular inflammation and intimal hyperplasia. By integrating site&#8208;specific immune shielding with in situ therapeutic delivery, a novel paradigm is established for improving transplant outcomes through localized intervention, which is highly promising for promoting the success of allogeneic vascular or organ transplantation.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal Structure Determination of Superconducting La4Ni3O10&#8208;&#948; under High Pressure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade of structural transitions from P21/a to Bmab and to I4/mmm is reported in the nickelate superconductor La4Ni3O10, revealing a correlation between I4/mmm and the emergence of superconductivity. These results demonstrate that ambient&#8208;pressure grown nickelate single crystals can superconduct under high pressure, and reveal a new intermediate structure under high pressure, providing new insights into the physics of nickelate superconductivity.








Abstract
Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper nickelates have attracted enormous attention since the discovery of high&#8208;temperature superconductivity in bilayer La3Ni2O7 under high pressure. However, the crystal structure under high pressure remains elusive due to the lack of single crystal diffraction data. Here, high&#8208;pressure superconductivity with a superconducting onset temperature approaching 30K and a zero&#8208;resistance state at 7K at 53.8 GPa is reported in high&#8208;quality single crystals of trilayer La4Ni3O10&#8208;&#948; grown at ambient pressure. A cascade of structural transitions from P21/a at 5.7 GPa to Bmab at 11.0 GPa and to I4/mmm at 16.6 GPa is unambiguously determined via synchrotron X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction, revealing a correlation between the tetragonal I4/mmm and the emergence of superconductivity. These results not only demonstrate that ambient&#8208;pressure grown nickelate single crystals can superconduct under high pressure but also reveal an intermediate structure that was not reported under high pressure, providing new insights into the physics of nickelate superconductivity.

         <title>Fast, Reconfigurable Domain&#8208;Wall Logic in a Magnetic Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterostructures of magnetic insulator TbIG and ultrathin Co layers enable field&#8208;free current&#8208;driven domain&#8208;wall motion over 1.4 km&#160;s&#8722;1. All 16 two&#8208;input Boolean logic operations are experimentally demonstrated within a single domain&#8208;wall device via current density and initial magnetization state adjustment, holding the potential for energy&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;density in&#8208;memory computing architectures.








Abstract
Conventional computing systems, based on silicon transistors, face challenges in meeting the growing demand for high computing efficiency in applications such as big data and artificial intelligence. Spin&#8208;based logic devices, particularly those utilizing chiral domain walls, offer a promising alternative due to their potential for high&#8208;performance and integration with high&#8208;density memory. Here, heterostructures composed of magnetic insulator TbIG and ultrathin Co layers are created, enabling field&#8208;free current&#8208;driven domain&#8208;wall motion at speeds exceeding 1.4&#160;km s&#8722;1. Based on the unique velocity phase diagram with respect to the in&#8208;plane field and current density, the implementation of all 16 two&#8208;input Boolean logic operations, including NAND, AND, XOR, and XNOR, is experimentally demonstrated by adjusting the current density and initial magnetization state. The results highlight the feasibility of multifunctional logic gates in spintronic systems and show the potential for energy&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;density in&#8208;memory computing architectures.

Virus&#8208;like nanoparticle (VNP) platform is engineered through rational integration of lipid scaffolding, siRNA encapsulation, and surface&#8208;anchored DNA aptamer&#8208;based LYTAC (DbLYTAC). This modular design synergistically combines gene silencing with targeted protein degradation capabilities while enhancing structural stability. VNP is a paradigm&#8208;shifting platform that overcomes the limitations of protein&#8208;based viral mimics, paving the way for multifunctional nanotherapeutics in cancer therapy.








Abstract
Virus&#8208;like particle (VLP) holds significant promise for drug delivery and cancer therapy; however, they encounter challenges related to structural stability and functional versatility. This study reports a biomimetic virus&#8208;like nanoparticle (VNP) platform, which is engineered through rational integration of lipid scaffolding, siRNA encapsulation, and surface&#8208;anchored DNA aptamer&#8208;based LYTAC (DbLYTAC). This modular design synergistically combines gene silencing with targeted protein degradation capabilities while enhancing structural stability. In vitro experiments validate the exceptional efficacy of the VNPs in achieving targeted protein degradation, while in vivo studies using animal models demonstrate their promising potential for tumor therapy. This approach establishes a paradigm&#8208;shifting platform that overcomes the limitations of protein&#8208;based viral mimics, paving the way for multifunctional nanotherapeutics in cancer therapy.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Bioinspired Meta&#8208;Structural Perovskite Catalysts for Dry Reforming of CH4 and CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D&#8208;printed bioinspired meta&#8208;structural perovskite catalyst (LaFe0.5Ni0.5O3/pseudo&#8208;boehmite) with gradient woodpile channels (0.5&#8211;3 mm) is developed, achieving 82.13% CH4 conversion and 9.69 mmol g&#8722;1 syngas yield in DRM. Mass transfer and catalytic performance are synergistically coupled by configuring gradient hierarchical pores and tailored flow dynamics, providing a design paradigm for robust, high&#8208;performance catalysts applicable to diverse processes.








Abstract
Conventional packed&#8208;bed catalysts suffer from single&#8208;scale porosity, insufficient mechanical strength, and suboptimal mass transfer efficiency. Inspired by the fractal structure of the lung bronchi, a design and 3D printing method for gradient meta&#8208;structural catalysts is proposed by integrating synthesized LaFe0.5Ni0.5O3 (LFN) perovskite with pseudo&#8208;boehmite, achieving ultralow pressure drop and high catalytic efficiency.&#160;Computational fluid dynamics and reaction simulations guide the design of uniform and gradient&#8208;structured catalysts with hierarchical woodpile channels (0.5&#8211;3&#160;mm). Compared with homogeneous catalysts, the gradient design theoretically exhibits 1.5&#8208;fold and 1.1&#8208;fold increases in flow velocity and hydrogen production, respectively. Meta&#8208;structural catalysts are fabricated with gradient multi&#8208;peak pore distribution (9.32&#160;nm, 103.75&#160;nm) by regionally modulating unit cell sizes and LFN content (11&#8211;35%) combined with the dehydroxylation of pseudo&#8208;boehmite. 3D&#8208;printed perovskite catalysts demonstrate a 78.7&#8208;fold increase in specific surface area (102.26 m2 g&#8722;1) and compressive strength of 8.48&#160;MPa. In dry reforming of methane (DRM) tests, it achieves 82.13% CH4 conversion, and 9.69&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 syngas yield, outperforming conventional powder&#8208;packed beds by 10% efficiency. This study achieves mass transfer and catalytic performance coupling by tuning gradient hierarchical pores and tailoring flow dynamics, offering a paradigm for robust, high&#8208;efficiency catalyst design across diverse applications.

         <title>Trojan Horse&#8208;Inspired Biomimetic Lipoprotein Nanocarrier for Noninvasive Anti&#8208;VEGF Therapy of Ocular Fundus Neovascularization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article&#160;presents a Trojan horse&#8208;inspired biomimetic lipoprotein nanocarrier (A&#8208;PA&#8208;&#945;CPP) that electrostatically binds aflibercept to phosphatidic acid (PA) and incorporates an apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1)&#8208;mimetic cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP)&#160;via self&#8208;assembly. This nanocarrier enables noninvasive delivery through corneal and conjunctival&#8211;scleral&#8211;choroidal pathways and effectively suppresses choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in a laser&#8208;induced mouse model.








Abstract
Pathological neovascularization is a major cause of vision loss in various ischemic and inflammatory ocular fundus diseases, with current anti&#8208;VEGF therapies requiring invasive and frequent intravitreal injections. In this study, a Trojan horse&#8208;inspired biomimetic lipoprotein nanocarrier (A&#8208;PA&#8208;&#945;CPP) is developed for noninvasive anti&#8208;VEGF therapy via topical administration. Utilizing phosphatidic acid (PA), specifically 1,2&#8208;dioleoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate (DOPA), as the sole phospholipid, the nanocarrier enables electrostatic tethering of aflibercept, with a cell&#8208;penetrating peptide (CPP)&#8208;functionalized apoA1 mimetic peptide (&#945;CPP) incorporated through self&#8208;assembly. Molecular dynamics simulations and intermolecular interaction experiments confirm effective PA&#8211;protein interactions and &#945;CPP incorporation. The nanocarrier demonstrates high encapsulation efficiency, size uniformity, and long&#8208;term stability. It enhances transcellular and paracellular transport by promoting cellular uptake, bypassing lysosomal degradation, and modulating tight junctions. When topically administered, A&#8208;PA&#8208;&#945;CPP efficiently delivers to the posterior segment via corneal and conjunctival&#8211;scleral&#8211;choroidal pathways. In a laser&#8208;induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) mouse model, A&#8208;PA&#8208;&#945;CPP eye drops show therapeutic efficacy comparable to a single intravitreal injection, while maintaining excellent ocular and systemic biocompatibility. This biomimetic platform highlights the potential of PA&#8208;mediated protein binding in nanocarrier design, offering a promising strategy for home&#8208;based anti&#8208;VEGF therapy and extending the potential to other protein&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>A Wideband Multimodal Flexible Sensor Integrating Vertical Graphene and Sea Urchin&#8208;Like Nanoparticles for Post&#8208;Stroke Rehabilitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a speech reconstruction framework based on a dual&#8208;sensor system that collects wideband signals from vocal vibrations and throat muscle movements. An encoder&#8208;cycle&#8208;consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN) model maps the signals to speech without requiring a large&#8208;scale paired training dataset. The system achieves over 95% intent recognition accuracy and generates natural&#8208;sounding speech with a mean opinion score of 2.9.








Abstract
Stroke is a leading cause of long&#8208;term disability worldwide, with post&#8208;stroke aphasia significantly impairing communication and social interaction. Traditional rehabilitation devices are often bulky, expensive, and impractical for daily use, particularly in speech recovery, where accessible and effective solutions remain limited. To address this challenge, this study introduces a portable and wearable sensor system for stroke&#8208;induced aphasia rehabilitation. The proposed sensor integrates a flexible, ultrasensitive, and durable dual&#8208;sensor system comprising an Ag&#8208;MnO2&#8208;based sea&#8208;urchin&#8208;like nanoparticle pressure sensor to detect high&#8208;frequency vocal vibrations and a vertical graphene/polydimethylsiloxane (VGr/PDMS) strain sensor to capture low&#8208;frequency muscular movements. The sensors, integrated into a flexible circuit, employ an encoder&#8208;cycle&#8208;consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGAN)&#160;model that recognizes users' intent and recovers voice, significantly reducing dependency on large&#8208;scale labelled datasets. Experimental results demonstrate accurate intent recognition with accuracies for certain commands exceeding 95%. The reconstructed speech exhibits improved naturalness based on objective and perceptual evaluations, highlighting potential clinical utility in enhancing daily communication and interaction for stroke survivors.

         <title>3D Acoustic Imaging Hitting the Diffraction Limit via Fully Parameter&#8208;Optimized Meta&#8208;Lens and Frequency&#8208;Domain Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article employs a binary genetic algorithm to design an ultra&#8208;fine ultrasonic meta&#8208;lens, achieving lateral super&#8208;resolution imaging in the far field (&gt;20&#955;&#8320;). Building on this, longitudinal resolution is effectively restored through frequency domain reconstruction. Additionally, the nonlinear effect of sound waves in the medium is leveraged to significantly enhance both lateral and longitudinal resolutions, reaching &#8776;0.2&#955;&#8320; and 0.68&#955;&#8320;.








Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution imaging is the long&#8208;sought goal pursued in acoustics. In the past decade, many solutions have been proposed by utilizing various metamaterial devices. For example, in acoustics, the holographic meta&#8208;lens is employed to improve the lateral resolutions of ultrasonic imaging. However, the filtering effect of meta&#8208;lens broadens the acoustic wave pulses, which severely degrades longitudinal resolutions, making the high&#8208;resolution 3D imaging hitherto quite challenging. Here, an innovative solution is proposed by designing and implementing a fully parameter&#8208;optimized meta&#8208;lens. At the fundamental frequency, this meta&#8208;lens can achieve a lateral resolution of 80&#160;&#181;m (&#8776;0.37&#955;0), successfully breaking the diffraction limit. Through the frequency&#8208;domain reconstruction, the longitudinal resolution is increased to 296&#160;&#181;m (&#8776;1.36&#955;0). Utilizing the nonlinear effect of ultrasound in water, the acoustic meta&#8208;lens can furtherly optimize its imaging quality at the harmonic frequency, where the lateral resolution is increased to 44&#160;&#181;m (&#8776;0.2&#955;0) with the longitudinal resolution to 148&#160;&#181;m (&#8776;0.68&#955;0). The work breaks the bias on meta&#8208;lenses with deteriorated longitudinal resolution for broad applications in functional ultrasonic imaging.

         <title>Multimodal Super&#8208;Cooling Textiles for All&#8208;Scenario Passive Hygrothermal Comfort</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a multimodal supercooling textile that integrates radiative, conductive, and evaporative functions by a 3D cladding strategy of nanosheets for all&#8208;scenario personal cooling. With high solar reflectance, a 3D thermally conductive network, and a Janus wetting structure, it cools 2&#160;&#176;C lower than cotton in a hot and humid environment, offering a new perspective for highly efficient human hygrothermal management.








Abstract
Radiative cooling textiles hold great promise for achieving personal thermal comfort amidst the rising global temperatures while enhancing productivity and saving energy. However, despite extensive research, most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art radiative cooling textiles possess solely radiative functions, failing to achieve highly efficient cooling across all scenarios, particularly as high temperatures and high humidity diminish non&#8208;radiative cooling power. This work presents a multimodal super&#8208;cooling textile that integrates radiative, conductive, and evaporative mechanisms through a 3D cladding strategy to enhance the cooling effect in various scenarios without compromising radiative performance. This method enables the surfaces of all 1D single fibers to be closely 3D clad with 2D boron nitride nanosheets, thereby achieving ultra&#8208;high solar reflectivity (97.30%), omnidirectional heat dissipation (in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane thermal conductivity of 2.40 and 0.33&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, respectively), and unidirectional moisture&#8208;wicking properties (transport index of 1547%) through high backscattering efficiency, a 3D thermal conductivity network structure, and a Janus wetting structure. Enabled by the multi&#8208;cooling mechanisms, MST drops temperature by 20&#160;&#176;C versus cotton in outdoor sunlight. Even in hot, humid circumstances, it still provides a 2&#160;&#176;C cooling advantage over cotton. This work thereby provides a promising strategy for personal thermal and moisture management textiles across various complex environments.

         <title>Inverted PAINT for Material&#8208;Specific Super&#8208;Resolution Fluorescence Imaging of Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents Inverted PAINT, a label&#8208;free super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging method optimized for thick and non&#8208;transparent semiconductor materials. By employing electrostatic dye&#8211;surface interactions in an inverted geometry, the technique enables material&#8208;specific, multicolor, and 3D nanoscale imaging, with applications in semiconductor metrology, defect detection, and analysis of various inorganic nanomaterials.








Abstract
Recent advances in super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy have extended its application beyond traditional biological samples to include various organic materials such as polymers and lipid layers. However, its application to inorganic materials, including semiconductor substrates, still remains limited due to technical challenges associated with their thickness, optical opacity, and the lack of effective fluorophore labeling methods. To overcome these challenges, a label&#8208;free Inverted point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (PAINT) imaging method is developed for thick and non&#8208;transparent inorganic nanomaterials by addressing the limitations of conventional PAINT imaging. By placing the sample in an inverted orientation and utilizing electrostatic interactions to control dye movement against gravity, silica&#8208;specific and silicon&#8208;specific nanoimaging of silica&#8211;silicon line&#8208; and hole&#8208;patterned semiconductor wafers, respectively is achieved. Through systematic optimization of polymer coating, dye charge, pH, refractive index, and dye concentration, it is demonstrated that the Inverted PAINT imaging method successfully visualizes sub&#8208;100&#160;nm line patterns with a resolution of &#8776;12&#160;nm, as well as enables multi&#8208;color and 3D nanoimaging. The method is anticipated to serve not only as a non&#8208;destructive and material&#8208;specific nanoimaging technique for a variety of inorganic nanomaterials, but also as a next&#8208;generation tool for semiconductor metrology and defect inspection.

         <title>Flexible Photovoltaic Neurostimulator for Analgesia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible photovoltaic Neurostimulator for Analgesia. This study introduces a fully implantable, wireless photovoltaic neurostimulator that integrates flexible self&#8208;rolling cuff electrodes with biocompatible Cu(In,Ga)Se2 photovoltaic cells. This adaptive optoelectronic system enables near&#8208;infrared&#8208;triggered nerve electrical stimulation, showing significant pain reduction in neuropathic conditions.








Abstract
Chronic neuropathic pain remains a significant clinical challenge, often requiring prolonged opioid use and exposing patients to associated complications. Current nerve electrical stimulation (ES) techniques show promise for analgesia but are constrained by their invasive nature and the potential risk of iatrogenic nerve injury. In this study, a novel approach is introduced to managing chronic pain through the development of a fully implantable, wireless, and self&#8208;adaptive photovoltaic neurostimulator (PVNS). This innovative device combines flexible, self&#8208;rolling cuff electrodes with biocompatible flexible Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin&#8208;film photovoltaics, enabling near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;triggered nerve ES. In vivo neuralgia models demonstrate significant analgesic effects, while mechanistic studies reveal the involvement of inflammatory pathway regulation and modulation of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1). The PVNS eliminates the difficulty for tethered stimulation and reduces the risk of peripheral nerve injury, offering a groundbreaking and minimally invasive solution for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.

         <title>A Nanobiocatalyst&#8208;Driven Hybrid System for Efficient and Sustainable Hydrogen Production via Electron Flow Optimization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intermetallic nanobiocatalyst LPBC, featuring an ordered atomic structure and defined electronic properties, is designed and integrated with Clostridium pasteurianum to construct an efficient, sustainable biohydrogen hybrid system. LPBC stimulates transcriptional enhancement for biohydrogen production, and targets NADH and [FeFe] hydrogenase to catalyze intracellular tandem reactions for directional electron modulation, achieving a 103% production rate increase with 30&#8208;day long&#8208;lasting performance.








Abstract
Biohydrogen production offers a promising pathway for developing clean and renewable energy sources. However, its practical application has been hindered by low efficiency and sustainability issues. Here, it is introduced an energy&#8208;efficient and output&#8208;sustainable hybrid system (LPBC/CH system) for biohydrogen production by integrating self&#8208;assembling intermetallic (L10) FePt@polypyrrole nanobiocatalysts (LPBC) with Clostridium pasteurianum. The engineered LPBC, characterized by optimal atomic structures and defined electronic properties, demonstrates robust transcriptional enhancement efficiency and biocatalytic capability, leading to an &#8776;103% increase in hydrogen production rate and a 57% enhancement in hydrogen yield to the bare C. pasteurianum system. Within the LPBC/CH system, the nanobiocatalysts target NADH and [FeFe] hydrogenase, triggering efficient tandem biocatalytic reactions for proton reduction. Notably, the LPBC achieves sustained performance for at least 30 days &#8211; a benchmark unmatched by other reported nanobiocatalysts. This study not only advances the frontiers of biohydrogen production but also establishes a universal framework for constructing hybrid systems with superior efficiency and sustainability.

         <title>Unravelling Microstructure Selection in an Additively Manufactured Eutectic High&#8208;Entropy Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Processing&#8211;microstructure&#8211;property relationships in additively manufactured high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are studied, showing&#160;how increasing solidification rate drives solidification morphology from coupled eutectic to anomalous eutectic and eventually to single&#8208;phase structures, enabling tunable strength&#8211;ductility combinations. Integrated thermodynamic modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, and multiscale characterization clarify the interplay between thermodynamic and kinetic factors in microstructure selection of additively manufactured HEAs.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are promising candidates for advanced structural applications due to their excellent mechanical properties. Additive manufacturing (AM), with its rapid solidification conditions, enables the creation of unique nonequilibrium microstructures. To fully leverage the synergy between AM and HEAs, understanding how processing affects structure and properties is essential. Here, how solidification rate influences microstructure evolution and phase transformation pathway in laser additively manufactured AlCrFe2Ni2 eutectic HEAs is investigated. By increasing the laser scan speed and hence the solidification rate, distinct solidification modes evolving from coupled eutectic to anomalous eutectic and eventually to single&#8208;phase solidification are revealed. These transitions result in distinct microstructures and a wide range of mechanical properties. Thermodynamic modeling and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that low cooling rates allow for sufficient atomic diffusion and phase separation, facilitating coupled eutectic growth. In contrast, rapid cooling suppresses diffusion and destabilizes the solid&#8211;liquid interface, promoting anomalous or single&#8208;phase solidification. This integrated experimental and computational approach provides a multiscale understanding of solidification mechanisms in HEAs and underscores how kinetic effects can over&#8208;ride thermodynamic predictions under nonequilibrium conditions. These results demonstrate that AM can serve as a powerful tool to design HEAs with tailored microstructures and properties.

         <title>A Near&#8208;Perfect Pt Cocatalyst with a Spatially Oriented Distribution of Pt2+/Pt0 for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;perfect Pt cocatalyst is developed featuring a near&#8208;zero proton reduction barrier and isolated O2 adsorption by precisely regulating the Pt2+/Pt0 ratio. This work underscores the critical role of spatial orientation distribution of Pt valence states in photocatalytic reactions, demonstrating generalizable design principles applicable to photoelectrocatalysis, organocatalysis, and environmental catalysis.








Abstract
Loading the cocatalyst, e.g., Pt, is a promising strategy for photocatalytic overall water splitting, in which metallic state Pt&#176; facilitates proton reduction and positive valence state Pt2+ inhibits H2/O2 recombination. However, simultaneously leveraging the advantages of Pt0 and Pt2+ in Pt&#8208;photocatalyst hybrids for photocatalytic water splitting is challenging. Herein, a universal strategy is demonstrated for modulating Pt valence state, obtaining a spatially oriented distribution of Pt2+/Pt3 and a close to zero proton reduction barrier, along with isolated O2 adsorption. As a proof of concept, Pt undergoes electron transfer to ZnIn2S4, accompanied by partial oxidation from Pt0 to Pt2+ through the introduction of electron&#8208;deficient centers in ZnIn2S4 via vanadium doping and sulfur vacancy (V&#8208;Sv&#8208;ZIS). Reverse electron transfer induces Pt2+ dominating 83% of the region near the Pt/V&#8208;Sv&#8208;ZIS interface and Pt0 dominating in the remaining 17% near the Pt cluster center, which can be extended to other Pt&#8208;based catalyst systems. The dominant Pt2+ inhibits O2 adsorption and induces the lowest H2/O2 recombination rate of 4%, and the minimal Pt0 obtains a 152.2&#8208;fold increase in photogenerated electron density, ultimately realizing a 45.4&#8208;fold increase in photocatalytic activity. A 10 m2 large&#8208;area photocatalytic system is fabricated, producing 6.4 L of H2 per day under natural sunlight.

In this work, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hybrid flow machine learning (HFML) framework is designed to efficiently discover HEO compositions. The factors affecting structural stability, including s&#8208;block metal ions, Cu2+, high&#8208;valence d0 and d10 metal ions are further verified. In conclusion, this work accomplishes the full chain study from artificial intelligence material prediction, and performance verification to pilot application.








Abstract
How to proficiently and accurately explore the vast compositional space of materials and accelerate the development of new materials with outstanding properties, especially structurally complex high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs), remains a challenge in materials science. To address this, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hybrid flow machine learning (HFML) framework is proposed, which combines ensemble learning, unsupervised learning, and Bayesian optimization, enabling efficient discovery of hidden patterns and comprehensive exploration of the component space. Based on the proposed HFML, a new HEO cathode material is screened out from over 2 million candidates for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (Na0.95Li0.06Ni0.25Cu0.05Fe0.1Co0.05Mn0.44Ti0.05O2), which shows excellent cycling stability (capacity retention of 83.6% after 1200 cycles) and high&#8208;rate performance (110 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C, and 96 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 C). Key factors affecting structural stability are identified, including s&#8208;block metal ions, Cu2+, high&#8208;valence d0 and d10 metal ions, and are verified by electrochemical tests and in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Additionally, pilot&#8208;scale production is achieved, and 2 Ah pouch cells based on this cathode demonstrate 95.0% capacity retention after 600 cycles. This work accomplishes the full chain study from artificial intelligence material prediction, creation, and performance verification to pilot application (mass production and pouch sodium batteries).

         <title>Origin of Synergy in Bicomponent Metal Nitride&#8211;Metal Single Atom Catalysts for Advanced Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>

A comprehensive coupling model for metal nitride (MN) and metal single atoms (M&#8722;SA) is proposed to optimize the behavior of polysulfides, and elucidate the principles by which the hybrid catalyst facilitates the conversion of polysulfides. W&#8722;SA/WN as the model prepared and dispersed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon sheets rendered batteries the increased capacity, superior rate performance, and enhanced cycling stability.








Abstract
To catalyze the sulfur redox kinetics of lithium&#8722;sulfur batteries (LSBs) can well enhance the capacity and longevity. However, the synergistic essence of bicomponent electrocatalysts for LSBs remains obscure. Here, this work introduces standardized descriptors to describe the underlying origin of catalysts&#8217; synergy for LSBs. Specifically, it pertains to the bi&#8722;functional electrocatalysts comprising a series of metal nitrides (MN) and partner metal single atoms (M&#8722;SA) for the conversion and migration of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The M&#8722;SA with higher eg/t2g promotes the conversion of Li2S4&#8722;dominated decisive steps, alleviating the shuttling. Concurrently, MN with abundant bonding facilitates the migration of lithium sulfide, which significantly reduces the accumulation of insulating sulfide. Such independent but synergistic hybridization makes the bicomponent MN/M&#8722;SA possess improved catalysis over the S electrochemistry compared to their single components, which is also experimentally verified with W&#8722;SA/WN as the representative. The batteries provide considerable sulfur utilization, superior rate capability, and the assembled 6.31 Ah pouch&#8722;pack battery even has an ultra&#8722;high incipient energy density of 506.2&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 under high sulfur loading and lean&#8722;electrolyte. A thorough comprehension of the catalytic properties from both electronic and structural standpoints provides a novel viewpoint for understanding and designing LSBs&#8217; catalysts.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Mechanoluminescent Haptic Sensor via Dual&#8208;Functional Chromatic Filtration by a Conjugated Polymer Shell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;resolution mechanoluminescence (ML) platform is achieved through&#160;chromatic filtration strategy using a conjugated polymer shell (F8BT) on copper&#8208;doped zinc sulfide microparticles. This shell narrows the emission bandwidth, selectively filtering out blue noise, while simultaneously boosting intensity via ML photon recycling process. The dual action significantly enhances signal clarity and stability, enabling precise multi&#8208;signal differentiation in haptic sensors and advanced stress&#8208;sensing technologies.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence materials have emerged as promising candidates for haptic interface sensors due to their mechanically driven luminescent property. However, the inherently broad emission spectra of most mechanoluminescence materials hinder sharp signal generation and high spectral resolution. Here, a chromatic filtration strategy is suggested employing poly(9,9&#8208;dioctylfluorene&#8208;alt&#8208;benzothiadiazole) (F8BT) as a conjugated polymer shell on copper&#8208;doped zinc sulfide to achieve a highly refined and intensified signal. By selectively suppressing spectral components below 490&#160;nm, the F8BT shell effectively narrows the emission bandwidth, yielding a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 55&#160;nm during the mechanoluminescence process. In particular, F8BT shell efficiently mitigates signal intensity loss, which can be ascribed to the chromatic filtration ability, through mechanoluminescence photon recycling performance. This dual functionality significantly reduces spectral noise in the blue region with high intensity, enhancing the resolution in actual powerless haptic controllers. The novel approach establishes a scalable framework for high&#8208;resolution mechanoluminescence platforms, providing a versatile pathway toward next&#8208;generation, power&#8208;free stress&#8208;sensing applications with unprecedented spectral precision and optical fidelity.

         <title>Prelithiation of Alloy Anodes via Roll Pressing for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general prelithiation method is developed for alloy&#8208;type negative electrodes via solid&#8208;state lithiation using roll&#8208;pressing with thin lithium foil. This mechanical prelithiation method is compatible with roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll processing and allows for a controlled extent of prelithiation. Prelithiated Si, Al, and Sn anodes, as well as multi&#8208;component foil anodes, exhibit improved Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability in solid&#8208;state batteries with sulfide&#8208;based electrolytes.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries with alloy&#8208;type negative electrodes can feature enhanced energy density and safety compared to conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, diffusional Li trapping within Li alloys often causes low initial Coulombic efficiency and leads to capacity loss with cycling. Here, a general roll&#8208;pressing prelithiation method compatible with a variety of alloy&#8208;type negative electrodes (silicon, aluminum, tin, and multi&#8208;phase alloys) is introduced, which is shown to improve performance in solid&#8208;state batteries. By warm&#8208;rolling lithium foil of controlled thickness with various alloy&#8208;type electrodes, both slurry&#8208;cast and foil&#8208;type electrodes can be uniformly prelithiated via direct chemical reaction. The prelithiated electrodes exhibit enhanced specific capacity and extended cycle life in batteries with Li6PS5Cl solid&#8208;state electrolyte. Prelithiated multi&#8208;phase foil electrodes with a tailored interface are shown to exhibit superior cycling stability down to 2&#160;MPa stack pressure. This prelithiation technique offers a pathway to overcome intrinsic challenges in alloy anodes for solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Biovision&#8208;Inspired Perovskite Intelligent Camera for Panchromatic and Metameric Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biovision&#8208;inspired intelligent imaging system combines perovskite photodetectors, single&#8208;pixel imaging and deep learning&#8211;driven color fusion to emulate the best of mantis shrimp&#8208;like multispectral vision and human color perception. With multispectral channels in a compact filter&#8208;free setup, the system enables full&#8208;color imaging and metamerism resistance, portending a new paradigm in adaptive color vision technology.








Abstract
Biological vision systems excel at acquiring and processing information, but there is often a trade&#8208;off between these capabilities. For instance, mantis shrimp possess exceptional spectral sensing but poor color perception due to limited neural processing. Taking the best of both worlds, the mantis shrimp's spectral detection ability and the human&#8208;like visual processing power are integrated to achieve full&#8208;color perception. Using an aerosol&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid spraying technique, an array of high&#8208;quality, excess ion migration enhanced perovskite narrowband photodetectors spanning the ultraviolet to visible spectrum is developed. These detectors enable a computational multispectral imaging system that captures seven spectral images in one shot. A deep&#8208;learning&#8208;based color fusion network is designed to efficiently translate multispectral inputs into an RGB representation, significantly enhancing color recognition of these mantis shrimp&#8208;inspired multispectral cameras and affording the capability to overcome metamerism. These perovskite intelligent camera leverages the strengths of biological vision and demonstrate a novel approach to multispectral imaging that could advance applications in machine vision, remote sensing, and medical imaging.

         <title>Color Tuning in Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystals using Triptycene/Hydrazone Chiral Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoresponsive chiral ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NF*LCs)&#160;have been obtained by doping a polar liquid crystal host (DIO) with chiral triptycene/hydrazone&#8208;based bistable photoswitches. Upon irradiation with 442 and 340&#160;nm light sources, the pitch of the NF*LCs can be reversibly phototuned at 50&#160;&#176;C, resulting in the reflection and locking&#8208;in of the primary colors, red, green, and blue.








Abstract
The development of light&#8208;tunable ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NFLCs) will allow for the multi&#8208;stimuli control over the properties of this newly discovered LC phase. Here on the development of photoresponsive chiral ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NF*LCs) is reported by incorporating chiral triptycene/hydrazone&#8208;based bistable photoswitchable dopants into the polar liquid crystal mesogen DIO. The propeller&#8208;like dopants exhibit high helical twisting powers with values of 13.5 &#181;m&#8722;1 in DIO, with a further increase in value to 31.0 &#181;m&#8722;1 upon 442&#160;nm light&#8208;induced Z &#8594; E photoisomerization. This process results in the tuning of the NF*LC's reflection color from near infrared, to red, green, and finally blue at 50&#160;&#176;C. The reverse color transition can be induced by 340&#160;nm light irradiation, which drives the E&#8594;Z photoisomerization of the hydrazone. The ferroelectric nature of the NF*LC phase is confirmed by applying an alternating current electric field (0.67&#160;V/ &#181;m, 10&#160;Hz, square wave), which initiated azimuthal deformations of the ferroelectric helix.

&lt;p&gt;Photoresponsive chiral ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;LCs)&#160;have been obtained by doping a polar liquid crystal host (DIO) with chiral triptycene/hydrazone-based bistable photoswitches. Upon irradiation with 442 and 340&#160;nm light sources, the pitch of the N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;LCs can be reversibly phototuned at 50&#160;&#176;C, resulting in the reflection and locking-in of the primary colors, red, green, and blue.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of light-tunable ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;LCs) will allow for the multi-stimuli control over the properties of this newly discovered LC phase. Here on the development of photoresponsive chiral ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;LCs) is reported by incorporating chiral triptycene/hydrazone-based bistable photoswitchable dopants into the polar liquid crystal mesogen DIO. The propeller-like dopants exhibit high helical twisting powers with values of 13.5 &#181;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in DIO, with a further increase in value to 31.0 &#181;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; upon 442&#160;nm light-induced &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; &#8594; &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; photoisomerization. This process results in the tuning of the N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;LC's reflection color from near infrared, to red, green, and finally blue at 50&#160;&#176;C. The reverse color transition can be induced by 340&#160;nm light irradiation, which drives the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&#8594;&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; photoisomerization of the hydrazone. The ferroelectric nature of the N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;LC phase is confirmed by applying an alternating current electric field (0.67&#160;V/ &#181;m, 10&#160;Hz, square wave), which initiated azimuthal deformations of the ferroelectric helix.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A photo&#8208;patternable solid&#8208;state electrolyte based on &#120580;&#8208;carrageenan (&#120580;&#8208;CGN) and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) is developed to enable high&#8208;performance complementary OECT circuits. The successful demonstration of fully implanted devices for vagus nerve stimulation in mice highlights solid&#8208;state &#120580;&#8208;CGN&#8208;based electrolytes as a promising platform for scalable, implantable circuits and next&#8208;generation bioelectronic technologies.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are crucial for next&#8208;generation (bio&#8208;)electronic devices but are often constrained by the use of aqueous electrolytes, which introduce crosstalk, hinder miniaturization, and limit circuit integration. Here, a photo&#8208;patternable solid&#8208;state electrolyte based on &#120580;&#8208;carrageenan (&#120580;&#8208;CGN) and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) is presented, enabling high&#8208;performance OECTs and complementary circuits. The &#120580;&#8208;CGN electrolyte exhibits high ionic conductivity (&gt;10 mS cm&#8722;1), comparable to a 0.1 m NaCl aqueous electrolyte, while supporting precise patterning down to 15 &#181;m, fast transient response times, minimal hysteresis, and excellent stability in both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type OECTs. Compact solid&#8208;state NAND/NOR gates (500 &#215; 800 &#181;m2), 4&#8208;input NAND gates (1600 &#215; 800 &#181;m2, 8 OECTs), and half&#8208;adders (2 &#215; 1 mm2, 18 OECTs) are demonstrated, all exhibiting correct logic functions and low&#8208;voltage operation. To highlight its potential for implantable bioelectronics, solid&#8208;state spiking circuits, monolithically integrated with flexible cuff electrodes, are developed for vagus nerve stimulation in mice. These findings establish &#120580;&#8208;CGN&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes as a promising platform for scalable, implantable circuits, paving the way for next&#8208;generation bioelectronic devices.

         <title>Solvation Design of an Interfacial Self&#8208;Compatible Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolyte for High&#8208;Loading Sodium&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

This work proposes an additive&#8208;induced solvation strategy toward an interface self&#8208;compatible quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte for high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading sodium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries. The additive exhibits stronger coordination with anion than EMC molecules, preventing solvent co&#8208;intercalation, and decomposes preferentially to form a thin and robust CEI. Consequently, the in situ fabricated quasi&#8208;solid SDIBs with high loading demonstrate stable cycling performance and a commendable rate capability.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (SDIBs) attract extensive attention in stationary energy storage for their low cost, environmental friendliness, and high working voltage. However, traditional liquid electrolytes for SDIBs undergo solvent co&#8208;intercalation and severe oxidation decomposition at high voltage, causing unstable cathode structure and low Coulombic efficiency, especially with high loading (&gt;5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). Herein, an interfacial self&#8208;compatible quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte (ACPE) is developed via an additive&#8208;induced solvation design strategy. The additive exhibits stronger coordination with Hexafluorophosphate anion (PF6&#8722;) than ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) molecules, prevents solvent co&#8208;intercalation, and decomposes preferentially to form a thin and robust cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI). ACPE offers a high oxidation stability (5.5&#160;V) and effectively curbs solvent co&#8208;intercalation at the graphite cathode. On the sodium anode, an ACPE&#8208;derived robust interphase enables stable sodium plating/stripping for over 300&#160;h. Consequently, for the first time, an in situ fabricated quasi&#8208;solid SDIB with high loading (&gt;6.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) demonstrates stable cycling performance (above 900 cycles) and a commendable rate capability (84.6% capacity retention at 10&#160;C), among the best quasi&#8208;solid DIBs. Even with an ultra&#8208;high&#8208;loading cathode (&gt;16.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;2), the SDIB maintains a stable capacity for 300 cycles. This solvation strategy of electrolytes paves a new way for developing high&#8208;loading DIBs.

         <title>Unlocking Dual Functionality in Triazine&#8208;Based Emitters: Synergistic Enhancement of Two&#8208;Photon Absorption and TADF&#8208;OLED Performance with Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Substituents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational molecular design strategy is presented for simultaneously enhancing two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) by incorporating electron&#8208;withdrawing units into a CzTRZ scaffold. The resulting materials exhibit high 2PA cross&#8208;sections, efficient reversed intersystem crossing, and excellent OLED performance, opening new possibilities for advanced imaging probes and organic semiconductors.








Abstract
The simultaneous realization of two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in a single molecular system remains challenging due to an inherent trade&#8208;off in their molecular design requirements. In this study, we present a strategy to enhance both properties by introducing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents into the CzTRZ scaffold, thereby leveraging an electron&#8208;withdrawing&#8208;enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (EWICT) character. The incorporation of TRZCF3 and TRZCN units effectively enhances the charge transfer (CT) character of CzTRZ, resulting in high 2PA cross&#8208;sections (156 GM for CzTRZCF3 and 200 GM for CzTRZCN) and a reduced singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST = ES1 &#8211; ET1). Computational and experimental studies reveal that incorporating TRZCF3 and TRZCN units selectively stabilizes the S1 state and reduces &#916;EST, significantly facilitating the reversed intersystem crossing (RISC) process. Notably, 1c exhibits the fastest RISC rate (kRISC), leading to superior TADF properties and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 13.5% in OLEDs. Moreover, a relatively high two&#8208;photon brightness of 174 GM is estimated for 1c. These findings demonstrate a rational molecular design strategy for the synergistic enhancement of 2PA cross&#8208;sections and excellent OLED performance, paving the way for applications in advanced imaging probes and organic semiconductors.

This work presents narrow&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (BTT&#8208;DTPn and BTT&#8208;DTPn&#8208;2F) for SWIR organic photodetectors. The optimized devices through solvent vapor annealing suppress dark current and enhance detectivity while enabling high&#8208;quality blood&#8208;pressure monitoring and real&#8208;time optical communication. The co&#8208;engineering strategy bridges molecular design and device processing to advance SWIR organic photodetectors.








Abstract
The limited noise&#8208;responsivity balance in Short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) organic photodetectors (OPDs) restricts their biomedical and optoelectronic applications. In this study, this challenge is addressed through molecular&#8208;device co&#8208;engineering by designing two fluorinated narrow&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (BTT&#8208;DTPn and BTT&#8208;DTPn&#8208;2F) coupled with solvent vapor annealing (SVA), achieving low noise and high detectivity in SWIR OPDs. The optimized devices based on BTT&#8208;DTPn&#8208;2F, which features enhance &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking due to terminal fluorination, extend its absorption capability to 1300&#160;nm. Under &#8722;0.1&#160;V bias, the SVA&#8208;processed BTT&#8208;DTPn&#8208;2F devices demonstrate an ultra&#8208;low dark current (Jd) of 4.93 &#215; 10&#8722;8 A cm&#8722;2 and exhibit a suppressed trap density of states (tDOS) reduced by an order of magnitude, achieving a shot&#8208;noise limited detectivity (Dsh&#8727;$D_{{\mathrm{sh}}}^*$) of 7.19 &#215; 1011 Jones at 1200&#160;nm. The synergy of molecular design and post&#8208;processing enables an ultra&#8208;fast response time (1.44/1.20 &#181;s rise/fall) and a record&#8208;high &#8722;3&#160;dB cutoff frequency (f&#8722;3&#160;dB) of 648&#160;kHz, demonstrating remarkable performance for SWIR OPDs. These advancements facilitate two groundbreaking applications: deep&#8208;tissue photoplethysmography (PPG) for cuff&#8208;less blood pressure monitoring and high&#8208;speed, real&#8208;time SWIR optical communication. This methodology presents a general strategy to harmonize molecular design with device fabrication in SWIR OPDs.

         <title>Lifting Triplet Degeneracy Through Organic&#8208;Cation Driven Structural Perturbation to Modulate Luminescence of Sb3+&#8208;Doped Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing a single&#8208;source, multi&#8208;emissive perovskite with better control over excited&#8208;state manifold splitting is a key challenge. Here, unique 2D Sb3+&#8208;doped halide double perovskites are developed, exhibiting triplet symmetry breaking through organic cation driven structural distortions, in concert with spin&#8208;orbit coupling and Jahn&#8208;Teller interactions. This enables a selective population of emissive non&#8208;degenerate states, a key step toward spin&#8208;polarized emission.








Abstract
The spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) and the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect (JTE) alter the orbital degeneracy in materials, leading to unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties essential in spintronics, quantum computing, and light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, the study employs luminescent p&#8208;xylylenediammonium (PXA) instead of Cs+ in Cs2NaInCl6 to yield 2D Sb3+&#8208;doped (PXA)2NaInCl8 double perovskite and demonstrates a non&#8208;degenerate triplet state resulting from enhanced JTE in the strong SOC regime, featuring distinct emission centers. Consequently, a broadband emission from both PXA and [SbCl6]3&#8722; spans the entire spectrum (350&#8211;750&#160;nm), representing a rare single&#8208;source multi&#8208;emissive 2D perovskite. With in&#8208;depth comparative structural, temperature&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;physical, and theoretical studies, it is elucidated that the synergistic effect of SOC and JTE on the Eg and T2g lattice modes modulate the electronic structure of [SbCl6]3&#8722; by splitting the doubly degenerate E levels of 3T1u&#8727;$^{3}{\mathrm{T}}_{1u}^*$ into non&#8208;degenerate states. The physical model, supported by theoretical studies, explains the energy level splitting required to realize two kinds of radiative minima in the relaxed excited state.

         <title>Pyridocarbene&#8208;Based Tetradentate Pt(II) Complexes for Long Device Lifetime over 500 h in Blue Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8211;Emitting Diodes</title>

Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy exhibit external quantum efficiencies of 24.5% and 27.4% at the 3&#160;wt.% doping concentration, respectively. In particular, Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy doped blue PhOLEDs optimized for stability demonstrate a device lifetime of up to 95% of the initial luminance of 543 and 228 h at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which has never been achieved in the blue PhOLEDs.








Abstract
Blue phosphorescent organic light&#8211;emitting diodes (PhOLEDs) face challenges in achieving high efficiency, color purity, and long device lifetime due to exciton quenching and high energy requirements. In this study, two tetradentate Pt(II) complexes, Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy, are designed and synthesized by incorporating pyridocarbene in their ligands. Pyridocarbene enhances the electrochemical stability, strengthens triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer characteristics, and improves the spin&#8211;orbit coupling, effectively shortening the exciton lifetime and minimizing the quenching effects. Additionally, the introduction of a methyl group as a conformation manager in Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy further improves the color purity by blue&#8208;shifting and narrowing the emission spectrum. As a result, Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy exhibit external quantum efficiencies of 24.5% and 27.4% at the 3&#160;wt.% doping concentration, respectively. In particular, Pt&#8208;impy and Pt&#8208;Me&#8208;impy doped blue PhOLEDs optimized for stability demonstrate a device lifetime of up to 95% of the initial luminance of 543 and 228&#160;h at 1,000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which has never been achieved in the blue PhOLEDs. This study demonstrates that the synergistic combination of pyridocarbene and the methyl conformation manager is an effective strategy for improving blue PhOLED performance, enhancing their potential for practical applications.

         <title>A Universal Orientation&#8208;Engineering Strategy for Enhancing Mechano&#8208;Electric Conversion Performance in Semi&#8208;Crystalline Biopolymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a systematic design of high&#8208;charge&#8208;output triboelectric biopolymers through multiscale orientation engineering. The triboelectric output performance of silk fibroin is systematically analyzed for the first time from the perspective of interfacial charge transfer and bulk charge transport. The enhanced mechano&#8208;electric conversion mechanism of orientation&#8208;optimized semi&#8208;crystalline biopolymers is further explored based on molecular dynamic simulations and first&#8208;principles calculations.








Abstract
High&#8208;charge&#8208;density triboelectric materials are the key to developing high&#8208;performance triboelectric nanogenerators. However, most semi&#8208;crystalline biopolymers exhibit low triboelectric output performance due to the limitations in their intrinsic structure and physicochemical properties. Herein, orientation&#8208;regulated silk fibroin nanofibers (SFNs) with phase transition polarization and enhanced carrier migration are developed through high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;speed synergistic electrospinning technology. To analyze the molecular and aggregation structural changes of SFNs during high&#8208;voltage electric fields and stress&#8208;induced orientation processes, a multiscale structural evolutionary model is constructed from microscopic molecular chains to mesoscopic aggregation structures, and then to macroscopic fiber arrangements. It is found that as the orientation coefficient increases, the molecular conformation shifts from disordered &#945;&#8208;helices to ordered stacked &#946;&#8208;sheets. The aggregated molecular chains gradually slip, recombine, and arrange in an orderly manner along the direction of the stress field, which contributes to regulating the charge capture and carrier migration properties. The orientation&#8208;regulated SFNs significantly enhance the interfacial charge transfer and bulk charge transport capacity, thereby greatly improving the triboelectric performance. This work not only provides new insights into the mechano&#8208;electric conversion mechanisms of semi&#8208;crystalline biopolymers but also offers guidance for the design of high&#8208;charge&#8208;density triboelectric materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-charge-density triboelectric materials are the key to developing high-performance triboelectric nanogenerators. However, most semi-crystalline biopolymers exhibit low triboelectric output performance due to the limitations in their intrinsic structure and physicochemical properties. Herein, orientation-regulated silk fibroin nanofibers (SFNs) with phase transition polarization and enhanced carrier migration are developed through high-voltage and high-speed synergistic electrospinning technology. To analyze the molecular and aggregation structural changes of SFNs during high-voltage electric fields and stress-induced orientation processes, a multiscale structural evolutionary model is constructed from microscopic molecular chains to mesoscopic aggregation structures, and then to macroscopic fiber arrangements. It is found that as the orientation coefficient increases, the molecular conformation shifts from disordered &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-helices to ordered stacked &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-sheets. The aggregated molecular chains gradually slip, recombine, and arrange in an orderly manner along the direction of the stress field, which contributes to regulating the charge capture and carrier migration properties. The orientation-regulated SFNs significantly enhance the interfacial charge transfer and bulk charge transport capacity, thereby greatly improving the triboelectric performance. This work not only provides new insights into the mechano-electric conversion mechanisms of semi-crystalline biopolymers but also offers guidance for the design of high-charge-density triboelectric materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exceptional n&#8208;Type Ionic Thermoelectric Hydrogels by Synergistic Hydrophobic and Coordination Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A poly(vinyl alcohol)&#8208;based n&#8208;type ionic thermoelectric hydrogel is developed by synergistic coordination and hydrophobic interactions. This strategy yields a high negative Seebeck coefficient (&#8722;38.6&#160;mV&#160;K&#8722;1) and excellent stretchability (382.5%). The hydrogel powers flexible sensors and harvests low&#8208;grade heat, offering a new approach for stretchable ionic thermoelectrics in wearable sensors and heat conversion devices.








Abstract
Ionic thermoelectric (i&#8208;TE) materials show promise for flexible energy harvesting and self&#8208;powered sensing due to their high ionic Seebeck coefficients (Si). However, achieving both high thermoelectric performance and mechanical stretchability, especially in n&#8208;type systems, remains a critical challenge. Herein, a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)&#8208;based n&#8208;type i&#8208;TE hydrogel is presented that exhibits both large negative Si (&#8722;38.6&#160;mV&#160;K&#8722;1) and excellent stretchability (382.5%) through synergistic effect of coordination and hydrophobic interactions. Leveraging the amphiphilic nature of PVA, its hydrophilic hydroxyl groups form coordination bonds with Cu2+ ions from copper chloride (CuCl2), while its hydrophobic backbone interacts with water&#8208;soluble conjugated polymer (poly(3&#8208;(3&#8242;&#8208;N,N,N&#8208;triethylammonium&#8208;1&#8242;&#8208;propy&#8208;loxy)&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;thiophene chloride (PMNT). Meanwhile, hydrophobic associations also occur among PMNT chains due to strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and backbone hydrophobicity. This dual&#8208;interaction strategy approach enhances the thermophoretic difference between chloride anions (from both CuCl2 and PMNT) and cations, enabling the giant ionic thermopower. Besides, the long&#8208;range hydrophobic interactions contribute to the overall mechanical robustness. The developed hydrogels are successfully implemented in self&#8208;powered temperature sensors and low&#8208;grade heat harvesting systems, such as powering a cooling fan by utilizing the waste heat from a working tablet. This work offers an alternative pathway toward developing high&#8208;performance i&#8208;TE materials for wearable electronics and low&#8208;grade heat harvesting applications.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Assisted Rapid Gelation and Foaming of Gradient Hydrogel as Human&#8208;Machine Interfaces with Regulated Charge Accumulation/Dissipation and Enhanced Tactile Sensing Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative strategy is proposed to improve the performance of hydrogel&#8208;based tactile sensors through manipulating the interfacial properties and ion transport kinetics rather than barely enlarging the contact area. The phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced hydrogel foam with gradient porous structure and interfacially accumulated MXene nanosheets simultaneously achieves high sensitivity of 4267 kPa&#8722;1 and a wide detectable range up to 100 kPa.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based tactile sensors, typically featuring a sandwiched structure of electrode/hydrogel/electrode with charges (electrons and ions) accumulated at both interfaces forming electrical double layers (EDLs), are considered promising candidates as human&#8208;machine interfaces (HMIs); however, the continuous dense structure limits the deformability of bulk hydrogels, hindering the achievement of high&#8208;sensitivity and wide detectable range. Moreover, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies for enhancing sensitivity predominantly focus on enlarging the changes of hydrogel/electrode contact area upon external force, while overlooking the design of interfacial properties and ion transport kinetics. Herein, polyacrylamide/chitosan/MXene (PAM/CS/MXene, PCM) hydrogels with gradient porosity and tailorable softness are developed following the phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced foaming mechanism. Ti3C2TX MXene plays critical roles in promoting rapid gelation, stabilizing bubbles, regulating ion transport kinetics, and modulating charge accumulation/dissipation at the hydrogel/electrode interfaces. As a consequence, the obtained PCM foam (PCMF) tactile sensor exhibits an optimal sensitivity of 4267 kPa&#8722;1 together with a wide detectable pressure range up to 100 kPa. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications are demonstrated for acquiring and identifying gesture commands to control a robotic arm for swab sampling and the movement of an electric car in a maze game by integrating PCMF sensors with a digital camera for visual feedback and machine learning for accurate recognition, respectively.

         <title>Nonresonant Raman Control of Ferroelectric Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonresonant Raman excitation with mid&#8208;infrared pulses induces large&#8208;amplitude lattice motion and ultrafast ferroelectric reversal in lithium niobate. A suite of spectroscopic techniques uncovers the underlying dynamics, establishing a low&#8208;energy route to reshape complex energy landscapes and synthesize hidden material phases with unique functionalities on ultrafast timescales.








Abstract
Important advances is recently made in the search for materials with complex multi&#8208;phase landscapes that host photoinduced metastable collective states with exotic functionalities. In almost all cases so far, the desired phases are accessed by exploiting light&#8211;matter interactions via the imaginary part of the dielectric function through above&#8208;bandgap or resonant mode excitation. Nonresonant Raman excitation of coherent modes is experimentally observed and proposed for dynamic material control, but the resulting atomic excursion is limited to perturbative levels. Here, this challenge is overcome by employing nonresonant ultrashort pulses with low photon energies well below the bandgap. Using mid&#8208;infrared pulses, ferroelectric reversal is induced in lithium niobate, and the large&#8208;amplitude mode displacements are characterized through femtosecond stimulated Raman scattering and second harmonic generation. This approach, validated by first&#8208;principle calculations, defines a novel method for synthesizing hidden phases with unique functional properties and manipulating complex energy landscapes at reduced energy consumption and ultrafast&#160;speeds.

         <title>Pyrazinoquinazoline&#8208;Based Eu&#8208;MOF Ratiometric Fluorescence Sensing: Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Meat Spoilage Enabled by Dynamic Regulation of LMCT/LLCT Triggered by Biogenic Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By developing a dual&#8208;emission Eu&#8208;MOF ratiometric platform using pyrazinoquinoxaline ligands, achieving biogenic amine detection via LMCT/LLCT&#8208;regulated fluorescence color shifts, integrated with hydrogel&#8208;encapsulated smartphone RGB analysis for real&#8208;time shrimp/chicken spoilage monitoring.








Abstract
This study develops a dual&#8208;emission Eu&#8208;MOF ratiometric fluorescence sensor for biogenic amine detection in food spoilage monitoring. The sensor exhibits dual emission at 495 nm (ligand &#960;&#8594;&#960;* transition) and 615 nm (ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer, LMCT) through the antenna effect. Biogenic amines specifically regulate the intensity ratio (I495nm/I615nm) by adsorbing into MOF pores via hydrogen bonding, triggering a dynamic equilibrium switch between LMCT and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (LLCT), causing fluorescence color shift from orange to green. Theoretical calculations reveal this response mechanism for the first time. Encapsulating Eu&#8208;MOF in agarose hydrogel&#8208;based portable tags with smartphone RGB analysis enables rapid quantitative detection of biogenic amines (detection limit: 3.7&#8211;9.1 &#181;M, response time &lt;10 min). The sensor allows real&#8208;time tracking of spoilage in shrimp and chicken stored at 0&#8211;25 &#176;C, with visual fluorescence color transitions reflecting amine accumulation levels. This work provides molecular insights into dynamic charge transfer regulation and establishes a high&#8208;sensitivity, visual, wearable solution for on&#8208;site food safety detection, advancing smart sensing technology in the food industry.

         <title>Ternary Strategy and Molecular Electrostatics Collaboratively Optimize Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Polymer Donor Organic Solar Cells: Over 20% Efficiency and High Scalability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>

Inefficient low&#8208;molecule&#8208;weight LWPM6&#8208;based organic solar cells (OSCs) using trimeric acceptor TYT&#8208;S are optimized, enhancing power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 20%. LWPM6 flexible devices show excellent mechanical stability and solution&#8208;processability, offering new insights for OSCs commercialization.








Abstract
Achieving consistent performance across polymer donor batches is crucial for the commercialization of organic solar cells (OSCs). Compared with high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight PM6 (HWPM6), low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight PM6 (LWPM6) has lower efficiency but better stress&#8208;dispersion characteristics and solution&#8208;processability, making its performance improvement vital for practical applications. Here, LWPM6&#8208;based OSCs are optimized by introducing a trimeric guest (TYT&#8208;S). TYT&#8208;S improves PM6:Y6 compatibility, achieving a finer phase separation and a favorable interpenetrating network morphology. A ternary strategy, leveraging molecular electrostatic potential differences, promotes LWPM6 pre&#8208;aggregation, extends film&#8208;formation time, and enhances molecular ordering. The LWPM6&#8208;based ternary system exhibits an optimized vertical phase distribution, with maximum exciton dissociation occurring near the cathode, resulting in a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.23% (LWPM6&#8208;based binary with a low PCE of 17.35%). When BTP&#8208;eC9 replaces Y6, the LWPM6&#8208;based ternary devices achieve a PCE of 20.12% (LWPM6&#8208;based binary with a low PCE of 17.64%). Additionally, LW polymers can dissipate stress via segmental motion. After 3000 bending cycles, LWPM6&#8208;based flexible devices retain higher initial efficiency than HWPM6&#8208;based one, demonstrating better mechanical stability. In mini&#8208;modules, they also have good solution&#8208;processability. This work demonstrates that a trimer guest strategy can significantly enhance the photovoltaic performance of low&#8208;efficiency LWPM6, offering new insights for OSCs commercialization.

Strong aromatic conjugated ammonium salt (PyPAI) spacers spontaneously form self&#8208;assembled columnar stacks via synergistic cation&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. This simultaneously regulates crystallization and establishes a continuous charge transport pathway through a robust &#960;&#8208;conjugated network, overcoming dielectric confinement. Resultant 2D/3D PSCs achieve 26.41% efficiency with enhanced stability.








Abstract
2D/3D perovskite heterojunctions exhibit simultaneous improvement of efficiency and stability to meet commercial applications. However, dielectric confinement and an intrinsically uncontrollable crystallization process in 2D perovskites typically lead to large exciton binding energies and poor film quality, hindering charge dissociation, carrier transport, and ultimately device performance. Here, a strong aromatic conjugated ammonium salt spacer (PyPAI) that can spontaneously form self&#8208;assembled columnar stacks via synergistic cation&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions is introduced, thereby simultaneously regulating crystal growth and enhancing charge transfer for high performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The in situ generated 2D perovskite phases effectively modulate nucleation and crystallization kinetics, yielding superior films with vertically oriented crystals and reduced grain boundary density. Concurrently, the robust aromatic &#960;&#8208;conjugated network establishes continuous energy bands, enabling highly efficient carrier shuttling between the inorganic Pb&#8208;I framework and the cationic organic layers. Consequently, PyPAI&#8208;optimized PSCs achieve a remarkable PCE of 26.41% with superior environmental and operational stability.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Selective Defects Engineering in A&#8208;Site Ordered Layered Perovskites for High&#8208;Performance Reversible Protonic Ceramic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cation&#8208;selective defects strategy is proposed to decouple and optimize activity and durability of A&#8208;site ordered layered perovskites air electrode for reversible protonic ceramic cells (RPCCs). A specific cations&#8208;deficient Pr(Ba0.5Sr0.5)0.95Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; displays superior activity and stability when used as an RPCCs air electrode, accelerating its commercialization.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic cells facilitate efficient chemical&#8208;electrical energy interconversion, advancing renewable energy utilization. Commercial viability, however, demands intermediate&#8208;to&#8208;low temperatures (ILT, 400&#8211;600&#160;&#176;C) operation, currently constrained by air electrode performance. A&#8208;site ordered layered perovskite PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (PBSCF) promises, yet faces activity and stability issues at ILT. Cation defects effectively tune defect structures in simple perovskites, boosting electrochemical performance, but their specific effects in A&#8208;site ordered perovskites with dual A&#8208;site environments remain unexplored. Here, A&#8208;site cation&#8208;selective defects are engineered to tune PBSCF's performance, with Pr&#8208;deficient (Pr0.95Ba0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948;, p&#8208;PBSCF) and Ba/Sr&#8208;deficient (Pr(Ba0.5Sr0.5)0.95Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948;, bs&#8208;PBSCF) variants revealing distinct defects&#8208;performance relationships. Pr defects weaken Co&#9472;O covalency to activate Co sites, enhancing oxygen electrocatalytic activity. Concurrently, it lowers oxygen vacancy concentration, inhibiting hydration&#8208;induced lattice expansion. This stabilizes Ba&#9472;O/Sr&#9472;O bonds and mitigates Ba/Sr segregation, enhancing stability. However, the reduced oxygen vacancy concentration inhibits the material's hydration, lowering proton conduction and thus restricting activity enhancement. In contrast, Ba/Sr defects not only weaken Co&#9472;O covalency to activate Co sites, but also increase oxygen vacancy concentration, promoting proton and oxygen&#8208;ion transport, thereby significantly enhancing electrode activity. Furthermore, despite increased hydration, bs&#8208;PBSCF's larger&#8208;radius cation defects yield a smaller unit cell versus p&#8208;PBSCF, further strengthening Ba&#9472;O/Sr&#9472;O bonds and inhibiting Ba/Sr segregation, thus leading to superior stability.

         <title>Hydrogen Storage in Magnesium Hydride at Room Temperature Enabled by Graphene&#8208;Stabilized Multivalent Niobium Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene&#8208;stabilized multivalent niobium oxides catalyst enables rapid and reversible hydrogen storage in MgH2, even under room&#8208;temperature or subzero conditions. The in situ formation of multivalent Nb species (Nb0/Nb2+/Nb4+) facilitates barrierless H2 dissociation and enhances H diffusion. This work offers critical insights into low&#8208;temperature hydrogen storage via a synergistic electronic and catalytic mechanism.








Abstract
Reversible hydrogen storage in magnesium hydride (MgH2) remains hindered by intrinsic, complicated kinetic barriers associated with both hydrogen release and uptake, particularly under mild conditions. In this work, graphene&#8208;confined, low&#8208;crystallinity niobium oxide nanoparticles are developed to optimize the kinetic barriers across all stages of hydrogen absorption and desorption in MgH2. This is realized by the synergistic effect of in situ&#8208;generated stable multivalent niobium oxide (NbOx) and the electronically modulating graphene. It is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that Nb2+ enhances H2 dissociation and diffusion, while Nb4+ facilitates Mg&#9472;H bond cleavage and recombination of H2. Graphene serves a dual function by modulating the electronic environment at NbOx interfaces to facilitate charge transfer, while confining nanoparticles to prevent aggregation and hence maintain the catalytic stability of NbOx. Moreover, graphene suppresses the excessive hydrogen binding tendency of over&#8208;reduced Nb0, which otherwise traps H and impedes hydrogen diffusion. This integrated structure ensures the stabilization of active Nb species and lowers energy barriers across all key steps of hydrogen storage. As a result, an effective hydrogen absorption even at 0&#160;&#176;C and an onset hydrogen desorption temperature of 155.9&#160;&#176;C is realized.

     alt="Hydrogen Storage in Magnesium Hydride at Room Temperature Enabled by Graphene-Stabilized Multivalent Niobium Oxides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphene-stabilized multivalent niobium oxides catalyst enables rapid and reversible hydrogen storage in MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, even under room-temperature or subzero conditions. The in situ formation of multivalent Nb species (Nb&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;/Nb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Nb&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;) facilitates barrierless H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissociation and enhances H diffusion. This work offers critical insights into low-temperature hydrogen storage via a synergistic electronic and catalytic mechanism.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reversible hydrogen storage in magnesium hydride (MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) remains hindered by intrinsic, complicated kinetic barriers associated with both hydrogen release and uptake, particularly under mild conditions. In this work, graphene-confined, low-crystallinity niobium oxide nanoparticles are developed to optimize the kinetic barriers across all stages of hydrogen absorption and desorption in MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This is realized by the synergistic effect of in situ-generated stable multivalent niobium oxide (NbO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) and the electronically modulating graphene. It is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that Nb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; enhances H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissociation and diffusion, while Nb&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; facilitates Mg&#9472;H bond cleavage and recombination of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Graphene serves a dual function by modulating the electronic environment at NbO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; interfaces to facilitate charge transfer, while confining nanoparticles to prevent aggregation and hence maintain the catalytic stability of NbO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, graphene suppresses the excessive hydrogen binding tendency of over-reduced Nb&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, which otherwise traps H and impedes hydrogen diffusion. This integrated structure ensures the stabilization of active Nb species and lowers energy barriers across all key steps of hydrogen storage. As a result, an effective hydrogen absorption even at 0&#160;&#176;C and an onset hydrogen desorption temperature of 155.9&#160;&#176;C is realized. This provides a versatile strategy for engineering multivalent oxides for promoting hydrogen storage of MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Omnidirectional Wind Domain Energy Harvesting Based on Dual&#8208;Mode Complementary Strategy of Wind&#8208;Induced Vibration</title>

The dual&#8208;mode complementary strategy of wind&#8208;induced vibration realizes broadband breeze vibration energy harvesting and optimizes wind energy collection in a wide range of wind speed and direction, filling the gap in energy collection when the transmission line does not vibrate due to wind direction changes.








Abstract
The harvesting and utilization of vibration energy from transmission lines can effectively advance the development of smart grids. However, variations in wind direction significantly affect the vibration status of transmission lines&#8208;a problem often overlooked in research. This paper clarifies the gap problem of wind&#8208;induced vibration energy harvesting in transmission lines for the first time, and presents a dual&#8208;mode complementary strategy of wind&#8208;induced vibration for transmission lines. The core innovation is to achieve self&#8208;adaptive omnidirectional wind domain energy harvesting by wind&#8208;vibration energy collaborative response, which overcomes the limitation of single vibration energy harvesting in transmission lines that depend on a specific wind direction. The designed wind&#8208;vibration hybrid nanogenerator (W&#8208;VHNG) ingeniously integrates two different TENG mechanisms to achieve broadband breeze vibration energy capture (vibration frequency range of 5&#8211;60&#160;Hz), wide wind speed and direction adaptability (wind speed range of 4.2&#8211;14 m&#160;s&#8722;1 and the wind direction range of &#177;30&#176;), and mW&#8208;scale power output (maximum mean power of 1.33&#160;mW). Finally, the potential of the W&#8208;VHNG for self&#8208;powered sensing of transmission lines is highlighted through three application strategies. This research provides a new solution for the sustainable harvesting of complex and variable high&#8208;entropy energy in transmission lines.

         <title>Breaking the Efficiency&#8208;Stability&#8208;Sustainability Trilemma in all&#8208;perovskite Tandem Solar Modules via Oxidative Blockchain Molecular Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>

This study presents an oxidation&#8208;triggered blockchain molecular&#8208;assisted buried interface engineering strategy for achieving comprehensive lifecycle management of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules and breaking the efficiency&#8208;stability&#8208;sustainability trilemma for practical applications.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites are vital for all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules (TSMs), yet their commercialization remains limited by challenges in balancing efficiency, stability, and sustainability. Here, we presented an oxidation&#8208;triggered blockchain molecular (BCM) interface engineering strategy, which modified the poly (3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) surface and constructed a dynamic functional layer at the buried PEDOT:PSS/Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite interface through synergistic effects of biocompatible rutin molecules and their oxidation derivatives. This approach enabled full&#8208;cycle optimization from film formation to operational longevity via sequential regulation of crystallization and carrier dynamics, along with persistent defect passivation through synergistic coordination and hydrogen bonding. Resulting NBG devices achieved champion efficiencies of 23.50% (0.045 cm2) and 17.10% (10.4 cm2), respectively. The all&#8208;perovskite TSMs (10.4 cm2) attained a 23.00% aperture efficiency (an active&#8208;area efficiency of 24.30%) and retained &#8764;90% efficiency after 640 h of continuous illumination (extrapolated TPCE80 lifetime of 3900 h) and after 15 cycles of day&#8208;night fatigue tests. Additionally, BCM's dual protection effects (physical barrier and chemical chelation) reduced lead leakage of severely damaged TSMs by 90% under simulated heavy rainfall, demonstrating strong environmental resilience. This work offers a scalable molecular strategy for advancing perovskite photovoltaics from lab&#8208;scale innovation to industrial viability.

         <title>Superstructure Engineering Enables NASICON&#8208;Type Phosphate Cathodes with Increased Working Voltage and Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the calcination temperature during synthesis, the Fe3+ is preferentially migrated to Na+ vacancies to generate Fe/Na_v superstructure ordering in monoclinic Na3VFe(PO4)3 (NVFP&#8208;S), which can increase Fe&#9472;O ionic characters due to electronic structure arrangement, finally elevating the Fe2+/Fe3 redox potential from 2.37 to 2.82&#160;V, corresponding to the energy density increase from 325 to 350&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 versus the conventional Na3VFe(PO4)3 (NVFP).








Abstract
Na+ Super Ionic CONductor (NASICON)&#8208;type iron&#8208;based phosphate cathode has attained extensive research interest due to its green, low cost, and superior rate capability for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, owing to strong Fe&#9472;O covalent character in the NASICON frameworks, the low Fe2+/Fe3+ redox potential (&lt;2.5&#160;V vs Na+/Na) has led to an undesirable energy density of phosphate cathode. Herein, superstructure engineering is employed to increase the ionic characteristics of Fe&#9472;O bonds and the working voltage of Fe2+/Fe3 redox couples. The combined analysis of advanced structural characterization and theoretical calculation indicates that the Fe3+ ions can migrate to Na+ vacancies to generate Fe/Na_v superstructure ordering by manipulating calcination temperature during synthesis. The Fe delocalization and electronic structure rearrangement can enlarge the energy gap between antibonding orbital and the Fermi energy level. As a concept proof, the as&#8208;prepared Na3VFe(PO4)3 cathode with Fe/Na_v superlattice structure enables an increase in Fe2+/Fe3 redox couples from 2.37 to 2.82&#160;V, accompanied by the energy density increase from 325 to 350&#160;W h kg&#8722;1, compared with the conventional Na3VFe(PO4)3 electrode. This work paves the way for increasing the working voltage and energy density of NASICON type iron&#8208;based phosphate cathodes for SIBs.

A novel 3D conical cone array evaporators is prepared based on high&#8208;entropy single&#8208;atom composite thermal management materials which only contain 3 wt.%. This design achieves a water evaporation rate of 2.86 kg&#160;m&#8722;2 along with an evaporation efficiency of 94.5% under 1.0 sunlight irradiation. The absorbed energy of cone array evaporators improved 18% and the evaporation rate is increased by 58.7% compared to the flat structure evaporator, offering significant insights for the progression of solar interface evaporation technology.








Abstract
Achieving efficient photothermal evaporation requires a synergistic integration of thermal management, water transport dynamics, and light trapping&#8212;key elements often challenging to harmonize. Herein, A high&#8208;entropy single&#8208;atomic metal doped porous carbon (HESA) with ultra&#8208;low metal content of 1.77 wt.% is designed as a new type of photothermal material through a green and convenient routine, which displays tunable hierarchical nano/micro/macro&#8208;porous structure. By integrating molecular dynamics simulations with a 3D light capture structure, a HESA cone evaporator is prepared, utilizing only 3 wt.% of photothermal content. Under 1.0 sun illumination, the cone evaporator demonstrates an outstanding water evaporation rate of 2.86&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and photothermal evaporation efficiency of 94.5%. Compared to conventional flat evaporators, the cone increases absorbed energy by 18% and enhances the evaporation rate by 58.7%. Molecular dynamics analyses reveal that the evaporator significantly improves water transfer kinetics, achieving an intermediate water content nearly twice that of pure water. Complementary COMSOL simulations further validate that the conical array structure enhances light absorption and optimizes water evaporation and diffusion. This meticulously designed evaporator leverages adaptive thermal and light management strategies, offering an effective solution to longstanding challenges in solar interfacial evaporation.

         <title>A p&#8208;Type Liquid&#8208;Crystal Semiconductor with Synergistic Morphological and Charge&#8208;Dynamic Modulation Enables 20.3%&#8208;Efficiency Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>

A classical p&#8208;type liquid crystalline organic semiconductor, 2&#8208;decyl&#8208;7&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzothienobenzothiophene (Ph&#8208;BTBT&#8208;10), is incorporated into the organic photovoltaic active layer as a dual&#8208;functional additive. Its incorporation optimizes the blend morphology with favorable phase separation, extends exciton diffusion length, and significantly improves charge transport dynamics. The binary device based on D18:L8&#8208;BO processes using Ph&#8208;BTBT&#8208;10 yields an impressive power conversion efficiency of 20.3%.








Abstract
Solid additives serve as an effective strategy for modulating the morphology of organic solar cell (OSC) active layers, which critically linked to devices performance. However, current solid additives primarily focus on morphological control, while their inherently weak electrical characteristics may limit improvements in carrier mobility and other electrical properties. This study innovatively introduces a p&#8208;type rod&#8208;like liquid crystalline (LC) organic&#8208;semiconductor, 2&#8208;decyl&#8208;7&#8208;phenylbenzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]thiophene (Ph&#8208;BTBT&#8208;10), as a multifunctional additive in D18:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based binary OSCs. Benefiting from its strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and high intrinsic mobility, Ph&#8208;BTBT&#8208;10 enables precise morphological control while simultaneously improving electrical properties. This dual effect synergistically extends exciton diffusion length, enhances charge separation, suppresses recombination, and significantly boosts hole mobility in blend films. Consequently, the optimized binary devices attained a competitive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.3%, alongside a short&#8208;circuit current density of 27.28&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and fill factor of 80.5%. To the best of knowledge, this performance ranks among the highest reported for binary systems exceeding the 20% PCE threshold. This work demonstrates that p&#8208;type LC semiconductors function as multifunctional additives capable of concurrently regulating morphology and boosting intrinsic electrical properties by establishing expanded charge&#8208;transport networks, presenting a promising new paradigm for advancing OSC performance.

         <title>Redefining PbS Quantum Dot Photovoltaics: p&#8208;i&#8208;n Devices with Superior Efficiency and Reproducibility</title>

Report a NiOx/SAM/PbS&#8208;SAM composite hole transporting layer (HTL) is reported for p&#8208;i&#8208;n PbS QD solar cells, achieving a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) approaching 14% (certified 13.62%), surpassing the previous 9.70% p&#8208;i&#8208;n record and exceeding the certified PCE of n&#8208;i&#8208;p architecture in both efficiency and reproducibility.








Abstract
Developing diverse photovoltaic device architectures is essential not only for improving power conversion efficiency (PCE) but also for enabling seamless integration with other photovoltaic materials in high&#8208;performance tandem configurations. While n&#8208;i&#8208;p architectures have historically dominated the development of PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) solar cells, p&#8208;i&#8208;n counterparts have significantly lagged behind in efficiency, limiting their potential for further advancement. In this work, the advantage of the surface tunability of CQDs is taken by anchoring the classical self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) molecule MeO&#8208;2PACz onto PbS CQDs via ligand exchange, forming a PbS&#8208;SAM bridging&#8208;layer, which is inserted between NiOx/SAM and the CQD active layer, resulting in a NiOx/SAM/PbS&#8208;SAM composite hole transporting layer (HTL). This structure effectively passivates the buried interfacial traps and enhances hole extraction. As a result, a record PCE approaching 14% is achieved, with a certified value of 13.62%, which is not only largely surpassing the previous highest value of 9.70% for p&#8208;i&#8208;n PbS QD solar cells, but also exceeds the current PCE record set by n&#8208;i&#8208;p architectures. Moreover, the p&#8208;i&#8208;n configuration exhibits excellent reproducibility, providing a robust and scalable platform for future applications, particularly as a narrow&#8208;bandgap subcell in monolithic tandem devices with wide&#8208;bandgap materials such as perovskites.

An amorphous iron&#8208;based oxyhalide CAM breaks the conductivity&#8208;capacity trade&#8208;off associated with the MCl6 anionic framework, achieving both high ionic conductivity and high discharge capacity.








Abstract
Halide cathode active materials (CAMs) with high ionic conductivities have attracted significant attention. However, their capacity and energy density are limited by the large molar weight of the Li&#8314; transport&#8208;dependent MCl6 anionic framework. In this study, a low&#8208;cost amorphous iron&#8208;based oxyhalide LFFOC&#8208;0.5 CAM is introduced that overcomes the conductivity&#8208;capacity trade&#8208;off between high ionic conductivity and low discharge capacity associated with the MCl6 framework. LFFOC&#8208;0.5 CAM achieves dual breakthroughs, exhibiting an impressive ionic conductivity of 0.26 mS cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C, and a high specific capacity of 586 mAh g&#8722;1 via an intercalation&#8208;conversion reaction at 60&#160;&#176;C. Due to its superior ionic conductivity and capacity, LFFOC&#8208;0.5 CAM enables a catholyte&#8208;free electrode to achieve an exceptional energy density of &#8776;1100&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1cathode and a power density of 2185&#160;W kg&#8722;1cathode at 60&#160;&#176;C, surpassing reported halide&#8208; and oxide&#8208;based CAMs by 1.5 to 3 times. Additionally, LFFOC&#8208;0.5 CAM is highly cost&#8208;effective ($9.3 kg&#8722;1) and exhibits remarkable humidity stability, retaining 100% of its capacity after 12 h of exposure to 5 &#177; 1% humidity. The multifunctional iron&#8208;based oxyhalide CAMs open new avenues for advancing high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Frequency Switching Neuristor for Realizing Intrinsic Plasticity and Enabling Robust Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A frequency switching (FS) neuristor is proposed, comprising a Mott memristor and a valence change mechanism (VCM) memristor. The FS neuristor exhibits a multi&#8208;level frequency&#8211;voltage (f&#8211;V) characteristics, enabling the implementation of neuronal intrinsic plasticity transfer functions. By leveraging the FS neuristor's intrinsic plasticity, a more reliable and robust sparse neural network can achieve, well&#8208;suited for edge neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
The human brain's efficiency and adaptability in processing information is largely attributed to spatiotemporal spiking activities and intrinsic plasticity&#8212;the ability of neurons to autonomously modulate their excitability. Mott memristors, with their threshold switching characteristics, have been effectively utilized as artificial neurons, or neuristors, to generate spiking activities. However, the implementation of intrinsic plasticity and its significance in neuromorphic computing has yet to be systematically explored. Here, a frequency switching (FS) neuristor is presented that emulates neuron's intrinsic plasticity characteristics. By combining a volatile Mott memristor with a non&#8208;volatile valence change memory (VCM) memristor, the FS neuristor achieves programmable multi&#8208;level frequency&#8211;voltage (f&#8211;V) characteristics analogous to the transfer functions of neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Through device&#8208;based simulations of sparse neural networks, it is proposed that this intrinsic plasticity acts as memory and processor itself, enhancing network performance and reducing energy consumption. Additionally, intrinsic plasticity endows the network with structural plasticity, enabling full recovery of the network's performance after random neuron damage, suggesting a pathway toward more adaptive and resilient neuromorphic computing systems.

         <title>Biomimetic 3D&#8208;Printed Adaptive Hydrogel Bioadhesives Featuring Superior Infection Resistance for Challenging Tissue Adhesion, Hemostasis, and Healthcare</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic 3D&#8208;printed hydrogel bioadhesives (PTLAs) are designed to address the limitations of existing bioadhesives, offering solutions for challenging tissue adhesion and enhanced healthcare. These PTLAs feature robust wet/underwater tissue adhesion/sealing, superior freeze/pressure and infection resistance, and adaptive self&#8208;healing/gelling capacity, presenting transformative potential as bio&#8208;tapes, bio&#8208;bandages, bio&#8208;sealants, bio&#8208;carriers, etc., and inspiring next&#8208;generation bioadhesives design.








Abstract
Conventional suturing and stapling cause additional trauma, pain, and cost for patients. As alternatives, existing bioadhesives suffer from imprecise fabrication, limited wet tissue adhesion, and insufficient biological functionalities for effective wound management. This work proposes biomimetic hydrogel bioadhesives composed of modified natural tannic acid (TA), hyperbranched polylysine (HPL), and acrylic acid (AA), abbreviated PTLAs, to offer solutions for tissue adhesion under challenging environments (underwater, body fluids, cold, pressure), and for enhanced healthcare. These PTLAs are fabricated via 3D printing, enabling the precise and controlled production of bioadhesives that are customized in a personalized manner with great reproducibility. Inspired by molluscs, developed PTLAs exhibit robust wet and underwater tissue adhesion, outperforming commercial and many recently reported bioadhesives. Ex vivo lamb and in vivo rat models demonstrate ultrafast (5&#160;s) and efficient sealing and hemostasis. Exceptional freeze resistance and pressure resistance further expand their applicability to extreme environments. Meanwhile, coupled with superior infection resistance, PTLAs ensure enhanced wound healthcare while sealing and hemostasis. Further, their self&#8208;gelling feature supports dry powder adhesion/sealing applications, practical packaging, and long&#8208;term storage. Overall, adaptive tissue&#8208;like PTLAs present transformative potential as bio&#8208;tapes, bio&#8208;bandages, bio&#8208;sealants, bio&#8208;carriers, etc., paving the way for next&#8208;generation bioadhesives design and enhanced healthcare solutions.

         <title>Steep&#8208;Slope CuInP2S6 Ferroionic Threshold Switching Field&#8208;Effect Transistor for Implementation of Artificial Spiking Neuron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of an energy&#8208;efficient and biologically inspired spiking neuron device based on a CuInP2S6 (CIPS) ferroionic threshold switching field&#8208;effect transistor TS&#8208;FET is reported. The device demonstrates essential neuronal behaviors, such as leaky integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire dynamics, a tunable firing threshold, and spatiotemporal processing, all without requiring auxiliary reset circuitry. Furthermore, a spiking neural network (SNN) is implemented by integrating CIPS&#8208;based synaptic and neuron devices.








Abstract
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered considerable attention as energy&#8208;efficient and biologically inspired computing paradigms. However, despite the growing interest, the development of hardware&#8208;based SNNs has remained limited, primarily because of insufficient research on hardware&#8208;based spiking neuron devices. In this study, a CuInP2S6 (CIPS)&#8208;based threshold switching field&#8208;effect transistor (TS&#8208;FET) is presented, featuring steep switching characteristics, and demonstrate its potential as an energy&#8208;efficient spiking neuron device. The proposed device exhibits outstanding characteristics: ultra&#8208;steep subthreshold swing (SS &#8776;7.5 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1), high on/off current ratio (&gt;107), and ultra&#8208;low off current (&#8776;0.3 pA) due to the ferroionic properties of CIPS. The tunable dynamics for Cu+ ion migration induce a phase transition, leading to sharp resistance switching and efficient spiking. This device successfully mimics key neuronal dynamics, including leaky integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire, threshold tuning, and spatiotemporal dynamics, without requiring auxiliary reset circuits. Furthermore, SNN is constructed by integrating CIPS&#8208;based synaptic and neuron devices and evaluate face classification performance using an unsupervised learning approach, achieving a recognition accuracy of 95.83% via the lateral inhibition function of the neuron device. The findings highlight the potential of CIPS TS&#8208;FET as energy&#8208;efficient spiking neuron device applications for next&#8208;generation SNN&#8208;based neuromorphic computing systems.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop and Sustainable 4D Printing of Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Sulfur&#8208;Rich Polymer Composites for Autonomous Task Execution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Closed&#8208;loop and sustainable 4D printing of sulfur&#8208;rich polymer composites is demonstrated for the first time using loosely crosslinked poly(phenylene polysulfide) networks (PSNs) and their magnetic composites (MPSNs). 3D&#8208;printed PSNs and MPSNs exhibit shape&#8208;morphing capabilities and can be directly reprinted into new form factors and magneto&#8208;responsive soft robots. 3D&#8208;printed MPSNs can serve as an on&#8208;demand catalyst&#8208;releasable stirring bar for chemical synthesis.








Abstract
Shape&#8208;programmable polymer networks derived from waste elemental sulfur hold great potential for diverse applications such as 4D printing and soft robotics. However, their crosslinked nature makes it challenging to 3D print complex geometry for soft robots. Herein, a closed&#8208;loop 4D printing strategy is reported of poly(phenylene polysulfide) networks (PSNs) and their magnetic particle composites (MPSNs) to fabricate multi&#8208;functional soft robots with programmable shape&#8208;morphing capabilities. The dynamic S&#9472;S bonds within the loosely crosslinked PSNs impart shear&#8208;thinning behavior, enabling hot&#8208;melt extrusion of both PSNs and MPSNs into complex architectures. After shape&#8208;programming, 3D&#8208;printed PSN and MPSN structures exhibit heat&#8208; or light&#8208;triggered shape recovery and allow modular assembly for spatially selective shape&#8208;morphing governed by the distinct glass transition temperatures of the PSN series. These architectures can be readily reprinted into new form factors, demonstrating a closed&#8208;loop and sustainable 4D printing. With multi&#8208;stimuli responsiveness and solvent resistance provided by the PSN composites, the MPSN capsule serves as an on&#8208;demand catalyst&#8208;releasing magnetic stirring bar in a reagent&#8208;containing solution, autonomously releasing catalysts at a preset temperature to facilitate carbamate synthesis. The 4D printable MPSNs offer a sustainable platform not only for adaptable shape&#8208;morphing and dynamic actuation but also for autonomous task execution in next&#8208;generation soft robotic applications.

         <title>Regular Tandem Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with over 51% External Quantum Efficiency for Next&#8208;Generation Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a regular tandem quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diode achieving over 51% external quantum efficiency through systematic optimization of both charge injection balance and light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Thanks to the fast response of this device, the obtained 8 &#215; 8 passive&#8208;matrix displays can present flicker&#8208;free images with either fixed color or dynamically transitioning colors at a stable brightness.








Abstract
Despite excellent efficiency and stability achieved in regular single&#8208;unit quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), regular tandem QLEDs still suffer from limited device performance, lagging far behind the inverted tandem QLEDs. Here, novel regular tandem QLEDs are demonstrated with an ultrathin (&#8776;4 nm) indium tin oxide (ITO) charge generation layer (CGL). Through systematic optimization of charge injection balance and light out&#8208;coupling efficiency, the resulting tandem QLEDs can exhibit a record&#8208;breaking EQE of 51.2%, an exceptional T95 lifetime of &#8776;31383 h (at 1000 cd&#160;m&#8722;2), and an ultralow turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.8 V, which represent the highest performance metrics reported to date for regular tandem QLEDs. Thanks to the fast response of this tandem device (&#8776;4.8 &#181;s), the first&#8208;ever fabricated 8 &#215; 8 passive&#8208;matrix displays can present flicker&#8208;free images with either fixed color or dynamically transitioning colors at a stable brightness, demonstrating that the achievable color display capability and driving scheme of QLED displays can be expanded by using the tandem architecture. It is believed the results will significantly promote the development of regular tandem QLEDs, which will lead to unprecedented improvements in device efficiency and stability, accelerating their application in next&#8208;generation displays and lighting.

         <title>Reducing Structural Distortion by Tailoring Orbital Interactions in High&#8208;Voltage Polyanionic Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main structural distortion of the KVPO4F cathode is attributed to the V5+ octahedral distortion. Low energy&#8208;level Mn is introduced into V site to enhance the matching of the central transition metal ion's 3d orbitals with the ligands&#8217; 2p orbitals in &#963; and &#960; symmetry. The strong orbital interactions suppress octahedron distortion and structure degradation to endure steady&#160;ion extraction.








Abstract
The structural distortion of electrode materials in battery systems usually results in the structure degradation and capacity fading upon cycling. However, the fundamental mechanism about the structural distortion remains elusive. A critical issue has emerged concerning the utilization of high&#8208;voltage potassium vanadium fluorophosphate compound (KVPO4F) as a competitive cathode material for potassium&#8208;ion battery applications. In this work, it is initially identified that the primary distortion in KVPO4F cathode is octahedra distortion. The weak orbital interactions among central transition metal ions with ligands in an octahedron play a pivotal role in the structural distortion, resulting in an accumulation of microstrain during the cycles. This cognition serves as the foundation for the introduction of low energy&#8208;level Mn into the V sites to suppress the structure distortion and lattice microstrain. The multi&#8208;electron 3d orbitals of Mn sites tend to interact with the &#963; and &#960; symmetry&#8208;matched 2p orbitals of ligands, thereby facilitating the formation of stable octahedrons to endure ion extraction steadily in high voltage. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of structure degradation based on the octahedral distortion, thereby facilitating the enhancement of stability in high&#8208;voltage cathodes.

         <title>Programmable Active Phase Reconstruction in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Toward High&#8208;Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study harnesses multimetallic synergy to program dynamic evolution of 2D nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks to architect high&#8208;activity oxyhydroxides phase for oxygen evolution. The cascade control of reconstruction dynamics, terminated structure state, and catalytic pathways deciphers &#8220;reconstruction&#8208;catalysis&#8221; programming principles. This paradigm shift enables on&#8208;demand design of efficient electrocatalysts through proactive reconstruction steering.








Abstract
Orchestrated manipulation of the dynamic structural evolution of catalytic materials in service represents an effective approach to rationally architect the active phase for highly efficient catalysis. Herein, this study reports a 2D ultrathin nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) pre&#8208;catalyst, where multimetallic electronic cooperativity enables on&#8208;demand hierarchical regulation of the structural evolution as well as the catalytic process of the reconstruction&#8208;derived active phase, delivering oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance superior to benchmark RuO2. Tailored cobalt&#8208;iron co&#8208;substitution in nickel&#8208;based MOF strategically engineers the overall structural flexibility, controllably promoting the reconstruction process in alkaline media into ligand&#8208;anchored nickel oxyhydroxide active phases. Crucially, the controlled modulation of the structural state of reconstructed phases induces targeted metal&#8208;oxygen electronic interplay, steering active oxygen intermediate reconfiguration and reducing the thermodynamic bottleneck of the rate&#8208;determining step, ultimately achieving optimized catalytic pathways. This work precisely constructs MOF&#8208;derived reconstructed active phases and elucidates a programmed optimization mechanism governed by multimetallic electronic interplay, which dynamically bridges structural transformation and catalytic activity enhancement. A promising approach is showcased to accurately design high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts through programming dynamic structural evolution.

         <title>Diamond&#8208;Inspired DNA Hydrogel Based on Tetrahedral Framework Nucleic Acids for Burn Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by diamond, this study introduces a DNA hydrogel formulated with tetrahedral DNA nanostructure, which exhibits enhanced mechanical strength. It exhibits multiple functionalities, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, hemostatic performance, etc. Single&#8208;cell sequencing indicates this hydrogel disrupts the ROS&#8208;inflammatory cascade, promotes extracellular matrix formation and re&#8208;epithelialization, ultimately facilitating burn wound healing.








Abstract
Burn wounds frequently pose high risks of a prolonged healing process and even death due to the persistent reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated inflammatory cascade. There is an urgent requirement for advanced dressings modulating the immune microenvironment surrounding the wound. DNA hydrogels have been preliminarily investigated in tissue regeneration due to their excellent permeability, editability, and biocompatibility. However, their broader applications have been limited by poor mechanical properties, and their roles in tissue regeneration remain insufficiently explored. Inspired by diamond, this study introduces a DNA hydrogel formulated with tetrahedral framework DNA, which exhibits enhanced mechanical strength due to its stable structure. Additionally, it exhibits multiple functionalities, including ROS scavenging, hemostatic performance, adhesion, injectability, shear&#8208;thinning behavior, and self&#8208;healing capability. Single&#8208;cell sequencing analysis indicates that this hydrogel disrupts the ROS&#8208;inflammatory cascade and promotes the transformation of pro&#8208;inflammatory macrophages into an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. This effect promotes extracellular matrix formation and re&#8208;epithelialization with changes in the communication between macrophages, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes, ultimately facilitating burn wound healing on the skin of mice. In summary, this study not only presents a novel approach to bolstering the mechanical strength of pure DNA hydrogels but also marks a systematic evaluation of DNA hydrogels in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Ultrahigh Energy Density in Dielectric Polymers Near Glass Transition Temperature by Molecular Twisting Conformation Locking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel molecular twisting conformation locking strategy is proposed and demonstrated to simultaneously suppress intrachain and interchain electron migration pathways in high glass transition temperature (Tg) dielectric polymers, addressing their compromised electrical insulation at elevated operating temperatures near their Tg. A novel dielectric polymer featuring molecular twisting conformation locking maintains stable operation at 250&#160;&#176;C while achieving ultrahigh discharge energy density of 4.3 J cm&#8722;3.








Abstract
Dielectric polymers with high operating temperatures (To) for capacitive energy storage applications are urgently needed in new energy vehicles and power electronics. Polymers with high glass transition temperatures (Tg), such as Kapton polyimide (Tg&#8776;360&#160;&#176;C), suffer low To (&lt; 150&#160;&#176;C) due to electron delocalization between donor and acceptor units. Here, a molecular twisting conformation&#8208;locking strategy is proposed for high&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers to block intrachain and interchain electron migration pathways. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the elevated leakage current in polyimides originates from enhanced electron delocalization induced by intrachain imide ring planarization and interchain donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking. The molecular twisting conformation&#8208;locking disrupts intrachain imide ring planarization and the face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking of interchain D&#8208;A units. As a result, the designed polymer exhibits an ultrahigh resistivity of 6.8 &#215; 1013 &#937; m&#8722;1 at 250&#160;&#176;C (close to its Tg), surpassing the 2.8 &#215; 1013 &#937; m&#8722;1 of PEI at 50&#160;&#176;C. Simultaneously, it achieves an ultrahigh discharge energy density of 4.3 J cm&#8722;3, outperforming existing high&#8208;Tg dielectric polymers.

     alt="Ultrahigh Energy Density in Dielectric Polymers Near Glass Transition Temperature by Molecular Twisting Conformation Locking"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel molecular twisting conformation locking strategy is proposed and demonstrated to simultaneously suppress intrachain and interchain electron migration pathways in high glass transition temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) dielectric polymers, addressing their compromised electrical insulation at elevated operating temperatures near their &lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;. A novel dielectric polymer featuring molecular twisting conformation locking maintains stable operation at 250&#160;&#176;C while achieving ultrahigh discharge energy density of 4.3 J cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dielectric polymers with high operating temperatures (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) for capacitive energy storage applications are urgently needed in new energy vehicles and power electronics. Polymers with high glass transition temperatures (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;), such as Kapton polyimide (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&#8776;360&#160;&#176;C), suffer low &lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; (&amp;lt; 150&#160;&#176;C) due to electron delocalization between donor and acceptor units. Here, a molecular twisting conformation-locking strategy is proposed for high-temperature dielectric polymers to block intrachain and interchain electron migration pathways. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the elevated leakage current in polyimides originates from enhanced electron delocalization induced by intrachain imide ring planarization and interchain donor-acceptor (D-A) face-to-face stacking. The molecular twisting conformation-locking disrupts intrachain imide ring planarization and the face-to-face stacking of interchain D-A units. As a result, the designed polymer exhibits an ultrahigh resistivity of 6.8 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; &#937; m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 250&#160;&#176;C (close to its &lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;), surpassing the 2.8 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; &#937; m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of PEI at 50&#160;&#176;C. Simultaneously, it achieves an ultrahigh discharge energy density of 4.3 J cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, outperforming existing high-&lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; dielectric polymers. This study introduces a design paradigm to address the challenge of dielectric polymers that do not function properly as ambient temperatures approach their &lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Multispectrum Electromagnetic Response in FeNiHo/C Heterodimensional Structure for Microwave Absorption and Multimode Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports a novel FeNiHo/C hierarchical heterodimensional structured with multispectrum&#8208;coupling electromagnetic response. Through multi&#8208;scale polar heterointerface engineering, the heterodimensional structure achieves ultra&#8208;broadband microwave absorption, in situ microwave frequency&#8208;agile property, and multimode photodetections. These results inspire the development of electromagnetic multifunctional materials.








Abstract
Multispectrum response technology is the key to developing multifunctional electromagnetic devices in cross&#8208;field applications. Traditional methods rely on integrating complex multi&#8208;material systems, leading to bulkier and costlier devices. Here, a hierarchical heterodimensional structure composed of FeNiHo alloy and carbon matrix achieves autonomous multispectrum&#8208;coupling electromagnetic response between microwave and ultraviolet through polar interface engineering. In the microwave band, the heterodimensional structure exhibits outstanding microwave absorption performance with high reflection loss of &#8722;46.87 dB and ultra&#8208;wide absorption bandwidth of 8.96 GHz. Furthermore, the antenna arrays based on the heterodimensional structure demonstrate in situ microwave frequency&#8208;agile property by a coupled ultraviolet stimulation, where the largest frequency modulation range reaches 5.05 GHz in Ku&#8208;band. In the ultraviolet band, multimode photodetectors constructed by the heterodimensional structure possess excellent responsivity and accurate decoding ability for anti&#8208;interference ultraviolet communication. Particularly, the metamaterial detector achieves analog signal communication for the first time by microwave&#8208;ultraviolet coupling response. This work pioneers a novel approach to developing multifunctional electromagnetic materials for multispectrum applications.

         <title>Sustainable Clay Electrolytes for Aqueous Batteries: All&#8208;Temperature Single&#8208;Ion Conductor with Nanoconfined Hydration Shell Reorganization Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A specifically designed clay&#8208;based single&#8208;ion conductor with unique hydration&#8208;shell reconfiguration mechanism is utilized as the all&#8208;temperature electrolyte to endow the working temperature range of the aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries from &#8722;60 to 60&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Ion transport property and water structure of electrolytes are two of the most important issues for aqueous batteries, especially when operated at extreme temperatures. To this end, a sepiolite&#8208;based clay electrolyte (SCYE) with nanoconfined channels as single&#8208;ion conductor is proposed. The inner Zn2+ and anions solvation shells exhibit fascinating hydration&#8208;shell reconfiguration behavior compared to the conventional Zn(ClO4)2 aqueous electrolytes. The bond&#8208;orientational order of the Zn2+ and anions is broken and highly developed, respectively, thus improving the Zn2+ transference number to 0.97. Moreover, free water molecules are dramatically reduced in the SCYE, contributing to improved anti&#8208;freezing ability and thermal stability. The single&#8208;ion transport property of the SCYE endows the PANI||Zn full cells with excellent rate performances, with an &#8776;84% capacity retention from 1 to 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Besides, full cells with the SCYE achieve 17,000 cycles under &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C with a specific capacity of 130 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 and considerable performances even at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C, while they can operate over 3000 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C with 87% capacity retention. This attracting effect can be expanded to several other clay materials, all presenting improved ion transport capability, which paves a road for future aqueous batteries across extreme temperatures.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Atmospheric Water Production Through Hierarchically Ordered Porous Carbon for Self&#8208;Sustaining Green Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green hydrogen production through a coupled self&#8208;sustaining solar&#8208;enabled system that couples atmospheric water harvesting with PEM water electrolysis (AWH&#8208;PEMWE), offering a novel pathway for clean water generation and green hydrogen production. The system operates without the need for carrier gases or external energy input accessories, enabling a fully solar&#8208;driven process with zero carbon emission throughout the hydrogen production cycle.








Abstract
Green hydrogen production by proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) powered by clean energy is a promising and environmentally friendly technology. However, it relies on a high&#8208;purity water source, which is limited in regions facing water scarcity. Here, a coupled self&#8208;sustaining solar&#8208;enabled system is reported that couples atmospheric water harvesting with PEM water electrolysis (AWH&#8208;PEMWE), offering a novel pathway for clean water generation and green hydrogen production. The atmospheric water harvester (AWH) component utilizes N and O co&#8208;doped hydrophilic ordered porous carbon, engineered with an interconnected hierarchical porous structure with prosperous channels for efficient mass transport. It enables effective interfacial solar evaporation for water release, achieving a record&#8208;high water harvesting capacity of 0.49 L kg&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 40% relative humidity (RH). During outdoor tests, the AWH&#8208;PEMWE system reaches a peak green hydrogen production rate of 204 mL h&#8722;1 at midday using only atmospheric water as feedstock. Remarkably, the system remains operational under ultra&#8208;low humidity conditions down to 20% RH, addressing the challenge of water availability in arid environments. Importantly, the system operates without the need for carrier gases or external energy input accessories, enabling a fully solar&#8208;driven process with zero carbon emission throughout the hydrogen production cycle.

         <title>Decoupling of Carrier Pathways in Au/Cu&#8208;Zn3In2S6 Through Bulk Hole Trapping and Surface Hot Electron Accumulation Enhances Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design and implement Au&#8208;Cu co&#8208;modified Zn3In2S6 catalyst with spatially decoupling charge carriers across bulk and surface sites, which effectively suppresses carrier recombination, drives surface hot electron accumulation and stabilizes intermediates for photocatalytic oxygen reduction. The optimized catalyst achieves an H2O2 evolution rate of 94.2 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 min&#8722;1 using pure water without any sacrificial agents, far exceeding most reported photocatalysts. 








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis offers a sustainable route to H2O2 production but is hindered by charge recombination and non&#8208;selective reactive species generation, resulting in parasitic reactions that reduce selectivity and yield. Here, Au&#8208;Cu co&#8208;modified Zn3In2S6 (Au/Cu&#8208;d/ZIS) is presented, a catalyst that spatially decouples charge carriers across bulk and surface sites, suppressing recombination and stabilizing intermediates for photocatalytic oxygen reduction. Cu doping introduces trap states that localize holes in the bulk and improve the separation and transportation of bulk photogenerated carriers. Plasmonic Au nanoparticles drive surface hot electron accumulation and further contribute to the oxygen reduction reaction. The optimized catalyst achieves an H2O2 evolution rate of 94.2 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 min&#8722;1 using pure water without any sacrificial agents, outperforming pristine Zn3In2S6 by nearly threefold. DRIFTS identifies stabilized oxygenated species on the catalyst surface, and DFT calculations demonstrate that Cu trap states lower energy barriers for &#8226;O2&#8722; formation, while Au NPs enhance the charge transfer and ORR reaction between ZIS and O2. The catalyst maintains stability and reusability, producing 2300 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 of H2O2 under natural sunlight over 4 h with consistent performance across multiple cycles.

&lt;p&gt;We design and implement Au-Cu co-modified Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst with spatially decoupling charge carriers across bulk and surface sites, which effectively suppresses carrier recombination, drives surface hot electron accumulation and stabilizes intermediates for photocatalytic oxygen reduction. The optimized catalyst achieves an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate of 94.2 &#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; using pure water without any sacrificial agents, far exceeding most reported photocatalysts. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial photosynthesis offers a sustainable route to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production but is hindered by charge recombination and non-selective reactive species generation, resulting in parasitic reactions that reduce selectivity and yield. Here, Au-Cu co-modified Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (Au/Cu-d/ZIS) is presented, a catalyst that spatially decouples charge carriers across bulk and surface sites, suppressing recombination and stabilizing intermediates for photocatalytic oxygen reduction. Cu doping introduces trap states that localize holes in the bulk and improve the separation and transportation of bulk photogenerated carriers. Plasmonic Au nanoparticles drive surface hot electron accumulation and further contribute to the oxygen reduction reaction. The optimized catalyst achieves an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate of 94.2 &#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; using pure water without any sacrificial agents, outperforming pristine Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; by nearly threefold. DRIFTS identifies stabilized oxygenated species on the catalyst surface, and DFT calculations demonstrate that Cu trap states lower energy barriers for &#8226;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; formation, while Au NPs enhance the charge transfer and ORR reaction between ZIS and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The catalyst maintains stability and reusability, producing 2300 &#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under natural sunlight over 4 h with consistent performance across multiple cycles. Furthermore, it is successfully applied for bacterial sterilization and pharmaceutical pollutant degradation, demonstrating its potential for environmental remediation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Competitive Crystallization Modulated Phase&#8208;Homogeneous Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites for Monolithic Perovskite&#8208;Organic Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triphenyl phosphate is utilized to modulate Br/I competitive crystallization for improving compositional distribution, efficiency, and stability in wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) PSCs. The homogeneous WBG perovskite boosts the efficiencies up to record values of 21.39% (1.72&#160;eV) and 19.64% (1.84&#160;eV), and maintains 95% of its initial efficiency for 1100&#160;h. The resulting PO&#8208;TSCs achieve champion efficiencies of 26.11% (certified 25.07%).








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites with tunable bandgaps can be integrated into organic solar cells to construct tandem solar cells (TSCs), enabling the device to exceed the Shockley&#8208;Queisser efficiency limit. However, ionic mismatches and crystallization kinetics in WBG perovskites trigger inhomogeneous phase distribution and defects. In this work, a triphenyl phosphate (Tri&#8208;PyPA) is utilized to modulate Br/I competitive crystallization and compositional distribution. The preferential coordination of Tri&#8208;PyPA with PbBr2 reduces the effective charge on Pb2+ and changes the electrostatic interaction between Pb2+ and Br&#8722;/I&#8722; ions. It suppresses the rapid migration of highly diffusive (Br&#8208;rich) components during crystallization. Meanwhile, Tri&#8208;PyPA forms a six&#8208;membered hydrogen&#8208;bonded ring structure with formamidinium cations by H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;O&#9552;P interaction to immobilize cations. The &#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation allows Tri&#8208;PyPA to form a compact molecular coverage on the (100) facet, significantly reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination and elevating the ion migration energy barriers. The homogeneous WBG perovskites boost the efficiency up to record values of 21.39% and 19.64% for 1.72&#160;eV and 1.84&#160;eV devices, respectively. The unencapsulated device can maintain 95% of its initial efficiency after illumination for 1100&#160;h. The champion perovskite&#8208;organic TSC shows an efficiency of 26.11% (certified 25.07%) and retains 80% of its initial efficiency after continuous operation for 1000&#160;h.

         <title>Asymmetric Stress Engineering of Dense Dislocations in Brittle Superconductors for Strong Vortex Pinning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stress&#8208;engineering strategy enables the direct formation of ultra&#8208;dense dislocations in rigid crystals through extrusion&#8208;induced asymmetric stress fields. These tilted dislocation arrays act as efficient pinning centers for magnetic vortices, leading to a fivefold enhancement in the current&#8208;carrying capacity of iron&#8208;based superconductors under high magnetic fields. The method provides a general, scalable pathway for dislocation design in brittle materials.









Abstract

Large lossless currents in high&#8208;temperature superconductors (HTS) critically rely on dense defects with suitable size and dimensionality to pin vortices, with dislocations being particularly effective due to their 1D geometry to interact extensively with vortex lines. However, in non&#8208;metallic compounds such as HTS with rigid lattices, conventional deformation methods typically lead to catastrophic fracture rather than dislocation&#8208;mediated plasticity, making it a persistent challenge to introduce dislocations at high density. Here, an asymmetric stress field strategy is proposed using extrusion to directly nucleate a high density of dislocations in HTS by activating shear&#8208;driven lattice slip and twisting under superimposed hydrostatic compression. As demonstrated in iron&#8208;based superconductors (IBS), atomic displacements of &#8776;1 &#197; trigger the formation of tilted dislocation lines with a density approaching that of metals. With further structural refinement, these dislocations serve as strong pinning centers that lead to a fivefold enhancement in the current&#8208;carrying capacity of IBS at 33 tesla (T), along with low anisotropy and a large irreversibility field. This work not only establishes a scalable route to engineer pinning landscapes in HTS but also offers a generalizable framework for manipulating dislocation structures in rigid crystalline systems.

         <title>Robust Sustainable Interfacial Evaporators from Lignin for Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 44, November 6, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developes a series of sustainable metal&#8208;lignin composites via a one&#8208;pot reaction between lignin and heavy metal ion&#8208;containing wastewater. The resulting metal&#8208;lignin composites demonstrates significantly enhanced light absorption and photothermal conversion performances compared to unmodified lignin, which are originated from the synergistic effects of oxidation, coordination, and the formation of metal oxides. The metal&#8208;lignin composites are architecturally structured into evaporators, with the optimized evaporator demonstrating an elevated evaporation rate of 2.88&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, also with long&#8208;term stability, efficient wastewater and seawater purification capacities, and notable economic benefits.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation technology has emerged as a promising solution for heavy metal&#8208;containing wastewater treatment, owing to its environmentally friendly and sustainable energy input advantages. However, the development of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;efficiency photothermal agents with enhanced heavy&#8208;metal ion tolerance remains a significant challenge for advancing practical solar&#8208;powered wastewater treatment. Herein, we developed a series of metal&#8208;lignin composites, through a one&#8208;pot reaction involving lignin and heavy metal&#8208;contained wastewater, which demonstrated outstanding light&#8208;harvesting efficiency and photothermal conversion properties. The resulting metal&#8208;lignin composites can be efficiently fabricated into evaporators via 3D printing technology for wastewater treatment. The optimized evaporator achieves an exceptional water evaporation rate of 2.88&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 under 1&#8208;sun irradiation while demonstrating outstanding performance in both seawater and heavy metal&#8208;containing wastewater systems. Moreover, the evaporator exhibits no significant decline in evaporation rate during continuous wastewater treatment over 7 days, highlighting its exceptional durability and long&#8208;term stability. Finally, techno&#8208;economic analysis estimates the production cost of clean water by the evaporator at 0.372&#160;$&#160;m&#8722;3, below the industry average and even approaching the globally reported lowest threshold for reverse osmosis desalination. This work is believed to offer valuable insights into achieving cost&#8208;effective and highly efficient solar&#8208;driven wastewater purification technologies from lignin.

A morphogenetic approach is established to precisely coordinate the precursor thermodynamics by tuning the carbon nanotube (CNT) content and precursor concentration in the framework of the freeze&#8208;drying method. Consequently, polyimide/CNT aerogels with unprecedented triaxial hierarchical architectures (macroscopic core&#8208;radiating patterns, microscopic omasum&#8208;like folds, and nanoscopic CNT bridges) are obtained.








Abstract
Lightweight polymer&#8208;based electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials exhibiting good mechanical adaptability and thermal stability are pivotal for next&#8208;generation electronics. However, conventional approaches utilized to enhance the EMI shielding efficiency (SE) through porous architectures often compromise the structural integrity of the material or its EMI shielding performance under dynamic deformation. Herein, a morphogenetic approach is proposed to precisely coordinate the precursor thermodynamics by tuning the carbon nanotube (CNT) content and precursor concentration in the framework of the freeze&#8208;drying method. With this method, polyimide/CNT aerogels with unprecedented triaxial hierarchical architectures (macroscopic core&#8208;radiating patterns, microscopic omasum&#8208;like folds, and nanoscopic CNT bridges) are obtained. The synergy between these multiscale structures extends the dissipation pathways of electromagnetic waves by inducing multiple reflections, yielding an EMI SE of 71&#160;dB and an ultrahigh specific efficiency (6470&#160;dB cm2 g&#8722;1). Remarkably, the C67&#8208;5.0 aerogels also exhibit enhanced EMI shielding performance with temperature (5.0% improvement at 350&#160;&#176;C), a negative Poisson's ratio (around &#8722;0.28), and structural stability (&#8776;90% height retention after 500 compression cycles). This unique combination of a high EMI SE, outstanding mechanical properties, and excellent structural compressibility opens new avenues for designing adaptive EMI shielding systems for application to aerospace and electronics industries.

         <title>Optimizing the Electron Density of PVDF&#8208;HFP&#8208;Based Solid Polymer Electrolyte by Donor&#8211;Acceptor COF Toward High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

The Br&#8208;COF with D&#8208;A characteristic is incorporated into PVDF&#8208;HFP, which can optimize electron density to create electron&#8208;rich environments, further promoting Li+ migration and LiF&#8208;rich SEI formation. The D and A units of Br&#8208;COF are confined in particular locations to create independent electron&#8208;hole transference channels, achieving rapid electron transfer dynamics to optimize electron density around TFSI&#8722; to promote its decomposition for the formation of high LiF content SEI. Furthermore, the Br&#8208;groups as electron&#8208;rich sites can promote Li salt dissociation through electrostatic interaction, resulting in rapid Li+ transference.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries equipped with solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are recognized as promising energy storage devices due to their excellent safety and good interfacial contact. However, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and sluggish Li+ transport kinetics inhibit their practical application. Herein, a bromine&#8208;modified covalent organic framework (Br&#8208;COF) with donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) characteristics is designed and incorporated into PVDF&#8208;HFP&#8208;based SPEs to regulate electron density for promoting Li+ migration and high stability LiF&#8208;rich SEI formation to solve these problems. The D and A units of Br&#8208;COF are confined in particular locations to create independent electron&#8208;hole transference channels, achieving rapid electron transfer dynamics, thereby promoting TFSI&#8722; decomposition to obtain high LiF content SEI. Meanwhile, the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing Br&#8208;group can adsorb the electron from tetra(p&#8208;amino&#8208;phenyl)porphyrin (TAPP) to create an electron&#8208;rich environment, resulting in the regulation of the Li+ local coordination environment to facilitate Li+ transference. Consequently, Br&#8208;COF@PVDF&#8208;HFP exhibits high ionic conductivity (9.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1) and Li+ transference number (0.78). Li|Br&#8208;COF@PVDF&#8208;HFP|Li cells achieve excellent cycling life (3000 h) at 0.1 mA cm&#8722;2, and LFP|Br&#8208;COF@PVDF&#8208;HFP|Li and NCM90|Br&#8208;COF@PVDF&#8208;HFP|Li cells can cycle steadily over 2000 cycles and 250 cycles, respectively. This study provides a reference basis for regulating the electron density of PVDF&#8208;HFP&#8208;based SPEs to enhance the performance of solid&#8208;state LMBs.

         <title>Multifunctional Fluidic Units for Emergent, Responsive Robotic Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional reconfigurable fluidic unit can be used as sensor, valve and actuator is presented. A unique configuration combines the features of the three components as a Responsive self&#8208;oscillating actuator. The remarkable versatility of the fluidic unit is demonstrated by building different robots with the same fluidic units only by varying their arrangement and connections.








Abstract
Fluidic circuits have shown significant promise in enabling complex functionality in soft robots with a minimal number of input signals. However, implementing complex behaviors typically involves numerous specialized components, resulting in intricate and nonversatile circuits. To address this challenge, a multifunctional fluidic unit designed to operate flexibly as a valve, sensor, or actuator is introduced. This unit provides an extensive design space that allows precise tuning to achieve the desired functionality. In particular, one configuration integrates all three functions simultaneously, resulting in a self&#8208;sensing oscillating actuator. By assembling multiple units&#8212;each customized for specific roles&#8212;complex robotic behaviors can be realized. The versatility and effectiveness of this modular approach are demonstrated by creating several robotic systems, including a controlled shaker, a multimodal hopper, and a crawler capable of sensing environmental boundaries. Furthermore, when these units are mechanically coupled via a shared body, it exhibit emergent passive behaviors, such as self&#8208;synchronization&#8212;a behavior that is elucidated with a Kuramoto model of networks of oscillators. This study highlights the potential of multifunctionality as a powerful and efficient strategy for realizing embodied intelligence in fluidic robotic systems.

         <title>Lattice Coupling Enables Gradient Strain Tuning Toward Platinum Skin at Intermetallic Nanocatalysts for Boosting Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gradient surface strain tuning is achieved through leveraging the lattice coupling between Pt shell and superlattice ordering Pt&#8208;based intermetallic compound core for developing high&#8208;performance HOR/HER bifunctional nanocatalysts. Based on this nanocatalyst platform, the influences of gradient strain on both the surface H&#8208;adsorption/desorption and interfacial mass transportation are revealed, which synergistically regulate the hydrogen electrocatalysis kinetics.








Abstract
Strain engineering in core&#8211;shell nanocatalysts is crucial for optimizing the activity of surficial sites. However, due to the significant difficulty in precise strain control, achieving optimal strain effect and insightful strain&#8208;activity correlations is challenging. In this context, a novel strategy is proposed of precisely tuning the surface strain by leveraging the lattice coupling between Pt shell and the superlattice ordering Pt&#8208;based intermetallic compound core. Two&#8208;atom&#8208;layer Pt&#8208;skinned PtCo&#8208;IMC nanocrystals are synthesized and subjected to heteroatom substitution in IMC core, yielding Pt@Pt2CoM (M&#9552;Co, Cu, Fe, Cr) nanocatalysts. Gradient strains in ultra&#8208;thin Pt skin are constructed by continuously modulating the lattice parameters of Pt2CoM&#8208;IMC cores. Based on this nanocatalyst platform, the influences of gradient strain on both the surface H&#8208;adsorption/desorption and interfacial mass transportation are revealed, which synergistically regulate the hydrogen electrocatalysis kinetics. Pt@Pt2CoFe with optimal 5.8% compressive surface strain demonstrates impressive bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalytic activities for hydrogen oxidation (1.33 A/mgPt) and evolution (4.58 A/mgPt) reactions that are respectively 22.2 and 6.0 times over the strain&#8208;free Pt. Additionally, Pt@Pt2CoFe exhibits robust CO tolerance and high stability for long&#8208;term hydrogen electrocatalysis. This work provides a promising route of ingenious surface strain design for developing high&#8208;performance nanocatalysts.

         <title>Confined Subnanometer Amorphous RuIrOx Overlayers on Ultrafine Pt Nanowires Achieve Ampere&#8208;Level Durable PEM Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline/amorphous Pt@RuIrOx core&#8211;shell nanowires with subnanometer amorphous Ir&#8208;stabilized RuOx overlayers are elaborately fabricated for acidic oxygen evolution in PEM water electrolysis. The catalyst achieves ultralow overpotential and outstanding stability at ampere&#8208;level current density, and concurrently activates multiple reaction pathways, demonstrating surface amorphous engineering as a powerful strategy for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Amorphous surfaces, which offer greater tunability compared to their crystalline counterparts, are increasingly recognized as highly active yet unstable phases for specific electrocatalysis reactions under harsh conditions. Whereas successfully creating and stabilizing amorphous surfaces on low&#8208;dimensional electrocatalysts remains a significant challenge. This work elaborately synthesizes ultrathin crystalline/amorphous Pt@RuIrOx core&#8211;shell nanowires that effectively overcome the trade&#8208;off among activity, stability, and cost for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. An in situ oxidation process actualizes the confinement of subnanometer amorphous Ir&#8208;doped RuOx overlayers on ultrathin Pt nanowires. Heteroatom Ir&#8208;doping induces amorphization of host RuOx and effectively modulates the electronic structure and Ru&#9472;O covalency. The Pt@RuIrOx nanowires exhibit a substantially intensified robustness when serving as OER active electrocatalysts, demonstrating an ultralow overpotential (146&#160;mV) at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a remarkable stability. In a practical PEM water electrolyzer, the catalyst requires only 1.55&#160;V cell voltage at 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 and maintains long&#8208;lasting operation for over 2000&#160;h. Mechanistic studies validate that the flexible amorphous surface vitalizes the coexistence of multiple reaction pathways, along with an unprecedented lattice oxygen self&#8208;healing capability. These findings establish surface amorphous phase engineering as a powerful strategy for designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amorphous surfaces, which offer greater tunability compared to their crystalline counterparts, are increasingly recognized as highly active yet unstable phases for specific electrocatalysis reactions under harsh conditions. Whereas successfully creating and stabilizing amorphous surfaces on low-dimensional electrocatalysts remains a significant challenge. This work elaborately synthesizes ultrathin crystalline/amorphous Pt@RuIrO&lt;i&gt;

&lt;/i&gt; and effectively modulates the electronic structure and Ru&#9472;O covalency. The Pt@RuIrO&lt;i&gt;

         <title>Non&#8208;Equilibrium Carbothermal Shock Upcycling: Atomically Precise Synthesis of Tailored SiC Polytypes and Novel Hybrid Graphene from Complex Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transformative Carbothermal Shock (CTS) process selectively upcycles complex wind blade waste into tailored SiC polytypes or novel hybrid graphene through non&#8208;equilibrium phase engineering. This furnace&#8208;free, solvent&#8208;free, and energy&#8208;saving method yields materials with exceptional performance (e.g., 1791 S&#160;m&#8722;1 conductivity, +21.8% strength), demonstrating sustainable and economic waste valorization with 86% lower GWP (compared to traditional pyrolysis) and low cost (&#8776;$0.11/kg).








Abstract
The complex, heterogeneous nature of challenging precursors, as seen in end&#8208;of&#8208;life wind turbine blades, typically comprises glass or carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer composites with polyvinyl chloride foam cores. This complexity poses a significant material synthesis challenge, particularly for achieving high&#8208;value recovery with precise structural control. A transformative one&#8208;step, ultrafast carbothermal shock (CTS) process is presented that selectively converts these intricate, unseparated composites into high&#8208;value SiC polytypes or novel graphene structures. Leveraging ultrafast Joule heating, CTS enables remarkable atomic&#8208;scale phase control, facilitating kinetic trapping of specific non&#8208;equilibrium structures such as metastable 6H&#8208;SiC and a unique hybrid AB&#8208;turbostratic graphene. This unique hybrid graphene combines the high charge carrier mobility of AB&#8208;stacked nanodomains with the enhanced mechanical interlocking of turbostratic nanodomains. This results in exceptional electrical conductivity (1791 S&#160;m&#8722;1) and substantial mechanical reinforcement (+21.8%) in composites, significantly outperforming conventional reduced graphene oxide. Multiscale characterization and simulations elucidate the atomic&#8208;scale mechanisms driving this phase evolution and kinetic trapping. The study establishes a new paradigm for advanced materials synthesis from complex feedstocks, transforming critical waste into on&#8208;demand functional materials with compelling environmental benefits and dramatically lower operational costs. This sets the stage for sustainable material innovation and a circular economy.

         <title>Halide Perovskite&#8211;Chalcohalide Nanocrystal Heterostructures as a Platform for the Synthesis and Investigation of the CsPbCl3&#8211;CsPbI3 Epitaxial Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, perovskite&#8211;chalcohalide CsPbCl3&#8211;Pb4S3Cl2 heterostructures are exploited to study the Cl&#8594;I exchange reaction and to isolate new types of intermediate structures, in particular emissive CsPbI3&#8211;CsPbCl3&#8211;Pb4S3Cl2 heterostructures, with partial I&#8208;alloying of the CsPbCl3 domain and at the perovskite&#8211;chalcohalide interface, having a 5.6% lattice mismatch at the CsPbCl3&#8211;CsPbI3 interface and a residual 3.4% mismatch at the perovskite&#8211;chalcohalide interface.








Abstract
Halide exchange in lead&#8208;based halide perovskites has been studied extensively. While mixed Cl/Br or Br/I alloy compositions can be formed with no miscibility gaps, this is precluded for mixed Cl/I compositions, due to the large difference in Cl&#8722; and I&#8722; ionic radii. Here, perovskite&#8208;chalcohalide CsPbCl3&#8211;Pb4S3Cl2 nanocrystal heterostructures are exploited to study the Cl&#8594;I exchange and to isolate new types of intermediate structures. The epitaxial interface between the Pb4S3Cl2 chalcohalide and the CsPbCl3 perovskite significantly influences the intermediate stages of halide exchange in the perovskite domain, leading to coexisting CsPbCl3 and CsPbI3 domains, thereby delivering segmented CsPbI3&#8211;CsPbCl3&#8211;Pb4S3Cl2, energetically favorable heterostructures, with partial I&#8208;alloying of the CsPbCl3 domain and at the perovskite&#8211;chalcohalide interface. The I:CsPbCl3 domain between CsPbI3 and Pb4S3Cl2 enables a gradual lattice expansion across the heterostructure. This design accommodates interfacial strain, with a 5.6% mismatch at the CsPbCl3&#8211;CsPbI3 interface and a 3.4% mismatch at the perovskite&#8211;chalcohalide interface. Full halide exchange leads to CsPbI3&#8211;Pb4S3Cl2 heterostructures. Both in intermediate and fully exchanged heterostructures, the CsPbI3 domain is emissive. In the intermediate structures, the band alignment between the two perovskite domains is type&#8208;I, with the carriers photogenerated in the CsPbCl3 domain quickly transferring to the CsPbI3 domain, where they can recombine radiatively.

         <title>Atomic Hydrogen Mediated Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excess atomic hydrogen (H*) formation at the cathode accelerates its self&#8208;quenching to H2, which inhibits its utilization and weakens the system stability. This work proposes a passivation strategy of active sites to achieve the supply&#8208;demand balance of H*, which promotes H* utilization and catalyst stability, thereby improving the electrocatalytic hydrogenation efficiency of CN&#8722;, NO3&#8722;, CO2 or O2.








Abstract
Although atomic hydrogen (H*) is a crucial active species during the electrocatalytic hydrogenation process, its excessive production accelerates its self&#8208;quenching into hydrogen (H2), which decreases the reduction efficiency of the target reactant and causes cathode instability. Herein, a universal strategy is proposed to enhance the efficiency of diverse electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions (such as cyanide (CN&#8722;), nitrate (NO3&#8722;), carbon dioxide (CO2), or oxygen (O2) reductions) based on the supply&#8208;demand balance of H*. Through passivating the terminal oxygen sites with unsaturated coordination in Co3O4 with grafted sulfur (Co3O4&#8208;S), the free energy for H* generation increases from 0.17 to 0.41&#160;eV, efficiently regulating its production rate to restrain its excess formation. The supply&#8208;demand balance of H* promotes its utilization and suppresses HER, immensely improving the deep hydrogenation of CN&#8722; (Faraday efficiency (FEch4/nh3/ch3nh2): 19.6% &#8594; 45.3%), NO3&#8722; (FEnh3: 83% &#8594; 100%), CO2 (FECO: 25.1% &#8594; 51.7%) and O2 (transferred electrons: 2.6 &#8594; 3.6). This electrocatalytic system also exhibits excellent practical application potential, such as the cyanide&#8208;containing wastewater treatment. This work offers a new idea to enhance the utilization efficiency of cathodic active species for electrocatalytic reduction reactions and provides technical support for the design and synthesis of highly efficient and stable electrode materials.

This electrocatalytic system also exhibits excellent practical application potential, such as the cyanide-containing wastewater treatment.

         <title>Chiral Acoustic Phonon and Conservation of Pseudoangular Momentum in &#945;&#8208;Quartz</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral acoustic phonons in &#945;&#8208;quartz are probed via Brillouin light scattering, exploiting the photon's helicity and the crystal's handedness. The interaction obeys a selection rule arising from pseudoangular momentum conservation, enabling direct optical access to phonon chirality in nonsymmorphic crystals.








Abstract
While the linear motion of phonons is widely understood as arising from the translational symmetry of crystal lattices, recent studies have revealed the intrinsic rotational motion of phonons in condensed matter with discrete rotational symmetry. These phonons, termed chiral phonons, carry angular momentum associated with the rotational motion of atomic masses, as well as pseudoangular momentum arising from the phase winding of their circular motion. Chiral phonons give rise to novel physical phenomena such as Weyl phonons, valleytronics, and current&#8208;induced spin selectivity. Furthermore, since acoustic phonons are the primary carriers of heat, chiral acoustic phonons are expected to play a significant role in spin caloritronics. However, the existence of chiral acoustic phonons has not yet been demonstrated, in contrast to the chiral optical phonons. In this study, the detection of chiral acoustic phonons is reported using Brillouin light scattering. It is found that the conservation of pseudoangular momentum, which governs the helicity&#8208;dependent selection rules in photon&#8211;phonon interactions, manifests clearly for chiral acoustic phonons. By probing the previously uncharted low&#8208;wavenumber, low&#8208;frequency regime of chiral phonon dispersion, the findings expand the understanding of phonon chirality and its potential implications.

         <title>Tailoring Li3N&#8208;Contained Complementary Gradient Solid Electrolyte Interphase in High&#8208;Performance 3.2&#160;V Aqueous Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The author constructs a LiF/Li3N gradient complementary SEI structure in aqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries (ALIBs) by the synergistic strategy, which includes introducing amide co&#8208;solvent and adjusting the overpotential. This internally&#160;self&#8208;protective and rapidly formed SEI can suppress hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under the high cut&#8208;off voltage condition (3.2V), thereby extending the cycle life of high&#8208;voltage ALIBs.








Abstract
Lithium nitride (Li3N) as a crucial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) component to realize high&#8208;voltage non&#8208;aqueous lithium batteries is rarely reported in aqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries (ALIBs) due to its intense hydrolysis in aqueous solution. To overcome the limited operating voltages (&lt; 3&#160;V) and the unstable electrode/electrolyte interphase in ALIBs, a two&#8208;pronged strategy is presented that includes employing asymmetric amide co&#8208;solvent and overpotential&#8208;driven interfacial engineering. This simple method enables the construction of Li3N&#8208;contained complementary gradient SEI in aqueous media unprecedentedly. By adopting the N&#8208;methylformamide (NMF) co&#8208;solvent and an appropriate overpotential (0.3&#160;V), a robust complementary gradient SEI composed of LiF (outer) and stable Li3N (inner) via internal self&#8208;protection is established. The potential three&#8208;step formation mechanism of LiF/Li3N complementary gradient SEI involving the sequential decomposition of TFSI&#8722;, NMF, and H2O is proposed. Consequently, the tailored complementary gradient structure synergistically combines chemical stability with rapid formation dynamics, inhibiting the hydrogen evolution reaction in high&#8208;voltage situations. Ultimately, LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 cells demonstrate excellent cycling stability over 700 and 2000 cycles under 2 and 5C (3.2&#160;V), respectively. This work establishes a span&#8208;new idea for stabilizing the Li3N&#8208;contained electrode/electrolyte interphase in aqueous batteries, and offers a distinctive pathway for advancing high&#8208;voltage, long&#8208;term ALIBs.

         <title>Wearable Microneedle Patch Integrated with Metal Hydrogel&#8208;Based Signal Probe for Dermal Interstitial Fluid Protein Biomarkers Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a fully integrated wearable microneedle patch incorporating a metal hydrogel&#8208;based electrochemical probe for minimally invasive sampling and real&#8208;time monitoring of protein biomarkers in interstitial fluid (ISF). The ferrocene&#8208;anchored Au gel ensures ultrahigh sensitivity, while a hollow microneedle array allows rapid ISF extraction, offering a versatile platform for next&#8208;generation wearable protein diagnostics.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time tracking of protein biomarkers in dermal interstitial fluid (ISF) remains a significant challenge due to the limitations in robust analyte sensing, efficient ISF extraction, and seamless system integration. Herein, a wearable microneedle patch (w&#8208;MN patch) integrated with a metal hydrogel&#8208;based electrochemical probe is demonstrated for simultaneous sampling and monitoring of immunoglobulin G (IgG), a key protein biomarker, in ISF. The sensing probe, featuring ferrocene anchored on polydopamine functionalized&#8208;Au gel, enables highly stable and sensitive detection with an ultralow detection limit of 0.05&#160;ng mL&#8210;1 in both in vitro and ex vivo models. A hollow MN (HMN) array design facilitates rapid ISF collection, yielding 5.6&#160;&#181;L within 5 min in a live rat model, as validated by simulations and experimental data. By integrating the HMN array via a sensing chip using a home&#8208;made packaging chamber, the w&#8208;MN patch realizes real&#8208;time, wireless IgG monitoring in vivo. This work presents a fully integrated platform that unites sensitive protein biomarker detection, efficient ISF extraction, and wearable device engineering, offering significant potential for precision diagnostics and next&#8208;generation wearable healthcare technologies.

         <title>Polarization Switching on the Open Surfaces of the Wurtzite Ferroelectric Nitrides: Ferroelectric Subsystems and Electrochemical Reactivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates polarization switching in wurtzite ferroelectric Al1&#8208;xScxN using automated piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). It reveals a multi&#8208;stage, surface&#8208;controled mechanism where electrochemical layer formation precedes bulk switching, highlighting strong coupling between ferroelectric and chemical effects. These findings offer nanoscale insights into how surface and interface conditions influence polarization switching in wurtzite ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Binary ferroelectric nitrides are promising materials for information technologies and power electronics. However, polarization switching in these materials is highly unusual. From the structural perspective, polarization reversal is associated with the change of the effective polarity at the surfaces and interfaces from N&#8208;to&#8208;M terminated, suggesting strong coupling between ferroelectric and chemical phenomena. Phenomenologically, macroscopic studies demonstrate the presence of complex time dependent phenomena including wake&#8208;up. Here, the polarization switching using the multidimensional high&#8208;resolution piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and spectroscopy is explored, detecting both the evolution of induced ferroelectric domain, electromechanical response, and surface deformation during first&#8208;order reversal curve measurements. The presence of two weakly coupled ferroelectric subsystems are demonstrated and the bias&#8208;induced electrochemical reactivity. The observed behaviors are very similar to the recent studies of other wurtzite system but additionally include electrochemical reactivity, suggesting the universality of these behaviors for the wurtzite binary ferroelectrics. These studies suggest potential of high&#8208;resolution multimodal PFM spectroscopies to resolve complex coupled polarization dynamics in materials. Furthermore, these PFM based studies are fully consistent with the recent electron microscopy observations of the shark&#8208;teeth like ferroelectric domains in nitrides. Hence, it is believed that these studies establish the universal phenomenological picture of polarization switching in binary wurtzite.

An enamel&#8208;inspired amorphous/crystalline ceramic nanocomposites (EACN) with superior mechanical and functional properties is prepared. The outstanding performance is due to stiff structural skeleton of hierarchical tubular ceramic heterophase microstructures and strong polymeric interfacial adhesion provided by compositional heterogeneity. The nanocomposite has demonstrated practical value in electronic structural material for bioelectronics exemplified as a wireless tooth patch for oral health monitoring.








Abstract
Despite extensive efforts to develop high&#8208;performance ceramic nanocomposites, specially achieving both high stiffness and high damping remains challenging because these properties are typically mutually exclusive. Here, a bottom&#8208;up strategy is developed to fabricate an enamel&#8208;inspired ceramic nanotube array nanocomposite by assembling highly ordered amorphous/crystalline&#8208;titania nanotube arrays infiltrated with a polymethyl methacrylate matrix on a large scale. This nanocomposite simultaneously exhibits high stiffness (nanoindent Young's modulus: &#8776;71.4&#160;GPa; nanoindent hardness: &#8776;4.3&#160;GPa), high damping (tan&#948;: &#8776;0.07), exceptional energy dissipation (&#8776;4.6 &#181;J &#181;m&#8722;3), and excellent fatigue resistance that surpass those of conventional and biomimetic ceramic&#8208;based materials, while also offering good processability (can be sculptured into various shapes), biocompatibility (no tissue damage or abnormal immune responses in vivo), and corrosion resistance. The remarkable mechanical performance arises from the robust amorphous/crystalline ceramic nanotube array skeleton and the abundant three&#8208;phase interfacial adhesion. This work expands the hierarchical dimensionality of enamel&#8208;like material design by precisely tailoring the heterogeneous phases within nanotubes, positioning this nanocomposite as a promising candidate for multipurpose applications that demand exceptional dynamic load&#8208;bearing capacity, exemplified by the electronic substrate of a dental patch for oral health monitoring.

         <title>Fiber Transistors as a Hardware Surrogate Gradient for Backpropagation in Spiking Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surrogate gradient for backpropagation in spiking neural networks requires nonlinear computation. Here, textile&#8208;based vertical OECTs are reported based on coaxial poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate/poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) fibers fabricated via solvent interdiffusion solidification spinning. Their anti&#8208;ambipolar transfer matches a Sigmoid derivative, enabling hardware surrogate gradients. Conditionally activated backpropagation yields sparse, event&#8208;driven updates and software&#8208;level EEG classification while cutting training operations by &#8776;20%.









Abstract
Efficient training of spiking neural networks (SNNs) in flexible neuromorphic hardware remains a major challenge due to the non&#8208;differentiable nature of spiking activations and the limited availability of trainable, energy&#8208;efficient device platforms. Here, a tunable textile&#8208;based vertical organic electrochemical transistor (TT&#8208;vOECT) enables implementation of surrogate gradients computation for backpropagation in SNNs. Using a solvent interdiffusion solidification spinning strategy, Plateau&#8211;Rayleigh instabilities are overcome to fabricate coaxial trilayer fibers with well&#8208;defined heterojunctions between PEDOT:PSS and BBL. The resulting TT&#8208;vOECT exhibits nonlinear transfer characteristics that closely approximate the Sigmoid derivative. A conditionally activated backpropagation (CAB) mechanism is further proposed, in which synaptic updates are gated by both surrogate gradient magnitude and input spike, is implemented using reconfigurable logic arrays based on dual TT&#8208;vOECTs. This framework enables sparse, event&#8208;driven weight updates with reduced computational overhead. Integrated into a convolutional SNN, the device&#8208;driven CAB strategy achieves high&#8208;accuracy classification of electroencephalogram signals for multiclass neurological disorder diagnosis, comparable to software baselines, while reducing computational redundancy by &#8776;20%. The results establish a scalable and flexible organic hardware platform for trainable neuromorphic systems with biologically inspired learning dynamics.

         <title>Rapid High&#8208;Resolution Visible&#8208;Light 3D Printing of Hydrogels via Nanocluster&#8208;Triggered Dual&#8208;Pathway Photoinitiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, it is presented that a nanocluster&#8208;triggered dual&#8208;pathway photoinitiation enables the rapid, high&#8208;resolution 3D printing of optically clear hydrogels driven by visible light. The dual&#8208;pathway, high photoinitiation performance, and new photochemical insights demonstrated in this work should stimulate more future exploration of nanocluster&#8208;based materials for improving the 3D printing of hydrogels and other materials.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven 3D printing (vat photopolymerization) of hydrogel materials has received significant attention because of its great potential in various biomedical applications.&#160;Currently, the simultaneous achievement of the high&#8208;speed and high&#8208;resolution printing of complex hydrogel structures is still challenging. Most of the hydrogel printings are conducted using UV sources (&lt;420&#160;nm), and visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven systems often suffer from slower reaction times, sensitivity to ambient oxygen,&#160;and unwanted coloring of products. Here, it is presented that a nanocluster&#8208;triggered dual&#8208;pathway photoinitiation can address these key limitations. In contrast to many of the reported water&#8208;soluble photoinitiators, Ag nanocluster demonstrates a superior initiation efficiency under long wavelength (405&#8211;560&#160;nm), and it simultaneously leads to the improved resolution due to the unique nature of nanoclusters and their generated radicals. In addition, Ag nanocluster is photodegradable which produces the highly desired, optically clear products. Spectroscopic analysis unveils the anomalous scission of the interfacial Ag&#8208;S bond (type&#8208;I) and the proton abstraction (type&#8208;II) from amino acids to Ag nanoclusters, both of which create highly reactive radicals. The dual&#8208;pathway, high photoinitiation performance, and new photochemical insights demonstrated in this work should stimulate more future exploration of nanocluster&#8208;based materials for improving the 3D printing of hydrogels and other materials systems.

         <title>Amino Acid&#8208;Induced Dynamic Networks of Interface&#8208;Enriched Adhesive Molecules for High&#8208;Strength, Recyclable, and Substrate&#8208;Adaptive Protein Adhesives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing amino acids to partially disrupt the non&#8208;covalent interactions between polyphenols and proteins, the distribution of phenolic compounds at the interface is enhanced while cohesive energy is maintained, significantly improving the interfacial adhesion of protein&#8208;based adhesives.








Abstract
Protein&#8208;based bioadhesives are emerging as sustainable alternatives to traditional adhesives, with potential applications in biomedicine, tissue engineering, and electronics. However, challenges such as low adhesive strength, poor substrate and environmental adaptability, and limited recyclability persist. Unlike previous studies that focused on replicating key chemical units, interaction patterns, liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS), and nano/microscale structures in natural adhesives, a novel strategy is proposed that partially disrupts the noncovalent interactions between polyphenols and proteins through amino acid modulation. This approach facilitates the migration and enrichment of polyphenol adhesive molecules at substrate interfaces along with amino acid, where they synergistically enhance substrate adaptability. The high cohesion and dynamic nature of the resulting network, driven by noncovalent interactions, ensures both high adhesive strength and full recyclability of polyphenol&#8208;protein adhesives (PPA). Importantly, this strategy expands the PPA toolbox, incorporating proteins (gelatin, collagen, silk, keratin) and polyphenols (tannic acid, proanthocyanidins, epigallocatechin gallate), broadening their applications in daily&#8208;use adhesives, industrial products, and cultural relic restoration across both dry and wet environments. This work enhances the understanding of balancing adhesion and cohesion, providing insights for the design of high&#8208;performance bioadhesives.

         <title>Gradient Hydrogel Electrolyte Enables High Ionic Conductivity and Robust Mechanical Properties for Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Hofmeister effect&#8208;endorsed concentration gradient hydrogel electrolyte is developed to balance the ionic conductivity and the mechanical integrity simultaneously for an ultralong lifespan aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery by regulated dendrite&#8208;free Zn (002) deposition and the suppressed hydrogen evolution side reaction during the service. The flexible nature of the gradient hydrogel electrolyte also enables the fabrication of a flexible fibril full battery for wearable electronic applications.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) hold great promise for sustainable storage, yet their practical deployment is impeded by dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Hydrogel electrolytes offer a potential solution to stabilization but suffer from a trade&#8208;off in ionic conductivity and mechanical robustness. Herein, by leveraging the Hofmeister effect, the way ions influence the solubility, stability, and structure of polymers in aqueous solutions, a concentration gradient hydrogel electrolyte (CGHE) is designed to reconcile these challenges. By integrating two hydrogels with high&#160;(1.5&#160;m OAc&#8722;) and low (0.3&#160;m) acetate concentrations, the CGHE achieves a high Zn2&#8314; transference number (tZn2+${t_{Z{n^{2 + }}}}$ = 0.88) and excellent mechanical strength (&#963; = 1.7&#160;MPa, &#603;max = 310%). The quasi&#8208;solid gradient architecture regulates Zn2+&#160;transport and cation selectivity, promoting uniform Zn (002) deposition while suppressing HER through reduced water activity in the networks. Consequently, symmetric Zn//Zn cells exhibit ultrastable cycling over 2,500 h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and Zn//Cu asymmetric cells deliver a coulombic efficiency of 99.1%. The Zn//hydrogel//V2O5 full batteries retain&#160;91% of capacity after 500 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1, while the quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte offers flexibility and flame resistance, enabling potential safe operation in wearable devices. The gradient electrolyte design provides &#160;a general strategy for constructing&#160;advanced electrolytes in&#160;metal&#8208;based energy systems.

By integrating two hydrogels with high&#160;(1.5&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; OAc&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and low (0.3&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;) acetate concentrations, the CGHE achieves a high Zn&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; transference number (tZn2+${t_{Z{n^{2 + }}}}$ = 0.88) and excellent mechanical strength (&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt; = 1.7&#160;MPa, &lt;i&gt;&#603;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = 310%). The quasi-solid gradient architecture regulates Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;transport and cation selectivity, promoting uniform Zn (002) deposition while suppressing HER through reduced water activity in the networks. Consequently, symmetric Zn//Zn cells exhibit ultrastable cycling over 2,500 h at 1&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and Zn//Cu asymmetric cells deliver a coulombic efficiency of 99.1%. The Zn//hydrogel//V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; full batteries retain&#160;91% of capacity after 500 cycles at 2 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, while the quasi-solid electrolyte offers flexibility and flame resistance, enabling potential safe operation in wearable devices. The gradient electrolyte design provides &#160;a general strategy for constructing&#160;advanced electrolytes in&#160;metal-based energy systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective Passive Ammonia Fuel Cells via Synergistic Integration of Optimized Membrane Electrode Assembly and Prototype</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost, powerful PAFC without noble metals is created. The key materials work together to greatly improve performance and stability. This shows a promising path for portable devices that run on NH3, offering a practical clean energy solution.








Abstract
Passive ammonia fuel cells (PAFCs) offer modular adaptability but face dual challenges: limited power density and dependency on noble metals. Here, a comprehensive strategy is presented to address these issues through coordinated materials and system design. Pre&#8208;oxidized nickel substrates direct the formation of &#946;&#8208;phase NiOOH/Ni3P (&#946;&#8208;NiOOH/Ni3P) heterointerfaces in anode, significantly enhancing ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) kinetics with a high current density of 171&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 0.7&#160;V. A spinel&#8208;structured MnCo2O4/C cathode catalyst demonstrates remarkable ammonia tolerance and outperforms Pt/C in stability. A polytetrafluoroethylene/layered double hydroxide (PTFE/LDH) composite membrane is also introduced, which effectively reduces ammonia crossover. Their integration with an optimized graphite prototype further enhances PAFCs' efficiency and stability. This synergistic multi&#8208;phase optimization enables record&#8208;breaking performance for non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based PAFCs, achieving a peak power density (PPD) of 61&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 and an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.87&#160;V (outperforming Pt&#8208;based PAFCs). Stable discharge can be sustained by the present PAFC for 9 h by replenishing the ammonia supply. This work establishes a prototype&#8208;to&#8208;performance strategy for cost&#8208;effective PAFC, highlighting the potential of non&#8208;noble metal catalysts in ammonia electrochemical energy conversion.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Electrode Synergistic Electrolyte Enabling Highly Reversible Multi&#8208;Electron Redox in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;electrode synergistic electrolyte based on [PeMIM]+Br&#8722; is designed to enable reversible multi&#8208;electron conversion in aqueous Zn&#9472;I2 batteries. Br&#8722; facilitates cascade halogen redox by accelerating sequential I&#8722;/I0/I+ and Br&#8722;/Br0 redox reactions, while the hydrophobic [PeMIM]+ cation suppresses I&#8314; hydrolysis and directs Zn deposition, thus achieving elevated capacity, high coulombic efficiency, and extended cycling stability under practical conditions.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;electron redox strategies offer promising approaches to achieve high energy density in aqueous Zn&#8208;iodine (Zn&#9472;I2) batteries, yet the development is impeded by unstable intermediate species, slow redox kinetics, and poor reversibility, particularly at low current densities. Herein, 1&#8208;pentyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bromide ([PeMIM]+Br&#8722;) is employed to develop a dual&#8208;electrode synergistic electrolyte (DESA&#8208;E), which enables the multi&#8208;electron conversion of Zn&#9472;I2 batteries with high specific capacity and long&#8208;term cycling stability. The Br&#8722; in DESA&#8208;E induces dual&#8208;halogen synergy, accelerating cascade I&#8722;/I0/I+ four&#8208;electron conversion kinetics and activating the Br&#8722;/Br0 redox reactions for ultra&#8208;high specific capacity. Meanwhile, hydrophobic [PeMIM]+ alkyl chains stabilize interhalogen intermediates, suppress I+ hydrolysis, and guide Zn deposition along the (002) plane via electrostatic effect. Consequently, the DESA&#8208;E enables Zn&#9472;I2 batteries with a specific capacity of 557&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.97%, and maintains a low degradation rate of 0.00055% per cycle over 60&#160;000 cycles at 8 A g&#8722;1. This work presents a facile and cost&#8208;effective electrolyte design to enable durable multi&#8208;electron Zn&#9472;I2 batteries for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density systems.

         <title>Superior Energy&#8208;Storage Performance in Sandwich&#8208;Structured AgNbO3&#8208;Based Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polarization and breakdown strength are improved simultaneously via optimizing the sandwich structure with alternate large polarization layer and high breakdown strength layer in AgNbO3&#8208;based antiferroelectric ceramics. A recoverable energy storage density Wrec of 16.8 J cm&#8722;3 with energy efficiency &#951; of 81.3% is realized in (Ag0.70Bi0.10)NbO3/(Ag0.82Bi0.06)NbO3/(Ag0.70Bi0.10)NbO3 ceramic, attaining the peak value of AgNbO3&#8208;based antiferroelectric ceramics.








Abstract
Antiferroelectric (AFE) ceramics with typical double polarization&#8208;electric field loops hold exceptional potential for high capacitance density capacitors. However, the inherent contradiction between polarization and breakdown strength limits the energy storage performance in AFE ceramics. Herein, the polarization and breakdown strength are improved simultaneously via optimizing the sandwich structure with alternate large polarization (Ag0.82Bi0.06)NbO3 layer and high breakdown strength (Ag0.70Bi0.10)NbO3 layer. A recoverable energy storage density Wrec of 16.8 J cm&#8722;3 with energy efficiency &#951; of 81.3% is realized in (Ag0.70Bi0.10)NbO3/(Ag0.82Bi0.06)NbO3/(Ag0.70Bi0.10)NbO3 ceramic, attaining the peak value of AgNbO3&#8208;based AFE ceramics. Moreover, the sandwich&#8208;structured ceramic shows good stabilities with variations of less than 7.0% over a temperature range of 30&#8211;150&#160;&#176;C, frequency range of 1&#8211;500&#160;Hz, and 105 cycling in Wrec, and a discharge energy density Wd of 6.2 J cm&#8722;3 along with a fast discharge time t0.9 of 120&#160;ns. This research provides an effective strategy for enhancing the energy storage performance of lead&#8208;free AFE ceramics, highlighting their potential for practical applications in pulse power systems.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
Thermoset composites often face a challenging trade&#8208;off between recyclability and high performance. In this study, an innovative closed&#8208;loop manufacturing approach that integrates frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) with 3D printing to produce fully recyclable carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced polymers (c&#8208;CFRPs) is presented. A self&#8208;propagating FROMP&#8208;enabled direct ink writing (DIW) printing technology is developed, enabling in situ curing within seconds. This breakthrough eliminates the need for post&#8208;processing and reduces energy consumption by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional autoclave methods. By copolymerizing dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) with a commercial spiroacetal monomer&#160;(&#8804;3&#160;wt.%), acid&#8208;degradable resins that retain the tensile strength of conventional thermosets are introduced&#160;while allowing for matrix depolymerization under mild conditions. The DCPD&#8208;based c&#8208;CFRPs demonstrate remarkable tensile strengths of up to 817&#160;MPa and glass transition temperatures exceeding 160&#160;&#176;C. In a significant advancement, the recovered carbon fibers retain their pristine morphology and over 95% of their original mechanical properties, enabling repeated recycling without performance loss. Additionally, recovered oligomers can be repolymerized into new resins, further enhancing sustainability. This work presents a groundbreaking solution for high&#8208;performance composite manufacturing, addressing critical energy and waste challenges in the thermoset industry.

         <title>Mitochondria Rewiring by Polyphenol&#8208;Copper Nanodots to Truncate Mitochondrial&#8208;Endoplasmic Reticulum Crosstalk for Acute Kidney Injury Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aberrant mitochondria&#8208;endoplasmic reticulum (ER) interactions at mitochondria&#8208;associated membranes (MAMs) drive renal injury in acute kidney injury (AKI). We developed gallic acid&#8208;modified copper nanodots (GA&#8208;Cu) that target tubular mitochondria. GA&#8208;Cu scavenges reactive oxygen species, disrupts the MAM tethering complex, and suppresses pathological mitochondria&#8208;ER contacts. This intervention restores calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function, offering a subcellular targeting strategy against AKI.








Abstract
Aberrant mitochondria&#8208;endoplasmic reticulum (ER) interactions at mitochondria&#8208;associated membranes (MAMs) drive renal tubular cell injury in acute kidney injury (AKI), exacerbating oxidative stress, calcium dysregulation, and homeostasis disruption. However, targeted intervention remains challenging. To address this challenge, this study employs gallic acid&#8208;modified polyphenol&#8208;copper nanodots (GA&#8208;Cu) to target tubular mitochondria and ameliorate AKI by rewiring organelle communication. Following systemic administration, the ultrasmall GA&#8208;Cu nanodots readily traverse the renal filtration barrier and are internalized by tubular cells. Their surface polyphenol composition enables precise enrichment around mitochondria, where they not only scavenge reactive oxygen species but also disrupt the core MAM tethering complex&#8212;the IP3R&#8211;GRP75&#8211;VDAC1 axis. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that GA&#8208;Cu remodels mitochondria&#8208;ER interfaces, significantly suppressing pathological MAM formation. This intervention attenuates ER&#8208;to&#8208;mitochondria calcium transfer and restores mitochondrial function, resulting in remarkable renal protection. Hence, this refined cellular regulation is expected to offer substantial prospects for activating new subcellular compartment&#8208;specific homeostatic effects.

         <title>Design Principles for Air Tolerance in Pyridinium&#8208;Based Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Equilibrium models are derived for redox flow battery electrolytes that enable accurate prediction of the onset air stability in methyl viologen &#8211; a compound known to the community for over 100 years and one of the most well&#8208;studied aqueous flow battery electrolytes.








Abstract
Pyridinium compounds represent promising electrolyte candidates for aqueous redox flow batteries. Recently, their ability to afford air&#8208;stability was demonstrated, unlocking potential avenues both for relaxed system constraints and for high voltage operation. Here, simple equilibrium models for pyridinium electrolytes are developed, which are leveraged to predict and successfully validate the air stability of methyl viologen &#8211; the lowest cost and most well&#8208;studied pyridinium system to date. By controlling the degree of &#960;&#8208;association of active species, the total fraction of radicals can be kept below a critical threshold, from which air&#8208;stable operation can be accessed. The resulting system exhibits 94.9% capacity retention in air after 150 cycles but undergoes dramatic losses in performance once diluted outside of its air stability threshold. We tie this behaviour to rates of oxygen consumption in solution and further derive the second Damk&#246;hler number, a dimensionless parameter which informs optimal scaling of battery components. On this basis, air stability is shown to be compatible with scaling requirements needed for applications in long&#8208;duration energy storage. Given the known tendency for broader classes of organic electrolytes to associate, it is anticipated that the findings presented can be generalized to many other current and future systems.

         <dc:description>
This study introduces an in situ encapsulated dual&#8208;nanograting structure combined with upconversion nanoparticles (NaYF4:20%Yb, 2%Er) to enhance the stability and NIR response of MAPbBr3 photodetectors. The approach significantly improves stability, extends spectral response to NIR, and achieves high responsivity (2915 mA&#183;W&#8722;1) and detectivity (1.3&#215;1011 Jones), with excellent flexibility.








Abstract
Potential applications of perovskite materials in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photodetectors are hindered by their instability and low absorption. In this study, dual nanogratings and upconversion nanoparticles (NaYF4:20%Yb, 2%Er) are introduced to enhance the stability of MAPbBr3 and extend its spectral response to the NIR range. A photodetector with responsivity of 2.9 A&#183;W&#8722;1 and detectivity of 1.34&#215;1011 Jones at 980&#160;nm is developed using this approach. The device maintained 78.6% performance after 4 months of air exposure and 72.4% performance after 3000 bending cycles, demonstrating significant improvements in stability and flexibility.

         <title>Water Interactions in Hydrated Aliphatic Polyester Composite Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactions among polymer chains, ceramic particles, and water affect properties like crystallinity, thermal behavior, and strength. Advances in scaffold&#8208;guided bone regeneration (SGBR)&#160;depend on understanding multiscale mechanisms in hydrated ceramic particle&#8211;polymer composites (CPPCs). This review explores the molecular basis of polymer hyperelasticity in relation to hydration and structure, and examines interfacial mechanisms in hydrated CPPCs to inform future research.








Abstract
The organ bone consists of mineralized and non&#8208;mineralized tissues. The mineralized tissues can be defined from a material science point of view as composites of inorganic and organic matter. Hydration of the composites is vital for mechanical and physico&#8211;chemical properties, supporting macromolecular networks in optimizing structure and function. In the field of scaffold&#8208;guided bone regeneration (SGBR), researchers have sought to mimic these naturally derived composites by combining ceramic particles with polymeric biodegradable biomaterials, mainly aliphatic polyesters, aiming to enhance the physicochemical properties of the polymeric matrix. However, the behavior of these resulting composites under physiological conditions remains underexplored. A complex interplay exists among the polymeric chains, ceramic particles, and water molecules, influencing various characteristics, including crystallinity, thermal properties, and mechanical strength, of the composite. Future advancements in scaffold design and manufacturing in SGBR cannot be separated from a comprehensive understanding of the diverse, multiscale physicochemical mechanisms at work in hydrated ceramic particle&#8211;polymer composites (CPPCs). This review analyzes literature on the molecular origins of hyperelasticity in polymers, focusing on hydration and structural rearrangements. It also discusses interfacial mechanisms in hydrated CPPCs, which allows future research to refine manufacturing, design, and strategies for next&#8208;generation CPPCs.

         <title>Thermally&#8208;Strained Black Phosphorus Photovoltaics Toward Spatially&#8208;Resolved Biomimetic Vision Enhancement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;centrosymmetric black phosphorus is achieved by introducing anisotropic thermal strains, enabling non&#8208;junction photovoltaic performance. Artificially&#8208;fabricated anisotropic synapse devices exhibit biomimetic vision behaviors. Superior broadband response and operation durability further endow all&#8208;in&#8208;one sensors with spatially&#8208;resolved perception and processing capability for blended image tasks. This methodology offers an alternative route for low&#8208;power neuromorphic sensing applications.








Abstract
The bulk photovoltaic effect presents a promising opportunity for smart photovoltaic sensing devices without the need for complex junction configurations. Black phosphorus (BP), with thickness&#8208; and direction&#8208;sensitive photoelectric characteristics and industrial scalability, is well&#8208;suited for developing integrated and reconfigurable imaging sensors. Although BP&#8208;based hetero&#8208;/homo&#8208;structures have demonstrated notable photovoltaic effects, the development of non&#8208;junction BP devices remains challenging. Herein, thick BP is engineered with directional spontaneous polarization along the armchair direction by artificially applying anisotropic thermal strains. This modified BP exhibits an ultrabroad photovoltaic response spanning 365&#8211;1800&#160;nm, achieving a peak photocurrent density of &#8776;52.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under &#181;W&#8208;level illumination, setting a new performance benchmark compared to existing non&#8208;junction or homojunction BP&#8208;based photovoltaic devices. Furthermore, robust operation stability and millisecond&#8208;level response within the human eye visual range indicate the potential for biomimetic vision applications. Leveraging these superiorities, a spatially&#8208;resolved imaging sensor that incorporates multi&#8208;optical parameters modulated synaptic plasticity and photoelectric transport nonlinearity, is developed. Such an all&#8208;in&#8208;one sensor allows for synergistic perception and parallel processing of blended images, demonstrating an enhanced anisotropic recognition capability of up to 94.1%. The thermally&#8208;strained symmetry&#8208;breaking approach paves the way for nonlinear photovoltaic effects in low&#8208;symmetry layered materials, advancing high&#8208;integration low&#8208;power neuromorphic sensors.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Light Harvesting Enhanced Hydrovoltaic Electric Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible hybrid energy&#8208;harvesting generator based on photo&#8208;responsive BiOBr nanosheets and hygroscopic polymers, it not only achieves high&#8208;performance moisture&#8208;induced power generation but also further enhances the output performance through the photo&#8208;induced water oxidation process. After light harvesting, the consumption of holes by water molecules generates additional hydrogen ions, resulting in a 60.98% increase in output power density under RH 75%.








Abstract
Moisture&#8208;voltaic power generation using hygroscopic materials harnesses atmospheric water to produce clean, sustainable energy. Yet environmental complexity means single mode moisture to electricity conversion suffers from efficiency limits and poor adaptability, making the development of flexible, multimodal clean&#8209;energy harvesters essential. Here, a strategy is presents that combines hygroscopic polyelectrolyte material with light&#8208;responsive BiOBr nanosheets to create a moisture&#8208;light harvesting electric generator (MLEG). We utilized the PSS/AMPS&#8208;Na/PVA/BiOBr (PAPBO) composite as the flexible active layer, achieving highly efficient hydrovoltaic power output. Additionally due to the incorporation of BiOBr, long&#8208;lived holes are generated through light harvesting, which further enhances the output performance through water oxidation. When exposed to an environment with 75% relative humidity, a single MLEG delivers a substantial open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.77 V and a short&#8208;circuit current of 18.73 &#181;A. After the MLEG harvests light energy, the consumption of holes by water molecules generates additional hydrogen ions, resulting in a 60.98% increase in output power density (from 72.75 to 117.11 &#181;W cm&#8722;2). The device can also function as a humidity sensor, responding to humidity levels from 10% to 100%. This work provides a novel approach to harvesting and converting multiple natural energy sources, boosting the hydrovoltaic effect and opening a new path for sustainable power generation.

         <title>Terracing Oxyphilic Platinum Sustains High&#8208;Rate Ammonia Electrolysis and Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by mechanistic insights, Pt86Ir5Rh9 nanowires are developed with weakened nitrogen adsorption and enhanced oxyphilicity for ammonia oxidation. In a membrane electrode assembly, the catalyst enables ammonia electrolysis at 1 A cm&#8722;2 in 0.63 V, maintains 100 mA cm&#8722;2 for 200 hours, and delivers a power density of 339 mW cm&#8722;2 at 0.4 V&#8212;an order of magnitude above c&#8208;Pt/C.








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics and catalyst poisoning of the ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) pose technical barriers to adopting ammonia as a distributable carrier for green hydrogen and electricity. Herein, a class of PtIrRh nanowires (NWs, &#8776;1 nm diameter) is report with abundant terraces and oxyphilic doping for enhanced AOR electrocatalysis. It is first unravel, through size&#8208;dependent AOR activity, that well&#8208;coordinated terraces outperform under&#8208;coordinated steps on platinum, guiding the rational design of 1D architecture. The compositionally&#8208;optimized Pt86Ir5Rh9 NWs achieve a mass activity of 324 A g&#8722;1PGM at 0.6 V, alongside an on&#8208;set potential (Eon&#8208;set) of 0.41 V. Electrochemical studies coupling in situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectra establish voltammetry&#8208;accessible descriptors: surface oxyphilicity governs the Eon&#8208;set, while nitrogenous adsorption strength dictates peak current density (jpeak). In a membrane electrode assembly, the Pt86Ir5Rh9 NWs enable ammonia electrolysis at 1 A cm&#8722;2 with a cell voltage of 0.63 V&#8212;1 V lower than the typical value of water electrolysis, and drive a direct ammonia fuel cell to 339 mW cm&#8722;2 at 0.4 V. The findings redefine Pt&#8208;based AOR catalyst design and advance ammonia&#8208;mediated hydrogen economy toward practicality.

         <title>A Pseudo&#8208;Mytilus Edulis Foot Protein&#8208;Based Hydrogel Adhesive with Osteo&#8208;Vascular&#8208;Immune Coupling Effects for Osteoporotic Bone&#8208;Implant Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by mussel proteins, YDC&#8208;Gel&#8208;Zn is a smart bone glue designed for osteoporotic implants. It adheres strongly to both metal implants and bone for initial fixation. In osteoporosis's inflammatory environment, it sequentially releases zinc ions and therapeutic peptides: the zinc modulates immune cells to reduce inflammation, while the peptides stimulate bone regeneration and blood vessel formation. This dual&#8208;action approach enhances implant stability in osteoporotic bone, achieving near&#8208;healthy bone performance.








Abstract
The reduced initial stability of orthopedic implants in osteoporotic bone matrices, coupled with excessive M1 macrophage polarization at bone&#8208;implant interfaces, disrupt bone&#8211;immune homeostasis and vascularization, ultimately leading to implant loosening or failure. Inspired by the marine mussel Mytilus edulis foot protein (Mefp), a pH&#8208;responsive multifunctional bone glue (YDC&#8208;Gel&#8208;Zn) with broad&#8208;spectrum adhesion capabilities is developed for osteoporotic bone&#8208;implant integration. This pseudo&#8208;Mefp bioglue enables dual&#8208;interface adhesion via catechol&#8208;rich sequences that mediate stable metal&#8208;phenolic coordination with metallic implants and hydrogen&#8208;bonded/Michael addition&#8208;driven interactions with the bone matrix, thereby improving initial implant fixation. Under osteoporotic inflammatory microenvironments, sequential dissociation of borate ester bonds and metal&#8210;phenolic coordination facilitates the controlled release of Zn2&#8314; and proangiogenic/osteogenic peptides (YDC). The released Zn2&#8314; remodels glutathione metabolism through glutathione S&#8208;transferase (GST)&#8208;mediated regulation of glutathione (GSH) levels, inhibits JAK1/STAT1/NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and suppresses the release of proinflammatory cytokines from senescent M1 macrophages, recalibrating the osteo&#8208;vascular&#8208;immune microenvironment. Due to its positive effects on bone regeneration and angiogenesis, the bioinspired bone bioglue demonstrated a 194% increase in fixation strength in osteoporotic rat models, achieving 93% healthy bone&#8208;implant stability. Overall, this study provides a clinically translatable strategy for stable implantation under osteoporotic conditions through synergistic mechanical adaptation, bioactivity regulation, and smart environmental responsiveness.

Sodium Metal All&#8208;Solid State Batteries (Na&#8208;ASSBs) are enabled by the synthesis of the solid state electrolyte, NASICON (Na1+xZr2SixP3&#8208;xO12), using carbide&#8208;based precursor compounds (ZrC and SiC); resulting in dense, pure, and mechanically improved microstructure. Heat released during solid state synthesis creates a uniform microstructure with a favorable distribution of secondary impurities &#8211; enabling faster current capabilities without dendrite driven short circuit.








Abstract
Reactive carbide precursor&#8208;based synthesis of NASICON&#8208;type NZSP (Na1+xZr2SixP3&#8208;xO12) solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) is demonstrated, in contrast to the established oxide&#8208;based approach. Exothermic decomposition of ZrC and SiC in air homogenizes microstructure, yielding 98% compact density after conventional sintering at 1200&#160;&#176;C. Quantitative stereology demonstrates that significant microstructural differences are present. Compacts of carbide&#8208;derived Carb&#8208;NZSP are 98% dense with a secondary zirconium oxide (ZrO2) volume fraction of 0.2% &#177; 0.3%, versus 93% dense and 3% &#177; 1% for oxide&#8208;derived baseline. For Carb&#8208;NZSP, the secondary glassy phosphate phase is agglomerated, while for baseline, it is dispersed and percolated. Electrochemical testing combined with post&#8208;mortem analysis demonstrates how microstructural control of secondary phases is critical for dendrite suppression: Carb&#8208;NZSP critical current density (CCD) is 3.1 &#177; 0.8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.1 mAh cm&#8722;2, versus 1.0 &#177; 0.7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.1 mAh cm&#8722;2. Cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo&#8208;FIB) analysis demonstrates that in both materials, the porous 2D sheet&#8208;like sodium metal dendrites propagate around and subsume NZSP grains, likely following a path enriched with glassy phase and with porosity. Dendrites also flow around isolated zirconia particles. Phase field simulation reveals deflection of dendrites by mechanically tough zirconia, while brittle glassy phase accelerates dendrite growth, especially when finely distributed.

         <title>The Rise of AIE&#8208;Peptide Systems: Design Principles, Multifunctional Applications, and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the synergistic fusion of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens and peptides for their transformative applications in sensing, bioimaging, and theranostics. It explores modular design strategies, assesses breakthroughs in bioapplications, and discusses challenges and future directions for enhancing AIE&#8208;peptide applications, aiming to inspire new research and development.








Abstract
Peptides exhibit exceptional potential in revolutionizing sensors, diagnostics, and therapeutics due to their multifunctionality, target specificity, self&#8208;assembly capacity, microenvironment responsiveness, and inherent biocompatibility. Nevertheless, conventional peptide nanomaterials are constrained by limitations in real&#8208;time monitoring and comprehensive disease management. Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) address the critical aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) problem of traditional fluorophores by demonstrating intensified fluorescence emission and amplified photodynamic/photothermal performance in aggregated states. The strategic coupling of AIEgens with peptides (AIE&#8208;peptide) creates a synergistic &#8220;1+1&gt;2&#8221; platform, enabling transformative applications in sensing, bioimaging, and theranostics. This review systematically evaluates innovative design strategies and emerging applications of AIE&#8208;peptide materials through molecular engineering perspectives. First, modular design principles are elucidated, followed by critical assessments of multidimensional breakthroughs in sensing, imaging, theranostics, and the synthesis of novel materials. Furthermore, current challenges and future directions for optimizing AIE&#8208;peptide architectures and translational implementations are comprehensively discussed. Given the nascent stage and rapid development of this field, continued progress is expected to address existing limitations and broaden practical implementations across diverse disciplines. This review aims to stimulate scientific discourse and inspire innovative frameworks for developing next&#8208;generation AIE&#8208;peptide materials with heightened biomedical efficacy and clinical impact.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Orbit&#8208;Driven Quarter Semimetals in Rhombohedral Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing proximate spin&#8208;orbit coupling into rhombohedral multilayer graphene gives rise to a novel quantum state, termed a quarter semimetal. This state enables the coexistence of fully spin&#8208;valley polarized electrons and holes, resulting in the emergence of both nonlinear Hall effect and a hysteretic anomalous Hall effect.








Abstract
Semimetals exhibit intriguing characteristics attributed to the coexistence of both electrons and holes. In rhombohedral multilayer graphene, a strong trigonal warping effect gives rise to a semi&#8208;metallic state near the Fermi surface, offering unique opportunities to explore the interplay of semi&#8208;metallic properties with strong correlations and topologies. Here, the observation of quarter semimetals in rhombohedral multilayer graphene by introducing spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC) is reported. The semi&#8208;metallic characteristics of rhombohedral graphene manifest as nearly vanished Hall resistance and parabolic longitudinal resistance. The strong correlations arising from the surface flat band lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking. SOC proximitized by WSe2 further lifts the valley degeneracy, resulting in the spontaneous time&#8208;reversal symmetry breaking, as evidenced by the hysteretic anomalous Hall effect. The coexistence of fully polarized electrons and holes allows for the observation of a nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the anomalous Hall resistance. Furthermore, the application of moderate magnetic fields induces a phase transition from quarter semimetals to Chern insulators. These findings establish rhombohedral multilayer graphene as an ideal platform for studying strong correlations and topologies in semimetals.

         <title>Highly Active IrOx Formation on Strontium Manganite for Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Balancing the reduction of iridium loading with improvements in activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) represents a key challenge. This work presents a synthesis approach for a low&#8208;Ir&#8208;content OER catalyst, where Mn incorporation combined with short&#8208;range ordering of IrOx confers high OER activity and durability.








Abstract
Iridium&#8208;based oxides are considered the most effective catalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their superior stability and high activity. However, the high Ir content required poses a significant barrier to their commercial application. Enhancing OER activity and durability while simultaneously reducing the Ir loading remains a significant challenge. Here, porous strontium manganate nanofibers are synthesized via electrospinning and the element leaching behavior is exploited during hydrothermal synthesis to load short&#8208;range ordered IrOx with high activity. In situ characterizations, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, confirm the structural stability of the short&#8208;range ordered IrOx during the OER process. Complementary theoretical calculations, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, and in situ synchrotron&#8208;radiation infrared spectroscopy reveal that Mn suppresses the lattice oxygen mechanism, enabling the catalyst to stabilize OER through the adsorbate evolution mechanism. The synthesized low&#8208;Ir&#8208;loading catalyst exhibits high OER activity (221&#160;mV overpotential at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and robust stability (&#8776;1000&#160;h).
