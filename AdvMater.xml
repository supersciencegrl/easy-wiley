         <title>Enhancing Light Outcoupling Efficiency via Anisotropic Low Refractive Index Electron Transporting Materials for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Thanks to the extensive efforts toward optimizing perovskite crystallization properties, high&#8208;quality perovskite films with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield have been successfully achieved. However, the light outcoupling efficiency of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is impeded by insufficient light extraction, which poses a challenge to the further advancement of PeLEDs. Here, an anisotropic multifunctional electron transporting material, 9,10&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl) anthracene (BPBiPA), with a low extraordinary refractive index (ne) and high electron mobility is developed for fabricating high&#8208;efficiency PeLEDs. The anisotropic molecular orientations of BPBiPA can result in a low ne of 1.59 along the z&#8208;axis direction. Optical simulations show that the low ne of BPBiPA can effectively mitigate the surface plasmon polariton loss and enhance the photon extraction efficiency in waveguide mode, thereby improving the light outcoupling efficiency of PeLEDs. Additionally, the high electron mobility of BPBiPA can facilitate balanced carrier injection in PeLEDs. As a result, high&#8208;efficiency green PeLEDs with a record external quantum efficiency of 32.1% and a current efficiency of 111.7&#160;cd A&#8722;1 are obtained, which provides new inspirations for the design of electron transporting materials for high&#8208;performance PeLEDs.

         <title>Moir&#233; Pattern Controlled Phonon Polarizer Based on Twisted Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Atomically twisted van der Waals materials featuring Moir&#233; patterns present new design possibilities and demonstrate unconventional behaviors in electrical, optical, spintronic, and superconducting properties. However, experimental exploration of thermal transport across Moir&#233; patterns has not been as extensive, despite its critical role in nanoelectronics, thermal management, and energy conversion. Here, we conduct the first experimental investigation into thermal transport across twisted graphene, demonstrating the concept of a phonon polarizer achieved by manipulating the rotational misalignment between adjacent stacked layers. Our approach includes thorough structural characterizations and atomistic modeling of various twisted graphene configurations, along with direct measurements of thermal and acoustic transport using ultrafast spectroscopies. For the first time, we have measured a significant modulation &#8211; up to 631% &#8211; in the thermal conductance of twisted graphene by reducing phonon transmissions as a function of Moir&#233; angles, while a high acoustic transmission maintains across all twist configurations. By comparing experiments with first&#8208;principles calculations using density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations, mode&#8208;dependent phonon transmission between monolayer graphene are quantified based on the angle alignment of phonon band structures. We investigate mode&#8208;specific phonon transmission and attribute the pronounced polarizing effect to the distortion over the coupling phase space especially from flexural phonon modes. The modeling results agree with experimental data, verifying the dominant tuning mechanisms in adjusting phonon transmission from high&#8208;frequency thermal modes while negligible effects on low&#8208;frequency acoustic modes near Brillouin zone center. This study offers crucial insights into the fundamental thermal transport in Moir&#233; structures, opening avenues for the invention of advanced thermal devices and new design methodologies based on manipulations of vibrational band structures and phonon spectra.

         <title>A Perspective on Uniform Plating Behavior of Mg Metal Anode: Diffusion Limited Theory versus Nucleation Theory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective points out the &#8220;Diffusion&#8208;Control Buffer Zone&#8221; between &#8220;Kinetic&#8208;Control Region&#8221; and &#8220;Diffusion&#8208;Control Region&#8221;, where the current density exceeds limited value, but time has not yet reached the Sand's time. In this buffer zone, dense and uniform Mg deposit layer is available, even the optimal deposit occurs in the vicinity of the boundary between &#8220;Diffusion&#8208;Control Buffer Zone&#8221; and &#8220;Diffusion&#8208;Control Region&#8221;.








Abstract
Utilizing metal anode is the most attractive way to meet the urgent demand for rechargeable batteries with high energy density. Unfortunately, the formation of dendrites, which is caused by uneven plating behavior, always threaten the safety of the batteries. To explore the origin of different plating behavior and predict the plating morphology of anode under a variety of operating conditions, multifarious models have been developed. However, abuse of models has led to conflictive views. In this perspective, to clarify the controversial reports on magnesium (Mg) metal plating behavior, the previously proposed models are elaborated that govern the plating process. Through linking various models and clarifying their boundary conditions, a scheme is drawn to illustrate the strategy for achieving the most dense and uniform plating morphology, which also explains the seemingly contradictory of diffusion limited theory and nucleation theory on uniform plating. This perspective will undoubtedly enhance the understanding on the metal anode plating process and provide meaningful guidance for the development of metal anode batteries.

         <title>Mechanical Properties of Conducting Printed Nanosheet Network Thin Films Under Uniaxial Compression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Printed thin film nanosheet networks show remarkable promise for a range of electrical applications. Their conductivity relies heavily on their morphology, which may be altered via compression. This work provides the first exploration of the compressive properties of printed networks of graphene and MoS2 to explore properties of elastic modulus, plastic yield, viscoelasticity, tensile failure, and sheet bending versus slippage.








Abstract
Thin film networks of solution processed nanosheets show remarkable promise for use in a broad range of applications including strain sensors, energy storage, printed devices, textile electronics, and more. While it is known that their electronic properties rely heavily on their morphology, little is known of their mechanical nature, a glaring omission given the effect mechanical deformation has on the morphology of porous systems and the promise of mechanical post processing for tailored properties. Here, this work employs a recent advance in thin film mechanical testing called the Layer Compression Test to perform the first in situ analysis of printed nanosheet network compression. Due to the well&#8208;defined deformation geometry of this unique test, this work is able to explore the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane elastic, plastic, and creep deformation in these systems, extracting properties of elastic modulus, plastic yield, viscoelasticity, tensile failure and sheet bending vs. slippage under both out of plane uniaxial compression and tension. This work characterizes these for a range of networks of differing porosities and sheet sizes, for low and high compression, as well as the effect of chemical cross linking. This work explores graphene and MoS2 networks, from which the results can be extended to printed nanosheet networks as a whole.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Surface Engineered Cyanine Nanodots for Active Transport of Therapeutic Antibodies into Solid Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput fluorescent screening of a library of single&#8208;molecule Cy5 nanodots reveals that the nanoparticle&#8208;inducing cell transcytosis is highly related to the particles' surface structures and varies significantly with cell lines. The selected Cy5 nanodots with high transcytosis&#8208;inducing capability (G5&#8208;R) can carry &#945;PD&#8208;L1 to penetrate deep into&#160;solid tumor and generates potent antitumor activity through immune checkpoint blockade therapy.








Abstract
The successful delivery of therapeutic biomacromolecules into solid tumor&#160;holds great challenge due to their high resistance to penetrate through the complex tumor microenvironments. Here, active&#8208;transporting nanoparticles are harnessed to efficiently deliver biomacromolecular drugs into solid tumors through cell transcytosis. A series of molecularly precise cyanine 5&#8208;cored polylysine G5 dendrimers (Cy5 nanodots) with different peripheral amino acids (G5&#8208;AA) is prepared. The capability of these positively charged nanodots to induce cell endocytosis, exocytosis, and transcytosis is evaluated via fluorescence&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput screen. The optimized nanodots (G5&#8208;R) are conjugated with &#945;PD&#8208;L1 (a therapeutic monoclonal antibody binding to programmed&#8208;death ligand 1) (&#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R) to demonstrate the nanoparticle&#8208;mediated tumor active transport. The &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R can greatly enhance the tumor&#8208;penetration capability through adsorption&#8208;mediated transcytosis (AMT).

     alt="High-Throughput Screening of Surface Engineered Cyanine Nanodots for Active Transport of Therapeutic Antibodies into Solid Tumor"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-throughput fluorescent screening of a library of single-molecule Cy5 nanodots reveals that the nanoparticle-inducing cell transcytosis is highly related to the particles' surface structures and varies significantly with cell lines. The selected Cy5 nanodots with high transcytosis-inducing capability (G5-R) can carry &#945;PD-L1 to penetrate deep into&#160;solid tumor and generates potent antitumor activity through immune checkpoint blockade therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The successful delivery of therapeutic biomacromolecules into solid tumor&#160;holds great challenge due to their high resistance to penetrate through the complex tumor microenvironments. Here, active-transporting nanoparticles are harnessed to efficiently deliver biomacromolecular drugs into solid tumors through cell transcytosis. A series of molecularly precise cyanine 5-cored polylysine G5 dendrimers (Cy5 nanodots) with different peripheral amino acids (G5-AA) is prepared. The capability of these positively charged nanodots to induce cell endocytosis, exocytosis, and transcytosis is evaluated via fluorescence-based high-throughput screen. The optimized nanodots (G5-R) are conjugated with &#945;PD-L1 (a therapeutic monoclonal antibody binding to programmed-death ligand 1) (&#945;PD-L1-G5-R) to demonstrate the nanoparticle-mediated tumor active transport. The &#945;PD-L1-G5-R can greatly enhance the tumor-penetration capability through adsorption-mediated transcytosis (AMT). The effectiveness of &#945;PD-L1-G5-R is tested in treating mice bearing partially resected CT26 tumors, mimicking the local immunotherapy of residual tumors post-surgery in clinic. The &#945;PD-L1-G5-R embedded in fibrin gel can efficiently mediate tumor cell transcytosis, and deliver &#945;PD-L1 throughout the tumor, thereby enhancing immune checkpoint blockade, reducing tumor recurrence, and significantly prolonging the survival time.

         <title>Ultraconfined Plasmons in Atomically Thin Crystalline Silver Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin crystalline silver structures of &lt;3 nm in thickness are fabricated by lighographically prepatterning a silicon wafer and subsequently depositing a few atomic layers of metal under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The method has great flexibility regarding the size and morphology of the structures, which are demonstrated to sustain plasmon resonances with quality factors as high as ten.








Abstract
The ability to confine light down to atomic scales is critical for the development of applications in optoelectronics and optical sensing as well as for the exploration of nanoscale quantum phenomena. Plasmons in metallic nanostructures with just a few atomic layers in thickness can achieve this type of confinement, although fabrication imperfections down to the subnanometer scale hinder actual developments. Here, narrow plasmons are demonstrated in atomically thin crystalline silver nanostructures fabricated by prepatterning silicon substrates and epitaxially depositing silver films of just a few atomic layers in thickness. Specifically, a silicon wafer is lithographically patterned to introduce on&#8208;demand lateral shapes, chemically process the sample to obtain an atomically flat silicon surface, and epitaxially deposit silver to obtain ultrathin crystalline metal films with the designated morphologies. Structures fabricated by following this procedure allow for an unprecedented control over optical field confinement in the near&#8208;infrared spectral region, which is here illustrated by the observation of fundamental and higher&#8208;order plasmons featuring extreme spatial confinement and high&#8208;quality factors that reflect the crystallinity of the metal. The present study constitutes a&#160;substantial improvement in the degree of spatial confinement and quality factor that should facilitate the design and exploitation of atomic&#8208;scale nanoplasmonic devices for optoelectronics, sensing, and quantum&#8208;physics&#160;applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Perception of Object's Deformability with Multiple Deformation Attributes Utilizing Biomimetic Mechanoreceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tactile sensor, which integrates biomimetic slow&#8208;adapting mechanoreceptors in a soft medium, enables self&#8208;decoupled sensing of local pressure and strain at the contact surface. In robotic manipulation, the sensor can achieve the self&#8208;adaptive perception of material softness and enhance tactile perception by establishing two relevant deformation attributes (material softness and compliance) for an object.








Abstract
The perception of object's deformability in unstructured interactions relies on both kinesthetic and cutaneous cues to adapt the uncertainties of an object. However, the existing tactile sensors cannot provide adequate cutaneous cues to self&#8208;adaptively estimate the material softness, especially in non&#8208;standard contact scenarios where the interacting object deviates from the assumption of an elastic half&#8208;infinite body. This paper proposes an innovative design of a tactile sensor that integrates the capabilities of two slow&#8208;adapting mechanoreceptors within a soft medium, allowing self&#8208;decoupled sensing of local pressure and strain at specific locations within the contact interface. By leveraging these localized cutaneous cues, the sensor can accurately and self&#8208;adaptively measure the material softness of an object, accommodating variations in thicknesses and applied forces. Furthermore, when combined with a kinesthetic cue from the robot, the sensor can enhance tactile expression by the synergy of two relevant deformation attributes, including material softness and compliance.&#160;It is demonstrated that the biomimetic fusion of tactile information can fully comprehend the deformability of an object, hence facilitating robotic decision&#8208;making and dexterous manipulation.

         <title>Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics Utilizing Intrinsic Charge Generation in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) can generate charges without a donor&#8211;acceptor interface. This is shown using transient absorption measurements and confirmed using computational methods. A small amount of donor material significantly enhances exciton splitting into free charges, resulting in well&#8208;performing donor&#8208;dilute OPVs. Semitransparent OPV modules with 2.2% light utilization efficiency are achieved by employing the optimized donor&#8208;dilute device concept.








Abstract
In organic semiconductors, a donor/acceptor heterojunction is typically required for efficient dissociation of excitons. Using transient absorption spectroscopy to study the dynamics of excited states in non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), it is shown that NFAs can generate charges without a donor/acceptor interface. This is due to the fact that dielectric solvation provides a driving force sufficient to dissociate the excited state and form the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state. The CT state is further dissociated into free charges at interfaces between polycrystalline regions in neat NFAs. For IEICO&#8208;4F, incorporating just 9 wt% donor polymer PTB7&#8208;Th in neat films greatly boosts charge generation, enhancing efficient exciton separation into free charges. This property is utilized to fabricate donor&#8208;dilute organic photovoltaics (OPV) delivering a power conversion efficiency of 8.3% in the case of opaque devices with a metal top&#8208;electrode and an active layer average visible transmittance (AVT) of 75%. It is shown that the intrinsic charge generation in low&#8208;bandgap NFAs contributes to the overall photocurrent generation. IEICO&#8208;4F&#8208;based OPVs with limited PTB7&#8208;Th content have high thermal resilience demonstrating little drop in performance over 700&#160;h. PTB7&#8208;Th:IEICO&#8208;4F semitransparent OPVs are leveraged to fabricate an 8&#8208;series connected semitransparent module, demonstrating light&#8208;utilization efficiency of 2.2% alongside an AVT of 63%.

         <title>In Situ Engineering of Inorganic&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphases via Anion Choice Enables Stable, Lithium Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrahydrofuran&#8208;based electrolyte systems have demonstrated success in enabling high&#8208;stability lithium anodes by encouraging the decomposition of anions (instead of organic solvent) and thus generating inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). By employing a variety of different lithium salts (i.e., LiPF6, LiTFSI, LiFSI, and LiDFOB), it is demonstrated that electrolyte anions can improve the inorganic composition and resulting properties of the SEI.








Abstract
The discovery of liquid battery electrolytes that facilitate the formation of stable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) to mitigate dendrite formation is imperative to enable lithium anodes in next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;dense batteries. Compared to traditional electrolyte solvents, tetrahydrofuran (THF)&#8208;based electrolyte systems have demonstrated great success in enabling high&#8208;stability lithium anodes by encouraging the decomposition of anions (instead of organic solvent) and thus generating inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs. Herein, by employing a variety of different lithium salts (i.e., LiPF6, LiTFSI, LiFSI, and LiDFOB),&#160;it is&#160;demonstrated that electrolyte anions modulate the inorganic composition and resulting properties of the SEI. Through novel analytical time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry&#160;methods, such as hierarchical clustering of depth profiles and compositional analysis using integrated yields,&#160;the chemical composition and morphology of the SEIs generated from each electrolyte system are examined. Notably, the LiDFOB electrolyte provides an exceptionally stable system to enable lithium anodes, delivering &gt;1500 cycles at a current density of 0.5 mAh g&#8722;1 and a capacity of 0.5 mAh g&#8722;1 in symmetrical cells. Furthermore, Li//LFP cells using this electrolyte demonstrate high&#8208;rate, reversible lithium storage, supplying 139 mAh g(LFP)&#8722;1 at C/2 (&#8776;0.991 mAh cm&#8722;2, @ 0.61 mA cm&#8722;2) with 87.5% capacity retention over 300 cycles (average Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.86%).

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of liquid battery electrolytes that facilitate the formation of stable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) to mitigate dendrite formation is imperative to enable lithium anodes in next-generation energy-dense batteries. Compared to traditional electrolyte solvents, tetrahydrofuran (THF)-based electrolyte systems have demonstrated great success in enabling high-stability lithium anodes by encouraging the decomposition of anions (instead of organic solvent) and thus generating inorganic-rich SEIs. Herein, by employing a variety of different lithium salts (i.e., LiPF&lt;sub&gt;6,&lt;/sub&gt; LiTFSI, LiFSI, and LiDFOB),&#160;it is&#160;demonstrated that electrolyte anions modulate the inorganic composition and resulting properties of the SEI. Through novel analytical time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry&#160;methods, such as hierarchical clustering of depth profiles and compositional analysis using integrated yields,&#160;the chemical composition and morphology of the SEIs generated from each electrolyte system are examined. Notably, the LiDFOB electrolyte provides an exceptionally stable system to enable lithium anodes, delivering &amp;gt;1500 cycles at a current density of 0.5 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a capacity of 0.5 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in symmetrical cells. Furthermore, Li//LFP cells using this electrolyte demonstrate high-rate, reversible lithium storage, supplying 139 mAh g&lt;sub&gt;(LFP)&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at C/2 (&#8776;0.991 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, @ 0.61 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) with 87.5% capacity retention over 300 cycles (average Coulombic efficiency &amp;gt;99.86%).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Retarding Ion Migration for Stable Blade&#8208;Coated Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional molecule, p&#8208;aminobenzoic acid (PABA), increases ion migration barrier, induces (100) facet perovskite grain growth, and yields defect&#8208;reduced, homogeneous films. The blade&#8208;coated PABA&#8208;based inverted PSC achieves an impressive PCE of 23.32% and maintains 93.8% of its initial efficiency after 1000 hours under 1&#8208;sun illumination at 75 &#176;C and 10% relative humidity.








Abstract
The fabrication of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) through blade coating is seen as one of the most viable paths toward commercialization. However, relative to the less scalable spin coating method, the blade coating process often results in more defective perovskite films with lower grain uniformity. Ion migration, facilitated by those elevated defect levels, is one of the main triggers of phase segregation and device instability. Here, a bifunctional molecule, p&#8208;aminobenzoic acid (PABA), which enhances the barrier to ion migration, induces grain growth along the (100) facet, and promotes the formation of homogeneous perovskite films with fewer defects, is reported. As a result, PSCs with PABA achieved impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 23.32% and 22.23% for devices with active areas of 0.1 cm2 and 1 cm2, respectively. Furthermore, these devices maintain 93.8% of their initial efficiencies after 1&#160;000 h under 1&#8208;sun illumination, 75 &#176;C, and 10% relative humidity conditions.

         <title>Rejuvenating Aged Bone Repair through Multihierarchy Reactive Oxygen Species&#8208;Regulated Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multihierarchy reactive oxygen species regulated system, PEGS&#8208;PGA/SeSe/Rapa hydrogel (PSeR) for aged bone regeneration can effectively delay senescence and restore the regenerative function of senescent BMSCs by maintaining the levels of ROS intracellularly and extracellularly. Additionally, the PSeR hydrogel can be injected and rapidly crosslinked in the site of bone defects, presenting a novel therapeutic strategy for addressing age&#8208;related bone injuries.








Abstract
Aging exacerbates the dysfunction of tissue regeneration at multiple levels and gradually diminishes individual's capacity to withstand stress, damage, and disease. The excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered a hallmark feature of senescent stem cells, which causes oxidative stress, deteriorates the host microenvironment, and eventually becomes a critical obstacle for aged bone defect repair. Till now, the strategies cannot synchronously and thoroughly regulate intracellular and extracellular ROS in senescent cells. Herein, a multihierarchy ROS scavenging system for aged bone regeneration is developed by fabricating an injectable PEGylated poly(glycerol sebacate) (PEGS&#8208;NH2)/poly(&#947;&#8208;glutamic acid) (&#947;&#8208;PGA) hydrogel containing rapamycin&#8208;loaded poly(diselenide&#8208;carbonate) nanomicelles (PSeR). This PSeR hydrogel exhibits highly sensitive ROS responsiveness to the local aged microenvironment and dynamically releases drug&#8208;loaded nanomicelles to scavenge the intracellular ROS accumulated in senescent bone mesenchymal stem cells. The PSeR hydrogel effectively tunes the antioxidant function and delays senescence of bone mesenchymal stem cells by safeguarding DNA replication in an oxidative environment, thereby promoting the self&#8208;renewal ability and enhancing the osteogenic capacity for aged bone repair in vitro and in vivo. Thus, this multihierarchy ROS&#8208;regulated hydrogel provides a new strategy for treating degenerative diseases.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Nanorobot&#8208;Based Marsupial Robotic System for Intracranial Cross&#8208;Scale Targeting Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A marsupial robotic system combining a continuum robot (mother robot) with nanorobots (child robots) is developed for cross&#8208;scale targeting drug delivery. The robotic system improves the targeting rate and therapeutic efficacy in brain tumor treatment with the hierarchical targeting strategy spanning targeting scale from centimeters to nanometers.








Abstract
Nanorobots capable of active movement are an exciting technology for targeted therapeutic intervention. However, the extensive motion range and hindrance of the blood&#8211;brain barrier impeded their clinical translation in glioblastoma therapy. Here, a marsupial robotic system constructed by integrating chemical/magnetic hybrid nanorobots (child robots) with a miniature magnetic continuum robot (mother robot) for intracranial cross&#8208;scale targeting drug delivery is reported. For primary targeting on macroscale, the continuum robot enters the cranial cavity through a minimally invasive channel (e.g., Ommaya device) in the skull and transports the nanorobots to pathogenic regions. Upon circumventing the blood&#8211;brain barrier, the released nanorobots perform secondary targeting on microscale to further enhance the spatial resolution of drug delivery. In vitro experiments against primary glioblastoma cells derived from different patients are conducted for personalized treatment guidance. The operation feasibility within organisms is shown in ex vivo swine brain experiments. The biosafety of the treatment system is suggested in in vivo experiments. Owing to the hierarchical targeting method, the targeting rate, targeting accuracy, and treatment efficacy have improved greatly. The marsupial robotic system offers a novel intracranial local therapeutic strategy and constitutes a key milestone in the development of glioblastoma treatment platforms.

         <title>Water&#8208;Mediated Selectivity Control of CH3OH versus CO/CH4 in CO2 Photoreduction on Single&#8208;Atom Implanted Nanotube Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;TiO2/SrTiO3 nanotube arrays are constructed with both Fe single atom reduction centers and dominant oxidation facets (001) for efficiently driving CO2 photoreduction and water oxidation. The amount of water can be facilely adjusted to selectively control CH3OH production from &#8776;0% (above H2O) to 98.90% (in H2O) via slowly immersing the catalyst into water.








Abstract
Controllable methanol production in artificial photosynthesis is highly desirable due to its high energy density and ease of storage. Herein, single atom Fe is implanted into TiO2/SrTiO3 (TSr) nanotube arrays by two&#8208;step anodization and Sr&#8208;induced crystallization. The resulting Fe&#8208;TSr with both single Fe reduction centers and dominant oxidation facets (001) contributes to efficient CO2 photoreduction and water oxidation for controlled production of CH3OH and CO/CH4. The methanol yield can reach to 154.20&#160;&#181;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 98.90% selectivity by immersing all the catalyst in pure water, and the yield of CO/CH4 is 147.48&#160;&#181;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with &gt;99.99% selectivity when the catalyst completely outside water. This CH3OH yield is 50 and 3 times higher than that of TiO2 and TSr and stands among all the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. The facile gas&#8211;solid and gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid&#160;phase switch can selectively control CH3OH production from &#8776;0% (above H2O) to 98.90% (in H2O) via slowly immersing the catalyst into water, where abundant &#8226;OH and H2O around Fe sites play important role in selective CH3OH production. This work highlights a new insight for water&#8208;mediated CO2 photoreduction to controllably produce CH3OH.

The facile gas&#8211;solid and gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid&#160;phase switch can selectively control CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH production from &#8776;0% (above H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) to 98.90% (in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) via slowly immersing the catalyst into water, where abundant &#8226;OH and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O around Fe sites play important role in selective CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH production. This work highlights a new insight for water-mediated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction to controllably produce CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dendrite&#8208;Free and High&#8208;Rate Potassium Metal Batteries Sustained by an Inorganic&#8208;Rich SEI</title>

A 3D porous Al current collector decorated with N&#8208;doped graphene affording electronic structure modulation, giving rise to an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI architecture to expedite ion transport and guide dendrite&#8208;free potassium deposition.








Abstract
Potassium metal battery is an appealing candidate for future energy storage. However, its application is plagued by the notorious dendrite proliferation at the anode side, which entails the formation of vulnerable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and non&#8208;uniform potassium deposition on the current collector. Here, this work reports a dual&#8208;modification design of aluminum current collector to render dendrite&#8208;free potassium anodes with favorable reversibility. This work achieves to modulate the electronic structure of the designed current collector and accordingly attain an SEI architecture with robust inorganic&#8208;rich constituents, which is evidenced by detailed cryo&#8208;EM inspection and X&#8208;ray depth profiling. The thus&#8208;produced SEI manages to expedite ionic conductivity and guide homogeneous potassium deposition. Compared to the potassium metal cells assembled using typical aluminum current collector, cells based on the designed current collector realize improved rate capability (maintaining 400&#160;h under 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and low&#8208;temperature durability (stable operation at &#8722;50 &#176;C). Moreover, scalable production of the current collector allows for the sustainable construction of high&#8208;safety potassium metal batteries, with the potential for reducing the manufacturing cost.

         <title>Intelligent Size&#8208;Switchable Iron Carbide&#8208;Based Nanocapsules with Cascade Delivery Capacity for Hyperthermia&#8208;Enhanced Deep Tumor Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Killing tumor cells in deep tumor regions with ferroptosis agents is still challenging because of distinct size requirements for intratumoral accumulation and deep tumor penetration. This study presents an intelligent formulation based on iron carbide for achieving deep tumor ferroptosis through size&#8208;switchable cascade delivery, thereby advancing the comprehension of ferroptosis in the context of tumor theranostics.








Abstract
The ferroptosis pathway is recognized as an essential strategy for tumor treatment. However, killing tumor cells in deep tumor regions with ferroptosis agents is still challenging because of distinct size requirements for intratumoral accumulation and deep tumor penetration. Herein, intelligent nanocapsules with size&#8208;switchable capability that responds to acid/hyperthermia stimulation to achieve deep tumor ferroptosis are developed. These nanocapsules are constructed using poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic) acid and Pluronic F127 as carrier materials, with Au&#8211;Fe2C Janus nanoparticles serving as photothermal and ferroptosis agents, and sorafenib (SRF) as the ferroptosis enhancer. The PFP@Au&#8211;Fe2C&#8211;SRF nanocapsules, designed with an appropriate size, exhibit superior intratumoral accumulation compared to free Au&#8211;Fe2C nanoparticles, as evidenced by photoacoustic and magnetic resonance imaging. These nanocapsules can degrade within the acidic tumor microenvironment when subjected to laser irradiation, releasing free Au&#8211;Fe2C nanoparticles. This enables them to penetrate deep into tumor regions and disrupt intracellular redox balance. Under the guidance of imaging, these PFP@Au&#8211;Fe2C&#8211;SRF nanocapsules effectively inhibit tumor growth when exposed to laser irradiation, capitalizing on the synergistic photothermal and ferroptosis effects. This study presents an intelligent formulation based on iron carbide for achieving deep tumor ferroptosis through size&#8208;switchable cascade delivery, thereby advancing the comprehension of ferroptosis in the context of tumor theranostics.

         <title>Functionalized MXene Films with Substantially Improved Low&#8208;Voltage Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simple tetrabutylammonium (TBA)&#8208;functionalization of MXene improves the in&#8208;plane actuation strain over three times and enhances the mechanical property and stability in air. In situ and ex situ characterizations reveal that the co&#8208;insertion/de&#8208;insertion of TBA ions with Li ions into/from MXene interlayer galleries and inter&#8208;edge gaps&#160;causes a large in&#8208;plane sliding of MXene sheets under negative/positive polarizations.








Abstract
Ti3C2Tx MXene film is promising for low&#8208;voltage electrochemical actuators (ECAs) due to its excellent electrical conductivity, volumetric capacitance, and mechanical properties. However, its in&#8208;plane actuation is limited to little intralayer strain of MXene sheets under polarization. Here it is demonstrated that a simple tetrabutylammonium (TBA) functionalization of MXene improves the in&#8208;plane actuation strain by 337% and also enhances the mechanical property and stability in air and the electrolyte. Various in situ characterizations reveal that the improved actuation is ascribed to the co&#8208;insertion/desertion of TBA and Li ions into/from MXene interlayer galleries and inter&#8208;edge gaps that causes a large in&#8208;plane sliding of MXene sheets under negative/positive polarizations. The assembled bending actuator has a high strength and modulus and generates a peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak strain difference of 0.771% and a blocking force up to 51.5 times its own weight under 1&#160;V. The designed soft robotic tweezer can grasp an object under 1&#160;V and hold it firmly under 0&#160;V. The novel sheet sliding mechanism resembling the filament sliding theory in skeletal muscles may inspire the design of high&#8208;performance actuators with other nanomaterials.

         <title>Mid&#8208;IR Light&#8208;Activatable Full Spectrum LaB6 Plasmonic Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasmonic LaB6 photocatalyst can be excited by mid&#8208;IR (3900 nm) light and thermal radiation from hot/warm objects to generate reactive oxygen species and exert photodegradation of organic pollutants, as well as disinfection of multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria.








Abstract
Photocatalysts as long&#8208;lasting, benign reagents for disinfection of bacteria in hospitals and public areas/facilities/transportation vehicles are strongly needed. A common limitation for all existing semiconductor photocatalysts is the requirement of activation by external UV&#8211;vis&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light with wavelengths shorter than &#8776;1265 nm. None of the existing photocatalysts can function during nighttime in the absence of external light. Herein, an unprecedented LaB6 plasmonic photocatalyst is reported, which can absorb UV&#8211;vis&#8208;NIR light and mid&#8208;IR (3900 nm) light to split water and generate hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals for the decomposition of organic pollutants, as well as kill multidrug&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli bacteria. Mid&#8208;IR light (&#8776;2&#8211;50 &#181;m) is readily available from the natural environments via thermal radiation of warm/hot objects on the earth including human bodies, animals, furnances,&#160;hot/warm electrical devices, and buildings.

         <title>Deformation&#8208;Induced Photoprogrammable Pattern of Polyurethane Elastomers Based on Poisson Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward yet powerful strategy to fabricate micropatterns with high aspect ratio on polyurethane elastomers is developed by spatially regulating the photodimerization and the distribution of internal stress. This technology integrates the characteristics of top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up methods, providing a versatile basis for applications in stretchable strain sensors, anticounterfeiting devices, and functional systems.








Abstract
Elastomers with high aspect ratio surface patterns are a promising class of materials for designing soft machines in the future. Here, a facile method for fabricating surface patterns on polyurethane elastomer by subtly utilizing the Poisson effect and gradient photocrosslinking is demonstrated. By applying uniaxial tensile strains, the aspect ratio of the surface patterns can be optionally manipulated. At prestretched state, the pattern on the polyurethane elastomer can be readily constructed through compressive stress, resulting from the gradient photocrosslinking via selective photodimerization of an anthracene&#8208;functionalized polyurethane elastomer (referred to as ANPU). The macromolecular aggregation structures during stretching deformation significantly contribute to the fabrication of high aspect ratio surface patterns. The insightful finite element analysis well demonstrates that the magnitude and distribution of internal stress in the ANPU elastomer can be regulated by selectively gradient crosslinking, leading to polymer chains migrate from the exposed region to the unexposed region, thereby generating a diverse array of surface patterns. Additionally, the periodic surface patterns exhibit tunable structural color according to the different stretching states and are fully reversible over multiple cycles, opening up avenues for diverse applications such as smart displays, stretchable strain sensors, and anticounterfeiting devices.

         <title>Self&#8208;Standing Metal Foam Catalysts for Cathodic Electro&#8208;Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops leaded foam&#8208;type electrodes through the dynamic hydrogen bubble template (DHBT) method and tests them in electro&#8208;organic reductions using an oxime to nitrile transformation for synthesis of fine chemicals. All developed catalysts outperformed both Pb and CuSn7Pb15 in terms of chemical yields and energy efficiency. The latter material is deemed the best replacement for Pb in reductive organo&#8208;electrosynthesis.








Abstract
Although electro&#8208;organic synthesis is currently receiving renewed interest because of its potential to enable sustainability in chemical processes to value&#8208;added products, challenges in process development persist: For reductive transformations performed in protic media, an inherent issue is the limited choice of metallic cathode materials that can effectively suppress the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) while maintaining a high activity toward the targeted electro&#8208;organic reaction. Current development trends are aimed at avoiding the previously used HER&#8208;suppressing elements (Cd, Hg, and Pb) because of their toxicity. Here, this work reports the rational design of highly porous foam&#8208;type binary and ternary electrocatalysts with reduced Pb content. Optimized cathodes are tested in electro&#8208;organic reductions using an oxime to nitrile transformation as a model reaction relevant for the synthesis of fine chemicals. Their electrocatalytic performance is compared with that of the model CuSn7Pb15 bronze alloy that has recently been endorsed as the best cathode replacement for bare Pb electrodes. All developed metal foam catalysts outperform both bare Pb and the CuSn7Pb15 benchmark in terms of chemical yield and energetic efficiency. Moreover, post&#8208;electrolysis analysis of the crude electrolyte mixture and the cathode's surfaces through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively, reveal the foam catalysts&#8217; elevated resistance to cathodic corrosion.

         <title>Rejoint of Carbon Nitride Fragments into Multi&#8208;Interfacial Order&#8208;Disorder Homojunction for Robust Photo&#8208;Driven Generation of H2O2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a directed healing process is employed to splice carbon nitride pieces into a carbon nitride homojunction with multiple order&#8208;disorder interfaces. The resultant catalyst exhibits boosted charge dynamics and more spatially and orderly separated redox centers, resulting in a remarkable yield, an excellent selectivity, and a prominent solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency in photosynthesis of H2O2.








Abstract
Photocatalytic technology based on carbon nitride (C3N4) offers a sustainable and clean approach for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, but the yield is severely limited by the sluggish hot carriers due to the weak internal electric field. In this study, a novel approach is devised by fragmenting bulk C3N4&#160;into smaller pieces (CN&#8208;NH4) and then subjecting it to a directed healing process to create multiple order&#8208;disorder interfaces (CN&#8208;NH4&#8208;NaK).&#160;The resulting junctions in CN&#8208;NH4&#8208;NaK significantly boost charge dynamics and facilitate more spatially and orderly separated redox centers. As a result, CN&#8208;NH4&#8208;NaK demonstrates outstanding photosynthesis of H2O2 via both two&#8208;step single&#8208;electron and one&#8208;step double&#8208;electron oxygen reduction pathways, achieving a remarkable yield of 16675&#160;&#181;mol h&#8211;1&#160;g&#8211;1, excellent selectivity (&gt;&#160;91%), and a prominent solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency exceeding 2.3%. These remarkable results surpass pristine C3N4 by 158 times and outperform previously reported C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work represents a significant advancement in catalyst design and modification technology, inspiring the development of more efficient metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for the synthesis of highly valued fuels.

         <title>A Soft, Adhesive Self&#8208;Healing Naked&#8208;Eye Strain/Stress Visualization Patch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel naked&#8208;eye strain/stress visualization (NSV) patch is developed based on a bio&#8208;inspired force&#8208;responsive hydrogel. Reversible generation of light scattering mechano&#8208;iridophore is regulated by local deformations, serving as the sensing mechanism. NSV patches feature fast response, high resolution, wide dynamic range, great adhesiveness, and self&#8208;healing material capability. Their optical output can be directly read by naked eyes or smartphone apps.








Abstract
Learning about the strain/stress distribution in a material is essential to achieve its mechanical stability and proper functionality. Conventional techniques such as universal testing machines only apply to static samples with standardized geometry in laboratory environment. Soft mechanical sensors based on stretchable conductors, carbon&#8208;filled composites, or conductive gels possess better adaptability, but still face challenges from complicated fabrication process, dependence on extra readout device, and limited strain/stress mapping ability. Inspired by the camouflage mechanism of cuttlefish and chameleons, here an innovative responsive hydrogel containing light&#8208;scattering &#8220;mechano&#8208;iridophores&#8221; is developed. Force induced reversible phase separation manipulates the dynamic generation of mechano&#8208;iridophores, serving as optical indicators of local deformation. Patch&#8208;shaped mechanical sensors made from the responsive hydrogel feature fast response time (&lt;0.4 s), high spatial resolution (&#8776;100&#160;&#181;m), and wide dynamic ranges (e.g., 10&#8211;150% strain). The intrinsic adhesiveness and self&#8208;healing material capability of sensing patches also ensure their excellent applicability and robustness. This combination of chemical and optical properties allows strain/stress distributions in target samples to be directly identified by naked eyes or smartphone apps, which is not yet achieved. The great advantages above are ideal for developing the next&#8208;generation mechanical sensors toward material studies, damage diagnosis, risk prediction, and smart devices.

         <title>Crystallization Control Based on the Regulation of Solvent&#8211;Perovskite Coordination for High&#8208;Performance Ambient Printable FAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A weak coordination solvent strategy is developed to tailor solvent&#8211;perovskite coordination. This strategy promotes the direct crystallization from sol&#8211;gel phases to &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3),&#160;leads to more balanced nucleation&#8211;growth kinetics, and restrains the formation of defects and microstrains in situ. The corresponding ambient&#8208;printed FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24%.

The critical requirement for ambient&#8208;printed formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) lies in the control of nucleation&#8211;growth kinetics and defect formation behavior, which are extensively influenced by interactions between the solvent and perovskite. Here, a strategy is developed that combines a cosolvent and an additive to efficiently tailor the coordination between the solvent and perovskite. Through in situ characterizations, the direct crystallization from the sol&#8211;gel phase to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 is illustrated. When the solvent exhibits strong interactions with the perovskite, the sol&#8211;gel phases cannot effectively transform into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, resulting in a lower nucleation rate and confined crystal growth directions. Consequently, it becomes challenging to fabricate high&#8208;quality void&#8208;free perovskite films. Conversely, weaker solvent&#8211;perovskite coordination promotes direct crystallization from sol&#8211;gel phases to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. This process exhibits more balanced nucleation&#8211;growth kinetics and restrains the formation of defects and microstrains in situ. This strategy leads to improved structural and optoelectronic properties within the FAPbI3 films, characterized by more compact grain stacking, smoother surface morphology, released lattice strain, and fewer defects. The ambient&#8208;printed FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells fabricated using this strategy exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24%, with significantly reduced efficiency deviation and negligible decreases in the stabilized output.

&lt;p&gt;A weak coordination solvent strategy is developed to tailor solvent&#8211;perovskite coordination. This strategy promotes the direct crystallization from sol&#8211;gel phases to &#945;-formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;),&#160;leads to more balanced nucleation&#8211;growth kinetics, and restrains the formation of defects and microstrains in situ.

         <title>Industrial Kraft Lignin Based Binary Cathode Interface Layer Enables Enhanced Stability in High Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces industrial solvent fractionated LignoBoost kraft lignin (KL) in highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) by binary cathode interface layer (CIL) strategy, which can significantly improve the stability of both binary and ternary photoactive layer (PAL) OSC, owing to the passivation of diffusion and reaction between bathocuproine (BCP) and nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). The results combine sustainable wood&#8208;based material with classic interface materials in advance NFA&#8208;OSCs.








Abstract
Herein, a binary cathode interface layer (CIL) strategy based on the industrial solvent fractionated LignoBoost kraft lignin (KL) is adopted for fabrication of organic solar cells (OSCs). The uniformly distributed phenol moieties in KL enable it to easily form hydrogen bonds with commonly used CIL materials, i.e., bathocuproine (BCP) and PFN&#8208;Br, resulting in binary CILs with tunable work function (WF). This work shows that the binary CILs work well in OSCs with large KL ratio compatibility, exhibiting equivalent or even higher efficiency to the traditional CILs in state of art OSCs. In addition, the combination of KL and BCP significantly enhanced OSC stability, owing to KL blocking the reaction between BCP and nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). This work provides a simple and effective way to achieve high&#8208;efficient OSCs with better stability and sustainability by using wood&#8208;based materials.

         <title>A Generic Strategy to Stabilize Wide Bandgap Perovskites for Efficient Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key cause of phase segregation in WBG perovskites is identified as residual PbI2 at the interface, creating electrical potential variations between domain surfaces and boundaries, inducing ion migration and subsequent phase segregation. Applying a surface reaction strategy to eliminate surface PbI2 residue enhances bandgap stability and mitigates photovoltage deficits in complete devices.








Abstract
Efficient wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are essential for fully maximizing the potential of tandem solar cells. However, these cells currently face challenges such as high photovoltage losses and the presence of phase segregation, which impede the attainment of their expected efficiency and stability. Herein, the root cause of halide segregation is investigated, uncovering a close association with the presence of locally aggregated lead iodide (PbI2), particularly at the perovskite/C60 interface. Kelvin&#8208;probe atomic force microscopy results indicate that the remaining PbI2 at the interface leads to potential electrical differences between the domain surface and boundaries, which drives the formation of halide segregation. By reacting the surface PbI2 residue with ethanediamine dihydroiodide (EDAI2) at proper temperature, it is possible to effectively mitigate the phase segregation. By applying this surface reaction strategy in WBG inverted cells, a notable improvement of &#8776;100&#160;mV is achieved in photovoltage over a wide range of WBG cells (1.67&#8211;1.78&#160;eV), resulting in a champion efficiency of 23.1% (certified 22.95%) for 1.67&#160;eV cells and 19.7% (certified 18.81%) for 1.75&#160;eV cells. Furthermore, efficiency of 26.1% is demonstrated in a monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem cell.

         <title>Diagnosing the Electrostatic Shielding Mechanism for Dendrite Suppression in Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal anode for aqueous zinc batteries is highly susceptible to dendrites and side reactions. Engineering the electrolyte with additives can combat these negative traits. Operando transmission electron microscopy is used to explore how the inclusion of LiCl additive encourages the formation of blocky Zn electroplated deposits, which it is proposed is due to an electrostatic shielding mechanism.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc electrolytes offer the potential for cheaper rechargeable batteries due to their safe compatibility with the high capacity metal anode; yet, they are stymied by irregular zinc deposition and consequent dendrite growth. Suppressing dendrite formation by tailoring the electrolyte is a proven approach from lithium batteries; yet, the underlying mechanistic understanding that guides such tailoring does not necessarily directly translate from one system to the other. Here, it is shown that the electrostatic shielding mechanism, a fundamental concept in electrolyte engineering for stable metal anodes, has different consequences for the plating morphology in aqueous zinc batteries. Operando electrochemical transmission electron microscopy is used to directly observe the zinc nucleation and growth under different electrolyte compositions and reveal that electrostatic shielding additive suppresses dendrites by inhibiting secondary zinc nucleation along the (100) edges of existing primary deposits and encouraging preferential deposition on the (002) faces, leading to a dense and block&#8208;like zinc morphology. The strong influence of the crystallography of Zn on the electrostatic shielding mechanism is further confirmed with Zn||Ti cells and density functional theory modeling. This work demonstrates the importance of considering the unique aspects of the aqueous zinc battery system when using concepts from other battery chemistries.

         <title>RuOx Quantum Dots Loaded on Graphdiyne for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strengthened d&#8211;p orbital hybridization between graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based catalyst (RuOxQDs/GDY) and lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is achieved through the strong Ru&#8208;to&#8208;alkyne &#960; backdonation, which significantly enhances the catalytic performance of RuOxQDs/GDY for LiPSs conversion. RuOxQDs/GDY also enable ultrastable lithium metal anodes. Thus, the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur full cells are realized.








Abstract
Here, a strategy to strengthen d&#8211;p orbital hybridization by fabricating &#960; backbonding in the catalyst for efficient lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion is reported. A special interface structure of RuOx quantum dots (QDs) anchored on graphdiyne (GDY) nanoboxes (RuOxQDs/GDY) is prepared to enable strong Ru&#8208;to&#8208;alkyne &#960; backdonation, which effectively regulates the d&#8208;electron structures of Ru centers to promote the d&#8211;p orbital hybridization between the catalyst and LiPSs and significantly boosts the catalytic performance of RuOxQDs/GDY. The strong affinity with Li ions and fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion of RuOxQDs/GDY also enable ultrastable Li metal anodes. Thus, S@RuOxQDs/GDY cathodes exhibit excellent cycling performance under harsh conditions, and Li@RuOxQDs/GDY anodes show an ultralong cycling life over 8800&#160;h without Li dendrite growth. Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) full cells with S@RuOxQDs/GDY cathodes and Li@RuOxQDs/GDY anodes can deliver an impressive areal capacity of 17.8&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2 and good cycling stability under the practical conditions of low negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive electrode capacity (N/P) ratio (N/P = 1.4), lean electrolyte (E/S = 3&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1), and high S mass loading (15.4&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2).

&lt;/i&gt;QDs/GDY also enable ultrastable lithium metal anodes. Thus, the high-energy-density lithium&#8211;sulfur full cells are realized.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, a strategy to strengthen d&#8211;p orbital hybridization by fabricating &#960; backbonding in the catalyst for efficient lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion is reported. A special interface structure of RuO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; quantum dots (QDs) anchored on graphdiyne (GDY) nanoboxes (RuO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;QDs/GDY) is prepared to enable strong Ru-to-alkyne &#960; backdonation, which effectively regulates the d-electron structures of Ru centers to promote the d&#8211;p orbital hybridization between the catalyst and LiPSs and significantly boosts the catalytic performance of RuO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;QDs/GDY. The strong affinity with Li ions and fast Li-ion diffusion of RuO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;QDs/GDY also enable ultrastable Li metal anodes. Thus, S@RuO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;QDs/GDY cathodes exhibit excellent cycling performance under harsh conditions, and Li@RuO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;QDs/GDY anodes show an ultralong cycling life over 8800&#160;h without Li dendrite growth. Lithium-sulfur (Li&#8211;S) full cells with S@RuO&lt;i&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;QDs/GDY cathodes and Li@RuO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;QDs/GDY anodes can deliver an impressive areal capacity of 17.8&#160;mA h cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and good cycling stability under the practical conditions of low negative-to-positive electrode capacity (N/P) ratio (N/P = 1.4), lean electrolyte (E/S = 3&#160;&#181;L mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and high S mass loading (15.4&#160;mg&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advanced Additive Manufacturing of Structurally&#8208;Colored Architectures</title>

High&#8208;yield stress colloidal inks for 3D printing of structurally&#8208;colored objects are created through destabilization of ultra&#8208;stable silica suspensions with polar molecules. These inks form dense, uniform colloidal networks and swiftly transition from liquid to solid upon nozzle discharge, facilitating rapid, shrinkage&#8208;free printing. The resulting prints display structural colors and enhanced mechanical properties due to the dense network.








Abstract
Direct ink writing (DIW) stands out as a facile additive manufacturing method, minimizing material waste. Nonetheless, developing homogeneous Bingham inks with high yield stress and swift liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transitions for versatile 3D printing remains a challenge. In this study, high&#8208;performance Bingham inks are formulated by destabilizing silica particle suspensions in acrylate&#8208;based resin. A colloidal network forms in the shear&#8208;free state through interparticle attraction, achieved by disrupting the solvation layer of large resin molecules using polar molecules. The network is highly dense, with evenly distributed linkage strength as monodisperse particles undergo gelation at an ultra&#8208;high fraction. Crucially, the strength is calibrated to ensure a sufficiently large yield stress, while still allowing the network to reversibly melt under shear flow. The inks immediately undergo a liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition upon discharge, while maintaining fluidity without nozzle clogging. The dense colloidal networks develop structural colors due to the short&#8208;range order. This enables the rapid and sophisticated drawing of structurally&#8208;colored 3D structures, relying solely on rheological properties. Moreover, the printed composite structures exhibit high mechanical stability due to the presence of the colloidal network, which expands the range of potential applications.

         <title>Photocatalytic H2O2 Generation Reaction with a Benchmark Rate at Air&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Solid Joint Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase photocatalytic interface effectively enhances the interfacial oxygen concentration and results in largely enhanced performance in photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production in water. This is attributed to an enhanced oxygen diffusion rate and high O2 concentration in triphase interface.








Abstract
The rapid charge recombination, low selectivity for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and limited O2 diffusion rate hinder the practical applications of photocatalytic H2O2 generation. Herein, a triphase photocatalytic system in which the H2O2 generation occurs at the air&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid joint interfaces is developed, using polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). The introduction of pyrrole units and cyano group into PCN can promote the activation of oxygen molecules and facilitate the spatial separation of HOMO and LUMO orbits, hence improving the charge carrier separation efficiency and enhancing the formation of H2O2. Importantly, the gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid triphase interface system allows for the rapid transport of oxygen from the air to the reaction interface, overcoming the low solubility and slow diffusion of oxygen in the water in conventional liquid reaction systems. The triphase system shows a benchmark H2O2 generation rate over PCN&#8208;based materials in pure water (2063.21&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), which is an approximate tenfold enhancement as compared to powder photocatalyst (215.44&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Simulation and electrochemical tests reveal that the rapid oxygen diffusion rate of triphase interface can promote charge separation and provide more O2 to generate H2O2. This work provides a promising strategy for constructing an efficient and sustainable H2O2 production system.

         <title>Switchable Chemical&#8208;Bond Reorganization for the Stable Charge Trapping in Amorphous Silicon Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors suggest a novel atomistic mechanism for stable charge storage in amorphous silicon nitride in charge trap flash memory. Through ab initio molecular dynamics and orbital interaction analysis, it is demonstrated that stable charge trapping involves chemical bond reorganization and large trap level shifts, resulting in charges being trapped in multicenter bonding states.








Abstract
Despite the widespread use of charge&#8208;trap flash (CTF) memory, the atomistic mechanism behind the exceptionally stable charge storage at the localized trap sites is still controversial. Herein, by combining first&#8208;principles calculations and orbital interaction analysis, a charge&#8208;dependent switchable chemical&#8208;bond reorganization is elucidated as the underpinning chemistry in the working mechanism of CTF. Especially, positively charged fourfold&#8208;coordinated nitrogen (dubbed N+ center), unappreciated until now, is the decisive component of the entire process; once an electron occupies this site, the N+ center disappears by breaking one N&#9472;Si bond, simultaneously forming a new Si&#9472;Si bond with a nearby Si atom which, in turn, creates fivefold coordinated Si. As a result, the electron is stored in a multi&#8208;center orbital belonging to multiple atoms including the newly formed Si&#9472;Si bond. It is also observed that hole trapping accompanies the creation of an N+ center by forming a new N&#9472;Si bond, which represents the reverse process. To further support and validate this model by means of core&#8208;level calculations, it is also shown that an N+ center's 1s core level is 1.0&#8211;2.5&#160;eV deeper in energy than those of the threefold coordinated N atoms, in harmony with experimental X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy data.

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment Modulating CaCO3&#8208;Based Colloidosomal Microreactors Can Generally Reinforce Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor microenvironment (TME) modulating CaCO3&#8208;based colloidosomal microreactors are constructed via encapulating catalase within CaCO3 nanoparticles assembled colloidsome. The obtained CCaP CSs can simultaneously neutralize tumor acidity, attenuate tumor hypoxia, and deplete immunosuppressive lactate, collectively leading to activated anticancer immunity. As a result, CCaP CSs treatment can remarkably reinforce the therapeutic potency of both anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 immunotherapy and EGFR&#8208;CAR&#8208;T cell immunotherapy in different tumor models.








Abstract
Tumor hypoxia and acidity, two general features of solid tumors, are known to have negative effect on cancer immunotherapy by directly causing dysfunction of effector immune cells and promoting suppressive immune cells inside tumors. Herein, a multifunctional colloidosomal microreactor is constructed by encapsulating catalase within calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticle&#8208;assembled colloidosomes (abbreviated as CaP CSs) via the classic double emulsion method. The yielded CCaP CSs exhibit well&#8208;retained proton&#8208;scavenging and hydrogen peroxide decomposition performances and can thus neutralize tumor acidity, attenuate tumor hypoxia, and suppress lactate production upon intratumoral administration. Consequently, CCaP CSs treatment can activate potent antitumor immunity and thus significantly enhance the therapeutic potency of coloaded anti&#8208;programmed death&#8208;1 (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1) antibodies in both murine subcutaneous CT26 and orthotopic 4T1 tumor xenografts. In addition, such CCaP CSs treatment also markedly reinforces the therapeutic potency of epidermal growth factor receptor expressing chimeric antigen receptor T (EGFR&#8208;CAR&#8208;T) cells toward a human triple&#8208;negative breast cancer xenograft by promoting their tumor infiltration and effector cytokine secretion. Therefore, this study highlights that chemical modulation of tumor acidity and hypoxia can collectively reverse tumor immunosuppression and thus significantly potentiate both immune checkpoint blockade and CAR&#8208;T cell immunotherapies toward solid tumors.

&lt;p&gt;Tumor hypoxia and acidity, two general features of solid tumors, are known to have negative effect on cancer immunotherapy by directly causing dysfunction of effector immune cells and promoting suppressive immune cells inside tumors. Herein, a multifunctional colloidosomal microreactor is constructed by encapsulating catalase within calcium carbonate (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) nanoparticle-assembled colloidosomes (abbreviated as CaP CSs) via the classic double emulsion method. The yielded CCaP CSs exhibit well-retained proton-scavenging and hydrogen peroxide decomposition performances and can thus neutralize tumor acidity, attenuate tumor hypoxia, and suppress lactate production upon intratumoral administration. Consequently, CCaP CSs treatment can activate potent antitumor immunity and thus significantly enhance the therapeutic potency of coloaded anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1) antibodies in both murine subcutaneous CT26 and orthotopic 4T1 tumor xenografts. In addition, such CCaP CSs treatment also markedly reinforces the therapeutic potency of epidermal growth factor receptor expressing chimeric antigen receptor T (EGFR-CAR-T) cells toward a human triple-negative breast cancer xenograft by promoting their tumor infiltration and effector cytokine secretion. Therefore, this study highlights that chemical modulation of tumor acidity and hypoxia can collectively reverse tumor immunosuppression and thus significantly potentiate both immune checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell immunotherapies toward solid tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reconstruction of Vesicle Assemblies with DNA Nanorulers for Resolving Heterogeneity of Vesicles in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a vitro system composed of synaptic vesicle&#8208;sized vesicles coupled to double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) nanorulers, which enables to selectively connect isolated vesicles to generate vesicle assemblies with controlled lateral distance (from 3 to 10 nm). Moreover, this work analyzes the state heterogeneity of vesicles (individual vesicle or vesicle clusters) in cells and vesicle release heterogeneity in different positions across the cell.








Abstract
Nanoscale vesicles such as synaptic vesicles play a pivotal role in efficient interneuronal communications in vivo. However, the coexistence of single vesicle and vesicle clusters in living cells increases the heterogeneity of vesicle populations, which largely complicates the quantitative analysis of the vesicles. The high spatiotemporal monitoring of vesicle assemblies is currently incompletely resolved. Here, this work uses synthetic vesicles and DNA nanorulers to reconstruct in vitro the vesicle assemblies that mimic vesicle clusters in living cells. DNA nanorulers program the lateral distance of vesicle assemblies from 3 to 10 nm. This work uses the carbon fiber nanoelectrode (CFNE) to amperometric monitor artificial vesicle assemblies with sub&#8208;10 nm interspaces, and obtain a larger proportion of complex events. This work resolves the heterogeneity of individual vesicle release kinetics in PC12 cells with the temporal resolution down to &#8776;0.1 ms. This work further analyzes the aggregation state of intracellular vesicles and the exocytosis of living cells with electrochemical vesicle cytometry. The results indicate that the exocytosis of vesicle clusters is critically dependent on the size of clusters. This technology has the potential as a tool to shed light on the heterogeneity analysis of vesicle populations.

         <title>Structure Engineered High Piezo&#8208;Photoelectronic Performance for Boosted Sono&#8208;Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of watermelon&#8208;like ZnSnO3@UCNPs (upconversion nanoparticles) heterostructure can effectively prevent the degradation of piezoelectric ZnSnO3 quantum dots in tumor environment, fully utilizing its piezoelectric catalytic effect as an antitumor carrier. Combined with the photodynamic therapy effect arising from the energy transfer from UCNPs to ZnSnO3, a satisfactory therapeutic efficacy is realized.








Abstract
Sono&#8208;photodynamic therapy is hindered by the limited tissue penetration depth of the external light source and the quick recombination of electron&#8211;hole owing to the random movement of charge carriers. In this study, orthorhombic ZnSnO3 quantum dots (QDs) with piezo&#8208;photoelectronic effects are successfully encapsulated in hexagonal upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) using a one&#8208;pot thermal decomposition method to form an all&#8208;in&#8208;one watermelon&#8208;like structured sono&#8208;photosensitizer (ZnSnO3@UCNPs). The excited near&#8208;infrared light has high penetration depth, and the watermelon&#8208;like structure allows for full contact between the UCNPs and ZnSnO3 QDs, achieving ultrahigh F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer efficiency of up to 80.30%. Upon ultrasonic and near&#8208;infrared laser co&#8208;activation, the high temperature and pressure generated lead to the deformation of the UCNPs, thereby driving the deformation of all ZnSnO3 QDs inside the UCNPs, forming many small internal electric fields similar to isotropic electric domains. This piezoelectric effect not only increases the internal electric field intensity of the entire material but also prevents random movement and rapid recombination of charge carriers, thereby achieving satisfactory piezocatalytic performance. By combining the photodynamic effect arising from the energy transfer from UCNPs to ZnSnO3, synergistic efficacy is realized. This study proposes a novel strategy for designing highly efficient sono&#8208;photosensitizers through structural design.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Electron Synchronization Excitation for Photochemical Synthesis and Patterning Graphene&#8208;Based Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a novel approach for synthesizing and patterning electrodes using multi&#8208;point electron synchronization excitation. It not only significantly enhances the processing efficiency for micro&#8208;supercapacitors but also circumvents the influence of electrode morphology during the traditional laser direct writing. This strategy leads to enhanced electrochemical performance&#160;and better processing efficiency and quality of micro&#8208;supercapacitors.








Abstract
Micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs) represent a pressing requirement for powering the forthcoming generation of micro&#8208;electronic devices. The simultaneous realization of high&#8208;efficiency synthesis of electrode materials and precision patterning for MSCs in a single step presents an ardent need, yet it poses a formidable challenge. Herein, a unique shaped laser&#8208;induced patterned electron synchronization excitation strategy has been put forward to photochemical synthesis RuO2/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) electrode and simultaneously manufacture the micron&#8208;scale high&#8208;performance MSCs with ultra&#8208;high resolution. Significantly, the technique represents a noteworthy advancement over traditional laser direct writing (LDW) patterning and photoinduced synthetic electrode methods. It not only improves the processing efficiency for MSCs and the controllability of laser&#8208;induced electrode material but also enhances electric fields and potentials at the interface for better electrochemical performance. The resultant MSCs exhibit excellent area and volumetric capacitance (516&#160;mF&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 1720&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3), and ultrahigh energy density (0.41&#160;Wh&#160;cm&#8722;3) and well&#8208;cycle stability (retaining 95% capacitance after 12000 cycles). This investigation establishes a novel avenue for electrode design and underscores substantial potential in the fabrication of diverse microelectronic devices.

         <title>Ultrastrong and High&#8208;Tough Thermoset Epoxy Resins from Hyperbranched Topological Structure and Subnanoscaled Free Volume</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the preparation of high&#8208;performance epoxy thermosets from hyperbranched epoxy, overcoming the two conflicts between strength and toughness and between high performance and highly efficient degradation. The in&#8208;situ simultaneous reinforcing and toughening mechanism is well investigated, being attributed to a synergistic effect of high crosslinking density, minimization of free volume, narrow free volume distribution, and hyperbranched structure.








Abstract
The strength and toughness of thermoset epoxy resins are generally mutually exclusive, as are the high performance and rapid recyclability. Experimentally determined mechanical strength values are usually much lower than their theoretical values. The preparation of thermoset epoxy resins with high modulus, high toughness, ultrastrong strength, and highly efficient recyclability is still a challenge. Here, novel hyperbranched epoxy resins (Bn, n = 6, 12, 24)&#160;with imide structures by a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction. Bn shows an excellent comprehensive function in simultaneously improving the strength, modulus, toughness, low&#8208;temperature resistance, and degradability of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol&#8208;A (DGEBA). All the mechanical properties first increase and then decrease with minimization of the free volume properties. The improvement is attributable to uniform molecular holes or free volume by a molecular mixture of linear and hyperbranched topological structures. The precise measurement and controllability of the molecular free volume properties of epoxy resins is first discovered, as well as the imide structure degradation of crosslinked epoxy resins. The two conflicts are successfully resolved between strength and toughness and between high performance during service and high efficiency during degradation. These findings provide a route for designing ultrastrong, tough, and recyclable thermoset epoxy resins.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature, Current&#8208;Induced Magnetization Self&#8208;Switching in A Van Der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In conventional switching heterostructures based on spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT), a spin source material with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling or broken inversion symmetry is typically required to generate SOT when a charge current is applied. In this study, we achieved current&#8208;induced self&#8208;switching of magnetization at room temperature using a layered polar magnetic metal, Fe2.5Co2.5GeTe2, thereby greatly simplifying the structure for magnetization switching.








Abstract
2D layered materials with broken inversion symmetry are being extensively pursued as &#160;spin&#160;source layers to realize high&#8208;efficiency magnetic switching. Such low&#8208;symmetry layered systems are, however, scarce. In addition, most layered magnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy show a low Curie temperature. Here, the experimental observation of spin&#8211;orbit torque magnetization self&#8208;switching at room temperature in a layered polar ferromagnetic metal, Fe2.5Co2.5GeTe2 is reported. The spin&#8211;orbit torque is generated from the broken inversion symmetry along the c&#8208;axis of the crystal. These results provide a direct pathway toward applicable 2D spintronic devices.

         <title>Supra&#8208;Photothermal CO2 Methanation over Greenhouse&#8208;Like Plasmonic Superstructures of Ultrasmall Cobalt Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic approach to enhance the efficiency of photothermal conversion while maintaining the excellent intrinsic catalytic reactivity for ultrasmall Co nanoparticles is demonstrated by integrating the &#8220;nano&#8208;greenhouse effect&#8221; with plasmonic coupling. This work reveals the great potential of nanoscale greenhouse effect in enhancing photothermal conversions through the combination with conventional promoting strategies.








Abstract
Improving the solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal energy conversion efficiency of photothermal nanomaterials at no expense of other physicochemical properties, e.g., the catalytic reactivity of metal nanoparticles, is highly desired for diverse applications but remains a big challenge. Herein, a synergistic strategy is developed for enhanced photothermal conversion by a greenhouse&#8208;like plasmonic superstructure of 4 nm cobalt nanoparticles while maintaining their intrinsic catalytic reactivity. The silica shell plays a key role in retaining the plasmonic superstructures for efficient use of the full solar spectrum, and reducing the heat loss of cobalt nanoparticles via the nano&#8208;greenhouse effect. The optimized plasmonic superstructure catalyst exhibits supra&#8208;photothermal CO2 methanation performance with a record&#8208;high rate of 2.3 mol gCo&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, close to 100% CH4 selectivity, and desirable catalytic stability. This work reveals the great potential of nanoscale greenhouse effect in enhancing photothermal conversions through the combination with conventional promoting strategies, shedding light on the design of efficient photothermal nanomaterials for demanding applications.

         <title>Slippery Porous&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Infused Porous Surface (SPIPS) with On&#8208;Demand Responsive Switching between &#8220;Defensive&#8221; and &#8220;Offensive&#8221; Antifouling Modes</title>

Inspired by the poison dart frog's skin with venom glands and mucus, a porous liquid (PL) based on ZIF&#8208;8 is prepared as a lubricant and injects into the silicone polyurethane (SPU) matrix to construct a new type of slippery liquid&#8208;infused porous surface (SLIPS)&#8212;the slippery porous&#8208;liquid&#8208;infused porous surface (SPIPS) for neritic marine antifouling.








Abstract
Slippery liquid&#8208;infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) have received widespread attention in the antifouling field. However, the reduction in antifouling performance caused by lubricant loss limits their application in marine antifouling. Herein, inspired by the skin of a poison dart frog which contains venom glands and mucus, a porous liquid (PL) based on ZIF&#8208;8 is prepared as a lubricant and injected into a silicone polyurethane (SPU) matrix to construct a new type of SLIPS for marine antifouling applications: the slippery porous&#8208;liquid&#8208;infused porous surface (SPIPS). The SPIPS consists of a responsive antifoulant&#8208;releasing switch between &#8220;defensive&#8221; and &#8220;offensive&#8221; antifouling modes to intelligently enhance the antifouling effect after lubricant loss. The SPIPS can adjust antifouling performance to meet the antifouling requirements under different light conditions. The wastage of antifoulants is reduced, thereby effectively maintaining the durability and service life of SLIPS materials. The SPIPS exhibits efficient lubricant self&#8208;replenishment, self&#8208;cleaning, anti&#8208;protein, anti&#8208;bacterial, anti&#8208;algal, and self&#8208;healing (97.48%) properties. Furthermore, it shows satisfactory 360&#8208;day antifouling performance in actual marine fields during boom seasons, demonstrating the longest antifouling lifespan in the field tests of reported SLIPS coatings. Hence, the SPIPS can effectively promote the development of SLIPS for neritic antifouling.

         <title>Metasurface&#8208;Based Optical Logic Operators Driven by Diffractive Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;compact optical quantum logic operator based on multifunctional metasurfaces is implemented under a spatial&#8208; and polarization&#8208;multiplexed strategy. Such a novel program for optical quantum computing is experimentally validated to achieve high fidelities (99.88%) for all four classical quantum logical gates at ultra&#8208;high operating speeds.








Abstract
In this paper, a novel optical logic operator based on the multifunctional metasurface driven by all&#8208;optical diffractive neural network is reported, which can perform four principal quantum logic operations (Pauli&#8208;X, Pauli&#8208;Y, Pauli&#8208;Z, and Hadamard gates). The two ground states |0&#10217;$|0 \rangle $ and |1&#10217;$|1 \rangle $&#8197;are characterized by two orthogonal linear polarization states. The proposed spatial&#8208; and polarization&#8208;multiplexed all&#8208;optical diffractive neural network only contains a hidden layer physically mapped as a metasurface with simple and compact unit cells, which dramatically reduces the volume and computing resources required for the system. The designed optical quantum operator is proven to achieve high fidelities for all four quantum logical gates, up to 99.96% numerically and 99.88% experimentally. The solution will facilitate the construction of large&#8208;scale optical quantum computing systems and scalable optical quantum devices.

         <title>Molecular Masking of Synthetic Immunomodulator Evokes Antitumor Immunity With Reduced Immune Tolerance and Systemic Toxicity by Temporal Activity Recovery and Sustained Stimulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The clinical application of toll&#8208;like receptor agonist (TLR7/8a)&#160;therapy is limited by systemic immune&#8208;associated toxicity and immune tolerance. To address these limitations, a dynamic immunomodulation strategy incorporating masking and temporal activity recovery&#160;of TLR7/8a through prodrug&#8208;like TLR7/8a (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) at the molecular level and a sustained release of active TLR7/8a from nanoliposomes (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) in a macroscale depot is designed.








Abstract
Activation of the innate immune system counteracts tumor&#8208;induced immunosuppression. Hence, small molecule&#8208;based toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 agonists (TLR7/8a), which can modulate immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment along with the activation of innate immunity, are emerging as essential components of cancer immunotherapy. However, the clinical application of synthetic TLR7/8a therapies is limited by systemic immune&#8208;associated toxicity and immune tolerance induced by uncontrolled stimulatory activities and repeated treatments. To address these limitations, a dynamic immunomodulation strategy incorporating masking and temporal recovery of the activity of TLR7/8a through prodrug&#8208;like TLR7/8a (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) at the molecular level and a sustained and controlled release of active TLR7/8a from nanoliposome (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) (NL(pro&#8208;TLR7/8)) in a macroscale depot are designed. Immunization with cationic NL(pro&#8208;TLR7/8) and anionic antigens triggers robust activation of innate immune cells as well as antigen&#8208;specific T cell responses, eliciting reprogramming of immunosuppressive cells into tumor&#8208;suppressive cells, with decreased systemic adverse effects and immune tolerance. Combination treatment with NL(pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 plus anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) or nanoliposomes (Doxorubicin) has synergistic effects on antitumor immunity in various tumor models. The concept of pro&#8208;TLR7/8a suggested herein may facilitate the advancement of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based immunomodulators for clinical translation and safe and effective cancer immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;The clinical application of toll-like receptor agonist (TLR7/8a)&#160;therapy is limited by systemic immune-associated toxicity and immune tolerance. To address these limitations, a dynamic immunomodulation strategy incorporating masking and temporal activity recovery&#160;of TLR7/8a through prodrug-like TLR7/8a (pro-TLR7/8a) at the molecular level and a sustained release of active TLR7/8a from nanoliposomes (pro-TLR7/8a) in a macroscale depot is designed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activation of the innate immune system counteracts tumor-induced immunosuppression. Hence, small molecule-based toll-like receptor 7/8 agonists (TLR7/8a), which can modulate immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment along with the activation of innate immunity, are emerging as essential components of cancer immunotherapy. However, the clinical application of synthetic TLR7/8a therapies is limited by systemic immune-associated toxicity and immune tolerance induced by uncontrolled stimulatory activities and repeated treatments. To address these limitations, a dynamic immunomodulation strategy incorporating masking and temporal recovery of the activity of TLR7/8a through prodrug-like TLR7/8a (pro-TLR7/8a) at the molecular level and a sustained and controlled release of active TLR7/8a from nanoliposome (pro-TLR7/8a) (NL(pro-TLR7/8)) in a macroscale depot are designed. Immunization with cationic NL(pro-TLR7/8) and anionic antigens triggers robust activation of innate immune cells as well as antigen-specific T cell responses, eliciting reprogramming of immunosuppressive cells into tumor-suppressive cells, with decreased systemic adverse effects and immune tolerance. Combination treatment with NL(pro-TLR7/8a) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-L1) or nanoliposomes (Doxorubicin) has synergistic effects on antitumor immunity in various tumor models. The concept of pro-TLR7/8a suggested herein may facilitate the advancement of small-molecule-based immunomodulators for clinical translation and safe and effective cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Free&#8208;Standing Film with Versatility: From Heterogeneous CTCs Programed Isolating to Breast Cancer Molecular Typing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A free&#8208;standing film composed of titanium dioxide nanotube/silk fibroin is developed by an eco&#8208;friendly way. It is an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use platform for capturing and profiling heterogeneous circular tumor cells (CTCs) effectively and accurately from the unprocessed blood samples of patients, discriminating the CTCs with different surface biomarkers, showing the potential in molecular typing of breast cancer.








Abstract
Developing a robust strategy for profiling heterogeneous circular tumor cells specifically, distinguishing the phenotypes of which in blood sample of cancer patient precisely, and releasing them sequentially, is significant for cancer management by liquid biopsy. Herein, a bio&#8208;inspired free&#8208;standing and flexible film composed of TiO2 nanotube and silk fibroin, fabricated with multiply dynamic bioactive surface (TSF/MDBS) by a simple and eco&#8208;friendly way including using polydopamine chemistry and dual dynamic covalent chemistry, is reported. The as&#8208;prepared TSF/MDBS binds specific peptides toward cells with epithelial biomarker and human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) biomarker, and antifouling agents bovine serum albumin for obviating platelets and proteins adhering of blood, can capture heterogeneous CTCs with enhanced capability due to the cytocompatible soft film and exquisite surface design, and further release the captured cells as program, by specifically breaking down the covalent bonds in sequence via the action of adding biocompatible molecules fructose and glutathione. By applying the TSF/MDBS, it can be tailored into desired pieces for identifying CTCs with different phenotypes (HER2&#8208;high and HER2&#8208;low) from the unprocessed blood samples of breast cancer patients, and finally profiling these heterogeneous CTCs, to discriminate HER2 positive or negative of breast cancer patients in clinical applications.

         <title>Smart&#8208;Responsive HOF Heterostructures with Multiple Spatial&#8208;Resolved Emission Modes toward Photonic Security Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The smart&#8208;responsive hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) heterostructure is first realized based on the differentiated design on high&#8208;electronegative atoms of building blocks, which exhibit dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;controlled spatial&#8208;resolved emission modes, facilitating the construction of responsive photonic barcodes with multiple convert states. These results provide enlightenment on the function&#8208;oriented design of smart&#8208;responsive HOF heterosystem for advanced anticounterfeiting and information security applications.








Abstract
Luminescent hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with the unique dynamics and versatile functional sites hold great potential application in information security, yet most of responsive HOFs focus on the single&#8208;component framework with restrained emission control, limiting further applications in advanced confidential information protection. Herein, the first smart&#8208;responsive HOF heterostructure with multiple spatial&#8208;resolved emission modes for covert photonic security platform is reported. The HOF heterostructures are prepared by integrating different HOFs into a single microwire based on a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted epitaxial growth method. The distinct responsive behaviors of HOFs permit the heterostructure to simultaneously display the thermochromism via the framework transformation and the acidichromism via the protonation effect, thus generating multiple emission modes. The dual stimuli&#8208;controlled spatial&#8208;resolved emission modes constitute the fingerprint of a heterostructure, and enable the establishment of the smart&#8208;responsive photonic barcode with multiple convert states, which further demonstrate the dynamic coding capability and enhanced security in anticounterfeiting label applications. These results offer a promising route to design function&#8208;oriented smart responsive HOF microdevices toward advanced anticounterfeiting applications.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Adaptable Optothermal Nanotweezers for Trapping, Sorting, and Assembling across Diverse Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly&#8208;adaptable optothermal nanotweezer (HAONT) is a universal optothermal manipulation scheme with sub&#8208;10 nm precision, enabling trapping, sorting, assembling, and novel doughnut&#8208;shaped vortex trapping across diverse nanoparticles. Its versatility expands its functionality to a broad spectrum of nanoparticles, making it a useful tool for versatile nano&#8208;fabrication across various materials, charges, shapes, sizes, and beyond.








Abstract
Optical manipulation of various kinds of nanoparticles is vital in biomedical engineering. However, classical optical approaches demand higher laser power and are constrained by diffraction limits, necessitating tailored trapping schemes for specific nanoparticles. They lack a universal and biocompatible tool to manipulate nanoparticles of diverse sizes, charges, and materials. Through precise modulation of diffusiophoresis and thermo&#8208;osmotic flows in the boundary layer of an optothermal&#8208;responsive gold film, highly adaptable optothermal nanotweezers (HAONTs) capable of manipulating a single nanoparticle as small as sub&#8208;10&#160;nm are designed. Additionally, a novel optothermal doughnut&#8208;shaped vortex (DSV) trapping strategy is introduced, enabling a new mode of physical interaction between cells and nanoparticles. Furthermore, this versatile approach allows for the manipulation of nanoparticles in organic, inorganic, and biological forms. It also offers versatile function modes such as trapping, sorting, and assembling of nanoparticles. It is believed that this approach holds the potential to be a valuable tool in fields such as synthetic biology, optofluidics, nanophotonics, and colloidal science.

         <title>Artificial Photosynthetic System with Spatial Dual Reduction Site Enabling Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Step&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, recognized for their efficient charge transport and high redox capacity, are considered a viable approach to improve photocatalytic hydrogen production. In this study, a double S&#8208;scheme heterojunction featuring spatial dual reduction sites is developed. This design enhances solar hydrogen production and yields a high apparent quantum efficiency. This work contributes a significant approach to the development of more effective S&#8208;scheme artificial photosynthetic systems.








Abstract
Although S&#8208;scheme artificial photosynthesis shows promise for photocatalytic hydrogen production, traditional methods often overly concentrate on a single reduction site. This limitation results in inadequate redox capability and inefficient charge separation, which hampers the efficiency of the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. To overcome this limitation, a double S&#8208;scheme system is proposed that leverages dual reduction sites, thereby preserving energetic photo&#8208;electrons and holes to enhance apparent quantum efficiency. The design features a double S&#8208;scheme junction consisting of CdS nanospheres decorated with anatase TiO2 nanoparticles coupled with graphitic C3N4. The as&#8208;prepared catalyst exhibits a hydrogen evolution rate of 26.84&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of 40.2% at 365 nm. This enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is ascribed to the efficient charge separation and transport induced by the double S&#8208;scheme. Both theoretical calculations and comprehensive spectroscopy tests (both in&#160;situ and ex&#160;situ) affirm the efficient charge transport across the catalyst interface. Moreover, substituting the reduction&#8208;type catalyst CdS with other similar sulfides like ZnIn2S4, ZnS, MoS2 and In2S3 further confirms the feasibility of the proposed double S&#8208;scheme configuration. The findings provide a pathway to designing more effective double S&#8208;scheme artificial photosynthetic systems, opening up fresh perspectives in enhancing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.

Both theoretical calculations and comprehensive spectroscopy tests (both in&#160;situ and ex&#160;situ) affirm the efficient charge transport across the catalyst interface. Moreover, substituting the reduction-type catalyst CdS with other similar sulfides like ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ZnS, MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; further confirms the feasibility of the proposed double S-scheme configuration. The findings provide a pathway to designing more effective double S-scheme artificial photosynthetic systems, opening up fresh perspectives in enhancing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Potent and Low&#8208;Volume Concentration Additives for Durable Aqueous Zinc Batteries: Machine Learning&#8208;Enabled Performance Rationalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,2&#8208;alkanediols with an optimal chain length are unveiled as highly potent low&#8208;volume concentration electrolyte additives to address the zinc anode rechargeability for the practical development of aqueous zinc batteries. A machine learning&#8208;based model that maps the performance relative to critical additive physicochemical descriptors is presented, which can lead the way for a rational approach to additive design and discoveries.








Abstract
The essential virtues of aqueous zinc battery chemistry stem from the energy&#8208;dense zinc metal anode and mild aqueous electrolytes. Yet, their incompatibility &#8211; as exposed by zinc's corrosion and associated dendrite problem &#8211; poses a challenge to achieving improved cycle life under practically relevant parameters. While electrolyte additives are a scalable strategy, additives that can function at low volume concentrations remain elusive. Here, through screening alkanol and alkanediol chemistries, 1,2&#8208;butanediol and pentanediol are unveiled as highly potent additives, which operate at a practical 1 volume% concentration owing to their ability to furnish dynamic solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase through pronounced interfacial filming. This unique mechanistic action renders effective corrosion and dendrite mitigation, resulting in up to five to twenty&#8208;fold zinc cyclability enhancement with a high Coulombic efficiency (up to 99.9%) and improved full&#8208;cell performance under demanding conditions, including at elevated temperatures. A machine learning&#8208;based analysis is presented to rationalize the additive performance relative to critical physicochemical descriptors, which can pave the way for a rational approach to efficient additive discoveries.

         <title>Epitaxial Ultrathin Pt Atomic Layers on CrN Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt atomic layers catalysts with electron&#8208;deficient Pt sites and epitaxial strain are successfully grown on low&#8208;cost CrN nanoparticles via a facile thermal ammonlysis method. The Pt atomic layers on CrN electrocatalyst deliver outstanding activity and durability for the formic acid oxidation reaction, guiding the development of low&#8208;cost Pt&#8208;based catalysts for various applications.








Abstract
The construction of platinum (Pt) atomic layers is an effective strategy to improve the utilization efficiency of Pt atoms in electrocatalysis, thus is important for reducing the capital costs of a wide range of energy storage and conversion devices. However, the substrates used to grow Pt atomic layers are largely limited to noble metals and their alloys, which is not conducive to reducing catalyst costs. Herein, low&#8208;cost chromium nitride (CrN) is utilized as a support for the loading of epitaxial ultrathin Pt atomic layers via a simple thermal ammonolysis method. Owing to the strong anchoring and electronic regulation of Pt atomic layers by CrN, the obtained Pt atomic layers&#160;catalyst (containing electron&#8208;deficient Pt sites) exhibits excellent activity and endurance for the formic acid oxidation reaction, with a mass activity of 5.17&#160;A&#160;mgPt&#8722;1 that is 13.6 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. This novel strategy demonstrates that CrN can replace noble metals as a low&#8208;cost substrate for constructing Pt atomic layers catalysts.

         <title>Engineering Semicarbazide&#8208;Bearing Polypeptide Conjugates for Efficient Tumor Chemotherapy and Imaging of Tumor Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the synthesis of well&#8208;defined polypeptides containing semicarbazide moieties via direct polymerization of N&#8208;phenoxycarbonyl&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino acid (NPCA) based monomers. These polypeptides can be further decorated with ketone/aldehyde&#8208;containing agents with the formation of pH&#8208;cleavable semicarbazone linkages. The intracellular acidic pH&#8208;triggered release promotes drug escape from endolysosomes and enhances anti&#8208;tumor efficacy, which can be also employed for highly sensitive detection of tumor lesions.








Abstract
Polypeptide materials offer scalability, biocompatibility, and biodegradability, rendering them an ideal platform for biomedical applications. However, the preparation of polypeptides with specific functional groups, such as semicarbazide moieties, remains challenging. This work reports, for the first time, the straightforward synthesis of well&#8208;defined methoxy&#8208;terminated poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;b&#8208;polypeptide hybrid block copolymers (HBCPs) containing semicarbazide moieties. This synthesis involves implementing the direct polymerization of environment&#8208;stable N&#8208;phenoxycarbonyl&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino acid (NPCA) precursors, thereby avoiding the handling of labile N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (NCA) monomers. The resulting HBCPs containing semicarbazide moieties enable facile functionalization with aldehyde/ketone derivatives, forming pH&#8208;cleavable semicarbazone linkages for tailored drug release. Particularly, the intracellular pH&#8208;triggered hydrolysis of semicarbazone moieties restores the initial semicarbazide residues, facilitating endo&#8208;lysosomal escape and thus improving therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, the integration of the hypoxic probe (Ir(btpna)(bpy)2) into the pH&#8208;responsive nanomedicines allows sequential responses to acidic and hypoxic tumor microenvironments, enabling precise detection of metastatic tumors. The innovative approach for designing bespoke functional polypeptides holds promise for advanced drug delivery and precision therapeutics.

         <title>Polyester Nanofiltration Membranes for Efficient Cations Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyester nanofiltration membrane for cation separation is prepared by interfacial polymerization of TET with TMC. The &#8220;hydroxyl&#8208;ammonium&#8221; entities in the TET confer the TET&#8208;TMC membrane with dense structures and positive surface charge, leading to MgCl2 retention (95.5%) significantly higher than other polyester nanofiltration membranes (&lt;50%).








Abstract
Polyester nanofiltration membranes highlight beneficial chlorine resistance, but their loose structures and negative charge result in poor cations retention precluding advanced use in cations separation. This work designs a new monomer (TET) containing &#8220;hydroxyl&#8208;ammonium&#8221; entities that confer dense structures and positive charge to polyester nanofiltration membranes. The TET monomer undergoes efficient interfacial polymerization with the trimesoyl chloride (TMC) monomer, and the resultant TET&#8208;TMC membranes feature one of the lowest molecular weight cut&#8208;offs (389&#160;Da) and the highest zeta potential (4&#160;mv, pH: 7) among all polyester nanofiltration membranes. The MgCl2 rejection of the TET&#8208;TMC membrane is 95.5%, significantly higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polyester nanofiltration membranes (&lt;50%). The Li+/Mg2+ separation performance of TET&#8208;TMC membrane is on par with cutting&#8208;edge polyamide membranes, while additionally, the membrane is stable against NaClO though polyamide membranes readily degrade. Thus the TET&#8208;TMC is the first polyester nanofiltration membrane for efficient cations separation.

         <title>High Output Power and High Quantum Efficiency in Novel NIR Phosphor MgAlGa0.7B0.3O4:Cr3+ with Profound FWHM Variation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel ultra&#8208;broadband near&#8208;infrared phosphor MgAlGa0.7B0.3O4:0.05Cr3+ exhibits impressive external quantum efficiency and output power. MgAlGa0.7B0.3O4:Cr3+ undergoes a transition from ultra&#8208;narrowband to ultra&#8208;broadband emission as the Cr3+ concentration increased, driven by energy transfer between the three emitting centers.








Abstract
There is strong demand for ultraefficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphors with adjustable emission properties for next&#8208;generation intelligent NIR light sources. Designing phosphors with large full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) variations is challenging. In this study, novel near&#8208;ultraviolet light&#8208;emitting diode&#160;(LED)&#8208;excited NIR phosphors, MgAlGa0.7B0.3O4:Cr3+ (MAGBO:Cr3+), with three emission centers achieve ultra&#8208;narrowband (FWHM = 29&#160;nm) to ultra&#8208;broadband (FWHM = 260&#160;nm) emission with increasing Cr3+ concentration. Gaussian fitting and decay time analysis reveal the alteration in the FWHM, which is attributed to the energy transfer occurring between the three emission centers. The distinct thermal quenching behaviors of the three emission centers are revealed through the temperature&#8208;dependent decay times. The ultra&#8208;broadband NIR phosphor MAGBO:0.05Cr3+ exhibits high thermal stability (85%, 425 K) and exceptional external quantum efficiency of 68.5%. An NIR phosphor&#8208;converted LED (pc&#8208;LED) is fabricated using MAGBO:0.05Cr3+ phosphor, exhibiting a remarkable NIR output power of 136&#160;mW at 600&#160;mA in ultra&#8208;broadband NIR pc&#8208;LEDs. This study describes the preparation of highly efficient phosphors and provides a further understanding of the tunable FWHM, which is vital for high&#8208;performance NIR phosphors with versatile applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Wearable Organic Photodetectors by Molecular Design and Green Solvent Processing for Pulse Oximetry and Photoplethysmography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic photodetectors processed from a biomass&#8208;derived solvent, namely 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran, which simultaneously exhibits a remarkably high detectivity and surpasses the performances of devices processed from conventional chlorinated solvents, are developed. Furthermore, such devices can also be used as smart wearable devices for medical applications, such as heart pulse rate monitoring and blood oxygen saturation assessment.








Abstract
White&#8208;light detection from the visible to the near&#8208;infrared region is central to many applications such as high&#8208;speed cameras, autonomous vehicles, and wearable electronics. While organic photodetectors (OPDs) are being developed for such applications, several challenges must be overcome to produce scalable high&#8208;detectivity OPDs. This includes issues associated with low responsivity, narrow absorption range, and environmentally friendly device fabrication. Here, an OPD system processed from 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;MeTHF) sets a record in light detectivity, which is also comparable with commercially available silicon&#8208;based photodiodes is reported. The newly designed OPD is employed in wearable devices to monitor heart rate and blood oxygen saturation using a flexible OPD&#8208;based finger pulse oximeter. In achieving this, a framework for a detailed understanding of the structure&#8211;processing&#8211;property relationship in these OPDs is also developed. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) thin films processed from 2&#8208;MeTHF are characterized at different length scales with advanced techniques. The BHJ morphology exhibits optimal intermixing and phase separation of donor and acceptor moieties, which facilitates the charge generation and collection process. Benefitting from high charge carrier mobilities and a low shunt leakage current, the newly developed OPD exhibits a specific detectivity of above 1012&#160;Jones over 400&#8211;900&#160;nm, which is higher than those of reference devices processed from chlorobenzene and&#160;ortho&#8208;xylene.

         <title>A &#8220;One Arrow Three Eagle&#8221; Strategy to Improve CM&#8208;272 Primed Bladder Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 cannot only promote the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 for O2&#8208;compensated SDT but also reduce the high level of GSH to enhance the reactive oxygen species, inducing ferroptosis and apoptosis. Significantly, MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 actives ICD to enhance T&#8208;cell receptor activation to better respond to ICI (&#945;PD&#8208;1). Hence, this effective &#8220;one arrow three eagle&#8221; strategy improves CM&#8208;272 primed bladder cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Immunotherapy using an immune&#8208;checkpoint blockade has significantly improved its therapeutic effects. CM&#8208;272, which is a novel epigenetic inhibitor of G9a, induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) for recovering the sensitivity to anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibodies; however, the efficacy of CM&#8208;272 is greatly limited by promoting the transcription activity of HIF&#8208;1&#945; to form a hypoxic environment. Here, a Fe3+&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (MIL&#8208;53) is used to load CM&#8208;272 (ultra&#8208;high loading rate of 56.4%) for realizing an MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 nanoplatform. After entering bladder cancer cells, Fe3+ not only promotes the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 for O2&#8208;compensated sonodynamic therapy but reduces the high level of glutathione in the tumor microenvironment (TME) for enhancing reactive oxygen species, including ferroptosis and apoptosis. MIL&#8208;53 carriers can be degraded in response to the TME, accelerating the release of CM&#8208;272, which helps achieve the maximum effectiveness in an O2&#8208;sufficient TME by attenuating drug resistance. Furthermore, MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 enhances dendritic cell maturation and synergistically combines it with an anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein 1 antibody during the study of immune&#8208;related pathways in the transcriptomes of bladder cancer cells using RNA&#8208;seq. This study presents the first instance of amalgamating nanomedicine with CM&#8208;272, inducing apoptosis, ferroptosis, and ICD to achieve the &#8220;one arrow three eagle&#8221; effect.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Nanophosphors Based on CuInSe2 Quantum Dots with Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield for Micro&#8208;LEDs Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and broadband near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphors based on CuInSe2 quantum dots (QDs) with tunable emission peaking from 750 to 1150&#160;nm and a high absolute photoluminescence quantum yield of 92.8% are reported. Notably, NIR light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with an output power of 88.7mW@350&#160;mA and bright micro&#8208;LEDs arrays with diameters less than 5&#160;&#181;m are achieved based on these QDs.








Abstract
Highly efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent nanomaterials are urgently required for portable mini or micro phosphors&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs). However, most existing NIR&#8208;emitting phosphors are generally restricted by their low photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) or large particle size. Herein, a kind of highly efficient NIR nanophosphors is developed based on copper indium selenide quantum dots (CISe QDs). The PL peak of these QDs can be exquisitely manipulated from 750 to 1150&#160;nm by altering the stoichiometry of Cu/In and doping with Zn2+. Their absolute PLQY can be significantly improved from 28.6% to 92.8% via coating a ZnSe shell. By combining the phosphors with a commercial blue chip, an NIR pc&#8208;LED is fabricated with remarkable photostability and a record&#8208;high radiant flux of 88.7 mW@350&#160;mA among the Pb/Cd&#8208;free QDs&#8208;based NIR pc&#8208;LEDs. Particularly, such QDs&#8208;based nanophosphors acted as excellent luminescence converter for NIR micro&#8208;LEDs with microarray diameters below 5&#160;&#181;m, which significantly exceeds the resolutions of current commercial inkjet display pixels. The findings may open new avenues for the exploration of highly efficient NIR micro&#8208;LEDs in a variety of applications.

         <title>Synchronous Diagnosis of Respiratory Viruses Variants via Receptonics Based on Modeling Receptor&#8210;Ligand Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A receptor&#8211;ligand binding reaction based receptonics platform is presented as a facile diagnostic device to discriminate numerous strains of respiratory viruses. Diagnosis of respiratory viruses and their variants indicate its potential as on&#8208;site screening platform for fatal diseases without the need for complex additional equipment. The newly developed receptonics shows the possibility for the application of clinical samples and samples from primate model.








Abstract
The transmission and pathogenesis of highly contagious fatal respiratory viruses are increasing, and the need for an on&#8208;site diagnostic platform has arisen as an issue worldwide. Furthermore, as the spread of respiratory viruses continues, different variants have become the dominant circulating strains. To prevent virus transmission, the development of highly sensitive and accurate on&#8208;site diagnostic assays is urgently needed. Herein, a facile diagnostic device is presented for multi&#8208;detection based on the results of detailed receptor&#8210;ligand dynamics simulations for the screening of various viral strains. The novel bioreceptor&#8208;treated electronics (receptonics) device consists of a multichannel graphene transistor and cell&#8208;entry receptors conjugated to N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC). An ultrasensitive multi&#8208;detection performance is achieved without the need for sample pretreatment, which will enable rapid diagnosis and prevent the spread of pathogens. This platform can be applied for the diagnosis of variants of concern in clinical respiratory virus samples and primate models. This multi&#8208;screening platform can be used to enhance surveillance and discriminate emerging virus variants before they become a severe threat to public health.

         <title>Engineered Bio&#8208;Heterojunction Confers Extra&#8208; and Intracellular Bacterial Ferroptosis and Hunger&#8208;Triggered Cell Protection for Diabetic Wound Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precise ferroptosis bio&#8208;heterojunction (F&#8208;bio&#8208;HJ) consisting of Fe2O3, Ti3C2&#8208;MXene, and glucose oxidase is developed to induce extra&#8208;intracellular bacteria&#8208;targeted ferroptosis for infected diabetic cutaneous regeneration. Under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, F&#8208;bio&#8208;HJ induces extracellular bacterial ferroptosis via photothermal, photodynamic, and chemodynamic properties and assists macrophages against intracellular bacteria via ferroportin&#8208;mediated bacterial ferroptosis and hunger&#8208;triggered AMPK pathway&#8208;mediated cell protection, elevating the biocompatibility of ferroptosis&#8208;mediated therapeutic strategies.








Abstract
Nanomaterial&#8208;mediated ferroptosis has garnered considerable interest in the antibacterial field, as it invokes the disequilibrium of ion homeostasis and boosts lipid peroxidation in extra&#8208; and intracellular bacteria. However, current ferroptosis&#8208;associated antibacterial strategies indiscriminately pose damage to healthy cells, ultimately compromising their biocompatibility. To address this daunting issue, this work has designed a precise ferroptosis bio&#8208;heterojunction (F&#8208;bio&#8208;HJ) consisting of Fe2O3, Ti3C2&#8208;MXene, and glucose oxidase (GOx) to induce extra&#8208;intracellular bacteria&#8208;targeted ferroptosis for infected diabetic cutaneous regeneration. Fe2O3/Ti3C2&#8208;MXene@GOx (FMG) catalytically generates a considerable amount of ROS which assaults the membrane of extracellular bacteria, facilitating the permeation of synchronously generated Fe2+/Fe3+ into bacteria under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, causing planktonic bacterial death via ferroptosis, Fe2+ overload, and lipid peroxidation. Additionally, FMG facilitates intracellular bacterial ferroptosis by transporting Fe2+ into intracellular bacteria via inward ferroportin (FPN). With GOx consuming glucose, FMG creates hunger protection which helps macrophages escape cell ferroptosis by activating the adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (AMP) activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. In vivo results authenticate that FMG boosts diabetic infectious cutaneous regeneration without triggering ferroptosis in normal cells. As envisaged, the proposed tactic provides a promising approach to combat intractable infections by precisely terminating extra&#8208;intracellular infection via steerable ferroptosis, thereby markedly elevating the biocompatibility of therapeutic ferroptosis&#8208;mediated strategies.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Based Macrophage&#8208;Like Nanoparticles for Targeted Photothermal Therapy and Virus Transmission Blockage in Monkeypox</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precise therapeutic, prevention, and control strategy for monkeypox, based on an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) loaded macrophage&#8208;like biomimetic nanoparticle (TBD@M NPs), is developed. TBD@M NPs achieve NIR&#8208;II fluorescent tracking of the monkeypox lesions and photothermal eradication of monkeypox virus after intravenous injection followed by 808&#160;nm laser stimulation, thus accomplishing monkeypox treatment, wound healing promoting, and virus transmission blockage.








Abstract
The recent prevalence of monkeypox has led to the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Monkeypox lesions are typically ulcers or pustules (containing high titers of replication&#8208;competent virus) in the skin and mucous membranes, which allow monkeypox virus to transmit predominantly through intimate contact. Currently, effective clinical treatments for monkeypox are lacking, and strategies for blocking virus transmission are fraught with drawbacks. Herein, this work constructs a biomimetic nanotemplate (termed TBD@M NPs) with macrophage membranes as the coat and polymeric nanoparticles loading a versatile aggregation&#8208;induced emission featured photothermal molecule TPE&#8208;BT&#8208;DPTQ as the core. In a surrogate mouse model of monkeypox (vaccinia&#8208;virus&#8208;infected tail scarification model), intravenously injected TBD@M NPs show precise tracking and near&#8208;infrared region II fluorescence imaging of the lesions. Upon 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, the virus is eliminated by the photothermal effect and the infected wound heals rapidly. More importantly, the inoculation of treated lesion tissue suspensions does not trigger tail infection or inflammatory activation in healthy mice, indicating successful blockage of virus transmission. This study demonstrates for the first time monkeypox theranostics using nanomedicine, and may bring a new insight into the development of a viable strategy for monkeypox management in clinical trials.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric &#960;&#8208;bridge engineering is proposed to improve the permittivity of polymer donors without impairing their miscibility with acceptor materials. Asymmetric &#960;&#8208;bridge benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]difuran (BDF)&#8208;based polymer PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz demonstrates larger permittivity, smaller exciton binding energy, and more favorable molecular packing than its counterparts, leading to proficient charge dynamics and a promising power conversion efficiency of 18.10% with a remarkable fill factor of 80.11% for derived devices.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) exhibit complex charge dynamics, which are closely correlated with the dielectric constant (&#603;r) of photovoltaic materials. In this work, a series of novel conjugated copolymers based on benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]difuran (BDF) and benzotriazole (BTz) is designed and synthesized, which differ by the nature of &#960;&#8208;bridge from one another. The PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz with asymmetric furan and thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridge demonstrates a larger &#603;r of 4.22 than PBDF&#8208;dT&#8208;BTz with symmetric thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridge (3.15) and PBDF&#8208;dF&#8208;BTz with symmetric furan &#960;&#8208;bridge (3.90). The PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz also offers more favorable molecular packing and appropriate miscibility with non&#8208;fullerene acceptor Y6 than its counterparts. The corresponding PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz:Y6 OSCs display efficient exciton dissociation, fast charge transport and collection, and reduced charge recombination, eventually leading to a power conversion efficiency of 17.01%. When introducing a fullerene derivative (PCBO&#8208;12) as a third component, the PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz:Y6:PCBO&#8208;12 OSCs yield a remarkable FF of 80.11% with a high efficiency of 18.10%, the highest value among all reported BDF&#8208;polymer&#8208;based OSCs. This work provides an effective approach to developing high&#8208;permittivity photovoltaic materials, showcasing PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz as a promising polymer donor for constructing high&#8208;performance OSCs.

The corresponding PBDF-TF-BTz:Y6 OSCs display efficient exciton dissociation, fast charge transport and collection, and reduced charge recombination, eventually leading to a power conversion efficiency of 17.01%. When introducing a fullerene derivative (PCBO-12) as a third component, the PBDF-TF-BTz:Y6:PCBO-12 OSCs yield a remarkable FF of 80.11% with a high efficiency of 18.10%, the highest value among all reported BDF-polymer-based OSCs. This work provides an effective approach to developing high-permittivity photovoltaic materials, showcasing PBDF-TF-BTz as a promising polymer donor for constructing high-performance OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Black Barium Titanate for Multienzyme&#8208;Piezoelectric Synergetic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on the engineering of oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich black barium titanate nanoparticles for amplified piezocatalytic tumor therapy based on the narrowing of the bandgap and the suppression of carrier recombination processes through the introduction of the Pd component.








Abstract
Piezocatalytic tumor therapy is an emerging reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;generating therapeutic approach that relies on piezoelectric polarization under ultrasound (US) irradiation. Optimizing ROS production is a primary objective for enhancing treatment efficiency. In this study, oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich Pd&#8208;integrated black barium titanate (BTO) nanoparticles are rationally engineered to boost the ROS generation efficiency via the introduction of Pd. Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation at low temperatures narrows the bandgap of BTO and reduces the recombination rate of electron&#8208;hole pairs. Furthermore, Pd has dual&#8208;enzyme&#8208;mimicking characteristics, including peroxidase&#8208; and catalase&#8208;mimicking activities, which further heighten the therapeutic efficacy by enhancing ROS production and reversing the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Importantly, the dual enzymatic activity of Pd can be amplified by multiple redox processes sparked by the piezoelectric potential under US stimulation, resulting in bilaterally enhanced multienzyme&#8208;piezoelectric synergetic therapy. In vitro and in vivo results confirm high tumor inhibition in murine breast cancer cells. This work stresses the critical effects of defect engineering&#8208;optimized piezodynamic tumor therapy.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Magnesium Deposition Induced by Paper&#8208;Based Triple&#8208;Gradient Scaffolds toward Flexible Magnesium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible paper&#8208;based scaffold exhibiting gradient conductivity, magnesiophilicity, and pore size is fabricated using an industrially compatible papermaking process. This triple&#8208;gradient design controls the Mg ion flux for bottom&#8208;up deposition, facilitating superior cyclability. The high flexibility and minimal thickness of the scaffold align well with the emerging demand for flexible and wearable electronics, signaling a robust pathway for their advancement.








Abstract
The development of advanced magnesium metal batteries (MMBs) has been hindered by longstanding challenges, such as the inability to induce uniform magnesium (Mg) nucleation and the inefficient utilization of Mg foil. This study introduces a novel solution in the form of a flexible, lightweight, paper&#8208;based scaffold that incorporates gradient conductivity, magnesiophilicity, and pore size. This design is achieved through an industrially adaptable papermaking process in which the ratio of carboxylated multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes to softwood cellulose fibers is meticulously adjusted. The triple&#8208;gradient structure of the scaffold enables the regulation of Mg ion flux, promoting bottom&#8208;up Mg deposition. Owing to its high flexibility, low thickness, and reduced density, the scaffold has potential applications in flexible and wearable electronics. Accordingly, the triple&#8208;gradient electrodes exhibit stable operation for over 1200&#160;h at 3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/3&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 in symmetrical cells, markedly outperforming the non&#8208;gradient and metallic Mg alternatives. Notably, this study marks the first successful fabrication of a flexible MMB pouch full cell, achieving an impressive volumetric energy density of 244&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1. The simplicity and scalability of the triple&#8208;gradient design, which uses readily available materials through an industrially compatible papermaking process, open new doors for the production of flexible, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries.

         <title>Ultrathin Clay Nanoparticles&#8208;Mediated Mutual Reinforcement of Ferroptosis and Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mutual reinforcement of ferroptosis and antitumor immunity is a promising strategy to overcome the drawbacks of current immunotherapy. Effective interferon &#947; (IFN&#947;)&#160;delivery sensitizes tumor cells to ferroptosis induced by an ultrathin Mn&#8208;based clay nanocarrier. Immunogenic cancer cell death and tumor microenvironment modulation evoke strong immune response. Meanwhile, cytotoxic T cells released IFN&#947; in turn promotes ferroptosis occurrence.








Abstract
Ferroptosis&#8208;triggered immunogenic cell death (ICD) is widely adopted to potentiate the body's antitumor immunity by catalyzing the production of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the efficacy of ferroptosis and immunotherapy is greatly restricted by intracellular abundant glutathione (GSH) and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a facile bottom&#8208;up method for solvent&#8208;free synthesis of ultrathin manganese (Mn)&#8208;based layered double hydroxide nanosheets with high loading efficiency for pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine interferon (IFN&#947;) (IFN&#947;/uMn&#8208;LDHs) is proposed to mutually reinforce the ferroptosis and systemic immunity. The introduction of manganese ions significantly contributes to GSH depletion and hydroxyl radical generation, which can be further enhanced by IFN&#947; delivery&#8208;induced SLC7A11 downregulation. The ICD effect after cell ferroptosis cooperates with the intrinsic immunomodulatory property of IFN&#947;/uMn&#8208;LDHs to facilitate the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the priming of T cells. IFN&#947; secretion from activated CD8+ T cells in turn involves cascade immunogenic ferroptosis, thus constructing a closed&#8208;loop therapy. Remarkably, a potent abscopal effect is observed in the growth inhibition of both primary and distant tumors. Overall, the ultrathin Mn&#8208;based clay nanoplatform provides a simple approach for mutual regulation between ferroptosis and antitumor immune response, overcoming the obstacles of current cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Robust Ru&#8208;VO2 Bifunctional Catalysts for All&#8208;pH Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;VO2 catalysts containing Ru&#8208;doped VO2 and Ru nanoparticles are synthesized, and it shows excellent water splitting performance in all&#8208;pH range. The in&#8208;situ characterizations and Theoretical&#160;calculations reveal that synergy of Ru Nanoparticles and Ru&#8208;doped VO2 breaks the hydrogen bond network formed by *OH adsorbed on the Ru single&#8208;atom site, and thereby significantly boosts the acidic oxygen evolution.








Abstract
Designing robust bifunctional catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction in all&#8208;pH conditions for overall water splitting (OWS) is an effective way to achieve sustainable development. Herein, a composite Ru&#8208;VO2 containing Ru&#8208;doped VO2 and Ru nanoparticles (NPs) is synthesized, and it shows a high OWS performance in full&#8208;pH range due to their synergist effect. In particular, the OER mass activities of Ru&#8208;VO2 at 1.53 V (vs RHE) in acidic, alkaline, and PBS solutions are &#8776;65, 36, and 235 times of commercial RuO2 in the same conditions. The &#8220;Ru&#8208;VO2 || Ru&#8208;VO2&#8221; two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer only needs a voltage of 1.515 V (at 10 mA cm&#8722;2) in acidic water splitting, which can operate stably for 125 h at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 without significant voltage decay. In situ Raman spectra and in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry prove that the OER of Ru&#8208;VO2 in acid follows the adsorption evolution mechanism. Density functional theory calculations further reveal the synergistic effect between Ru NP and Ru&#8208;doped VO2, which breaks the hydrogen bond network formed by *OH adsorbed on the Ru single&#8208;atom site, and thereby significantly enhances the OER activity. This work provides new insights into the design of novel bifunctional pH&#8208;universal catalysts for OWS.

Ultraconfined Plasmons
In article number 2302520, J. Enrique Ortega, F. Javier Garc&#237;a de Abajo, and co&#8208;workers present a new approach to fabricating ultrathin crystalline silver films consisting of a few atomic layers in thickness and featuring collective electron oscillations&#8212;plasmons&#8212;with an unprecedented combination of spatial confinement and long lifetimes. The image illustrates one of those structures, where bowtie pillars are carved from a silicon wafer, followed by a chemical and physical treatment that flattens the upper surface, and subsequent epitaxial deposition of a controlled number of silver (111) atomic layers. The resulting silver bowtie structures present confined plasmons at the gap region with a quality factor (spectral frequency&#8208;to&#8208;width ratio) approaching ten and a spatial footprint of a few tens of nanometers.

Intracranial Drug Delivery
In article number 2306876 by Niandong Jiao, Anhua Wu, Lianqing Liu, and co&#8208;workers, a marsupial robotic system combining a continuum robot (mother robot) with nanorobots (child robots) is developed for cross&#8208;scale targeting drug delivery. A magnetic catheter robot goes through a minimally invasive channel on the skull and enters deep into the brain along a curved path. The hollow catheter robot releases nanorobots when reaching the location of the brain tumor. Then the nanorobots further advance to the tumor and release the loaded drugs to kill the brain tumor.

Vesicle Assemblies with DNA Nanorulers
In article number 2308344, Min Li, Xiaolei Zuo, and co&#8208;workers used synthetic vesicles and DNA nanorulers to reconstruct in vitro the vesicle assemblies that mimic vesicle clusters in living cells. They demonstrate the amperometric monitoring of vesicle assemblies using nanoelectrode with high precision. The further application in vivo enables to analyze the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of vesicle clusters in cells and release events heterogeneity in different positions across the cell.

         <title>3D Printing of Self&#8208;Healing Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article critically summarizes the recent literature on 3D printable materials and structures with self&#8208;healing characteristics, emphasizing the intimate relationship between chemical and physical properties and printability, toward the design and fabrication of advanced components. Moreover, it highlights actual applications, envisaging future directions of investigation.








Abstract
This review article presents a comprehensive overview of the latest advances in the field of 3D printable structures with self&#8208;healing properties. Three&#8208;dimensional printing (3DP) is a versatile technology that enables the rapid manufacturing of complex geometric structures with precision and functionality not previously attainable. However, the application of 3DP technology is still limited by the availability of materials with customizable properties specifically designed for additive manufacturing. The addition of self&#8208;healing properties within 3D printed objects is of high interest as it can improve the performance and lifespan of structural components, and even enable the mimicking of living tissues for biomedical applications, such as organs printing. The review will discuss and analyze the most relevant results reported in recent years in the development of self&#8208;healing polymeric materials that can be processed via 3D printing. After introducing the chemical and physical self&#8208;healing mechanism that can be exploited, the literature review here reported will focus in particular on printability and repairing performances. At last, actual perspective and possible development field will be critically discussed.

         <title>Technology and Integration Roadmap for Optoelectronic Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optoelectronic memristors (OMs) can emulate neurological functions within a bionic computing architecture, enabling energy&#8208;efficient in&#8208;memory computing. Identifying suitable techniques for integrating materials into integrated circuit platforms is imperative to advance the field. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental performance, mechanism, structures, applications, and integration roadmap of OMs aiming to establish a connection between materials and OM systems.








Abstract
Optoelectronic memristors (OMs) have emerged as a promising optoelectronic Neuromorphic computing paradigm, opening up new opportunities for neurosynaptic devices and optoelectronic systems. These OMs possess a range of desirable features including minimal crosstalk, high bandwidth, low power consumption, zero latency, and the ability to replicate crucial neurological functions such as vision and optical memory. By incorporating large&#8208;scale parallel synaptic structures, OMs are anticipated to greatly enhance high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;power in&#8208;memory computing, effectively overcoming the limitations of the von Neumann bottleneck. However, progress in this field necessitates a comprehensive understanding of suitable structures and techniques for integrating low&#8208;dimensional materials into optoelectronic integrated circuit platforms. This review aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the fundamental performance, mechanisms, design of structures, applications, and integration roadmap of optoelectronic synaptic memristors. By establishing connections between materials, multilayer optoelectronic memristor units, and monolithic optoelectronic integrated circuits, this review seeks to provide insights into emerging technologies and future prospects that are expected to drive innovation and widespread adoption in the near future.

         <title>Engineered Synthetic Matrices for Human Intestinal Organoid Culture and Therapeutic Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human intestinal organoids (HIOs) derived from pluripotent stem cells or adult stem cell biopsies represent a powerful platform to study human development, drug testing, and disease modeling, and serve as a cell source for tissue regeneration. Synthetic hydrogels can be engineered to serve as analogs of the extracellular matrix to support HIO growth and delivery vehicles in therapeutic applications. 








Abstract
Human intestinal organoids (HIOs) derived from pluripotent stem cells or adult stem cell biopsies represent a powerful platform to study human development, drug testing, and disease modeling in vitro, and serve as a cell source for tissue regeneration and therapeutic advances in vivo. Synthetic hydrogels can be engineered to serve as analogs of the extracellular matrix to support HIO growth and differentiation. These hydrogels allow for tuning the mechanical and biochemical properties of the matrix, offering an advantage over biologically derived hydrogels such as Matrigel. Human intestinal organoids have been used for repopulating transplantable intestinal grafts and for in vivo delivery to an injured intestinal site. The use of synthetic hydrogels for in vitro culture and for in vivo delivery is expected to significantly increase the relevance of human intestinal organoids for drug screening, disease modeling, and therapeutic applications.

The use of synthetic hydrogels for in vitro culture and for in vivo delivery is expected to significantly increase the relevance of human intestinal organoids for drug screening, disease modeling, and therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Assembly of 2D Graphene&#8208;Derived Ion Channels for Water&#8208;Based Green Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational materials selection/design and thorough mechanism research in water&#8208;based green energy conversion are essential scientific issues to be imminently discussed for future development of 2D graphene&#8208;derived ion channels (2D&#8208;GDICs) through interfacial assembly. Such review and prospects about 2D&#8208;GDIC from synthesis to applications including stability and functionalization would also provide a reference for other 2D materials to fabricate sophisticated ion channels.








Abstract
The utilization of sustained and green energy is believed to alleviate increasing menace of global environmental concerns and energy dilemma. Interfacial assembly of 2D graphene&#8208;derived ion channels (2D&#8208;GDICs) with tunable ion/fluid transport behavior enables efficient harvesting of renewable green energy from ubiquitous water, especially for osmotic energy harvesting. In this review, various interfacial assembly strategies for fabricating diverse 2D&#8208;GDICs are summarized and their ion transport properties are discussed. This review analyzes how particular structure and charge density/distribution of 2D&#8208;GDIC can be modulated to minimize internal resistance of ion/fluid transport and enhance energy conversion efficiency, and highlights stimuli&#8208;responsive functions and stability of 2D&#8208;GDIC and further examines the possibility of integrating 2D&#8208;GDIC with other energy conversion systems. Notably, the presented preparation and applications of 2D&#8208;GDIC also inspire and guide other 2D materials to fabricate sophisticated ion channels for targeted applications. Finally, potential challenges in this field is analyzed and a prospect to future developments toward high&#8208;performance or large&#8208;scale real&#8208;word applications is offered.

         <title>Engineering Kirigami Frameworks Toward Real&#8208;World Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines the basic deformation mechanisms inherent to kirigami design, summarizes the most distinguished properties of kirigami induced by cutting and folding, and overviews how each property can be leveraged to tackle challenges across various domains. It envisions that this work will inspire further innovation in metamaterials and encourage the community to address the challenges posed by real&#8208;world&#160;applications.








Abstract
The surge in advanced manufacturing techniques has led to a paradigm shift in the realm of material design from developing completely new chemistry to tailoring geometry within existing materials. Kirigami, evolved from a traditional cultural and artistic craft of cutting and folding, has emerged as a powerful framework that endows simple 2D sheets with unique mechanical, thermal, optical, and acoustic properties, as well as shape&#8208;shifting capabilities. Given its flexibility, versatility, and ease of fabrication, there are significant efforts in developing kirigami algorithms to create various architectured materials for a wide range of applications. This review summarizes the fundamental mechanisms that govern the transformation of kirigami structures and elucidates how these mechanisms contribute to their distinctive properties, including high stretchability and adaptability, tunable surface topography, programmable shape morphing, and characteristics of bistability and multistability. It then highlights several promising applications enabled by the unique kirigami designs and concludes with an outlook on the future challenges and perspectives of kirigami&#8208;inspired metamaterials toward real&#8208;world&#160;applications.

         <title>Strain Engineering in Perovskites: Mutual Insight on Oxides and Halides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxide and halide perovskites play a key role in various energy conversion devices such as piezoelectric devices, catalysts, light emitting diodes, and photodetectors. This review covers the latest studies on strain engineering in both oxide and halide perovskites for energy conversion devices. The work provides a new insight that can lead breakthroughs for high performance energy conversion devices.








Abstract
Perovskite materials have garnered significant attention over the past decades due to their applications, not only in electronic materials, such as dielectrics, piezoelectrics, ferroelectrics, and superconductors but also in optoelectronic devices like solar cells and light emitting diodes. This interest arises from their versatile combinations and physiochemical tunability. While strain engineering is a recognized powerful tool for tailoring material properties, its collaborative impact on both oxides and halides remains understudied. Herein, strain engineering in perovskites for energy conversion devices, providing mutual insight into both oxides and halides is discussed. The various experimental methods are presented for applying strain by using thermal mismatch, lattice mismatch, defects, doping, light illumination, and flexible substrates. In addition, the main factors that are influenced by strain, categorized as structure (e.g., symmetry breaking, octahedral distortion), bandgap, chemical reactivity, and defect formation energy are described. After that, recent progress in strain engineering for perovskite oxides and halides for energy conversion devices is introduced. Promising methods for enhancing the performance of energy conversion devices using perovskites through strain engineering are suggested.

         <title>Active Materials for Functional Origami</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Origami has emerged as a popular design strategy for engineering structures. Further, active materials can be integrated with origami for lightweight, programmable, self&#8208;deployable structures relevant to numerous aerospace, metamaterial, and biomedical applications. This review details active material actuation mechanisms, active origami applications, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fabrication methods, as well as origami modeling, and provides insights into the future of active origami research.








Abstract
In recent decades, origami has been explored to aid in the design of engineering structures. These structures span multiple scales and have been demonstrated to be used toward various areas such as aerospace, metamaterial, biomedical, robotics, and architectural applications. Conventionally, origami or deployable structures have been actuated by hands, motors, or pneumatic actuators, which can result in heavy or bulky structures. On the other hand, active materials, which reconfigure in response to external stimulus, eliminate the need for external mechanical loads and bulky actuation systems. Thus, in recent years, active materials incorporated with deployable structures have shown promise for remote actuation of light weight, programmable origami. In this review, active materials such as shape memory polymers (SMPs) and alloys (SMAs), hydrogels, liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs), magnetic soft materials (MSMs), and covalent adaptable network (CAN) polymers, their actuation mechanisms, as well as how they have been utilized for active origami and where these structures are applicable is discussed. Additionally, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fabrication methods to construct active origami are highlighted. The existing structural modeling strategies for origami, the constitutive models used to describe active materials, and the largest challenges and future directions for active origami research are summarized.

         <title>Review&#8212;Extremely Thin Amorphous Indium Oxide Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing the thickness of indium oxide, enabled by atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, can tune its material properties to achieve high performance devices beyond the capabilities of conventional oxide semiconductors. In this work, the history leading to the re&#8208;emergence of indium oxide, its fundamental material properties, growth techniques with a focus on ALD, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art indium oxide device research are reviewed.








Abstract
Amorphous oxide semiconductor transistors have been a mature technology in display panels for upward of a decade, and have recently been considered as promising back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line compatible channel materials for monolithic 3D applications. However, achieving high&#8208;mobility amorphous semiconductor materials with comparable performance to traditional crystalline semiconductors has been a long&#8208;standing problem. Recently it has been found that greatly reducing the thickness of indium oxide, enabled by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, can tune its material properties to achieve high mobility, high drive current, high on/off ratio, and enhancement&#8208;mode operation at the same time, beyond the capabilities of conventional oxide semiconductor materials. In this work, the history leading to the re&#8208;emergence of indium oxide, its fundamental material properties, growth techniques with a focus on ALD, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art indium oxide device research, and the bias stability of the devices are reviewed.

In this work, the history leading to the re-emergence of indium oxide, its fundamental material properties, growth techniques with a focus on ALD, state-of-the-art indium oxide device research, and the bias stability of the devices are reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Materials in Droplet Manipulation for Biochemical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven droplet manipulation strategies, featured in contactless interaction, high&#8208;spatiotemporal resolution, and biocompatibility, are considered promising, particularly for biochemical applications. Special attention is paid to the underlying mechanisms, recent advancements of light&#8208;responsive materials, and the most notable applications of light&#8208;driven droplet manipulation in this review.








Abstract
Miniaturized droplets, characterized by well&#8208;controlled microenvironments and capability for parallel processing, have significantly advanced the studies on enzymatic evolution, molecular diagnostics, and single&#8208;cell analysis. However, manipulation of small&#8208;sized droplets, including moving, merging, and trapping of the targeted droplets for complex biochemical assays and subsequent analysis, is not trivial and remains technically demanding. Among various techniques, light&#8208;driven methods stand out as a promising candidate for droplet manipulation in a facile and flexible manner, given the features of contactless interaction, high spatiotemporal resolution, and biocompatibility. This review therefore compiles an in&#8208;depth discussion of the governing mechanisms underpinning light&#8208;driven droplet manipulation. Besides, light&#8208;responsive materials, representing the core of light&#8211;matter interaction and the key character converting light into different forms of energy, are particularly assessed in this review. Recent advancements in light&#8208;responsive materials and the most notable applications are comprehensively archived and evaluated. Continuous innovations and rational engineering of light&#8208;responsive materials are expected to propel the development of light&#8208;driven droplet manipulation, equip droplets with enhanced functionality, and broaden the applications of droplets for biochemical studies and routine biochemical investigations.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Construction of Articular Cartilage&#8208;Like Hydrogel Coating for Durable Aqueous Lubrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy is developed for constructing an articular cartilage&#8208;like hydrogel coating on the surface of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene, which exhibits an ultralow friction coefficient of 0.0048 during 10&#160;000 cycles under a load of 0.9&#160;MPa, and thus has important implications for development of biological lubricating materials.








Abstract
Articular cartilage has an appropriate multilayer structure and superior tribological properties and provides a structural paradigm for design of lubricating materials. However, mimicking articular cartilage traits on prosthetic materials with durable lubrication remains a huge challenge. Herein, an ingenious three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy is developed for constructing an articular cartilage&#8208;like bilayer&#160;hydrogel coating on the surface of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene (BH&#8208;UPE), which makes full use of conceptions of interfacial interlinking, high&#8208;entanglement crosslinking, and interface&#8208;modulated polymerization. The hydrogel coating is tightly interlinked with UPE substrate through hydrogel&#8208;UPE interchain entanglement and bonding. The hydrogel chains are highly entangled with each other to form a dense tough layer with negligible hysteresis for load&#8208;bearing by reducing the amounts of crosslinker and hydrophilic initiator to p.p.m. levels.&#160;Meanwhile, the polymerization of monomers in the top surface region is suppressed via interface&#8208;modulated polymerization, thus introducing a porous&#160;surface for effective aqueous lubrication. As a result, BH&#8208;UPE exhibits an ultralow friction coefficient of 0.0048 during 10&#160;000 cycles under a load of 0.9&#160;MPa, demonstrating great potential as an advanced bearing material for disc prosthesis. This work may provide a new way to build stable bilayer coatings and have important implications for development of biological lubricating materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Thermal&#8208;Shock Resistance Enabled by Radiative Cooling and Latent Heat Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Radiative cooling technology is well known for its sub&#8208;ambient temperature cooling performance under sunlight radiation. However, the intrinsic maximum cooling power of radiative cooling limits the performance when the objects meet the thermal shock. Here, we proposed a dual&#8208;function strategy composed of radiative cooling and latent heat storage simultaneously enabling the efficient sub&#8208;ambient cooling and high&#8208;efficiency thermal&#8208;shock resistance performance. The electrospinning and absorption&#8208;pressing methods were employed to assemble the dual&#8208;function cooler. The high sunlight reflectivity and high mid&#8208;infrared emissivity of radiative film allows excellent sub&#8208;ambient temperature of 5.1&#160;&#176;C. When subjected the thermal shock, the dual&#8208;function cooler demonstrates a pinning effect of huge temperature drop of 39&#160;&#176;C and stable low&#8208;temperature level by isothermal heat absorption compared with the traditional radiative cooler. The molten phase change materials provide the heat&#8208;time transfer effect by converting thermal&#8208;shock heat to the delayed preservation. This strategy paves a powerful way to protect the objects from thermal accumulation and high&#8208;temperature damage, expanding the applications of radiative cooling and latent heat storage technologies.

Abstract
Achieving reversible insertion/extraction in most cathodes for aqueous aluminum ion batteries (AAIBs) is a significant challenge due to the high charge density of Al3+ and strong electrostatic interactions. Organic materials facilitate the hosting of multivalent carriers and rapid ions diffusion through the rearrangement of chemical bonds. Here, a bipolar conjugated poly(2,3&#8208;diaminophenazine) (PDAP) on carbon substrates prepared via a straightforward electropolymerization method was introduced as cathode for AAIBs. The integration of n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type active units endow PDAP with an increased number of sites for ions interaction. The long&#8208;range conjugated skeleton enhances electron delocalization and collaborates with carbon to ensure high conductivity. Moreover, the strong intermolecular interactions including &#960;&#8722;&#960; interaction and hydrogen bonding significantly enhance its stability. Consequently, the Al//PDAP battery exhibits a large capacity of 338 mAh g&#8722;1 with long lifespan and high&#8208;rate capability. It consistently demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performances even under extreme conditions with capacities of 155 and 348 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;20 and 45&#160;&#176;C, respectively. In/ex situ spectroscopy comprehensively elucidates its cation/anion (Al3+/H3O+ and ClO4&#8722;) storage with 3&#8208;electron transfer in dual electroactive centers (C = N and &#8208;NH&#8208;). This study presents a promising strategy for constructing high&#8208;performance organic cathode for AAIBs over a wide temperature range.

         <title>Rational Design of Multinary Metal Chalcogenide Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 Nanocrystals for Efficient Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multinary metal chalcogenides hold considerable promise for high&#8208;energy potassium storage due to their numerous redox reactions. However, challenges arise from issues such as volume expansion and sluggish kinetics. Here, we present a design featuring a layered ternary Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 anchored on graphene layers as a composite anode, where Bi atoms act as a lattice softening agent on Sb. Benefiting from the lattice arrangement in Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 and structure, Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3/graphene exhibits a mitigated expansion of 28% during the potassiation/de&#8208;potassiation process and demonstrates facile K+ ion transfer kinetics, enabling long&#8208;term durability of 500 cycles at various high rates. Operando synchrotron diffraction patterns and spectroscopies including in&#8208;situ Raman, ex situ adsorption, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron reveal multiple conversion and alloying/de&#8208;alloying reactions for potassium storage at the atomic level. Additionally, both theoretical calculations and electrochemical examinations elucidate the K+ migration pathways and indicate a reduction in energy barriers within Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3/graphene, thereby suggesting enhanced diffusion kinetics for K+. These findings provide insight in the design of durable high&#8208;energy multinary tellurides for potassium storage.

Additionally, both theoretical calculations and electrochemical examinations elucidate the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration pathways and indicate a reduction in energy barriers within Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;1.6&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/graphene, thereby suggesting enhanced diffusion kinetics for K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted widespread research and commercialization attention because of their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low fabrication cost. The long&#8208;term stability of PSCs should satisfy industrial requirements for photovoltaic devices. Inverted PSCs with a p&#8208;i&#8208;n architecture exhibit considerable advantages because of their excellent stability and competitive efficiency. The continuously broken&#8208;through PCE of inverted PSCs shows huge application potential. This review summarizes the developments and outlines the characteristics of inverted PSCs including charge transporting layers (CTLs), perovskite compositions, and interfacial regulation strategies. The latest effective CTLs, interfacial modification, and stability promotion strategies especially under light, thermal and bias conditions are emphatically analyzed. Furthermore, the applications of the inverted structure in high&#8208;efficiency and stable tandem, flexible photovoltaic devices, and modules and their main obstacles are systematically introduced. Finally, the remaining challenges faced by inverted devices are discussed, and several directions for advancing inverted PSCs are proposed according to their development status and industrialization requirements.

         <title>High&#8208;Fluidity/High&#8208;Strength Dual&#8208;Layer Gel Electrolytes Enable Ultra&#8208;Flexible and Dendrite&#8208;Free Fiber&#8208;Shaped Aqueous Zinc Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte composed of inner&#8208;layer with high fluidity and outer&#8208;layer with superb strength is tactfully in&#8208;situ constructed on fiber electrodes. Profiting from the synergistic effect of the inner&#8208;layer and outer&#8208;layer gel electrolytes, the fiber&#8208;shaped Zn&#8208;Zn cells with dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte delivered outstanding cyclic performances. This work provides a new perspective in designing high&#8208;performance fiber&#8208;shaped metal batteries.








Abstract
Fiber&#8208;shaped aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (FAZIBs) with intrinsic safety, highcapacity, and superb omnidirectional flexibility hold promise for wearable energy&#8208;supply devices. However, the interfacial separation of fiber&#8208;shaped electrodes and electrolytes caused by Zinc (Zn) stripping process and severe Zn dendrites occurring at the folded area under bending condition seriously restricts FAZIBs' practical application. Here, an advanced confinement encapsulation strategy is originally reported to construct dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte consisting of high&#8208;fluidity polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;Zn acetate inner layer and high&#8208;strength Zn alginate outer layer for fiber&#8208;shaped Zn anode. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of inner&#8208;outer gel electrolyte and the formation of solid electrolyte interphase&#160;on Zn anode surface by lysine additive, the resulting fiber&#8208;shaped Zn&#8208;Zn symmetric cell delivers long cycling life over 800&#160;h at 1 mA cm&#8722;2 with dynamic bending frequency of 0.1&#160;Hz. The finite element simulation further confirms that dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte can effectively suppress the interfacial separation arising from the Zn stripping and bending process. More importantly, a robust twisted fiber&#8208;shaped Zn/zinc hexacyanoferrate battery based on dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte is successfully assembled, achieving a remarkable capacity retention of 97.7% after bending 500 cycles. Therefore, such novel dual&#8208;layer gel electrolyte design paves the way for the development of long&#8208;life fiber&#8208;shaped aqueous metal batteries.

         <title>Customized Intranasal Hydrogel Delivering Methylene Blue Ameliorates Cognitive Dysfunction against Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Black phosphorus&#8208;methylene blue (BP&#8208;MB) is continuously released from intranasal BP&#8208;MB@Gel and delivered to the brain, exerting synergistic therapeutic effects by suppressing tau neuropathology, restoring mitochondrial function, and alleviating the neuroinflammation, thus inducing cognitive improvements in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These findings highlight a potential strategy for brain&#8208;targeted drug delivery in the management of the complex pathologies of AD.









Abstract
The accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein aggregates is a key pathogenic event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and induces mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species overproduction. However, the treatment of AD remains challenging owning to the hindrance caused by the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and the complex pathology of AD. Nasal delivery represents an effective means of circumventing the BBB and delivering drugs to the brain. In this study, black phosphorus (BP) is used as a drug carrier, as well as an antioxidant, and loaded with a tau aggregation inhibitor, methylene blue (MB), to obtain BP&#8208;MB. For intranasal (IN) delivery, a thermosensitive hydrogel is fabricated by cross&#8208;linking carboxymethyl chitosan and aldehyde Pluronic F127 (F127&#8208;CHO) micelles. The BP&#8208;MB nanocomposite is incorporated into the hydrogel to obtain BP&#8208;MB@Gel. BP&#8208;MB@Gel could be injected intranasally, providing high nasal mucosal retention and controlled drug release. After IN administration, BP&#8208;MB is continuously released and delivered to the brain, exerting synergistic therapeutic effects by suppressing tau neuropathology, restoring mitochondrial function, and alleviating neuroinflammation, thus inducing cognitive improvements in mouse models of AD. These findings highlight a potential strategy for brain&#8208;targeted drug delivery in the management of the complex pathologies of AD.

         <title>In Vivo Stimulation of Therapeutic Antigen&#8208;Specific T Cells in an Artificial Lymph Node Matrix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, an injectable T cell&#8208;stimulating scaffold, the artificial lymph node (aLN), is developed that works with the host immune system to create an immunostimulatory niche. The aLN&#160;can activate and expand rare, antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells from fully na&#239;ve, endogenous populations. aLN stimulated cells are fully functional and synergize with immune checkpoint blockade to reduce tumor burden and prolong survival.








Abstract
T cells are critical mediators of antigen&#8208;specific immune responses and are common targets for immunotherapy. Biomaterial scaffolds have previously been used to stimulate antigen&#8208;presenting cells to elicit antigen&#8208;specific immune responses; however, structural and molecular features that directly stimulate and expand na&#239;ve, endogenous, tumor&#8208;specific T cells in vivo have not been defined. Here, an artificial lymph node (aLN) matrix is created, which consists of an extracellular matrix hydrogel conjugated with peptide&#8208;loaded&#8208;MHC complex (Signal 1), the co&#8208;stimulatory signal anti&#8208;CD28 (Signal 2), and a tethered IL&#8208;2 (Signal 3), that can bypass challenges faced by other approaches to activate T cells in situ such as vaccines. This dynamic immune&#8208;stimulating platform enables direct, in vivo antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cell stimulation, as well as recruitment and coordination of host immune cells, providing an immuno&#8208;stimulatory microenvironment for antigen&#8208;specific T cell activation and expansion. Co&#8208;injecting the aLN with na&#239;ve, wild&#8208;type CD8+ T cells results in robust activation and expansion of tumor&#8208;targeted T cells that kill target cells and slow tumor growth in several distal tumor models. The aLN platform induces potent in vivo antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cell stimulation without the need for ex vivo priming or expansion and enables in situ manipulation of antigen&#8208;specific responses for immunotherapies.

         <title>Acoustic Higher&#8208;Order Topological Insulators Induced by Orbital&#8208;Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orbital&#8208;interactions between degenerate acoustic cavity modes are introduced to demonstrate versatile higher&#8208;order corner states and orbital&#8208;dependent edge states embedded in the bulk, opening the avenue for exploring orbital&#8208;related topological physics and sound&#8208;wave interaction beyond the single&#8208;orbital systems. It also provides new opportunities for the applications such as sound trapping and sensing.








Abstract
The discovery of higher&#8208;order topological insulator metamaterials, in analogy with their condensed&#8208;matter counterparts, has enabled various breakthroughs in photonics, mechanics, and acoustics.

&lt;p&gt;Orbital-interactions between degenerate acoustic cavity modes are introduced to demonstrate versatile higher-order corner states and orbital-dependent edge states embedded in the bulk, opening the avenue for exploring orbital-related topological physics and sound-wave interaction beyond the single-orbital systems. It also provides new opportunities for the applications such as sound trapping and sensing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of higher-order topological insulator metamaterials, in analogy with their condensed-matter counterparts, has enabled various breakthroughs in photonics, mechanics, and acoustics. A common way of inducing higher-order topological wave phenomena is through pseudo-spins, which mimic the electron spins as a symmetry-breaking degree of freedom. Here, this work exploits degenerate orbitals in acoustic resonant cavities to demonstrate versatile, orbital-selective, higher-order topological corner states. Type-II corner states are theoretically investigated and experimentally demonstrated based on tailored orbital interactions, without the need for long-range hoppings that has so far served as a key ingredient for Type-II corner states in single-orbital systems. Due to the orthogonal nature of the degenerate &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbitals, this work also introduces a universal strategy to realize orbital-dependent edge modes, featuring high-&lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt; edge states identified in bulk bands. These findings provide an understanding of the interplay between acoustic orbitals and topology, shedding light on orbital-related topological wave physics, as well as its applications for acoustic sensing and trapping.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable and High&#8208;performance Flow H2&#8208;O2 Fuel Cells with Coupled Acidic Oxygen Reduction and Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conceptually new, coupled flow fuel cell (CF&#8208;FC) by integrating acidic oxygen reduction reaction and alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction is developed, leading to a significantly increased theoretical open&#8208;circuit voltage of 2.057&#160;V. More specifically, a CF&#8208;FC based on a typical transition metal single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C cathode demonstrates a high electricity output and excellent durability, far superior to the conventional fuel cells.








Abstract
Conventional H2&#8208;O2 fuel cells suffer from the low output voltage, insufficient durability, and high&#8208;cost catalysts (e.g., noble metals). Herein, this work reports a conceptually new coupled flow fuel cell (CF&#8208;FC) by coupling asymmetric electrolytes for acidic oxygen reduction reaction and alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction. By introducing an electrochemical neutralization energy, the newly&#8208;developed CF&#8208;FCs possess a significantly increased theoretical open&#8208;circuit voltage. Specifically, a CF&#8208;FC based on a typical transition metal single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C cathode catalyst demonstrates a high electricity output up to 1.81&#160;V and durability with an ultrahigh retention of 91% over 110&#160;h, far superior to the conventional fuel cells (usually, &lt; 1.0&#160;V, &lt; 50% retention over 20&#160;h). The output performance can even be significantly enhanced easily by connecting multiple CF&#8208;FCs into the parallel, series, or combined parallel&#8208;series connections at a fractional cost of that for the conventional H2&#8208;O2 fuel cells, showing great potential for large&#8208;scale practical applications. Thus, this study provides a platform to transform conventional fuel cell technology through the rational design and development of advanced energy conversion and storage devices by coupling different electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Modular Protein Fibers with Outstanding High&#8208;Strength and Acid&#8208;Resistance Performance Mediated by Copper Ion Binding and Imine Networking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust protein fibers are constructed from chimeric proteins consisting of rigid amyloid peptide and flexible elastin&#8208;like protein modules. The Cu2+ binding and imine crosslinking are introduced to construct the double networks, which endow the fibers with exceptional mechanical performance and acid resistance. Gastric perforation suturing is successfully investigated, greatly expanding their multi&#8208;scenario applications in complex environments.








Abstract
Engineered protein fibers are promising biomaterials with diverse applications due to their tunable protein structure and outstanding mechanical properties. However, it remains challenging at the molecular level to achieve satisfied mechanical properties and environmental tolerance simultaneously, especially under extreme acid conditions. Herein, the construction of artificial fibers comprising chimeric proteins made of rigid amyloid peptide and flexible cationic elastin&#8208;like protein (ELP) module is reported. The amyloid peptide readily assembles into highly organized &#946;&#8208;sheet structures that can be further strengthened by the coordination of Cu2+, while the flexible ELP module allows the formation of imine&#8208;based crosslinking networks. These double networks synergistically enhance the mechanical properties of the fibers, leading to a high tensile strength and toughness, overwhelming many reported recombinant spidroin fibers. Notably, the coordination of Cu2+ with serine residues could stabilize &#946;&#8208;sheet structures in the fibers under acidic conditions, which makes the fibers robust against acid, thus enabling their successful utilization in gastric perforation suturing. This work highlights the customization of double networks at the molecular level to create tailored high&#8208;performance protein fibers for various application scenarios.

         <title>A 2D Cryptographic Hash Function Incorporating Homomorphic Encryption for Secure Digital Signatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complete hardware&#8208;based and secure user authentication scheme using public key cryptography with integrated circuits constructed using monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) memtransistors is demonstrated. A key highlight of this study involves exploiting the unique properties of homomorphic encryption where computations are performed on the encrypted data while preserving the integrity of the underlying information.








Abstract
User authentication is a critical aspect of any information exchange system&#160;which verifies the identities of individuals seeking access to sensitive information. Conventionally, this approachrelies on establishing robust digital signature protocols&#160;which employ asymmetric encryption techniques involving a key pair consisting of a public key and its matching private key. In this article, a user verification platform constructed using integrated circuits (ICs) with atomically thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) memtransistors is presented. First, generation of secure cryptographic keys is demonstrated by exploiting the inherent stochasticity of carrier trapping and detrapping at the 2D/oxide interface trap sites. Subsequently, the ability to manipulate the functionality of logical NOR is leveraged to create a secure one&#8208;way hash function which when homomorphically operated upon with NAND, XOR, OR, NOT, and AND logic circuits generate distinct digital signatures. These signatures when subsequently decrypted, verify the authenticity of the receiver while ensuring complete preservation of data integrity and confidentiality as the underlying information is never revealed. Finally, the advantages of implementing a NOR&#8208;based hashing techniques in comparison to the conventional XOR&#8208;based encryption method are established. This demonstration highlights the potential of 2D&#8208;based ICs in developing critical hardware information security primitives.

         <title>Epitaxial Growth of Large&#8208;Scale 2D CrTe2 Films on Amorphous Silicon Wafers With Low Thermal Budget</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seeded growth technique is developed for crystallizing large&#8208;scale 2D CrTe2 films on amorphous SiNx/Si substrates with a low thermal budget. Grain boundaries, intrinsic ferromagnetism, and magnetic&#8211;electrical behavior of 2D CrTe2 magnets are controlled through crystallinity engineering. This work paves the way for large&#8208;scale batch manufacturing of practical magneto&#8211;electronic and spintronic devices, heralding a new era of technological innovation.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) magnets open landmark horizons in the development of innovative spintronic device architectures. However, their fabrication with large scale poses challenges due to high synthesis temperatures (&gt;500 &#176;C) and difficulties in integrating them with standard complementary metal&#8208;oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology on amorphous substrates such as silicon oxide (SiO2) and silicon nitride (SiNx). Here, a seeded growth technique for crystallizing CrTe2 films on amorphous SiNx/Si and SiO2/Si substrates with a low thermal budget is presented. This fabrication process optimizes large&#8208;scale, granular atomic layers on amorphous substrates, yielding a substantial coercivity of 11.5 kilo&#8208;oersted, attributed to weak intergranular exchange coupling. Field&#8208;driven N&#233;el&#8208;type stripe domain dynamics explain the amplified coercivity. Moreover, the granular CrTe2 devices on Si wafers display significantly enhanced magnetoresistance, more than doubling that of single&#8208;crystalline counterparts. Current&#8208;assisted magnetization switching, enabled by a substantial spin&#8211;orbit torque with a large spin Hall angle (85) and spin Hall conductivity (1.02 &#215; &#8201;107 &#8463;/2e&#8201; &#937;&#8315;&#185;&#8201; m&#8315;&#185;), is also demonstrated. These observations underscore the proficiency in manipulating crystallinity within integrated 2D magnetic films on Si wafers, paving the way for large&#8208;scale batch manufacturing of practical magnetoelectronic and spintronic devices, heralding a new era of technological innovation.

         <title>Stainless Steel Activation for Efficient Alkaline Oxygen Evolution in Advanced Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By&#160;cycling the stainless steel (SS) electrode within a potential window that encompasses the Fe(II)&#8596;Fe(III) process, its oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity can be enhanced to a great extent compared to pristine electrodes or using a potential window that excludes this redox reaction. Inspired by this observation, a potential&#8208;pulse strategy is then proposed to regenerate the OER activity of SS for its use in electrolyzers powered by intermittent electricity.








Abstract
Designing robust and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for efficient alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great significance in the field of water electrolysis. In this study, an electrochemical strategy to activate stainless steel (SS) electrodes for efficient OER is introduced. By&#160;cycling the SS electrode within a potential window that encompasses the Fe(II)&#8596;Fe(III) process, its OER activity can be enhanced to a great extent compared to using a potential window that excludes this redox reaction, decreasing the overpotential at current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 by 40&#160;mV. Electrochemical characterization, Inductively Coupled Plasma &#8211; Optical Emission Spectroscopy, and operando Raman measurements demonstrate that the Fe leaching at the SS surface can be accelerated through a Fe &#8594; &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 &#8594; Fe3O4 or FeO &#8594; Fe2+ (aq.) conversion process, leading to the sustained exposure of Cr and Ni species. While Cr leaching occurs during its oxidation process, Ni species display higher resistance to leaching and gradually accumulate on the SS surface in the form of OER&#8208;active Fe&#8208;incorporated NiOOH species. Furthermore, a potential&#8208;pulse strategy is also introduced to regenerate the OER&#8208;activity of 316&#8208;type SS for stable OER, both in the three&#8208;electrode configuration (without performance decay after 300&#160;h at 350&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and in an alkaline water electrolyzer (&#8776;30&#160;mV cell voltage increase after accelerated stress test&#8208;AST). The AST&#8208;stabilized cell can still reach 1000 and 4000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at cell voltages of 1.69 and 2.1&#160;V, which makes it competitive with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolyzers based on ion&#8208;exchange membrane using Ir&#8208;based anodes.

         <title>22% Record Efficiency in Nanorod Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Achieved by Gradient Shells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency nanorod light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diodes (NR&#8208;LEDs) are fabricated using CdSe/CdZnSe/CdZnS/ZnS core/shell nanorods. The gradient alloyed CdZnSe/CdZnS shell effectively suppresses the electron delocalization and reduces hole injection barrier compared with conventional CdS shell. Therefore, the NRs exhibit near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield and a high degree of linear polarization. The NR&#8208;LEDs show record external quantum efficiency, high brightness, and high current efficiency simultaneously.








Abstract
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on isotropic quantum dots has approached the theoretical limit of close to 20%. Anisotropic nanorods can break this limit by taking advantage of their directional emission. However, the progress towards higher EQE by using CdSe/CdS nanorods (NRs) faces several challenges, primarily involving the low quantum yield and unbalanced charge injection in devices. Herein, the seeded growth method is modified and anisotropic nanorods are obtained with photoluminescence quantum yield up to 98% by coating a gradient alloyed CdZnSe shell around conventional spherical CdSe seeds. This intermediate alloyed CdZnSe shell combined with a subsequent rod&#8208;shaped CdZnS/ZnS shell can effectively suppress the electron delocalization in the typical CdSe/CdS nanorods due to their small conduction bandgap offset. Additionally, this alloyed shell can reduce the hole&#8208;injection barrier and create a larger barrier for electron injection, both effects promoting a balanced injection of electrons and holes in LEDs. Hence, LEDs are reached with high brightness (160341&#160;cd m&#8722;2) and high efficiency (EQE = 22%, current efficiency = 23.19&#160;cd A&#8722;1), which are the highest values to date for nanorod LEDs.

         <title>Touchless Thermosensation Enabled by Flexible Infrared Photothermoelectric Detector for Temperature Pre&#8208;Warning Function of Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Artificial skin, endowed with the capability to perceive thermal stimuli without physical contact, will bring innovative interactive experiences into smart robotics and augmented reality. The implementation of touchless thermosensation, responding to both hot and cold stimuli, relies on the construction of a flexible infrared detector operating in the long&#8208;wavelength infrared range to capture the spontaneous thermal radiation. This imposes rigorous requirements on the photodetection performance and mechanical flexibility of the detector. Herein, we present a flexible and wearable infrared detector, on basis of the photothermoelectric coupling of the tellurium&#8208;based thermoelectric multilayer film and the infrared&#8208;absorbing polyimide substrate. By suppressing the optical reflection loss and aligning the destructive interference position with the absorption peak of polyimide, the fabricated thermopile detector exhibits high sensitivity to the thermal radiation over a broad source temperature range from &#8211;50 to 110&#160;&#176;C, even capable of resolving 0.05&#160;&#176;C temperature change. Spatially&#8208;resolved radiation distribution sensing is also achieved by constructing an integrated thermopile array. Furthermore, we demonstrate an established temperature pre&#8208;warning system for soft robotic gripper, enabling the identification of noxious thermal stimuli in a contactless manner. This work offers a feasible strategy to integrate the infrared detection technique into the sensory modality of electronic skin.

This review surveys recent progress and proposes future prospects on 2D ferroic materials for nonvolatile memory applications, including 2D spintronic devices, 2D ferroelectric devices, and 2D multiferroic devices.








Abstract
The emerging nonvolatile memory technologies based on ferroic materials are promising for producing high&#8208;speed, low&#8208;power, and high&#8208;density memory in the field of&#160;integrated circuits. Long&#8208;range ferroic orders observed in 2D materials have triggered extensive research interest in 2D magnets, 2D ferroelectrics, 2D multiferroics, and their device applications. Devices based on 2D ferroic materials and heterostructures with an atomically smooth interface and ultrathin thickness have exhibited impressive properties and significant potential for developing advanced nonvolatile memory. In this context, a systematic review of emergent 2D ferroic materials is conducted here, emphasizing their recent research on nonvolatile memory applications, with a view to proposing brighter prospects for 2D magnetic materials, 2D ferroelectric materials, 2D multiferroic materials, and their relevant devices.

         <title>Gradiently Foaming Ultrasoft Hydrogel with Stop Holes for Highly Deformable, Crack&#8208;Resistant and Sensitive Conformal Human&#8208;Machine Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Hydrogels are considered as promising materials for human&#8208;machine interfaces owing to their merits of tailorable mechanical and electrical properties; nevertheless, it remains challenging to simultaneously achieve ultrasoftness, good mechanical robustness and high sensitivity, which are the pre&#8208;requisite requirements for wearable sensing applications. Herein, for the first time, we propose a universal phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced bubbling strategy to fabricate ultrasoft gradient foam&#8208;shaped hydrogels (FSHs) with stop holes for high deformability, crack&#8208;resistance and sensitive conformal HMIs. As a typical system, the FSH based on polyacrylamide/sodium alginate system shows an ultralow Young's modulus (1.68&#160;kPa), increased sustainable strain (1411%), enhanced fracture toughness (915.6 J/m2), improved tensile sensitivity (21.77) and compressive sensitivity (65.23 kPa&#8722;1). The FSHs are used for precisely acquiring and identifying gesture commands of the operator to remotely control a surgical robot for endoscopy and an electric ship in a first&#8208;person perspective for cruising, feeding crabs and monitoring the environmental change in real&#8208;time.

         <title>Achieving Bright and Long&#8208;Lived Aqueous Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Carbon Nitrogen Dots Through In&#8208;Situ Host&#8208;Guest Binding</title>

Abstract
The development of bright and long&#8208;lived aqueous room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials holds paramount importance in broadening the application scope of RTP material system. However, the conventional RTP materials usually exhibit low efficiency and short lifetime in aqueous solution. Herein, we proposed an in&#8208;situ host&#8208;guest strategy to achieve cyanuric acid&#8208;derived phosphorescent carbon nitrogen dots composite (CNDs@CA) that demonstrates a significant enhancement of both quantum yield (QY) and lifetime mediated by water. Detailed investigations reveal that the robust hydrogen bonding networks between CNDs@CA and water effectively stabilizes triplet excitons and suppresses non&#8208;radiative decays, as well as facilitate efficient energy transfer from CA to CNDs, thereby prolonging the lifetime and enhancing the efficiency of RTP. The phosphorescent QY and lifetime of CNDs@CA can be increased to 26.89% (3.9&#8208;fold increase) and 951.25&#160;ms (5.5&#8208;fold increase), respectively, with the incorporation of 50 wt% water under ambient conditions. Even in fully aqueous environments (with up to 400 wt% water added), CNDs@CA exhibits persistent water&#8208;boosted RTP properties, demonstrating exceptional stability. The robust water&#8208;boosted RTP property of CNDs@CA in aqueous solutions presented significant potential for high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio afterglow bioimaging as well as advanced information encryption.

&lt;p&gt;The development of bright and long-lived aqueous room-temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials holds paramount importance in broadening the application scope of RTP material system. However, the conventional RTP materials usually exhibit low efficiency and short lifetime in aqueous solution. Herein, we proposed an in-situ host-guest strategy to achieve cyanuric acid-derived phosphorescent carbon nitrogen dots composite (CNDs@CA) that demonstrates a significant enhancement of both quantum yield (QY) and lifetime mediated by water. Detailed investigations reveal that the robust hydrogen bonding networks between CNDs@CA and water effectively stabilizes triplet excitons and suppresses non-radiative decays, as well as facilitate efficient energy transfer from CA to CNDs, thereby prolonging the lifetime and enhancing the efficiency of RTP. The phosphorescent QY and lifetime of CNDs@CA can be increased to 26.89% (3.9-fold increase) and 951.25&#160;ms (5.5-fold increase), respectively, with the incorporation of 50 wt% water under ambient conditions.

         <title>Self&#8208;Timed and Spatially&#8208;Targeted Delivery of Chemical Cargo by Motile Liquid Crystal</title>

Abstract
A key challenge underlying the design of miniature machines is encoding materials with time&#8208; and space&#8208;specific functional behaviors that require little human intervention. Dissipative processes that drive materials beyond equilibrium and evolve continuously with time and location represent one promising strategy to achieve such complex functions. Here we report how internal non&#8208;equilibrium states of liquid crystal (LC) emulsion droplets undergoing chemotaxis can be used to time the delivery of a chemical agent to a targeted location. During ballistic motion, hydrodynamic shear forces dominate LC elastic interactions, dispersing micodroplet inclusions (microcargo) within double emulsion droplets. Scale&#8208;dependent colloidal forces then hinder the escape of dispersed microcargo from the propelling droplet. Upon arrival at the targeted location, a circulatory flow of diminished strength triggers the microcargo to cluster within the LC elastic environment such that hydrodynamic forces grow to exceed colloidal forces and thus trigger the escape of the microcargo. We illustrate the approach by using microcargo that initiate polymerization upon release through the outer interface of the carrier droplet. These findings provide a platform that utilizes non&#8208;equilibrium strategies to design autonomous spatial and temporal functions into active materials.

         <title>Reduction of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)Furan at High Current Density Using a Ga&#8208;doped AgCu:Cationomer Hybrid Electrocatalyst</title>

Abstract
Hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived chemicals is of interest for the production of biofuels and valorized chemicals. Thermochemical processes for biomass reduction typically employ hydrogen as the reductant at elevated temperatures and pressures. Here we investigate direct electrified reduction of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to a precursor to bio&#8208;polymers, 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF). Noting a limited current density in prior reports of this transformation, we investigated the use of a hybrid catalyst consisting of ternary metal nanodendrites mixed with a cationic ionomer, the latter purposed to increase local pH and facilitate surface proton diffusion. We found that the approach, when implemented using Ga&#8208;doped Ag&#8208;Cu electrocatalysts designed for p&#8208;d orbital hybridization, steered selectivity to BHMF, achieving a faradaic efficiency of 58% at 100&#160;mA/cm2 and a production rate of 1&#160;mmol/cm2/h, this latter a doubling in rate compared to the best prior reports.

         <title>Sprayable Hydrogel Sealant for Gastrointestinal Wound Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Naturally occurring internal bleeding, such as in stomach ulcers, and complications following interventions, like polyp resection post&#8208;colonoscopy, may result in delayed (5&#8208;7 days) post&#8208;operative adverse events&#8212;such as bleeding, intestinal wall perforation, and leakage. Current solutions for controlling intra&#8208; and post&#8208;procedural complications are limited in effectiveness. Hemostatic powders only provide a temporary solution due to their short&#8208;term adhesion to GI mucosal tissues (less than 48 hours). In this study, we developed a sprayable adhesive hydrogel for facile application and sustained adhesion to GI lesions using clinically available endoscopes. Upon spraying, the biomaterial (based on polyethyleneimine&#8208;modified Pluronic&#174; micelles precursor and oxidized dextran) instantly gels upon contact with the tissue, forming an adhesive shield. In vitro and in vivo studies in guinea pigs, rabbits, and pig models confirm the safety and efficacy of this biomaterial in colonic and acidic stomach lesions. Our findings highlight that this family of hydrogels ensures prolonged tissue protection (3&#8208;7 days), facilitates wound healing, and minimizes the risk of delayed complications&#8212;a readily adoptable approach for gastrointestinal wound management.

         <title>&#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking Modulation via Polymer Adsorption for Elongated Exciton Diffusion in High&#8208;Efficiency Thick&#8208;Film Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study addresses the challenge of maintaining efficiency in thick&#8208;film organic solar cells (OSCs). A novel polymer adsorption strategy that regulates molecular stacking, leading to enhanced intermolecular interactions. A reduction in trap states and an elongation in exciton diffusion length, resulting in a remarkable increase in power conversion efficiency in thick&#8208;film OSCs, is achieved.








Abstract
Developing efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) with thick active layers is crucial for roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll printing. However, thicker layers often result in lower efficiency. This study tackles this challenge using a polymer adsorption strategy combined with a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer approach. Incorporating insulator polystyrene (PS) into the PM6:L8&#8208;BO system creates PM6+PS:L8&#8208;BO blends, effectively suppressing trap states and extending exciton diffusion length in the mixed donor domain. Adding insulating polymers with benzene rings to the donor enhances &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of donors, boosting intermolecular interactions and electron wave function overlap. This results in more orderly molecular stacking, longer exciton lifetimes, and higher diffusion lengths. The promoted long&#8208;range exciton diffusion leads to high power conversion efficiencies of 19.05% and 18.15% for PM6+PS:L8&#8208;BO blend films with 100 and 300&#160;nm thickness, respectively, as well as a respectable 16.00% for 500&#160;nm. These insights guide material selection for better exciton diffusion, and offer a method for thick&#8208;film OSC fabrication, promoting a prosperous future for practical OSC mass production.

         <title>Polymeric Conductive Adhesive based Ultrathin Epidermal Electrodes for Long&#8208;term Monitoring of Electrophysiological Signals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrophysiology, exploring vital electrical phenomena in living organisms, anticipates broader integration into daily life through wearable devices. However, addressing the challenges of electrode durability and motion artifacts is essential to enable continuous and long&#8208;term biopotential signal monitoring, presenting a hurdle for its seamless implementation in daily life. To address these challenges, we present an ultrathin poly(3,4&#8208; ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate)/polyvinyl alcohol/d&#8208;sorbitol (PPd) electrode with enhanced adhesion, stretchability, and skin conformability. It was designed according to the theoretical criteria for skin&#8208;conformal electrodes based on the mechanical analysis of epidermal electronics. Thus, we obtained impedance stability over 1&#8208;week of daily life, and the PPd electrode addresses the challenges related to durability during prolonged usage.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrophysiology, exploring vital electrical phenomena in living organisms, anticipates broader integration into daily life through wearable devices. However, addressing the challenges of electrode durability and motion artifacts is essential to enable continuous and long-term biopotential signal monitoring, presenting a hurdle for its seamless implementation in daily life. To address these challenges, we present an ultrathin poly(3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate)/polyvinyl alcohol/d-sorbitol (PPd) electrode with enhanced adhesion, stretchability, and skin conformability. It was designed according to the theoretical criteria for skin-conformal electrodes based on the mechanical analysis of epidermal electronics. Thus, we obtained impedance stability over 1-week of daily life, and the PPd electrode addresses the challenges related to durability during prolonged usage. Proving stability in electromyography (EMG) signals during high-intensity exercise, our wireless PPd measurement system exhibits high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals even in situations involving significant and repetitive skin deformation. Throughout continuous 1 week-long electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring in daily life, the system consistently preserves signal quality, underscoring the heightened durability and applicability of the PPd measurement system.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Self&#8208;Propulsion by Directed Explosive Emulsification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternative approach is introduced to create active droplets through a simple process of inducing symmetry&#8208;breaking oversaturation at the interface assembly. The partially oversaturated interfacial packing structure causes the asymmetrical explosive emulsification behavior and enables the directional movement of the droplet. The process exhibits autonomy, repeatability, and versatility in handling diverse nanoparticle compositions, making it highly promising for self&#8208;propulsion applications.








Abstract
An active droplet system, programmed to repeatedly move autonomously at a specific velocity in a well&#8208;defined direction, is demonstrated. Coulombic energy is stored in oversaturated interfacial assemblies of charged nanoparticle&#8208;surfactants by an applied DC electric field and can be released on demand. Spontaneous emulsification is suppressed by an increase in the stiffness of the oversaturated assemblies. Rapidly removing the field releases the stored energy in an explosive event that propels the droplet, where thousands of charged microdroplets are ballistically ejected from the surface of the parent droplet. The ejection is made directional by a symmetry breaking of the interfacial assembly, and the combined interaction force of the microdroplet plume on one side of the droplet propels the droplet distances tens of times its size, making the droplet active. The propulsion is autonomous, repeatable, and agnostic to the chemical composition of the nanoparticles. The symmetry&#8208;breaking in the nanoparticle assembly controls the microdroplet velocity and direction of propulsion. This mechanism of droplet propulsion will advance soft micro&#8208;robotics, establishes a new type of active matter, and introduces new vehicles for compartmentalized delivery.

         <title>Simple&#8208;Structured Acceptor with Highly Interconnected Electron&#8208;Transport Pathway Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transport plays a significant role in determining the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, a highly interconnected electron&#8208;transport pathway in simple&#8208;structured nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptor (NFREA) is achieved by manipulating the alkyl&#8208;chain topology. Therefore, the 3TTB&#8208;4F with branched alkyl side&#8208;chains demonstrates a record&#8208;breaking power conversion efficiency of 17.38% (certified 16.59%), establishing it as the highest efficiency among NFREA&#8208;based OSCs.








Abstract
Achieving desirable charge&#8208;transport highway is of vital importance for high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, it is shown how molecular packing arrangements can be regulated via tuning the alkyl&#8208;chain topology, thus resulting in a 3D network stacking and highly interconnected pathway for electron transport in a simple&#8208;structured nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptor (NFREA) with branched alkyl side&#8208;chains. As a result, a record&#8208;breaking power conversion efficiency of 17.38% (certificated 16.59%) is achieved for NFREA&#8208;based devices, thus providing an opportunity for constructing low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.

         <title>Revealing Seed&#8208;mediated Structural Evolution of Copper&#8208;Silicide Nanostructures: Generating Structured Current Collectors for Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Metal silicide thin films and nanostructures typically employed in electronics have recently gained significant attention in battery technology, where they are used as active or inactive materials. However, unlike thin films, the science behind the evolution of silicide nanostructures, especially 1&#8208;D Nanowires (NWs), is a key missing aspect. CuxSiy nanostructures synthesized by solvent vapor growth technique (SVG) are studied as a model system to gain insights into metal silicide formation. The temperature&#8208;dependent phase evolution of CuxSiy structures proceeds from Cu&gt;Cu0.83Si0.17&gt;Cu5Si&gt;Cu15Si4. The role of Cu diffusion kinetics on the morphological progression of Cu silicides is studied, revealing that the growth of 1D metal silicide NWs proceeds through an in&#8208;situ formed, Cu seed&#8208;mediated, self&#8208;catalytic process. The different CuxSiy morphologies synthesized were utilized as structured current collectors (CC) for K&#8208;ion battery anodes. Sb deposited by thermal evaporation upon Cu15Si4 tripod NWs and cube architectures exhibited reversible alloying capacities of 477.3 and 477.6 mAh/g at a C/5 rate. Furthermore, Sb deposited Cu15Si4 tripod NWs anode tested in Li&#8208;ion and Na&#8208;ion batteries demonstrated reversible capacities of &#8764;518 mAh/g and 495 mAh/g.

Abstract
Lightweight, low&#8208;cost metasurfaces and reflectarrays that are easy to stow and deploy are desirable for many terrestrial and space&#8208;based communications and sensing applications. This work demonstrates a lightweight, flexible metasurface platform based on flat&#8208;knit textiles operating in the cm&#8208;wave spectral range. By using a colorwork knitting approach called float&#8208;jacquard knitting to directly integrate an array of resonant metallic antennas into a textile, we realize two textile reflectarray devices, a metasurface lens (metalens) and a vortex&#8208;beam generator. Operating as a receiving antenna, the metalens focuses a collimated normal&#8208;incidence beam to a diffraction&#8208;limited, off&#8208;broadside focal spot. Operating as a transmitting antenna, the metalens converts the divergent emission from a horn antenna into a collimated beam with peak measured directivity, gain, and efficiency of 21.30&#160;dB, 15.30&#160;dB, and &#8211;6.00&#160;dB (25.12%), respectively. The vortex&#8208;beam generating metasurface produces a focused vortex beam with a topological charge of m = 1 over a wide frequency range of 4.1&#8208;5.8&#160;GHz. Strong specular reflection is observed for our textile reflectarrays, caused by wavy yarn floats on the backside of the float&#8208;jacquard textiles. Our work demonstrates a novel approach for scalable production of flexible metasurfaces by leveraging commercially available yarns and well&#8208;established knitting machinery and techniques.

         <title>Wireless Bioelectronics for In Vivo Pressure Monitoring with Mechanically&#8208;compliant Hydrogel Biointerfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recent electronics&#8208;tissues biointefacing technology has offered unprecedented opportunities for long&#8208;term disease diagnosis and treatment. It remains a grand challenge to robustly anchor the pressure sensing bioelectronics onto specific organs, since the periodically&#8208;varying stress generated by normal biological processes may pose high risk of interfacial failures. Here, we&#160;report a general yet reliable approach to achieve the robust hydrogel interface between wireless pressure sensor and biological tissues/organs, featuring highly desirable mechanical compliance and swelling resistance, despite the direct contact with biofluids and dynamic conditions. The sensor is operated wirelessly through inductive coupling, characterizing minimal hysteresis, fast response times, excellent stability and robustness, thus allowing for easy handling and eliminating the necessity for surgical extraction after a functional period. We&#160;have demonstrated the operation of the wireless sensor with a custom&#8208;made pressure sensing model and In Vivo intracranial pressure monitoring in rats. This technology may be advantageous in real&#8208;time post&#8208;operative monitoring of various biological inner pressures after the reconstructive surgery, thus guaranteeing the timely treatment of lethal&#160;diseases.

         <title>Antigen Presenting Cell Mimetic Lipid Nanoparticles for Rapid mRNA CAR T Cell Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
CAR T cell therapy has achieved remarkable clinical success for the treatment of hematological malignancies. However, producing these bespoke cancer&#8208;killing cells is a complicated ex vivo process involving leukapheresis, artificial T cell activation, and CAR construct introduction. The activation step requires the engagement of CD3/TCR and CD28 and is vital for T cell transfection and differentiation. Though antigen presenting cells facilitate activation in vivo, ex vivo activation relies on antibodies against CD3 and CD28 conjugated to magnetic beads. While effective, this artificial activation adds to the complexity of CAR T cell production as the beads must be removed prior to clinical implementation. To overcome this challenge, this work develops activating lipid nanoparticles (aLNPs) that mimic antigen presenting cells to combine the activation of magnetic beads and the transfection capabilities of LNPs. It is shown that aLNPs enable one&#8208;step activation and transfection of primary human T cells with the resulting mRNA CAR T cells reducing tumor burden in a murine xenograft model, validating aLNPs as a promising platform for the rapid production of mRNA CAR T cells.

         <title>Ultraflexible Temperature&#8208;Strain Dual&#8208;Sensor Based on Chalcogenide Glass&#8208;Polymer Film for Human&#8208;Machine Interaction</title>

Abstract
Skin&#8208;like thermoelectric (TE) films with temperature&#8208; and strain&#8208;sensing functions are highly desirable for human&#8208;machine interaction systems and wearable devices. However, current TE films still face challenges in achieving high flexibility and excellent sensing performance simultaneously. Herein, for the first time, we propose a facile roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll strategy to fabricate an ultraflexible chalcogenide glass&#8208;polytetrafluoroethylene composite film with superior temperature&#8208; and strain&#8208;sensing performance. The unique reticular network of the composite film endows it with efficient Seebeck effect and flexibility, leading to a high Seebeck coefficient (731 &#956;V/K), rapid temperature response (&#8764;0.7 s), and excellent strain sensitivity (gauge factor = 836). Based on this high&#8208;performance composite film, an intelligent robotic hand for action feedback and temperature alarm was fabricated, demonstrating its great potential in human&#8208;machine interaction. Such TE film fabrication strategy not only brings new inspiration for wearable inorganic TE devices, but also sets the stage for a wide implementation of multifunctional human&#8208;machine interaction systems.

         <title>Phase Engineered CuxS&#8211;Ag2S with Photothermoelectric Activity for Enhanced Multienzyme Activity and Dynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The insufficient exposure sites and active site competition of multienzyme are the two main factors to hinder its therapeutic effect. Here, we design and prepare a phase&#8208;junction nanomaterial (amorphous&#8208;crystalline CuxS&#8722;Ag2S) through a simple room temperature ion&#8208;exchange process. A small amount of Ag+ is added into Cu7S4 nanocrystals, which transforms Cu7S4 into amorphous phased CuxS and produces crystalline Ag2S simultaneously. In this structure, the overhanging bonds on the amorphous CuxS surface provide abundant active sites for optimizing the therapeutic activity. Meanwhile, the amorphous state enhances the photothermal effect through non&#8208;radiative relaxation, and due to its low thermal resistance, phase&#8208;junction CuxS&#8722;Ag2S forms a significant temperature gradient to unlock the optimized thermo&#8208;electrodynamic therapy. Furthermore, benefiting from the high asymmetry of the amorphous state, the material forms a spin&#8208;polarized state that can effectively inhibit electron&#8208;hole recombination. In this way, the thermoelectric effect can facilitate the enzyme&#8208;catalyzed cycle by providing electrons and holes, enabling an enhanced coupling of thermoelectric therapy with multienzyme activity, which induces excellent anti&#8208;tumor performance. More importantly, the catalytic process simulated by density&#8208;functional theory proves that Ag+ alleviates the burden on the Cu sites through favorable adsorption of O2 and prevents active site competition.

         <title>Overcoming the Unfavorable Effects of &#8220;Boltzmann Tyranny&#8221;: Ultra&#8208;Low Subthreshold Swing in Organic Phototransistors via One&#8208;Transistor&#8208;One&#8208;Memristor Architecture</title>

Abstract
Organic phototransistors (OPTs), as photosensitive organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), have gained significant attention due to their pivotal roles in imaging, optical communication, and night vision. However, their performance has been fundamentally limited by the Boltzmann distribution of charge carriers, which constrains the average subthreshold swing (SSave) to a minimum of 60&#160;mV/decade at room temperature. In this study, we propose an innovative one&#8208;transistor&#8208;one&#8208;memristor (1T1R) architecture to overcome the Boltzmann limit in conventional OFETs. By replacing the source electrode in an OFET with a memristor, the 1T1R device exploits the memristor's sharp resistance state transitions to achieve an ultra&#8208;low SSave of 18&#160;mV/decade. Consequently, the 1T1R devices demonstrate remarkable sensitivity to photo illumination, with a high specific detectivity of 3.9 &#215; 109&#160;cm W&#8722;1Hz1/2, outperforming conventional OPTs (4.9 &#215; 104&#160;cm W&#8722;1Hz1/2) by more than four orders of magnitude. The 1T1R architecture presents a potentially universal solution for overcoming the detrimental effects of &#8220;Boltzmann tyranny,&#8221; setting the stage for the development of ultra&#8208;low SSave devices in various optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Supra&#8208;Fluorophores: Ultrabright Fluorescent Supramolecular Assemblies Derived from Conventional Fluorophores in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fluorescent organic nanoparticles (NPs) with exceptional brightness hold significant promise for demanding fluorescence bioimaging applications. Although considerable efforts have been invested in developing novel organic dyes with enhanced performance, augmenting the brightness of conventional fluorophores is still one of the biggest challenges to overcome. In this study, we present a supramolecular strategy for constructing ultrabright fluorescent nanoparticles in aqueous media (referred to as &#8220;Supra&#8208;fluorophores&#8221;) derived from conventional fluorophores. To achieve this, we have employed a cylindrical nanoparticle with a hydrophobic microdomain, assembled by a cyclic peptide&#8208;diblock copolymer conjugate in water, as a supramolecular scaffold. The noncovalent dispersion of fluorophore moieties within the hydrophobic microdomain of the scaffold effectively mitigates the undesired aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and fluorescence quenching by water, resulting in fluorescent NPs with high brightness. This strategy is applicable to a broad spectrum of fluorophore families, covering polyaromatic hydrocarbons, coumarins, boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes, cyanines, xanthenes, and squaraines. The resulting fluorescent NPs demonstrate high fluorescence quantum yield (&gt;30%) and brightness per volume (as high as 12&#8239;060 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 nm&#8722;3). Moreover, high&#8208;performance NPs with emission in the NIR region are constructed, showcasing up to 20&#8208;fold increase in both brightness and photostability. Our Supra&#8208;fluorophore strategy offers a versatile and effective method for transforming existing fluorophores into ultrabright fluorescent NPs in aqueous environments, for applications such as bioimaging.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fluorescent organic nanoparticles (NPs) with exceptional brightness hold significant promise for demanding fluorescence bioimaging applications. Although considerable efforts have been invested in developing novel organic dyes with enhanced performance, augmenting the brightness of conventional fluorophores is still one of the biggest challenges to overcome. In this study, we present a supramolecular strategy for constructing ultrabright fluorescent nanoparticles in aqueous media (referred to as &#8220;Supra-fluorophores&#8221;) derived from conventional fluorophores. To achieve this, we have employed a cylindrical nanoparticle with a hydrophobic microdomain, assembled by a cyclic peptide-diblock copolymer conjugate in water, as a supramolecular scaffold. The noncovalent dispersion of fluorophore moieties within the hydrophobic microdomain of the scaffold effectively mitigates the undesired aggregation-caused quenching and fluorescence quenching by water, resulting in fluorescent NPs with high brightness. This strategy is applicable to a broad spectrum of fluorophore families, covering polyaromatic hydrocarbons, coumarins, boron-dipyrromethenes, cyanines, xanthenes, and squaraines. The resulting fluorescent NPs demonstrate high fluorescence quantum yield (&amp;gt;30%) and brightness per volume (as high as 12&#8239;060 M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; nm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Moreover, high-performance NPs with emission in the NIR region are constructed, showcasing up to 20-fold increase in both brightness and photostability. Our Supra-fluorophore strategy offers a versatile and effective method for transforming existing fluorophores into ultrabright fluorescent NPs in aqueous environments, for applications such as bioimaging.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Musculoskeletal diseases and injuries are among the leading causes of pain and morbidity worldwide. Broad efforts have focused on developing pro&#8208;regenerative biomaterials to treat musculoskeletal conditions; however, these approaches have yet to make a significant clinical impact. Recent studies have demonstrated that the immune system is central in orchestrating tissue repair and that targeting pro&#8208;regenerative immune responses can improve biomaterial therapeutic outcomes. However, aging is a critical factor negatively affecting musculoskeletal tissue repair and immune function. Hence, understanding how age affects the response to biomaterials is essential for improving musculoskeletal biomaterial therapies. This review focuses on the intersection of the immune system and aging in responding to biomaterials for musculoskeletal tissue repair. The article introduces the general impacts of aging on tissue physiology, the immune system, and the response to biomaterials. Then, it explains how the adaptive immune system guides the response to injury and biomaterial implants in cartilage, muscle, and bone and discusses how aging impacts these processes in each tissue type. The review concludes by highlighting future directions for the development and translation of personalized immunomodulatory biomaterials for musculoskeletal tissue repair.

Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) hold a higher metal atom loading and provide greater flexibility in terms of the structural characteristics of their active sites in comparison to single&#8208;atom catalysts. Consequently, DACs hold great promise for achieving improved catalytic performance. This article aims to provide a focused overview of the latest advancements in DACs, covering their synthesis and mechanisms in reversible oxygen electrocatalysis, which plays a key role in sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies. The discussion starts by highlighting the structures of DACs and the differences in diatomic coordination induced by various substrates. Subsequently, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fabrication strategies of DACs for oxygen electrocatalysis are discussed from several different perspectives. It particularly highlights the challenges of increasing the diatomic loading capacity. More importantly, the main focus of this overview is to investigate the correlation between the configuration and activity in DACs in order to gain a deeper understanding of their active roles in oxygen electrocatalysis. This will be achieved through density functional theory calculations and sophisticated in situ characterization technologies. The aim is to provide guidelines for optimizing and upgrading DACs in oxygen electrocatalysis. Additionally, the overview discusses the current challenges and future prospects in this rapidly evolving area of research.

         <title>All&#8208;Automated Fabrication of Freestanding and Scalable Photo&#8208;Thermoelectric Devices with High Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;automated laser fabrication technique is reported for the preparation of flexible and freestanding photo&#8208;thermoelectric (PTE) devices with single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube films. The achieved PTE devices with a narrow p&#8211;n transition area of 2&#8211;3 &#181;m exhibit high&#8208;performance among the highest level for freestanding&#8208;film&#8208;based PTE devices.








Abstract
Flexible photo&#8208;thermoelectric (PTE) devices have great application prospects in the fields of solar energy conversion, ultrabroadband light detection, etc. A suitable manufacturing process to avoid the substrate effects as well as to create a narrow transition area between p&#8211;n modules for high&#8208;performance freestanding flexible PTE devices is highly desired. Herein, an automated laser fabrication (ALF) method is reported to construct the PTE devices with rylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;doped n&#8208;type single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films. The&#160;wet&#8208;compressing approach is developed to improve the thermoelectric power factors and figure of merit (ZT) of the SWCNT hybrid films. Then, the films are cut and patterned automatically to make PTE devices with various structures by the proposed ALF method. The freestanding PTE device with a narrow transition area of &#8776;2&#8211;3 &#181;m between the p and n modules exhibits a high&#8208;power density of 0.32 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 under the light of 200 mW cm&#8722;2, which is among the highest level for freestanding&#8208;film&#8208;based PTE devices. The results pave the way for the automatic production process of PTE devices for green power generation and ultrabroadband light detection.

         <title>Polymorphic Self&#8208;Assembly with Procedural Flexibility for Monodisperse Quaternary Protein Structures of DegQ Enzymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As smart building blocks, proteins can create quaternary structures in polymorphic configurations determined by soft clients. In the present study, highly monodisperse, one&#8208;way clustering is programmed by the protomer, DegQ, featuring procedural flexibility in the self&#8208;assembly procedure. First high&#8208;resolution cryo&#8208;EM structures of DegQ are presented, validating the feasibility and flexibility of programming proteins with native robot&#8208;like functions.








Abstract
As large molecular tertiary structures, some proteins can act as small robots that find, bind, and chaperone target protein clients, showing the potential to serve as smart building blocks in self&#8208;assembly fields. Instead of using such intrinsic functions, most self&#8208;assembly methodologies for proteins aim for de novo&#8208;designed structures with accurate geometric assemblies, which can limit procedural flexibility. Here, a strategy enabling polymorphic clustering of quaternary proteins, exhibiting simplicity and flexibility of self&#8208;assembling paths for proteins in forming monodisperse quaternary cage particles is presented. It is proposed that the enzyme protomer DegQ, previously solved at low resolution, may potentially be usable as a threefold symmetric building block, which can form polyhedral cages incorporated by the chaperone action of DegQ in the presence of protein clients. To obtain highly monodisperse cage particles, soft, and hence, less resistive client proteins, which can program the inherent chaperone activity of DegQ to efficient formations of polymorphic cages, depending on the size of clients are utilized. By reconstructing the atomic resolution cryogenic electron microscopy DegQ structures using obtained 12&#8208; and 24&#8208;meric clusters, the polymorphic clustering of DegQ enzymes is validated in terms of soft and rigid domains, which will provide effective routes for protein self&#8208;assemblies with procedural flexibility.

         <title>Reversible Surface Engineering of Cellulose Elementary Fibrils: From Ultralong Nanocelluloses to Advanced Cellulosic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible surface engineering of cellulose elementary fibrils not only isolates ultralong cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) from various cellulosic bioresources with a low energy consumption and high&#8208;yield process, but also realizes the fabrication of advanced cellulosic materials through the reconstruction of hydrogen bonds among CNFs after saponification.








Abstract
Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) are supramolecular assemblies of cellulose chains that provide outstanding mechanical support and structural functions for cellulosic organisms. However, traditional chemical pretreatments and mechanical defibrillation of natural cellulose produce irreversible surface functionalization and adverse effects of morphology of the CNFs, respectively, which limit the utilization of CNFs in nanoassembly and surface functionalization. Herein, this work presents a facile and energetically efficient surface engineering strategy to completely exfoliate cellulose elementary fibrils from various bioresources, which provides CNFs with ultrahigh aspect ratios (&#8776;1400) and reversible surface. During the mild process of swelling and esterification, the crystallinity and the morphology of the elementary fibrils are retained, resulting in high yields (98%) with low energy consumption (12.4&#160;kJ g&#8722;1). In particular, on the CNF surface, the surface hydroxyl groups are restored by removal of the carboxyl moieties via saponification, which offers a significant opportunity for reconstitution of stronger hydrogen bonding interfaces. Therefore, the resultant CNFs can be used as sustainable building blocks for construction of multidimensional advanced cellulosic materials, e.g., 1D filaments, 2D films, and 3D aerogels.

     alt="Reversible Surface Engineering of Cellulose Elementary Fibrils: From Ultralong Nanocelluloses to Advanced Cellulosic Materials"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reversible surface engineering of cellulose elementary fibrils not only isolates ultralong cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) from various cellulosic bioresources with a low energy consumption and high-yield process, but also realizes the fabrication of advanced cellulosic materials through the reconstruction of hydrogen bonds among CNFs after saponification.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) are supramolecular assemblies of cellulose chains that provide outstanding mechanical support and structural functions for cellulosic organisms. However, traditional chemical pretreatments and mechanical defibrillation of natural cellulose produce irreversible surface functionalization and adverse effects of morphology of the CNFs, respectively, which limit the utilization of CNFs in nanoassembly and surface functionalization. Herein, this work presents a facile and energetically efficient surface engineering strategy to completely exfoliate cellulose elementary fibrils from various bioresources, which provides CNFs with ultrahigh aspect ratios (&#8776;1400) and reversible surface. During the mild process of swelling and esterification, the crystallinity and the morphology of the elementary fibrils are retained, resulting in high yields (98%) with low energy consumption (12.4&#160;kJ g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). In particular, on the CNF surface, the surface hydroxyl groups are restored by removal of the carboxyl moieties via saponification, which offers a significant opportunity for reconstitution of stronger hydrogen bonding interfaces. Therefore, the resultant CNFs can be used as sustainable building blocks for construction of multidimensional advanced cellulosic materials, e.g., 1D filaments, 2D films, and 3D aerogels. The proposed surface engineering strategy provides a new platform for fully utilizing the characteristics of the cellulose elementary fibrils in the development of high-performance cellulosic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stereo&#8208;hindrance Engineering of a Cation toward &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented 2D Perovskite with Minimized Tilting and High&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray Detection</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional &lt;100&gt;&#8208;oriented Dion&#8208;Jacobson or Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper perovskites have been widely recognized as promising candidates for optoelectronic applications. However, the large interlayer spacing significantly hinders the carrier transport. &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented 2D perovskites naturally exhibit reduced interlayer spacings, but the tilting of metal halide octahedra is typically serious and leads to poor charge transport. Herein, a &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented 2D perovskite EPZPbBr4 (EPZ = 1&#8208;ethylpiperazine) with minimized tilting is designed through A&#8208;site stereo&#8208;hindrance engineering. The piperazine functional group enters the space enclosed by the three [PbBr6]4&#8722; octahedra, pushing Pb&#8208;Br&#8208;Pb closer to a straight line (maximum Pb&#8208;Br&#8208;Pb angle &#8764;180&#176;), suppressing the tilting as well as electron&#8208;phonon coupling. Meanwhile, the ethyl group is located between layers and contributes an extremely reduced effective interlayer distance (2.22 &#197;), further facilitating the carrier transport. As a result, EPZPbBr4 simultaneously demonstrates high &#181;&#964; product (1.8&#215;10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1) and large resistivity (2.17&#215;1010 &#937; cm). The assembled X&#8208;ray detector achieves low dark current of 1.02&#215;10&#8722;10 A cm&#8722;2 and high sensitivity of 1240 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 under the same bias voltage. The realized specific detectivity (ratio of sensitivity to noise current density, 1.23&#215;108 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 A&#8722;1/2) is the highest among all reported perovskite X&#8208;ray detectors.

         <title>Regulating d&#8208;Orbital Hybridization of Subgroup&#8208;IVB Single Atoms for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a common strategy that optimization of the binding energies for the reaction intermediates by tuning the d&#8208;orbital hybridization with axial groups converts inactive subgroup&#8208;IVB (Ti, Zr, Hf) moieties (MN4) into active motifs (MN4O). The optimized catalyst exhibits a favorable adsorption of oxygen reduction reaction intermediates and excellent electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Highly active single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction are crucial for improving the energy conversion efficiency, but they suffer from a limited choice of metal centers and unsatisfactory stabilities. Here, this work reports that optimization of the binding energies for reaction intermediates by tuning the d&#8208;orbital hybridization with axial groups converts inactive subgroup&#8208;IVB (Ti, Zr, Hf) moieties (MN4) into active motifs (MN4O), as confirmed with theoretical calculations. The competition between metal&#8208;ligand covalency and metal&#8208;intermediate covalency affects the d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between the metal site and the intermediates, converting the metal centers into active sites. Subsequently, dispersed single&#8208;atom M sites coordinated by nitrogen/oxygen groups have been prepared on graphene (s&#8208;M&#8208;N/O&#8208;C) catalysts on a large&#8208;scale with high&#8208;energy milling and pyrolysis. Impressively, the s&#8208;Hf&#8208;N/O&#8208;C catalyst with 5.08&#160;wt% Hf exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.920&#160;V and encouraging performance in a zinc&#8208;air battery with an extraordinary cycling life of over 1600&#160;h and a large peak power&#8208;density of 256.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This work provides promising single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts and principles for preparing other catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction.

         <title>Ice&#8208;templated Synthesis of Atomic Cluster Cocatalyst with Regulable Coordination Number for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Supported metal catalysts have been exploited in various applications. Among them, cocatalyst supported on photocatalyst is essential for activation of photocatalysis. However, cocatalyst decoration in a controllable fashion to promote intrinsic activity remains challenging. Herein, we developed a versatile method for cocatalyst synthesis using an ice&#8208;templating (ICT) strategy, resulting in size control from single&#8208;atom (SA), and atomic clusters (AC) to nanoparticles (NP). Importantly, the coordination numbers (CN) of decorated AC cocatalysts are highly controllable, and this ICT method applies to various metals (e.g., Ni, Rh, Pt, and Ru) and photocatalytic substrates (e.g., TiO2, g&#8208;C3N4, CdS, and LTCA). Taking narrow&#8208;band gap Ga&#8208;doped La5Ti2Cu0.9Ag0.1O7S5 (LTCA) photocatalyst as an example, supported Ru AC/LTCA catalysts with regulable Ru CNs have been prepared, delivering significantly enhanced activities compared to Ru SA and Ru NPs supported on LTCA. Specifically, Ru(CN = 3.4) AC/LTCA with an average CN of Ru&#8208;Ru bond measured to be &#8764;3.4 exhibits excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution rate (578&#160;&#956;mol h&#8722;1) under visible light irradiation. Density functional theory calculation (DFT) reveals that the modeled Ru(CN = 3) atomic cluster cocatalyst possesses favorable electronic properties and available active sites for the H2 evolution reaction.

         <title>An Integrated Deposition and Passivation Strategy for Controlled Crystallization of 2D/3D Halide Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
This work introduces a simplified deposition procedure for multidimensional (2D/3D) perovskite thin films, integrating a phenethylammonium chloride (PEACl)&#8208;treatment into the antisolvent step when forming the 3D perovskite. This simultaneous deposition and passivation strategy reduces the number of synthesis steps while simultaneously stabilizing the halide perovskite film and improving the photovoltaic performance of resulting solar cell devices to 20.8%. Using a combination of multimodal in situ and additional ex situ characterizations, it is demonstrated that the introduction of PEACl during the perovskite film formation slows down the crystal growth process, which leads to a narrower grain size distribution and a larger average grain size, thus reducing carrier recombination at grain boundaries and improving the device's performance and stability. The data suggests that during annealing of the wet film, the PEACl diffuses to the surface of the film, forming hydrophobic (quasi&#8208;)2D structures that protect the bulk of the perovskite film from humidity&#8208;induced degradation.

Abstract
Biological materials, although composed of meager minerals and biopolymers, often exhibit amazing mechanical properties far beyond their components due to hierarchically ordered structures. Understanding their structure&#8208;properties relationships and replicating them into artificial materials would boost the development of bulk structural nanocomposites. Layered microstructure widely exists in biological materials, serving as the fundamental structure in nanosheet&#8208;based nacres and nanofiber&#8208;based Bouligand tissues, and implying superior mechanical properties. High&#8208;efficient and scalable fabrication of bioinspired bulk structural nanocomposites with precise layered microstructure is therefore important yet remains difficult. Here, we focus on one straightforward bottom&#8208;up film&#8208;to&#8208;bulk assembly strategy for fabricating bioinspired layered bulk structural nanocomposites. The bottom&#8208;up assembly strategy inherently offers a methodology for precise construction of bioinspired layered microstructure in bulk form, availability for fabrication of bioinspired bulk structural nanocomposites with large sizes and complex shapes, possibility for design of multiscale interfaces, feasibility for manipulation of diverse heterogeneities. Not limited to discussing what has been achieved by using the current bottom&#8208;up film&#8208;to&#8208;bulk assembly strategy, we also envision how to promote such an assembly strategy to better benefit the development of bioinspired bulk structural nanocomposites. Compared to other assembly strategies, the highlighted strategy provides great opportunities for creating bioinspired bulk structural nanocomposites on demand.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Responsive Manganese&#8208;Based Bacterial Materials Synergistically Activate the cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Stimulating the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a crucial strategy by which bacteria activate the tumor immune system. However, the limited stimulation capability poses significant challenges in advancing bacterial immunotherapy. In this study, we successfully engineered an adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;responsive manganese (Mn)&#8208;based bacterial material (E. coli@PDMC&#8208;PEG) that exhibits an exceptional ability to synergistically activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. In the tumor microenvironment, which is characterized by elevated ATP levels, this biohybrid material degrades, resulting in the release of divalent manganese ions (Mn2+) and subsequent bacteria exposure. This combination synergistically activates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, as Mn2+ enhances the sensitivity of cGAS to the extracellular DNA (eDNA) secreted by the bacteria. The results of the in vivo experiments demonstrated that the biohybrid materials E. coli@PDMC&#8208;PEG and VNP20009@PDMC&#8208;PEG effectively inhibited the growth of subcutaneous melanoma in mice and in situ liver cancer in rabbits. Our work provides valuable insights for the development of bacteria&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;responsive Nanostructured Viologen&#8208;Siloxane Materials for Controllable Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Spontaneous phase separation is a promising strategy for the development of novel electronic materials, as the resulting well&#8208;defined morphologies generally exhibit enhanced conductivity. Making these structures adaptive to external stimuli is challenging, yet crucial as multi&#8208;state reconfigurable switching is essential for neuromorphic materials. Here, a modular and scalable approach is presented to obtain switchable phase&#8208;separated viologen&#8208;siloxane nanostructures with sub&#8208;5&#160;nm features. The domain spacing, morphology and conductivity of these materials can be tuned by ion exchange, repeated pulsed photo&#8208;irradiation and electric stimulation. Counterion exchange triggers a post&#8208;synthetic modification in domain spacing of up to 10%. Additionally, in some cases, 2D to 1D order&#8208;order transitions were observed with the latter exhibiting a 7&#8208;fold decrease in conductivity with respect to their 2D lamellar counterparts. Moreover, the combination of the viologen core with tetraphenylborate counterions enables reversible and in situ reduction upon light irradiation. This light&#8208;driven reduction provides access to a continuum of conducting states, reminiscent of long&#8208;term potentiation. The repeated voltage sweeps improve the nanostructures alignment, leading to increased conductivity in a learning effect. Overall, these results highlight the adaptivity of phase&#8208;separated nanostructures for the next generation of organic electronics, with exciting applications in smart sensors and neuromorphic devices.

         <title>Synergizing Pyroelectric Catalysis and Enzyme Catalysis: Establishing a Reciprocal and Synergistic Model to Enhance Anti&#8208;Tumor Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanozyme activity is greatly weakened by the microenvironments and multidrug resistance of tumor cells. Hence, we developed a bi&#8208;catalytic nanoplatform, which promotes the anti&#8208;tumor activity through &#8220;charging empowerment&#8221; and &#8220;mutual complementation&#8221; processes involved in enzymatic and pyroelectric catalysis, by loading ultra&#8208;small nanoparticles (USNPs) of pyroelectric ZnSnO3 onto MXene nanozyme (V2CTx nanosheets). Here, the V2CTx nanosheets exhibit enhanced peroxidase activity by reacting V3+ with H2O2 to generate toxic &#183;OH, accelerated by the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light mediated heat effect. The resulting V4+ is then converted to V3+ by oxidizing endogenous glutathione (GSH), realizing an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed cycle. However, the cycle will lose its persistence once GSH is insufficient; nevertheless, the pyroelectric charges generated by ZnSnO3 USNPs continuously support the V4+/V3+ conversion and ensure nanoenzyme durability. Moreover, the hyperthermia arising from the V2CTx nanosheets by NIR irradiation results in an ideal local temperature gradient for the ZnSnO3 USNPs, giving rise to an excellent pyroelectric catalytic effect by promoting band bending. Furthermore, polarized charges increase the tumor cell membrane permeability and facilitate nanodrug accumulation, thereby resolving the multidrug resistance issue. Thus, the combination of pyroelectric and enzyme catalysis together with the photothermal effect solves the dilemma of nanozymes and improves the antitumor efficiency.

         <title>Locally Concentrated Deep Eutectic Liquids Electrolytes for Low&#8208;Polarization Aluminum Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Low&#8208;cost and nontoxic deep eutectic liquid electrolytes (DELEs), such as [AlCl3]1.3[Urea] (AU), are promising for rechargeable non&#8208;aqueous aluminum metal batteries (AMBs). However, their high viscosity and sluggish ion transport at room temperature lead to high cell polarization and low specific capacity, limiting their practical application. Herein, non&#8208;solvating 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene (dFBn) is proposed as a co&#8208;solvent of DELEs using AU as model to construct a locally concentrated deep eutectic liquid electrolyte (LC&#8208;DELE). dFBn effectively improves the fluidity and ion transport without affecting the ionic dynamics in the electrolyte. Moreover, dFBn also modifies the solid electrolyte interphase growing on the aluminum metal anodes and reduces the interfacial resistance. As a result, the lifespan of Al/Al cells is improved from 210&#160;h to 2000&#160;h, and the cell polarization is reduced from 0.36 to 0.14&#160;V at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The rate performance of Al&#8208;graphite cells is greatly improved with a polarization reduction of 0.15 and 0.74&#160;V at 0.1 and 1 A g&#8722;1, respectively. The initial discharge capacity of Al&#8208;sulfur cells is improved from 94 to 1640 mAh g&#8722;1. This work provides a feasible solution to the high polarization of AMBs employing DEL&#8208;based electrolytes and a new path to high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost AMBs.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Driven Proton Sponge Nano&#8208;Assembly for Imaging and Triggering Lysosome&#8208;Regulated Immunogenic Cancer Cell Death</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton sponge nano&#8208;assembly (PSNA) is optimized with self&#8208;assembly dependent fluorescence, positive charge density, and cell cytotoxicity. PSNA triggers immunogenic cell death (e.g., pyroptosis and necroptosis) of tumor cells, followed by the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens, danger&#8208;associated molecular patterns, and pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines and the stimulation of dendritic cells by these molecules.








Abstract
Triggering lysosome&#8208;regulated immunogenic cell death (ICD, e.g., pyroptosis and necroptosis) with nanomedicines is an emerging approach for turning an &#8220;immune&#8208;cold&#8221; tumor &#8220;hot&#8221;&#8212;a key challenge faced by cancer immunotherapies. Proton sponge such as high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight branched polyethylenimine (PEI) is excellent at rupturing lysosomes, but its therapeutic application is hindered by uncontrollable toxicity due to fixed charge density and poor understanding of resulted cell death mechanism. Here, a series of proton sponge nano&#8208;assemblies (PSNAs) with self&#8208;assembly controllable surface charge density and cell cytotoxicity are created. Such PSNAs are constructed via low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight branched PEI covalently bound to self&#8208;assembling peptides carrying tetraphenylethene pyridinium (PyTPE, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission&#8208;based luminogen). Assembly of PEI assisted by the self&#8208;assembling peptide&#8208;PyTPE leads to enhanced surface positive charges and cell cytotoxicity of PSNA. The self&#8208;assembly tendency of PSNAs is further optimized by tuning hydrophilic and hydrophobic components within the peptide, thus resulting in the PSNA with the highest fluorescence, positive surface charge density, cell uptake, and cancer cell cytotoxicity. Systematic cell death mechanistic studies reveal that the lysosome rupturing&#8208;regulated pyroptosis and necroptosis are at least two causes of cell death. Tumor cells undergoing PSNA&#8208;triggered ICD activate immune cells, suggesting the great potential of PSNAs to trigger anticancer immunity.

&lt;p&gt;Proton sponge nano-assembly (PSNA) is optimized with self-assembly dependent fluorescence, positive charge density, and cell cytotoxicity. PSNA triggers immunogenic cell death (e.g., pyroptosis and necroptosis) of tumor cells, followed by the release of tumor-associated antigens, danger-associated molecular patterns, and pro-inflammatory cytokines and the stimulation of dendritic cells by these molecules.

         <title>Bioresorbable Multilayer Organic&#8211;Inorganic Films for Bioelectronic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an organic&#8211;inorganic multilayer design strategy for bioresorbable encapsulating structures that serve as water barriers for electronic systems. This approach not only protects implantable electronic devices from biofluids to ensure reliable operational performance but also enables favorable degradation after a desired period of use. This materials system&#160;may find broad and immediate applications for a range of practical electronic devices that are capable of resorption in biological and environmental settings.








Abstract
Bioresorbable electronic devices as temporary biomedical implants represent an emerging class of technology relevant to a range of patient conditions currently addressed with technologies that require surgical explantation after a desired period of use. Obtaining reliable performance and favorable degradation behavior demands materials that can serve as biofluid barriers in encapsulating structures that avoid premature degradation of active electronic components. Here, this work presents a materials design that addresses this need, with properties in water impermeability, mechanical flexibility, and processability that are superior to alternatives. The approach uses multilayer assemblies of alternating films of polyanhydride and silicon oxynitride formed by spin&#8208;coating and plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition , respectively. Experimental and theoretical studies investigate the effects of material composition and multilayer structure on water barrier performance, water distribution, and degradation behavior. Demonstrations with inductor&#8208;capacitor circuits, wireless power transfer systems, and wireless optoelectronic devices illustrate the performance of this materials system as a bioresorbable encapsulating structure.

         <title>Skin&#8208;Inspired Multi&#8208;Modal Mechanoreceptors for Dynamic Haptic Exploration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;inspired multi&#8208;modal mechanoreceptor (SENS) is developed. The rational design of SENS allows for high&#8208;precision multidimensional (i.e., spatial direction) and multimodal (i.e., hardness, roughness, and adhesion) sensing, enabling the development of a closed&#8208;loop robotic system with the capability to accurately recognize objects. Such a strategy is universal and adaptable to a broad range of fields for flexible sensors and robotics.








Abstract
Active sensing is a fundamental aspect of human and animal interactions with the environment, providing essential information about the hardness, texture, and tackiness of objects. This ability stems from the presence of diverse mechanoreceptors in the skin, capable of detecting a wide range of stimuli and from the sensorimotor control of biological mechanisms. In contrast, existing tactile sensors for robotic applications typically excel in identifying only limited types of information, lacking the versatility of biological mechanoreceptors and the requisite sensing strategies to extract tactile information proactively. Here, inspired by human haptic perception, a skin&#8208;inspired artificial 3D mechanoreceptor (SENS) capable of detecting multiple mechanical stimuli is developed to bridge sensing and action in a closed&#8208;loop sensorimotor system for dynamic haptic exploration. A tensor&#8208;based non&#8208;linear theoretical model is established to characterize the 3D deformation (e.g., tensile, compressive, and shear deformation) of SENS, providing guidance for the design and optimization of multimode sensing properties with high fidelity. Based on SENS, a closed&#8208;loop robotic system capable of recognizing objects with improved accuracy (&#8776;96%) is further demonstrated. This dynamic haptic exploration approach shows promise for a wide range of applications such as autonomous learning, healthcare, and space and deep&#8208;sea exploration.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Dimensional Multiplexed Metasurface Holography by Inverse Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An end&#8208;to&#8208;end inverse design framework is proposed. By representing the entire process of meta&#8208;atom mapping and scattered field diffraction propagation as differentiable, the parameters of metasurface can be directly output after inputting target images. Metasurface hologram containing up to 12 channels is designed and experimentally demonstrated by using simple meta&#8208;atoms with two degrees of freedom.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;dimensional multiplexed metasurface holography extends holographic information capacity and promises revolutionary advancements for vivid imaging, information storage, and encryption. However, achieving multifunctional metasurface holography by forward design method is still difficult because it relies heavily on Jones matrix engineering, which places high demands on physical knowledge and processing technology. To break these limitations and simplify the design process, here, an end&#8208;to&#8208;end inverse design framework is proposed. By directly linking the metasurface to the reconstructed images and employing a loss function to guide the update of metasurface, the calculation of hologram can be omitted; thus, greatly simplifying the design process. In addition, the requirements on the completeness of meta&#8208;library can also be significantly reduced, allowing multi&#8208;channel hologram to be achieved using meta&#8208;atoms with only two degrees of freedom, which is very friendly to processing. By exploiting the proposed method, metasurface hologram containing up to 12 channels of multi&#8208;wavelength, multi&#8208;plane, and multi&#8208;polarization is designed and experimentally demonstrated, which exhibits the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art information multiplexing capacity of the metasurface composed of simple meta&#8208;atoms. This method is conducive to promoting the intelligent design of multifunctional meta&#8208;devices, and it is expected to eventually accelerate the application of meta&#8208;devices in colorful display, imaging, storage and other fields.

         <title>Intrinsic Defect&#8208;Driven Synergistic Synaptic Heterostructures for Gate&#8208;Free Neuromorphic Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative gate&#8208;free Fe7S8@MoS2 heterostructure wherein a defect&#8208;rich Fe7S8 core is enveloped snugly by a curved MoS2 dome shell is developed to realize the effective photocarrier trapping through the exploitation of intrinsic defects in the Fe7S8 core. The resultant neuromorphic devices exhibit remarkable light&#8208;tunable synaptic behaviors, thus demonstrating great advances in simulating visual recognition system.








Abstract
The optoelectronic synaptic devices based on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials offer great advances for future neuromorphic visual systems with dramatically improved integration density and power efficiency. The effective charge capture and retention are considered as one vital prerequisite to realizing the synaptic memory function. However, the current 2D synaptic devices are predominantly relied on materials with artificially&#8208;engineered defects or intricate gate&#8208;controlled architectures to realize the charge trapping process. These approaches, unfortunately, suffer from the degradation of pristine materials, rapid device failure, and unnecessary complication of device structures. To address these challenges, an innovative gate&#8208;free heterostructure paradigm is introduced herein. The heterostructure presents a distinctive dome&#8208;like morphology wherein a defect&#8208;rich Fe7S8 core is enveloped snugly by a curved MoS2 dome shell (Fe7S8@MoS2), allowing the realization of effective photocarrier trapping through the intrinsic defects in the adjacent Fe7S8 core. The resultant neuromorphic devices exhibit remarkable light&#8208;tunable synaptic behaviors with memory time up to &#8776;800 s under single optical pulse, thus demonstrating great advances in simulating visual recognition system with significantly improved image recognition efficiency. The emergence of such heterostructures foreshadows a promising trajectory for underpinning future synaptic devices, catalyzing the realization of high&#8208;efficiency and intricate visual processing applications.

         <title>All&#8208;Photolithography Fabrication of Ion&#8208;Gated Flexible Organic Transistor Array for Multimode Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;density flexible organic ion&#8208;gated transistor (OIGT) arrays with long&#8208;term stability are achieved by an all&#8208;photolithography strategy. OIGT arrays could switch from volatile to nonvolatile modes, which demonstrates the feasibility of integrating a flexible homogeneous reservoir computing (RC) system on the same substrate for precise recognition of handwritten digits, indicating the potential of RC hardware systems for nonlinear realistic tasks.








Abstract
Organic ion&#8208;gated transistors (OIGTs) demonstrate commendable performance for versatile neuromorphic systems. However, due to the fragility of organic materials to organic solvents, efficient and reliable all&#8208;photolithography methods for scalable manufacturing of high&#8208;density OIGT arrays with multimode neuromorphic functions are still missing, especially when all active layers are patterned in high&#8208;density. Here, a flexible high&#8208;density (9662 devices per cm2) OIGT array with high yield and minimal device&#8208;to&#8208;device variation is fabricated by a modified all&#8208;photolithography method. The unencapsulated flexible array can withstand 1000 times&#8217; bending at a radius of 1&#160;mm, and 3 months&#8217; storage test in air, without obvious performance degradation. More interesting, the OIGTs can be configured between volatile and nonvolatile modes, suitable for constructing reservoir computing systems to achieve high accuracy in classifying handwritten digits with low training costs. This work proposes a promising design of organic and flexible electronics for affordable neuromorphic systems, encompassing both array and algorithm aspects.

         <title>Efficient Ion Percolating Network for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;induced alignment strategy is explored to effectively control the orientation of Li0.35La0.55TiO3 nanowires (LLTO NWs) in solid&#8208;state composite cathodes. Simulation calculations combined with experiments reveal the merits of vertically aligned LLTO NWs in the composite cathode alleviating the ion concentration gradient and enhancing the active material utilization which is promising for achieving high&#8208;performance ASSLBs.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) face critical challenges of low cathode loading and poor rate performances, which handicaps their energy/power densities. The widely&#8208;accepted aim of high ionic conductivity and low interfacial resistance seems insufficient to overcome these challenges. Here, it is revealed that an efficient ion percolating network in the cathode exerts a more critical influence on the electrochemical performance of ASSLBs. By constructing vertical alignment of Li0.35La0.55TiO3 nanowires (LLTO NWs) in solid&#8208;state cathode through magnetic manipulation, the ionic conductivity of the cathode increases twice compared with the cathode consisted of randomly distributed LLTO NWs. The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LiFePO4/Li cells using poly(ethylene oxide) as the electrolyte is able to deliver high capacities of 151&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (2&#160;C) and 100&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (5&#160;C) at 60&#160;&#176;C, and a room&#8208;temperature capacity of 108&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 can be achieved at a charging rate of 2&#160;C. Furthermore, the cell can reach a high areal capacity of 3&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 even with a practical LFP loading of 20&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2. The universality of this strategy is also presented showing the demonstration in LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes. This work offers new pathways for designing ASSLBs with improved energy/power densities.

         <title>Homeostatic Solid Solution Reaction in Phosphate Cathode: Breaking High&#8208;Voltage Barrier to Achieve High Energy Density and Long Life of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The homeostatic solid solution characteristics drive the phosphate with multilevel redox (MLNP) in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), breaking through the high barrier of intrinsic mono&#8208;redox center with sluggish reactivity&#160;by differentiating each redox couple. This establishes fast and stable reaction kinetics, balancing multi&#8208;electron transfer and low strain to develope high energy&#8208;density and durable NASICON cathodes for SIBs.








Abstract
The stable phase transformation during electrochemical progress drives extensive research on vanadium&#8208;based polyanions in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), especially Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP). And the electron transfer between V3+/4+ redox couple in NVP could be generally achieved, owing to the confined crystal variation during battery service. However, the more favorable V4+/5+ redox couple is still in hard&#8208;to&#8208;access situation due to the high barrier and further brings about the corresponding inefficiency in energy densities. In this work, the multilevel redox in NVP frame (MLNP) alters reaction pathway to undergo homeostatic solid solution process and breaks the high barrier of V4+/5+ at high voltage, taking by progressive transition metal (V, Fe, Ti, and Cr) redox couple. The diversified reaction paths across diffusion barriers could be realized by distinctive release/uptake of inactive Na1 site, confirmed by the calculations of density functional theory. Thereby its volume change is merely 1.73% during the multielectron&#8208;transfer process (&#8776;2.77 electrons). MLNP cathode could achieve an impressive energy density of 440&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, driving the leading development of MLNP among other NASICON structure SIBs. The integration of multiple redox couples with low strain modulates the reaction pathway effectively and will open a new avenue for fabricating high&#8208;performance cathodes in SIBs.

         <title>A Gradient Stiffness&#8208;Programmed Circuit Board by Spatially Controlled Phase&#8208;Transition of Supercooled Hydrogel for Stretchable Electronics Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient stiffness&#8208;programmed circuit board (GS&#8208;PCB) that possesses high stretchability and stability with surface mounted chips is introduced. The board comprises a stiffness&#8208;programmed hydrogel substrate and a laser&#8208;patterned liquid metal conductor. By integrating the gel with laser&#8208;patterned liquid metal with exceptional properties, GS&#8208;PCB exhibits higher electromechanical stability than other rigid&#8208;island research.








Abstract
Due to emerging demands in soft electronics, there is an increasing need for material architectures that support robust interfacing between soft substrates, stretchable electrical interconnects, and embedded rigid microelectronics chips. Though researchers have adopted rigid&#8208;island structures to solve the issue, this approach merely shifts stress concentrations from chip&#8208;conductor interfaces to rigid&#8208;island&#8208;soft region interfaces in the substrate. Here, a gradient stiffness&#8208;programmed circuit board (GS&#8208;PCB) that possesses high stretchability and stability with surface mounted chips is introduced. The board comprises a stiffness&#8208;programmed hydrogel substrate and a laser&#8208;patterned liquid metal conductor. The hydrogel simultaneously obtains a large stiffness disparity and robust interfaces between rigid&#8208;islands and soft regions. These seemingly contradictory conditions are accomplished by adopting a gradient stiffness structure at the interfaces, enabled by combining polymers with different interaction energies and a supercooled sodium acetate solution. By integrating the gel with laser&#8208;patterned liquid metal with exceptional properties, GS&#8208;PCB exhibits higher electromechanical stability than other rigid&#8208;island research. To highlight the practicality of this approach, a finger&#8208;sensor device that successfully distinguishes objects by direct physical contact is fabricated, demonstrating its stability under various mechanical disturbances.

         <title>Unexpected Energy Applications of Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract

We conclude that there is tremendous scope for further optimizing and tuning of the ionic liquid in its task, subject to sustainability imperatives in line with current global priorities, assisted by artificial intelligence.

         <title>COF/In2S3 S&#8208;scheme photocatalyst with enhanced light absorption and H2O2&#8208;production activity and fs&#8208;TA investigation</title>

Abstract
Photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis from water and O2 is an economical, eco&#8208;friendly, and sustainable route for H2O2 production. However, single&#8208;component photocatalysts are subjected to limited light&#8208;harvesting range, fast carrier recombination, and weak redox power. To promote photogenerated carrier separation and enhance redox abilities, an organic/inorganic S&#8208;scheme photocatalyst was fabricated by in&#8208;situ growing In2S3 nanosheets on a COF substrate for efficient H2O2 production in pure water. Interestingly, compared to unitary COF and In2S3, the COF/In2S3 S&#8208;scheme photocatalysts exhibit significantly larger light&#8208;harvesting range and stronger visible&#8208;light absorption. Partial density of state (PDOS) calculation, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy reveal that the coordination between In2S3 and COF induces the formation of midgap hybrid energy levels, leading to smaller energy gaps and broadened absorption. Combining electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, radical&#8208;trapping experiments, and isotope labeling experiments, three pathways for H2O2 formation were identified. Benefited from expanded light&#8208;absorption range, enhanced carrier separation, strong redox power, and multi&#8208;channel H2O2 formation, the optimal composite shows an impressive H2O2&#8208;production rate of 5713.2&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water. This work exemplifies an effective strategy to ameliorate COF&#8208;based photocatalysts by building S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions and provides molecular&#8208;level insights into their impact on energy level modulation.

         <title>Probing Hyperbolic Shear Polaritons in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 Nanostructures Using STEM&#8208;EELS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperbolic shear polaritons are observed in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanostructures using electron energy loss spectroscopy. The propagation and reflection of polariton modes are studied. The tunable broad spectral polaritons in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 expand the scope of &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 from its application in traditional electronic devices to applications in nanophotonics and metamaterials.








Abstract
Phonon polaritons, quasiparticles arising from strong coupling between electromagnetic waves and optical phonons, have potential for applications in subdiffraction imaging, sensing, thermal conduction enhancement, and spectroscopy signal enhancement. A new class of phonon polaritons in low&#8208;symmetry monoclinic crystals, hyperbolic shear polaritons (HShPs), have been verified recently in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 by free electron laser (FEL) measurements. However, detailed behaviors of HShPs in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanostructures still remain unknown. Here, by using monochromatic electron energy loss spectroscopy in conjunction with scanning transmission electron microscopy, the experimental observation of multiple HShPs in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 in the mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) and far&#8208;infrared (FIR) ranges is reported. HShPs in various &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanorods and a &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanodisk are excited. The frequency&#8208;dependent rotation and shear effect of HShPs reflect on the distribution of EELS signals. The propagation and reflection of HShPs in nanostructures are clarified by simulations of electric field distribution. These findings suggest that, with its tunable broad spectral HShPs, &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 is an excellent candidate for nanophotonic applications.

         <title>Chemical Vapor Deposition Synthesis of Intrinsic High&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectric 2D CuCrSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a chemical vapor deposition method is reported to synthesize 2D CuCrSe2 single crystal. The ultrathin CuCrSe2 nanosheet exhibits a high Curie temperature TC of 800 K. The in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity in 2D CuCrSe2 are characterized by piezo&#8208;response force microscopy measurements and confirmed by the lateral and vertical devices.








Abstract
Ultrathin 2D ferroelectrics with high Curie temperature are critical for multifunctional ferroelectric devices. However, the ferroelectric spontaneous polarization is consistently broken by the strong thermal fluctuations at high temperature, resulting in the rare discovery of high&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity in 2D materials. Here, a chemical vapor deposition method is reported to synthesize 2D CuCrSe2 nanosheets. The crystal structure is confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy characterization. The measured ferroelectric phase transition temperature of ultrathin CuCrSe2 is about &#8776;800 K. Significantly, the switchable ferroelectric polarization is observed in &#8776;5.2&#160;nm nanosheet. Moreover, the in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric response are modulated by different maximum bias voltage. This work provides a new insight into the construction of 2D ferroelectrics with high Curie temperature.

         <title>Anisotropic Morphing in Bistable Kirigami Through Symmetry Breaking and Geometric Frustration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Shape morphing in bistable kirigami enables remarkable functionalities appealing to a diverse range of applications across the spectrum of length scale. At the core of their shape shifting lies the architecture of their repeating unit, where highly deformable slits and quasi&#8208;rigid rotating units often exhibit multiple symmetries that confers isotropic deployment obeying uniform scaling transformation. In this work, symmetry breaking in bistable kirigami is investigated to access geometric frustration and anisotropic morphing, enabling arbitrarily scaled deployment in planar and spatial bistable domains. With an analysis on their symmetry properties complemented by a systematic investigation integrating semi&#8208;analytical derivations, numerical simulations, and experiments on elastic kirigami sheets, this work unveils the fundamental relations between slit symmetry, geometric frustration, and anisotropic bistable deployment. Furthermore, asymmetric kirigami units are leveraged in planar and flat&#8208;to&#8208;3D demonstrations to showcase the pivotal role of shear deformation in achieving target shapes and functions so far unattainable with uniformly stretchable kirigami. The insights provided in this work unveil the role of slit symmetry breaking in controlling the anisotropic bistable deployment of soft kirigami metamaterials, enriching the range of achievable functionalities for applications spanning deployable space structures, wearable technologies, and soft machines.

         <title>Truly Tiny Acoustic Biomolecules for Ultrasound Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nanotechnology offers significant advantages for medical imaging and therapy, including enhanced contrast and precision targeting. However, integrating these benefits into ultrasonography has been challenging due to the size and stability constraints of conventional bubble&#8208;based agents. Here we describe bicones, truly tiny acoustic contrast agents based on gas vesicles, a unique class of air&#8208;filled protein nanostructures naturally produced in buoyant microbes. We show that these sub&#8208;80&#160;nm particles can be effectively detected both in vitro and in vivo, infiltrate tumors via leaky vasculature, deliver potent mechanical effects through ultrasound&#8208;induced inertial cavitation, and are easily engineered for molecular targeting, prolonged circulation time, and payload conjugation.

         <title>Structuring Cu Membrane Electrode for Maximizing Ethylene Yield from CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A freestanding Cu membrane cathode is designed and constructed through the electrochemical deposition of mesoporous copper film on copper foam. This innovative design aims to efficiently facilitate the electroreduction of CO2 to C2H4 by concurrently addressing the transport of CO2, electrons, ions, water, and products.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic ethylene (C2H4) evolution from CO2 reduction is an intriguing route to mitigate both the energy and environmental crises; however, to acquire industrially relevant high productivity and selectivity at low energy cost remains to be challenging. Membrane assembly electrode has shown great prospect and tailoring its architecture for maximizing C2H4 yield at minimum voltage with long&#8208;term stability becomes critical. Here a freestanding Cu membrane cathode is designed and constructed by electrochemically depositing mesoporous Cu film on Cu foam to simultaneously manage CO2, electron, water, and product transport, which shows an extraordinary C2H4 Faradaic efficiency of 85.6% with a full cell power conversion efficiency of 33% at a current density of 368&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, heading the techno&#8208;economic viability for electrocatalytic C2H4 production.

         <title>Atomic Diffusion Engineered PtSnCu Nanoframes with High&#8208;Index Facets Boost Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary PtSnCu active&#8208;site ensembles with enlarged lattice spacings and high&#8208;index facets are achieved by atomic Sn diffusion into the PtCu octopod nanoframes. Benefiting from the single&#8208;atom Sn tailoring, the Pt47Sn12Cu41 octopod nanoframes exhibit ultrahigh and all&#8208;round superior electrocatalytic performances including activity, selectivity, stability, and anti&#8208;poisoning ability toward the electrochemical ethanol oxidation in acidic electrolyte.








Abstract
Electrochemical ethanol oxidation is crucial to directly convert a biorenewable liquid fuel with high energy density into electrical energy, but it remains an inefficient reaction even with the best catalysts. To boost ethanol oxidation, developing multimetallic nanoalloy has emerged as one of the most effective strategies, yet faces a challenge in the rational engineering of multimetallic active&#8208;site ensembles at atomic&#8208;level. Herein, starting from typical PtCu nanocrystals, an atomic Sn diffusion strategy is developed to construct well&#8208;defined Pt47Sn12Cu41 octopod nanoframes, which is enclosed by high&#8208;index facets of n (111)&#8208;(111), such as {331} and {221}. Pt47Sn12Cu41 achieves a high mass activity of 3.10 A mg&#8722;1Pt and promotes the C&#8208;C bond breaking and oxidation of poisonous CO intermediate, representing a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalyst toward ethanol oxidation in acidic electrolyte. Density functional theory &#65288;DFT&#65289; calculations have confirmed that the introduction of Sn improves the electroactivity by uplifting the d&#8208;band center through the s&#8208;p&#8208;d coupling. Meanwhile, the strong binding of ethanol and the reduced energy barrier of CO oxidation guarantee a highly efficient ethanol oxidation process with improved Faradic efficiency of C1 products. This work offers a promising strategy for constructing novel multimetallic nanoalloys tailored by atomic metal sites as the efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Tempospatially Confined Catalytic Membranes for Advanced Water Remediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review critically summarizes recent representative studies on catalytic membranes (CMs) for advanced water remediation, paying attention to both thermodynamics and mass transfer kinetics mechanism. A rational design framework of tempospatially confined CM is proposed initiatively, involving the materials selection, catalytic oxidation system selection, pore microstructure design according to the tempospatial confinement, CM fabrication, and application.








Abstract
The application of homogeneous catalysts in water remediation is limited by their excessive chemical and energy input, weak regenerability, and potential leaching. Heterogeneous catalytic membranes (CMs) offer a new approach to facilitate efficient, selective, and continuous pollutant degradation. Thus, integrating membranes and continuous filtration with heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) can promote thermodynamic and kinetic mass transfers in spatially confined intrapores and facilitate diffusion&#8208;reaction processes. Despite the remarkable advantages of heterogeneous CMs, their engineering application is practically restricted due to the fuzzy design criteria for specific applications. Herein, the recent advances in CMs for advanced water remediation are critically reviewed and the design flow for tempospatially confined CMs is proposed. Further, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art CM materials and their catalytic mechanisms are reviewed, after which the tempospatial confinement mechanisms comprising the nanoconfinement effect, interface effect, and kinetic mass transfer are emphasized, thus clarifying their roles in the construction and performance optimization of CMs. Additionally, the fabrication methods for CMs based on their catalysts and pore sizes are summarized and an overview of their application and performance evaluations is presented. Finally, future directions for CMs in materials research and water treatment, are presented.

         <title>Quantitative Assessment of Fungal Biomarkers in Clinical Samples via an Interface&#8208;Modulated Optical Fiber Biosensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interface&#8208;modulated biosensor, utilizing an optical fiber for the quantitative analysis of fungal biomarkers for point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT), is demonstrated. It overcomes the limitations of existing detection methods, including a high rate of misdiagnosis, prolonged detection time, elevated costs, and the requirement for stringent laboratory conditions, and offers promising prospects for prompt and precise diagnosis in resource&#8208;constrained and underdeveloped regions.








Abstract
Invasive fungal infections pose a significant public health threat. The lack of precise and timely diagnosis is a primary factor contributing to the significant increase in patient mortality rates. Here, an interface&#8208;modulated biosensor utilizing an optical fiber for quantitative analysis of fungal biomarkers at the early stage of point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT), is reported. By integrating surface refractive index (RI) modulation and plasmon enhancement, the sensor to achieve high sensitivity in a directional response to the target analytes, is successfully optimized. As a result, a compact fiber&#8208;optic sensor with rapid response time, cost&#8208;effectiveness, exceptional sensitivity, stability, and specificity, is developed. This sensor can successfully identify the biomarkers of specific pathogens from blood or other tissue specimens in animal models. It quantifies clinical blood samples with precision and effectively discriminates between negative and positive cases, thereby providing timely alerts to potential patients. It significantly reduces the detection time of fungal infection to only 30 min. Additionally, this approach exhibits remarkable stability and achieves a limit of detection (LOD) three orders of magnitude lower than existing methods. It overcomes the limitations of existing detection methods, including a high rate of misdiagnosis, prolonged detection time, elevated costs, and the requirement for stringent laboratory conditions.

         <title>Sensitive Organic Photodetectors With Spectral Response up to 1.3&#160;&#181;m Using a Quinoidal Molecular Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quinoidal molecular semiconductor, with a photoelectric response of up to 1.3&#160;&#181;m, is developed. The resulting photodetector affords unprecedented external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26% and 41% at a wavelength of 1.10&#160;&#181;m under zero bias and a reverse bias, respectively. Moreover, owing to the low trap density, the photodetector demonstrates detectivity exceeding 1012 Jones from 0.3&#8211;1.3&#160;&#181;m.








Abstract
Detecting short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) light has underpinned several emerging technologies. However, the development of highly sensitive organic photodetectors (OPDs) operating in the SWIR region is hindered by their poor external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) and high dark currents. Herein, the development of high&#8208;sensitivity SWIR&#8208;OPDs with an efficient photoelectric response extending up to 1.3&#160;&#181;m is reported. These OPDs utilize a new ultralow&#8208;bandgap molecular semiconductor featuring a quinoidal tricyclic electron&#8208;deficient central unit and multiple non&#8208;covalent conformation locks. The SWIR&#8208;OPD achieves an unprecedented EQE of 26% under zero bias and an even more impressive EQE of up to 41% under a &#8211;4&#160;V bias at 1.10&#160;&#181;m, effectively pushing the detection limit of silicon photodetectors. Additionally, the low energetic disorder and trap density in the active layer lead to significant suppression of thermal&#8208;generation carriers and dark current, resulting in excellent detectivity (Dsh*) exceeding 1013 Jones from 0.50 to 1.21&#160;&#181;m and surpassing 1012 Jones even at 1.30&#160;&#181;m under zero bias, marking the highest achievements for OPDs beyond the silicon limit to date. Validation with photoplethysmography measurements, a spectrometer prototype in the 0.35&#8211;1.25&#160;&#181;m range, and image capture under 1.20&#160;&#181;m irradiation demonstrate the extensive applications of this SWIR&#8208;OPD.

         <title>Inflammation&#8208;Responsive Cell Membrane&#8208;Camouflaged Nanoparticles against Liver Fibrosis via Regulating Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Oxidative Stress</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PLGA@Melatonin is constructed by loading melatonin with poly (lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA). Platelet membranes (PM) and activated hepatic stellate cell membranes (HSCM) with high expression of the platelet&#8208;derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) are extracted to successfully construct PM@PLGA@Melatonin and HSCM@PLGA@Melatonin, which are subsequently utilized to treat mice with liver fibrosis.








Abstract
Liver fibrosis represents a reversible stage of various chronic liver diseases that progresses to cirrhosis. This condition is characterized by an imbalance between tissue damage and repair, and the production of fibers in the liver exceeds their degradation. Oxidative stress (OS) resulting from tissue injury and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) triggered by the overproduction of proteins are pivotal factors in liver fibrosis. Melatonin demonstrates the capability to neutralize free radicals, shielding cells from oxidative harm. It is also a specific inhibitor of the ERS receptor transcription activating factor 6 (ATF6), indicating its great potential in ameliorating liver fibrosis. However, its limited water solubility and oral bioavailability of under 15% present hurdles in achieving therapeutic blood concentrations for treating liver fibrosis. The PLGA@Melatonin is constructed by loading melatonin with poly (lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA).

The results illustrated the remarkable therapeutic effects of the two nanoparticles on liver fibrosis, along with their excellent targeting and biosafety properties.

         <title>Strain Regulation of Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskites Enables High&#8208;Performance Wide&#8208;Bandgap Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Rb+ fills the A&#8208;site vacancy caused by the MA volatilization, relieving shrinkage strain of perovskite crystal. The reduced lattice distortion increases the halide migration barrier, resulting a homogeneous mixed&#8208;halide perovskite phase, and suppressing nonradiative recombination. As a result, the Rb&#8208;treated wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cell exhibits an improved power conversion efficiency and stability.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap mixed&#8208;halogen perovskite materials are widely used as top cells in tandem solar cells. However, serious open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss restricts the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, it is shown that the resulting methylammonium vacancies induce lattice distortion in methylammonium chloride&#8208;assisted perovskite film, resulting in an inhomogeneous halogen distribution and low Voc. Thus, a lattice strain regulation strategy is reported to fabricate high&#8208;performance wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs. Rubidium (Rb) cations are introduced to fill the A&#8208;site vacancy caused by the methylammonium volatilization, which alleviates shrinkage strain of the perovskite crystal. The reduced lattice distortion and increased halide ion migration barrier result in a homogeneous mixed&#8208;halide perovskite film. Due to improved carrier transport and suppressed nonradiative recombination, the Rb&#8208;treated wide&#8208;bandgap PSC (1.68&#160;eV) achieves an excellent PCE of 21.72%, accompanied by a high Voc of 1.22&#160;V. The resulting device maintains more than 90% of its initial PCE after 1500&#160;h under 1&#8208;sun illumination conditions.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Assisted Generation and Straight Movement of Skyrmion Bubble in Kagome TbMn6Sn6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise generation and straight movement of skyrmion bubble are demonstrated at zero field and room temperature in the Kagome plane of TbMn6Sn6 by conveniently electron&#8208;assisted heating, where the crucial contribution of local anisotropy variation near the spin reorientation transition and geometric confinement is validated in simulation, highlighting a significant possibility for the compatible application in skyrmionic devices.








Abstract
Topological magnetic textures are promising candidates as binary data units for the next&#8208;generation memory device. The precise generation and convenient control of nontrivial spin topology at zero field near room temperature endows the critical advantages in skyrmionic devices but is not simultaneously integrated into one material. Here, in the Kagome plane of quantum TbMn6Sn6, the expedient generation of the skyrmion bubbles in versatile forms of lattice, chain, and isolated one by converging the electron beam, where the electron intensity gradient contributes to the dynamic generation from local anisotropy variation near spin reorientation transition (SRT) is reported. Encouragingly, by utilizing the dynamic shift of the SRT domain interface, the straight movement is actualized with the skyrmion bubble slave to the SRT domain interface forming an elastic composite object, avoiding the usual deflection from the skyrmion Hall effect. The critical contribution of the SRT domain interface via conveniently electron&#8208;assisted heating is further theoretically validated in micromagnetic simulation, highlighting the compatible application possibility in advanced devices.

         <title>Double&#8208;Layer Asymmetric Porous Mesh with Dynamic Mechanical Support Properties Enables Efficient Single&#8208;Stage Repair of Contaminated Abdominal Wall Defect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Pollution tolerance and long&#8208;term mechanical support are the two critical properties of meshes for contaminated abdominal wall defect repair. However, biological meshes with excellent pollution tolerance fail to provide bio&#8208;adaptive long&#8208;term mechanical support due to their rapid degradation. Here, a novel double&#8208;layer asymmetric porous mesh (SIS/PVA&#8208;EXO) is designed by simple and efficient in situ freeze&#8208;thaw of sticky polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution on the loosely porous surface of small intestinal submucosal decellularized matrix (SIS), which can successfully repair the contaminated abdominal wall defect with bio&#8208;adaptive dynamic mechanical support through only single&#8208;stage surgery. The exosome&#8208;loaded degradable loosely porous SIS layer accelerates the tissue healing, while the exosome&#8208;loaded densely porous PVA layer can maintain long&#8208;term mechanical support without any abdominal adhesion. In addition, the tensile strength and fracture strain of the SIS/PVA&#8208;EXO mesh change gradually from 0.37&#160;MPa and 210% to 0.10&#160;MPa and 385% with the degradation of SIS layer. This unique performance can dynamically adapt to the variable mechanical demands during different periods of contaminated abdominal wall reconstruction. As a result, our SIS/PVA&#8208;EXO mesh shows an attractive prospect in the treatment of contaminated abdominal wall defect without recurrence by integrating local immune regulation, tissue remodeling, and dynamic mechanical supporting.

         <title>Strengthening the Metal&#8208;Acid Interactions by Using CeO2 as Regulators of Precisely Placing Pt species in ZSM&#8208;5 for Furfural Hydrogenation</title>

Abstract
Understanding the synergism between metal site and acid site is of great significance in boosting the efficiency of bi&#8208;functional catalysts in many heterogeneous reactions, particularly in biomass upgrading. Herein, we report a &#8220;confined auto&#8208;redox&#8221; strategy to fix CeO2&#8208;anchored Pt atoms on the inner wall of a ZSM&#8208;5 cage, achieving the target of finely controlling the placements of the two active sites. Compared with the conventional surface&#8208;supported counterpart, the encapsulated Pt/CeO2@ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst possesses remarkably&#8208;improved activity and selectivity, which can convert &gt; 99% furfural into cyclopentanone with 97.2% selectivity in 6 hours at 160 &#176;C. Besides the excellent catalytic performance, the ordered metal&#8208;acid distribution also makes such kind of catalyst become an ideal research subject for metal&#8208;acid interactions. The following mechanization investigation reveals that the enhancement is strongly related to the unique encapsulation structure, which promotes the migration of the reactants over different active sites, thereby contributing to the tandem reaction.

         <title>Enhanced Chemoradiotherapy for MRSA&#8208;Infected Osteomyelitis Using Immunomodulatory Polymer&#8208;Reinforced Nanotherapeutics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The eradication of osteomyelitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses a significant challenge due to its development of biofilm&#8208;induced antibiotic resistance and impaired innate immunity, which often leads to frequent surgical failure. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and performance of X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated polymer&#8208;reinforced nanotherapeutics that modulate the immunological properties of infectious microenvironments to enhance chemoradiotherapy against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacterial deep&#8208;tissue infections. Upon X&#8208;ray radiation, the proposed polymer&#8208;reinforced nanotherapeutic generates reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species. To robustly eradicate MRSA biofilms at deep infection sites, these species can specifically bind to MRSA and penetrate biofilms for enhanced chemoradiotherapy treatment. X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated nanotherapeutics modulate the innate immunity of macrophages to prevent the recurrence of osteomyelitis. The remarkable anti&#8208;infection effects of these nanotherapeutics were validated using a rat osteomyelitis model. This study demonstrates the significant potential of a synergistic chemoradiotherapy and immunotherapy method for treating MRSA biofilm&#8208;infected osteomyelitis.

         <title>RhNi Bimetallenes with Lattice&#8208;Compressed Rh Skin towards Ultrastable Acidic Nitrate Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Harvesting recyclable ammonia (NH3) from acidic nitrate (NO3&#8722;)&#8208;containing wastewater requires the utilization of corrosion&#8208;resistant electrocatalytic materials with high activity and selectivity towards acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3ER). Herein, ultrathin RhNi bimetallenes with a Rh&#8208;skin&#8208;type structure (RhNi@Rh BMLs) are fabricated towards acidic NO3ER. The Rh&#8208;skin atoms on the surface of RhNi@Rh BMLs experience the lattice compression&#8208;induced strain effect, resulting in the shortened Rh&#8208;Rh bond and a downshifted d&#8208;band center. Experimental and theoretical calculation results corroborate that Rh&#8208;skin atoms can inhibit NO2*/NH2* adsorption&#8208;induced Rh dissolution, contributing to the exceptional electrocatalytic durability of RhNi@Rh BMLs (over 400 hours) towards acidic NO3ER. RhNi@Rh BMLs also reveals an excellent catalytic performance, boasting a 98.4% NH3 Faradaic efficiency and a 13.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 NH3 yield. Theoretical calculations reveal that compressive stress tunes the electronic structure of Rh skin atoms, which facilitates the reduction of NO* to NOH* in the process of NO3ER. The practicality of RhNi@Rh BMLs has also been confirmed in an alkaline&#8208;acidic hybrid Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery with a 1.39&#160;V open circuit voltage and a 10.5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 power density. More strikingly, this work offers valuable insights into the nature of electrocatalyst deactivation behavior and guides the development of high&#8208;efficiency corrosion&#8208;resistant electrocatalysts for applications in energy and the environment.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Interface as a Cell Scaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell culturing at hydrophobic molecular liquids, such as fluorinated carbon and silicones, is attracting attention as a fundamental technology for highly efficient growth of useful cell resources. Here, it is attempted to utilize physicochemical property designable ionic liquid (IL) interface for cell culture, which provides a unique liquid | liquid interface that is highly polar but phase&#8208;separated from water.








Abstract
In sharp contrast to conventional solid/hydrogel platforms, water&#8208;immiscible liquids, such as perfluorocarbons and silicones, allow the adhesion of mammalian cells via protein nanolayers (PNLs) formed at the interface. However, fluorocarbons and silicones, which are typically used for liquid cell culture, possess only narrow ranges of physicochemical parameters and have not allowed for a wide variety of cell culturing environments. In this paper, it is proposed that water&#8208;immiscible ionic liquids (ILs) are a new family of liquid substrates with tunable physicochemical properties and high solvation capabilities. Tetraalkylphosphonium&#8208;based ILs are identified as non&#8208;cytotoxic ILs, whereon human mesenchymal stem cells are successfully cultured. By reducing the cation charge distribution, or ionicity, via alkyl chain elongation, the interface allows cell spreading with matured focal contacts. High&#8208;speed atomic force microscopy observations of the PNL formation process suggest that the cation charge distribution significantly altered the protein adsorption dynamics, which are associated with the degree of protein denaturation and the PNL mechanics. Moreover, by exploiting dissolution capability of ILs, an ion&#8208;gel cell scaffold is fabricated. This enables to further identify the significant contribution of bulk subphase mechanics to cellular mechanosensing in liquid&#8208;based culture scaffolds.

         <title>Layered High&#8208;Entropy Metallic Glasses for Photothermal CO2 Methanation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The layered high&#8208;entropy metallic glasses&#160;(HEMG) are obtained which exhibit unprecedented photothermal CO2 methanation performance due to the metastable state of both chemical and structural disorder. The study provides a new perspective to understand the catalytic mechanism of high&#8208;entropy materials, showing its great potential of HEMG to drive the development of a green, carbon&#8208;negative industry in the future.








Abstract
High entropy alloys and metallic glasses, as two typical metastable nanomaterials, have attracted tremendous interest in energy conversion catalysis due to their high reactivity in nonequilibrium states. Herein, a novel nanomaterial, layered high entropy metallic glass (HEMG), in a higher energy state than low&#8208;entropy alloys and its crystalline counterpart due to both the disordered elemental and structural arrangements, is synthesized. Specifically, the MnNiZrRuCe HEMG exhibits highly enhanced photothermal catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability. An unprecedented CO2 methanation rate of 489&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 330&#160;&#176;C is achieved, which is, to the authors&#8217; knowledge, the highest photothermal CO2 methanation rate in flow reactors. The remarkable activity originates from the abundant free volume and high internal energy state of HEMG, which lead to the extraordinary heterolytic H2 dissociation capacity. The high&#8208;entropy effect also ensures the excellent stability of HEMG for up to 450 h. This work not only provides a new perspective on the catalytic mechanism of HEMG, but also sheds light on the great catalytic potential in future carbon&#8208;negative industry.

         <title>Octadecyl Gallate and Lipid&#8208;modified MnSe2 Nanoparticles Enhance Radiosensitivity in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Promote Radioprotection in Normal Tissues</title>

Abstract
Radiotherapy, a widely used therapeutic strategy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), is always limited by radioresistance of tumor tissues and side&#8208;effects on normal tissues. Herein, a signature based on 4 core genes of cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, is developed to predict prognosis and assess immune cell infiltration, indicating that the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and radiotherapy efficacy are closely intertwined in ESCC. A novel lipid&#8208;modified manganese diselenide nanoparticle (MnSe2&#8208;lipid) with extraordinarily uniform sphere morphology and tumor microenvironment (TME) responsiveness is developed to simultaneously overcome radioresistance and reduce side&#8208;effects of radiation. The uniform MnSe2 encapsulated lipid effectively achieves tumor accumulation. Octadecyl gallate (OGA) on surface of MnSe2 forming pH&#8208;responsive metal&#8208;phenolic covalent realizes rapid degradation in TME. The released Mn2+ promotes radiosensitivity by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by Fenton&#8208;like reaction and activating cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Spontaneously, selenium strengthens immune response by promoting secretion of cytokines and increasing white blood cells (WBC), and performs antioxidant activity to reduce side&#8208;effects of radiotherapy. Overall, this multifunctional remedy which is responsive to TME is capable of providing radiosensitivity by cGAS&#8208;STING pathway&#8208;mediated immunostimulation and chemodynamic therapy (CDT), and radioprotection of normal tissues, is highlighted here to optimize ESCC treatment.

         <title>Single&#8208;Shot Laser&#8208;Induced Switching of an Exchange Biased Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ultrafast manipulation of magnetic order has challenged our understanding the fundamental and dynamic properties of magnetic materials. So far single shot magnetic switching has been limited to ferrimagnetic alloys, multilayers and designed ferromagnetic heterostructures. In ferromagnetic (FM)/antiferromagnetic (AFM) bilayers, exchange bias (He) arises from the interfacial exchange coupling between the two layers and reflects the microscopic orientation of the antiferromagnet. Here we demonstrate the possibility of single shot switching of the antiferromagnet (change of the sign and amplitude of He) with a single femtosecond laser pulse in IrMn/CoGd bilayers. We demonstrate the manipulation in a wide range of fluences for different layer thicknesses and compositions. Atomistic simulations predict ultrafast switching and recovery of the AFM magnetization on a timescale of 2 ps. Our results provide the fastest and the most energy&#8208;efficient method to set the exchange bias and pave the way to potential applications for ultrafast spintronic devices.

         <title>In Situ Insights into Cathode Calcination for Predictive Synthesis: Kinetic Crystallization of LiNiO2 from Hydroxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcination is a commonly used in making battery cathode materials. However, its inherent complexity associated with elusive intermediates hinders the predictive synthesis of high&#8208;performance cathodes. This study unveils the kinetic crystallization process&#160;of forming LiNiO2, the archetypical Ni&#8208;based cathode during calcination from hydroxides, providing insights into controlling structure&#160;and morphology&#160;through lithiation in the calcination process.








Abstract
Calcination is a solid&#8208;state synthesis process widely deployed in battery cathode manufacturing. However, its inherent complexity associated with elusive intermediates hinders the predictive synthesis of high&#8208;performance cathode materials. Here, correlative in situ X&#8208;ray absorption/scattering spectroscopy is used to investigate the calcination of nickel&#8208;based cathodes, focusing specifically on the archetypal LiNiO2 from Ni(OH)2. Combining in situ observation with data&#8208;driven analysis reveals concurrent lithiation and dehydration of Ni(OH)2 and consequently, the low&#8208;temperature crystallization of layered LiNiO2 alongside lithiated rocksalts. Following early nucleation, LiNiO2 undergoes sluggish crystallization and structural ordering while depleting rocksalts; ultimately, it turns into a structurally&#8208;ordered layered phase upon full lithiation but remains small in size. Subsequent high&#8208;temperature sintering induces rapid crystal growth, accompanied by undesired delithiation and structural degradation. These observations are further corroborated by mesoscale modeling, emphasizing that, even though calcination is thermally driven and favors transformation towards&#160;thermodynamically equilibrium phases, the actual phase propagation and crystallization can be kinetically tuned via lithiation, providing freedom for structural and morphological control during cathode calcination.

         <title>Rational Design of New Conjugated Polymers with Main Chain Chirality for Efficient Optoelectronic Devices: Carbo[6]Helicene and Indacenodithiophene Copolymers as Model Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The unique properties of conjugated polymers (CPs) in various optoelectronic applications are mainly attributed to their different self&#8208;assembly processes and superstructures. Various methods have been utilized to tune and control CP structure and properties with less attention paid to the use of chirality. CPs with main chain chirality are rare and their microscopic and macroscopic properties are still unknown. In this work, we provide the first experimental results along these lines by synthesizing a series of racemic and enantiopure CPs containing statistical and alternating carbo[6]helicene and indacenodithiophene moieties and evaluating their microscopic (optical, energy levels) and macroscopic properties (hole mobilities, photovoltaic performance). We demonstrate that a small statistical insertion of either the racemic or enantiopure helicene into the polymer backbone finely tunes the microscopic and macroscopic properties as a function of the statistical content. The microscopic properties of the enantiopure versus the racemic polymers with the same helicene loading remain similar. On the contrary, the macroscopic properties, and more interestingly those between the two enantiomeric forms, are altered as a function of the statistical content. Once incorporated into a solar cell device, these chiral CPs display better performance in their enantiopure versus racemic forms.

         <title>Silk&#8208;Fabric Reinforced Silk for Artificial Bones</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bone implants for different body parts require varying mechanical properties, dimensions, and biodegradability rates. Currently, it is still challenging to produce artificial bones with perfect compatibility with human bones. In this study, we report a silk&#8208;fabric reinforced silk material (SFS) composed of pure silk with exceptional biocompatibility, osteogenesis and biodegradability, and demonstrate its outstanding performance as a bone implant material. The SFS was fabricated using a simple hot&#8208;pressing technique, with degummed silk fabric as the reinforcement and silk fibroin as the matrix. The SFS as a self&#8208;reinforced composite, has exceptional mechanical properties due to the almost perfect interface between the matrix and reinforcement. More importantly, its mechanical properties, biodegradability rates and density can be tailored by adjusting the reinforcement structure and the ratio of the reinforcement to the matrix to align with the requirements for bone implantation in different parts of the human body. Besides, the SFS can improve osteoblastic proliferation and increase osteogenic activity, which is not the case with clinically used titanium alloy artificial bone. Therefore, the SFS holds significant potential to replace conventional metal or ceramic implants in the field of medical fracture repair.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bone implants for different body parts require varying mechanical properties, dimensions, and biodegradability rates. Currently, it is still challenging to produce artificial bones with perfect compatibility with human bones. In this study, we report a silk-fabric reinforced silk material (SFS) composed of pure silk with exceptional biocompatibility, osteogenesis and biodegradability, and demonstrate its outstanding performance as a bone implant material. The SFS was fabricated using a simple hot-pressing technique, with degummed silk fabric as the reinforcement and silk fibroin as the matrix. The SFS as a self-reinforced composite, has exceptional mechanical properties due to the almost perfect interface between the matrix and reinforcement. More importantly, its mechanical properties, biodegradability rates and density can be tailored by adjusting the reinforcement structure and the ratio of the reinforcement to the matrix to align with the requirements for bone implantation in different parts of the human body. Besides, the SFS can improve osteoblastic proliferation and increase osteogenic activity, which is not the case with clinically used titanium alloy artificial bone. Therefore, the SFS holds significant potential to replace conventional metal or ceramic implants in the field of medical fracture repair.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synergistic Interaction Between Metal Single&#8208;Atoms and Defective WO3&#8208;x Nanosheets for Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Although metal single&#8208;atom (SA)&#8208;based nanomaterials have been explored as sonosensitizers for sonodynamic therapy (SDT), they normally exhibit poor activities and need to combine with other therapeutic strategies. Herein, we report the deposition of metal SAs on oxygen vacancy (OV)&#8208;rich WO3&#8208;x nanosheets to generate synergistic effect for efficient sonodynamic cancer therapy. Crystalline WO3 and OV&#8208;rich WO3&#8208;x nanosheets are first prepared by a simple calcination of the WO3&#183;H2O nanosheets under an air and N2 atmosphere, respectively. Pt, Cu, Fe, Co and Ni metal SAs are then deposited on WO3&#8208;x nanosheets to obtain metal SA&#8208;decorated WO3&#8208;x nanocomposites (M&#8208;WO3&#8208;x). Importantly, the Cu&#8208;WO3&#8208;x sonosensitizer exhibits a much higher activity for ultrasound (US)&#8208;induced production of reactive oxygen species than that of the WO3&#8208;x and Cu SA&#8208;decorated WO3, which is also higher than other M&#8208;WO3&#8208;x nanosheets. Both the experimental and theoretical results suggest that the excellent SDT performance of the Cu&#8208;WO3&#8208;x nanosheets should be attributed to the synergistic effect between Cu&#8208;SAs and WO3&#8208;x OVs. Therefore, after polyethylene glycol modification, the Cu&#8208;WO3&#8208;x can quickly kill cancer cells in vitro and effectively eradicate tumors in vivo under US irradiation. Transcriptome sequencing analysis and further molecular validation suggest that the Cu&#8208;WO3&#8208;x&#8208;mediated SDT&#8208;activated apoptosis and TNF signaling pathways are potential drivers of tumor apoptosis induction.

         <title>Controllable Manipulation of Large&#8208;Volume Droplet on Non&#8208;Slippery Surfaces Based on Triboelectric Contactless Charge Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging dual&#8208;functional triboelectric nanogenerator (DF&#8208;TENG) facilitates contactless charge injection through triboelectric means, introducing a novel method for controllable droplet manipulation. This method is adaptable for a variety of non&#8208;slippery substrates and droplets of different compositions and viscosities, which makes it an ideal strategy for contamination&#8208;free droplet transport, chemical reactions, and even driving solids.








Abstract
Controllable droplet manipulation is crucial in diverse scientific and engineering fields. Traditional electric&#8208;based methods usually rely on commercial high&#8208;voltage (HV) power sources, which are typically bulky, expensive, and potentially hazardous. The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a highly studied device that can generate HV output with limited current, showing great potential in droplet manipulation applications. However, current TENG&#8208;based approaches usually utilize traditional free&#8208;standing TENGs that produce short&#8208;pulsed alternating&#8208;current signals. This limitation hinders continuous electrostatic forces necessary for precise droplet control, leading to complex circuitry and suboptimal droplet motion control in terms of volume, distance, direction, and momentum. Here, a triboelectric contactless charge injection (TCCI) method employing a novel dual&#8208;functional triboelectric nanogenerator (DF&#8208;TENG), is proposed. The DF&#8208;TENG can produce both high voltage and constant current during unidirectional motion, enabling continuous corona discharges for contactless charge injection into the droplets. Using this method, a large&#8208;volume droplet (3000 &#181;L) can be controlled with momentum up to 115.2 g mm s&#8722;1, quintupling the highest value recorded by the traditional methods. Moreover, the TCCI method is adaptable for a variety of non&#8208;slippery substrates and droplets of different compositions and viscosities, which makes it an ideal manipulation strategy for droplet transport, chemical reactions, and even driving solids.

         <title>Extreme Thermal Insulation and Tradeoff of Thermal Transport Mechanisms Between Graphene and WS2 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Controlling and understanding the heat flow at a nanometer scale are challenging, but important for fundamental science and applications. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered materials provide perhaps the ultimate solution for meeting these challenges. While there have been reports of low thermal conductivities (several mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) across the 2D heterostructures, phonon&#8208;dominant thermal transport remains strong due to the nearly&#8208;ideal contact between the layers. Here we experimentally explore the heat transport mechanisms by increasing the interlayer distance from perfect contact to a few nanometers and demonstrate that the phonon&#8208;dominated thermal conductivity across the WS2/graphene interface decreases further with the increasing interlayer distance until the air&#8208;dominated thermal conductivity increases again. We found that the resulting tradeoff of the two heat conduction mechanisms leads to the existence of a minimum thermal conductivity at 2.11&#160;nm of 1.41&#215;10&#8722;5&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, which is two thousandths of the smallest value reported previously. Our work provides an effective methodology for engineering thermal insulation structures and understanding heat transport at the ultimate small scales.

         <title>Suppressing Element Inhomogeneity Enables 14.9% Efficiency CZTSSe Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Kesterites Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1&#8208;x)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells suffer from severe open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) loss due to the numerous secondary phases and defects. The prevailing notion attributes this issue to Sn&#8208;loss during the selenization. However, this work unveils that, instead of Sn&#8208;loss, elemental inhomogeneity caused by Cu&#8208;directional diffusion towards Mo(S,Se)2 layer, is the critical factor in the formation of secondary phases and defects. This diffusion decreases the Cu/(Zn+Sn) ratio to 53% at the bottom fine&#8208;grain layer, increasing the Sn&#8208;/Zn&#8208;related bulk defects. By suppressing the Cu&#8208;directional diffusion with a blocking layer, we effectively improve the crystal quality and reduce the defect density, leading to a remarkable efficiency of 14.9% with a VOC of 576&#160;mV and a certified efficiency of 14.6%. The findings provide insights into element inhomogeneity, holding significant potential to advance the development of CZTSSe solar cells.

         <title>150 Gbps THz Chipscale Topological Photonic Diplexer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The on&#8208;chip photonic diplexer for sixth to X generation communication works on the principle of power splitting and terahertz spectrum filtering. The topological nature of the silicon chip facilitates simultaneous multiplexing and demultiplexing of the two broadband 12.5 GHz channels (CH1 and CH2) to support an aggregated data speed of 150 Gbps.








Abstract
Photonic diplexers are being widely investigated for high data transfer rates in on&#8208;chip communication. However, dividing the available spectrum into nonoverlapping multicarrier frequency sub&#8208;bands has remained a challenge in designing frequency&#8208;selective time&#8208;invariant channels. Here, an on&#8208;chip topological diplexer is reported exhibiting terahertz frequency band filtering through Klein tunneling of topological edge modes. The silicon topological diplexer chip facilitates two high&#8208;speed channels with quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) over a broad bandwidth of 12.5 GHz each. These channels operate at carrier frequencies of 305 and 321.6 GHz, achieving a combined diplexer capacity of 150 Gbit&#160;s&#8722;1. To ensure minimal interference between adjacent channels, a guard band is implemented. Topologically protected edge modes suppress the frequency selective fading of the broadband signals and hold promise for diverse integrated photonic applications spanning terahertz and telecommunication realms, including the design of lossless topological multiplexers, interconnects, antennas, and modulators for the sixth to X generation (6G to XG) wireless.

&lt;p&gt;The on-chip photonic diplexer for sixth to X generation communication works on the principle of power splitting and terahertz spectrum filtering. The topological nature of the silicon chip facilitates simultaneous multiplexing and demultiplexing of the two broadband 12.5 GHz channels (CH1 and CH2) to support an aggregated data speed of 150 Gbps.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photonic diplexers are being widely investigated for high data transfer rates in on-chip communication. However, dividing the available spectrum into nonoverlapping multicarrier frequency sub-bands has remained a challenge in designing frequency-selective time-invariant channels. Here, an on-chip topological diplexer is reported exhibiting terahertz frequency band filtering through Klein tunneling of topological edge modes. The silicon topological diplexer chip facilitates two high-speed channels with quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) over a broad bandwidth of 12.5 GHz each. These channels operate at carrier frequencies of 305 and 321.6 GHz, achieving a combined diplexer capacity of 150 Gbit&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. To ensure minimal interference between adjacent channels, a guard band is implemented. Topologically protected edge modes suppress the frequency selective fading of the broadband signals and hold promise for diverse integrated photonic applications spanning terahertz and telecommunication realms, including the design of lossless topological multiplexers, interconnects, antennas, and modulators for the sixth to X generation (6G to XG) wireless.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ptychographic Nanoscale Imaging of the Magnetoelectric Coupling in Freestanding BiFeO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Understanding the magnetic and ferroelectric ordering of magnetoelectric multiferroic materials at the nanoscale necessitates a versatile imaging method with high spatial resolution. Here, soft X&#8208;ray ptychography was&#160;employed to simultaneously image the ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic domains in an 80&#160;nm thin freestanding film of the room&#8208;temperature multiferroic BiFeO3 (BFO). The antiferromagnetic spin cycloid of period 64&#160;nm was&#160;resolved by reconstructing the corresponding resonant elastic X&#8208;ray scattering in real space and visualized together with mosaic&#8208;like ferroelectric domains in a linear dichroic contrast image at the Fe L3 edge. The measurements reveal a near perfect coupling between the antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric ordering by which the propagation direction of the spin cycloid is locked orthogonally to the ferroelectric polarization. In addition, the study evinces both a preference for in&#8208;plane propagation of the spin cycloid and changes of the ferroelectric polarization by 71&#176;&#160;between multiferroic domains in the epitaxial strain&#8208;free, freestanding BFO film. The results provide a direct visualization of the strong magnetoelectric coupling in BFO and of its fine multiferroic domain structure, emphasizing the potential of ptychographic imaging for the study of multiferroics and non&#8208;collinear magnetic materials with soft&#160;X&#8208;rays.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Dynamically Morphing Microelectronics towards High&#8208;Density Energy Applications and Intelligent Biomedical Implants</title>

Abstract
Choreographing the adaptive shapes of patterned surfaces to exhibit designable mechanical interactions with their environment remains an intricate challenge. Here, we introduce a novel category of strain&#8208;engineered dynamic&#8208;shape materials, empowering diverse multi&#8208;dimensional shape modulations that are combined to form fine&#8208;grained adaptive microarchitectures. Using micro&#8208;origami tessellation technology, heterogeneous materials are provided with strategic creases featuring stimuli&#8208;responsive micro&#8208;hinges that morph precisely upon chemical and electrical cues. Freestanding multifaceted foldable packages, auxetic mesosurfaces, and morphable cages are three of the forms demonstrated herein of these complex 4&#8208;dimensional (4D) metamaterials. These systems are integrated in dual proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept bioelectronic demonstrations: a soft foldable supercapacitor enhancing its power density (ca.&#160;108&#160;mW/cm2), and a bio&#8208;adaptive device with dynamic shape that may enable novel smart&#8208;implant technologies. This work demonstrates that intelligent material systems are now ready to support ultra&#8208;flexible 4D microelectronics, which can impart autonomy to devices culminating in the tangible realization of microelectronic morphogenesis.

         <title>Synergistic Brilliance: Engineered Bacteria and Nanomedicine Unite in Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Engineered bacteria are widely used in cancer treatment because live facultative/obligate anaerobes can selectively proliferate at tumor sites and reach hypoxic regions, thereby causing nutritional competition, enhancing immune responses, and producing anticancer microbial agents in situ to suppress tumor growth. Despite the unique advantages of bacteria&#8208;based cancer biotherapy, the insufficient treatment efficiency limits its application in the complete ablation of malignant tumors. The combination of nanomedicine and engineered bacteria has attracted increasing attention owing to their striking synergistic effects in cancer treatment. Engineered bacteria that act as natural vehicles can effectively deliver nanomedicines to tumor sites. Moreover, bacteria provide an opportunity to enhance nanomedicines by modulating the TME and producing substrates to support nanomedicine&#8208;mediated anticancer reactions. Nanomedicine exhibits excellent optical, magnetic, acoustic, and catalytic properties, and plays an important role in promoting bacteria&#8208;mediated biotherapies. The synergistic anticancer effects of engineered bacteria and nanomedicines in cancer therapy are comprehensively summarized in this review. Attention is paid not only to the fabrication of nanobiohybrid composites, but also to the interpromotion mechanism between engineered bacteria and nanomedicine in cancer therapy. Additionally, recent advances in engineered bacteria&#8208;synergized multimodal cancer therapies have also been highlighted.

         <title>Suppressing Halide Segregation via Pyridine&#8208;Derivative Isomers Enables Efficient 1.68&#8208;eV Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Light&#8208;induced phase segregation is one of the main issues restricting the efficiency and stability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (WBG PSCs). Small organic molecules with abundant functional groups can passivate various defects, and therefore suppress the ionic migration channels for phase segregation. Herein, a series of pyridine&#8208;derivative isomers containing amino and carboxyl are applied to modify the perovskite surface. The amino, carboxyl, and N&#8208;terminal of pyridine in all of these molecules can interact with undercoordinated Pb2+ through coordination bonds and suppress halide ions migration via hydrogen bonding. Among them, the 5&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;pyridine carboxyl acid (APA&#8208;3) treated devices win the champion performance, enabling an efficiency of 22.35% (certified 22.17%) using the 1.68&#8208;eV perovskite, which represents one of the highest values for WBG&#8208;PSCs. This is believed to be due to the more symmetric spatial distribution of the three functional groups of APA&#8208;3, which provides a better passivation effect independent of the molecular arrangement orientation. Therefore, the APA&#8208;3 passivated perovskite shows the slightest halide segregation, the lowest defect density, and the least non&#8208;radiative recombination. Moreover, the APA&#8208;3 passivated device retains 90% of the initial efficiency after 985 hours of operation at the maximum power point, representing the robust durability of WBG&#8208;PSCs under working conditions.

         <title>Imaging the Breakdown and Restoration of Topological Protection in Magnetic Topological Insulator MnBi2Te4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators transport charge without resistance along topologically protected chiral one&#8208;dimensional edge states. Yet, in magnetic topological insulators (MTI) to date, topological protection is far from robust, with zero&#8208;magnetic field QAH effect only realised at temperatures an order of magnitude below the N&#233;el temperature TN, though small magnetic fields can stabilize QAH effect. Understanding why topological protection breaks down is therefore essential to realising QAH effect at higher temperatures. Here we use a scanning tunnelling microscope to directly map the size of exchange gap (Eg,ex) and its spatial fluctuation in the QAH insulator 5&#8208;layer MnBi2Te4. We observe long&#8208;range fluctuations of Eg,ex with values ranging between 0 (gapless) and 70 meV, appearing to be uncorrelated to individual surface point defects. We directly image the breakdown of topological protection, showing that the gapless edge state, hallmark signature of a QAH insulator, hybridizes with extended gapless regions in the bulk. Finally, we unambiguously demonstrate that the gapless regions originate from magnetic disorder, by demonstrating that a small magnetic field restores Eg,ex in these regions, explaining the recovery of topological protection in magnetic fields. Our results indicate that overcoming magnetic disorder is key to exploiting the unique properties of QAH insulators.

Yet, in magnetic topological insulators (MTI) to date, topological protection is far from robust, with zero-magnetic field QAH effect only realised at temperatures an order of magnitude below the N&#233;el temperature &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;, though small magnetic fields can stabilize QAH effect. Understanding why topological protection breaks down is therefore essential to realising QAH effect at higher temperatures. Here we use a scanning tunnelling microscope to directly map the size of exchange gap (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g,ex&lt;/sub&gt;) and its spatial fluctuation in the QAH insulator 5-layer MnBi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. We observe long-range fluctuations of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g,ex&lt;/sub&gt; with values ranging between 0 (gapless) and 70 meV, appearing to be uncorrelated to individual surface point defects. We directly image the breakdown of topological protection, showing that the gapless edge state, hallmark signature of a QAH insulator, hybridizes with extended gapless regions in the bulk. Finally, we unambiguously demonstrate that the gapless regions originate from magnetic disorder, by demonstrating that a small magnetic field restores &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g,ex&lt;/sub&gt; in these regions, explaining the recovery of topological protection in magnetic fields. Our results indicate that overcoming magnetic disorder is key to exploiting the unique properties of QAH insulators.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Triphenylamine Spirofunctionalized Light&#8208;Emitting Conjugated Polymer with an Ultradeep&#8208;Blue Narrowband Emission for Large&#8208;Area Printed Display</title>

         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area blade&#8208;coated ultradeep&#8208;blue polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are fabricated based on triphenylamine spirofunctionalized polydiarylfluorenes (POPSAF). POPSAF present a&#160;stable narrowband emissionand good charge transport behavior. Large&#8208;area printed PLEDs are constructed with an uniform emission of full width at half maximum &#8776;36&#160;nm and a Commission internationale de l&#8217;&#233;clairage of (0.155, 0.072) for preliminary passive matrix PLED display.








Abstract
Emerging printed large&#8208;area polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are essential for manufacturing flat&#8208;panel displays and solid lighting devices. However, it is challenging to obtain large&#8208;area and stable ultradeep&#8208;blue PLEDs because of the lack of light&#8208;emitting conjugated polymers (LCPs) with robust deep&#8208;blue emissions, excellent morphological stabilities, and high charging abilities. Here, a novel unsymmetrically substituted polydiarylfluorene (POPSAF) is obtained with stable narrowband emission for large&#8208;area printed displays via triphenylamine (TPA) spirofunctionalization of LCPs. POPSAF films show narrowband and stable ultradeep&#8208;blue emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 36&#160;nm, associated with their intrachain excitonic behavior without obvious polaron formation. Compared to controlled poly[4&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl]&#8208;co&#8208;[5&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl] (PODPF), excellent charge transport is observed in the POPSAF films because of the intrinsic hole transport ability of the TPA units. Large&#8208;area PLEDs are fabricated via blade&#8208;coating with an emission area of 9 cm2, which exhibit uniform ultradeep&#8208;blue emission with an FWHM of 36&#160;nm and corresponding Commission internationale de l&#8217;&#233;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.155, 0.072). These findings are attributed to the synergistic effects of robust emission, stable morphology, and printing capacity. Finally, preliminary printed passive matrix (PM) PLED displays with 20 &#215; 20 pixels monochromes are fabricated, confirmed the effectiveness of spirofunctionalization in optoelectronics.

         <title>Engineering Biomaterials to Model Immune&#8208;Tumor Interactions In Vitro</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the authors explore the pertinent microenvironmental cues that drive tumor progression in the context of the immune system, discuss how these cues can be incorporated into hydrogel design to culture immune cells, and describe progress toward precision oncological drug screening with engineered&#160;tissues.








Abstract
Engineered biomaterial scaffolds are becoming more prominent in research laboratories to study drug efficacy for oncological applications in vitro, but do they have a place in pharmaceutical drug screening pipelines? The low efficacy of cancer drugs in phase II/III clinical trials suggests that there are critical mechanisms not properly accounted for in the pre&#8208;clinical evaluation of drug candidates. Immune cells associated with the tumor may account for some of these failures given recent successes with cancer immunotherapies; however, there are few representative platforms to study immune cells in the context of cancer as traditional 2D culture is typically monocultures and humanized animal models have a weakened immune composition. Biomaterials that replicate tumor microenvironmental cues may provide a more relevant model with greater in vitro complexity. In this review, the authors explore the pertinent microenvironmental cues that drive tumor progression in the context of the immune system, discuss how these cues can be incorporated into hydrogel design to culture immune cells, and describe progress toward precision oncological drug screening with engineered tissues.

         <title>Mechanically Robust Self&#8208;Organized Crack&#8208;Free Nanocellular Graphene with Outstanding Electrochemical Properties in Sodium Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel crack&#8208;free nanocellular graphene is developed by liquid metal dealloying. The defect&#8208;free nature of the precursor leads to the self&#8208;organization of nanocellular carbons without cracks, and offers an exceptional combination of high tensile strength, good electrical conductivity, and high specific surface area. Multifunctionality of this unique graphene material enhances the rate and cycle performance of Na&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Crack&#8208;free nanocellular graphenes are attractive materials with extraordinary mechanical and electrochemical properties, but their homogeneous synthesis on the centimeter scale is challenging. Here, a strong nanocellular graphene film achieved by the self&#8208;organization of carbon atoms using liquid metal dealloying and employing a defect&#8208;free amorphous precursor is reported. This study demonstrates that a Bi melt strongly catalyzes the self&#8208;structuring of graphene layers at low processing temperatures. The robust nanoarchitectured graphene displays a high&#8208;genus seamless framework and exhibits remarkable tensile strength (34.8&#160;MPa) and high electrical conductivity (1.6 &#215; 104 S m&#8722;1). This unique material has excellent potential for flexible and high&#8208;rate sodium&#8208;ion battery applications.

         <title>Electrolytes Design for Extending the Temperature Adaptability of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: from Fundamentals to Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on electrolytes design for lithium ion batteries (LIBs) from a temperature adaptability perspective. Prototypical examples, such as lithium salts, solvent structures, additives, and interfacial layers, are presented to explain how these factors can affect the electrochemical behavior of LIBs. Meanwhile, the principles and&#160;limitations of electrolytes design, are discussed under the corresponding temperature conditions.








Abstract
With the continuously growing demand for wide&#8208;range applications, lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) are increasingly required to work under conditions that deviate from room temperature (RT). However, commercial electrolytes exhibit low thermal stability at high temperatures (HT) and poor dynamic properties at low temperatures (LT), hindering the operation of LIBs under extreme conditions. The bottleneck restricting the practical applications of LIBs has promoted researchers to pay more attention to developing a series of innovative electrolytes. This review primarily covers the design of electrolytes for LIBs from a temperature adaptability perspective. First, the fundamentals of electrolytes concerning temperature, including donor number (DN), dielectric constant, viscosity, conductivity, ionic transport, and theoretical calculations are elaborated. Second, prototypical examples, such as lithium salts, solvent structures, additives, and interfacial layers in both liquid and solid electrolytes, are presented to explain how these factors can affect the electrochemical behavior of LIBs at high or low temperatures. Meanwhile, the principles and limitations of electrolyte design are discussed under the corresponding temperature conditions. Finally, a summary and outlook regarding electrolytes design to extend the temperature adaptability of LIBs are proposed.

         <title>Activating CD8+ T Cells by Pt(IV) Prodrug&#8208;Based Nanomedicine and aPD&#8208;L1 Antibody for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regulation of the tumor immune microenvironment is a crucial factor that affects the effectiveness of cancer therapy. In this study, the combined action of retinoic acid&#8208;containing polymers and Pt(IV) prodrugs induces a potent antitumor effect by reducing myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells infiltration and promoting T&#8208;cell immune responses, which ultimately effectively inhibits tumor growth, metastasis and recurrence.








Abstract
Recent years have witnessed substantial progress in cancer immunotherapy, specifically T cell&#8208;based therapies. However, the application of T cell therapies has been primarily limited to hematologic malignancies, with limited success in the treatment of solid tumors. The main challenge in treating solid tumor is immune escape, which is characterized by reduced antigenicity, diminished immunogenicity, and the development of suppressive tumor immune microenvironments. To address these obstacles and restore T cell&#8208;mediated anti&#8208;tumor responses, a novel nanoparticle formulation known as PRA@Oxa&#8208;c16 is developed. This innovative approach combines retinoic acid and Pt(IV) to specifically target and overcome immune escape. Notably, the therapeutic efficacy of PRA@Oxa&#8208;c16 primarily relies on its ability to induce anti&#8208;tumor T cell responses, in contrast to the cytotoxicity associated with conventional chemotherapeutic agents. When combined with an immune checkpoint blockade, anti&#8208;programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 antibody, PRA@Oxa&#8208;c16 effectively eliminates solid tumors and induces immune memory responses, which prevent tumor metastasis and recurrence. This promising approach holds great potential for enhancing the treatment of solid tumors with T cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;The regulation of the tumor immune microenvironment is a crucial factor that affects the effectiveness of cancer therapy. In this study, the combined action of retinoic acid-containing polymers and Pt(IV) prodrugs induces a potent antitumor effect by reducing myeloid-derived suppressor cells infiltration and promoting T-cell immune responses, which ultimately effectively inhibits tumor growth, metastasis and recurrence.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent years have witnessed substantial progress in cancer immunotherapy, specifically T cell-based therapies. However, the application of T cell therapies has been primarily limited to hematologic malignancies, with limited success in the treatment of solid tumors. The main challenge in treating solid tumor is immune escape, which is characterized by reduced antigenicity, diminished immunogenicity, and the development of suppressive tumor immune microenvironments. To address these obstacles and restore T cell-mediated anti-tumor responses, a novel nanoparticle formulation known as PRA@Oxa-c16 is developed. This innovative approach combines retinoic acid and Pt(IV) to specifically target and overcome immune escape. Notably, the therapeutic efficacy of PRA@Oxa-c16 primarily relies on its ability to induce anti-tumor T cell responses, in contrast to the cytotoxicity associated with conventional chemotherapeutic agents. When combined with an immune checkpoint blockade, anti-programmed death-ligand 1 antibody, PRA@Oxa-c16 effectively eliminates solid tumors and induces immune memory responses, which prevent tumor metastasis and recurrence. This promising approach holds great potential for enhancing the treatment of solid tumors with T cell-based immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Functionalized Inorganic Oxide Nanomaterials for Solid Cancer Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces the peptide&#8208;functionalized inorganic oxide nanomaterials (PFIONs) as promising candidates in the optically, magnetically, ultrasonically guided imaging and therapy for solid tumors, highlighting the superiority of construction strategies of PFIONs and multimodal imaging and synergistic treatment, as well as integration of diagnosis and treatment for solid tumors based on PFIONs.








Abstract
The diagnosis and treatment of solid tumors have undergone significant advancements marked by a trend toward increased specificity and integration of imaging and therapeutic functions. The multifaceted nature of inorganic oxide nanomaterials (IONs), which boast optical, magnetic, ultrasonic, and biochemical modulatory properties, makes them ideal building blocks for developing multifunctional nanoplatforms. A promising class of materials that have emerged in this context are peptide&#8208;functionalized inorganic oxide nanomaterials (PFIONs), which have demonstrated excellent performance in multifunctional imaging and therapy, making them potential candidates for advancing solid tumor diagnosis and treatment. Owing to the functionalities of peptides in tumor targeting, penetration, responsiveness, and therapy, well&#8208;designed PFIONs can specifically accumulate and release therapeutic or imaging agents at the solid tumor sites, enabling precise imaging and effective treatment. This review provides an overview of the recent advances in the use of PFIONs for the imaging and treatment of solid tumors, highlighting the superiority of imaging and therapeutic integration as well as synergistic treatment. Moreover, the review discusses the challenges and prospects of PFIONs in depth, aiming to promote the intersection of the interdisciplinary to facilitate their clinical translation and the development of personalized diagnostic and therapeutic systems by optimizing the material systems.

         <title>Multidimensional Interactive Cascading Nanochips for Detection of Multiple Liver Diseases via Precise Metabolite Profiling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multidimensional interactive cascade nanochip is developed to form a multi&#8208;interaction proton transport pathway for ionization and reduce the thermal conductivity for thermally&#8208;driven desorption. Multiple liver diseases are high&#8208;throughput and accurately detected via a single pass&#160;and potential metabolic biomarkers are revealed via serum metabolic profiling based on nanochip&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry analysis and the neural network model.








Abstract
It is challenging to detect and differentiate multiple diseases with high complexity/similarity from the same organ. Metabolic analysis based on nanomatrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (NMALDI&#8208;MS) is a promising platform for disease diagnosis, while the enhanced property of its core nanomatrix materials has plenty of room for improvement. Herein, a multidimensional interactive cascade nanochip composed of iron oxide nanoparticles (FeNPs)/MXene/gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), IMG, is reported for serum metabolic profiling to achieve high&#8208;throughput detection of multiple liver diseases. MXene serves as a multi&#8208;binding site and an electron&#8208;hole source for ionization during NMALDI&#8208;MS analysis. Introduction of AuNPs with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) properties facilitates surface charge accumulation and rapid energy conversion. FeNPs are integrated into the MXene/Au nanocomposite to sharply reduce the thermal conductivity of the nanochip with negligible heat loss for strong thermally&#8208;driven desorption, and construct a multi&#8208;interaction proton transport pathway with MXene and AuNPs for strong ionization. Analysis of these enhanced serum fingerprint signals detected from the IMG nanochip through a neural network model results in differentiation of multiple liver diseases via a single pass and revelation of potential metabolic biomarkers. The promising method can rapidly and accurately screen various liver diseases, thus allowing timely treatment of liver diseases.

         <title>Phenothiazine Derivatives as Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Cathodes with Adjustable Dropout Voltage and Cycle Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work connects microstructure and macroscopic properties via molecular aggregation, and for the first time summarizes the relationship among molecular structure, molecular aggregation, and electrochemical properties. With the extension of alkyl chain, the dropout voltage exhibits &#8220;odd&#8208;even effect&#8221;, and the cycle stability presents &#8220;alkyl chain length effect&#8221;, providing valuable guidance for the further development of this field.








Abstract
Compared with conventional inorganic materials, organic electrodes are competitive candidates for secondary battery cathodes due to their resourcefulness, environmental friendliness, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Much effort is devoted at the level of chemical structure, while ignoring the impact of molecular aggregation on battery behavior. Herein, this work designs a series of organic molecules with two electrochemically active phenothiazine groups linked by different lengths of alkyl chain to regulate molecular symmetry and crystallinity. The results emphasize the equally important role of molecular aggregation and chemical structure for battery performance. Among them, 2PTZ&#8208;C7H14|Li cell exhibits the most impressive cycle and rate performance. At the high rate of 50 C, it can still deliver a capacity of 63.4 mA h g&#8722;1 and 74.5% capacity retention after 10&#160;000 cycles. Besides, the dropout voltage of 2PTZ&#8208;C9H18|Li cell is only 52 mV, which is among the lowest reported for lithium&#8208;organic batteries to the best of the author's knowledge.

         <title>Planar Cation Passivation on Colloidal Quantum Dots Enables High&#8208;Performance 0.35&#8211;1.8&#160;&#181;m Broadband TFT Imager</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an innovative passivation strategy for large&#8208;size PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), using a planar 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cation to face&#8208;to&#8208;face couple on PbS (100) facet and strengthen halide passivation on PbS (111) facet. This effective passivation enables monolithically integrated 0.35&#8208;1.8&#160;&#181;m broadband CQDs TFT imager.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising candidates for broadband photodetectors from visible light to shortwave infrared (SWIR). However, large&#8208;size PbS CQDs sensitive to longer SWIR are mainly exposed with nonpolar (100) facets on the surface, which lack robust passivation strategies. Herein, an innovative passivation strategy that employs planar cation, is introduced to enable face&#8208;to&#8208;face coupling on (100) facets and strengthen halide passivation on (111) facets. The defect density of CQDs film (Eg &#8776; 0.74&#160;eV) is reduced from 2.74&#160;&#215;&#160;1015 to 1.04&#160;&#160;&#215;&#160;1015 cm&#8722;3, coupled with 0.1&#160;eV reduction in the activation energy of defects. The resultant CQDs photodiodes exhibit a low dark current density of 14 nA cm&#8722;2 with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 62%, achieving a linear dynamic range of 98&#160;dB, a &#8722;3dB bandwidth of 103&#160;kHz and a detectivity of 4.7&#160;&#215;&#160;1011 Jones. The comprehensive performance of the CQDs photodiodes outperforms previously reported CQDs photodiodes operating at &gt;1.6&#160;&#181;m. By monolithically integrated with thin&#8208;film transistor (TFT) readout circuit, the broadband CQDs imager covering 0.35&#8208;1.8&#160;&#181;m realizes the functions including silicon wafer perspectivity and material discrimination, showing its potential for wide range of applications.

         <title>Decomposable Nanoagonists Enable NIR&#8208;Elicited cGAS&#8208;STING Activation for Tandem&#8208;Amplified Photodynamic&#8208;Metalloimmunotherapy</title>

A decomposable nanoagonist is developed for agonists&#8208;free cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) activation. This process results in released mitochondrial DNA, inhibited nuclear DNA repair, and metal ions&#8208;boosted cGAS enzyme activity, synergistically facilitating the cGAS&#8208;STING activation. Combining these effects and the photodynamic&#8208;enhanced antitumor immune response, the nanoagonist enables an amplified photodynamic&#8208;metalloimmunotherapy of tumors.








Abstract
Activation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway has emerged as an efficient strategy to improve the therapeutic outcomes of immunotherapy. However, the &#8220;constantly active&#8221; mode of current STING agonist delivery strategies typically leads to off&#8208;target toxicity and hyperimmunity. To address this critical issue, herein a metal&#8208;organic frameworks&#8208;based nanoagonist (DZ@A7) featuring tumor&#8208;specific and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;enhanced decomposition is constructed for precisely localized STING activation and photodynamic&#8208;metalloimmunotherapy. The engineered nanoagonist enabled the generation of mitochondria&#8208;targeted reactive oxygen species under NIR irradiation to specifically release mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and inhibit the repair of nuclear DNA via hypoxia&#8208;responsive drugs. Oxidized tumor mtDNA serves as an endogenous danger&#8208;associated molecular pattern that activates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Concurrently, NIR&#8208;accelerated zinc ions overloading in cancer cells further enhance the cGAS enzymatic activity through metalloimmune effects. By combining the synergistically enhanced activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway triggered by NIR irradiation, the engineered nanoagonist facilitated the maturation of dendritic cells and infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes for primary tumor eradication, which also established a long&#8208;term anti&#8208;tumor immunity to suppress tumor metastasis. Therefore, the developed nanoagonist enabled NIR&#8208;triggered, agonist&#8208;free, and tandem&#8208;amplified activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, thereby offering a distinct paradigm for photodynamic&#8208;metalloimmunotherapy.

         <title>Tailless Information&#8211;Energy Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tailless information&#8211;energy metasurface platform is proposed by integrating programmable metasurface with wireless power transmission technology. This platform eliminates the need for an external DC power source, which is typically required in conventional programmable metasurface systems. Moreover, it enables the simultaneous transmission of wireless energy and information.








Abstract
Programmable metasurface technology can achieve flexible manipulations of electromagnetic waves in real time by adjusting the surface structure and material properties and has shown extraordinary potential in many fields such as wireless communications and the Internet of Things. However, most of the programmable metasurfaces have a common feature: a tail (electrical wires and DC powers), which is difficult to supply in some particular application scenarios such as canyons and mountains. To eliminate the limitation of DC power supply, the programmable metasurface and wireless power transfer technology are combined to propose a tailless information&#8211;energy metasurface (IEMS). The tailless IEMS platform can dynamically control electromagnetic waves without relying on an external DC power supply; instead, the required DC power is provided internally by the IEMS platform itself. In the tailless IEMS experiments, the concept is demonstrated through the dynamic regulation of wireless channels and the wireless transmission of DC power. This work provides a self&#8208;powered method for programmable metasurfaces, expands the application scenarios, facilitates the miniaturization of systems, and makes it easy to integrate with other systems.

         <title>Photoactivation Inducing Multifunctional Coupling of Fluorophore for Efficient Tumor Therapy In Situ</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactivatable sensor for in situ formation of near infrared fluorochrome is reported. Importantly, the photoactivation process involves the generation of superoxide anion radicals, which is highly promising for photodynamic therapy. Besides, the photochemically generated product possess ultra&#8208;high photothermal conversion efficiency up to 90.9%. Importantly, BI and Cy&#9472;BI are identified as efficient CHK1 inhibitor.








Abstract
Photoactivatable molecules, with high&#8208;precision spatialtemporal control, have largely promoted bioimaging and phototherapy applications of fluorescent dyes. Here, the first photoactivatable sensor (BI) is described that can be triggered by broad excitation light (405&#8211;660 nm), which further undergoes intersystem crossing and H&#8208;atom transfer processes to forming superoxide anion radicals (O2&#8722;&#8226;) and carbon radicals. Particularly, the photoinduced gain of carbon&#8208;centered radicals (BI&#8226;) allows for radical&#8208;radical coupling to afford the combined crosslink product (BI&#9472;BI), which would be oxidized in the presence of O2&#8722;&#8226; to produce an extended conjugate system with near infrared emission (820 nm). Besides, the photochemically generated product (Cy&#9472;BI) possesses ultra&#8208;high photothermal conversion efficiency up to 90.9%, which optimized phototherapy potential. What&#8242;s more, Western Blot assay reveals that both BI and the photoproduct Cy&#9472;BI can efficiently inhibit the expression of CHK1, and the irradiation of BI and Cy&#9472;BI further induces apoptosis and ultimately enhances the phototherapeutic effects. Thus, the combination of cell cycle block inducing apoptosis, photodynamic therapy and photothermal therapy treatments significantly suppress solid tumor in vivo antitumor efficacy explorations. This is a novel finding in developing photoactivatable molecules, as well as the broad applicability of photoimaging and phototherapy in tumor&#8208;related areas.

         <title>Physicochemical Targeting of Lipid Nanoparticles to the Lungs Induces Clotting: Mechanisms and Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have become the dominant drug delivery technology in industry, holding the promise to deliver RNA to up or down&#8208;regulate any protein of interest. LNPs have mostly been targeted to specific cell types or organs by physicochemical targeting in which LNP's lipid compositions are adjusted to find mixtures with the desired tropism. Here we examined lung tropic LNPs, whose organ tropism derives from containing either a cationic or ionizable lipid conferring a positive zeta potential. Surprisingly, we found these LNPs induce massive thrombosis. We show such thrombosis in the lungs and other organs, and that it is greatly exacerbated by pre&#8208;existing inflammation. This clotting is induced by a variety of formulations with cationic lipids, including LNPs and non&#8208;LNP nanoparticles, and even by lung&#8208;tropic ionizable lipids that do not have a permanent cationic charge. The mechanism depends on the LNPs binding to and then changing the conformation of fibrinogen, which then activates platelets and thrombin. Based on these mechanisms, we engineered multiple solutions that enable positively charged LNPs to target the lungs while ameliorating thrombosis. Our findings implicate thrombosis as a major barrier that blood erects against LNPs with positive zeta potential and illustrate how physicochemical targeting approaches must be investigated early for risks and re&#8208;engineered with a careful understanding of biological mechanisms.

         <title>Giant X&#8208;Ray Circular Dichroism in a Time&#8208;Reversal Invariant Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
X&#8208;ray circular dichroism, arising from the contrast in X&#8208;ray absorption between opposite photon helicities, serves as a spectroscopic tool to measure the magnetization of ferromagnetic materials and identify the handedness of chiral crystals. Antiferromagnets with crystallographic chirality typically lack X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism because of time&#8208;reversal symmetry, yet exhibit weak X&#8208;ray natural circular dichroism. Here, we&#160;report the observation of giant natural circular dichroism in the Ni L3&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption of Ni3TeO6, a polar and chiral antiferromagnet with effective time&#8208;reversal symmetry. To unravel this intriguing phenomenon, we&#160;propose a phenomenological model that classifies the movement of photons in a chiral crystal within the same symmetry class as that of a magnetic field. The coupling of X&#8208;ray polarization with the induced magnetization yields giant X&#8208;ray natural circular dichroism, revealing typical ferromagnetic behaviors allowed by the symmetry in an antiferromagnet, i.e., the altermagnetism of Ni3TeO6. Our&#160;findings provide evidence for the interplay between magnetism and crystal chirality in natural optical activity. Additionally, we&#160;establish the first example of a new class of magnetic materials exhibiting circular dichroism with time&#8208;reversal&#160;symmetry.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X-ray circular dichroism, arising from the contrast in X-ray absorption between opposite photon helicities, serves as a spectroscopic tool to measure the magnetization of ferromagnetic materials and identify the handedness of chiral crystals. Antiferromagnets with crystallographic chirality typically lack X-ray magnetic circular dichroism because of time-reversal symmetry, yet exhibit weak X-ray natural circular dichroism. Here, we&#160;report the observation of giant natural circular dichroism in the Ni &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-edge X-ray absorption of Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;TeO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, a polar and chiral antiferromagnet with effective time-reversal symmetry. To unravel this intriguing phenomenon, we&#160;propose a phenomenological model that classifies the movement of photons in a chiral crystal within the same symmetry class as that of a magnetic field. The coupling of X-ray polarization with the induced magnetization yields giant X-ray natural circular dichroism, revealing typical ferromagnetic behaviors allowed by the symmetry in an antiferromagnet, i.e., the altermagnetism of Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;TeO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Our&#160;findings provide evidence for the interplay between magnetism and crystal chirality in natural optical activity. Additionally, we&#160;establish the first example of a new class of magnetic materials exhibiting circular dichroism with time-reversal&#160;symmetry.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Sustained and Localized Drug Depot Release using Radiation&#8208;Activated Scintillating Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Clinical treatment of cancer commonly incorporates X&#8208;ray radiation therapy (XRT), and developing spatially&#8208;precise radiation&#8208;activatable drug delivery strategies may improve XRT efficacy while limiting off&#8208;target toxicities associated with systemically administered drugs. Nevertheless, achieving this has been challenging thus far because strategies typically rely on radical species with short lifespans, and the inherent nature of hypoxic and acidic tumor microenvironments may encourage spatially heterogeneous effects. We hypothesized that the challenge could be bypassed by using scintillating nanoparticles that emit light upon X&#8208;ray absorption, locally forming therapeutic drug depots in tumor tissues. We thus developed a nanoparticle platform (
Scintillating nanoparticle Drug Depot; SciDD) that enables the local release of cytotoxic payloads only after activation by XRT, thereby limiting off&#8208;target toxicity. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, SciDD was used to deliver a microtubule&#8208;destabilizing payload MMAE (monomethyl auristatin E). With as little as a 2&#160;Gy local irradiation to tumors, MMAE payloads were released effectively to kill tumor cells. XRT&#8208;mediated drug release was demonstrated in multiple mouse cancer models and showed efficacy over XRT alone (p &lt; 0.0001). This work shows that SciDD can act as a local drug depot with spatiotemporally controlled release of cancer therapeutics.

         <title>Structuring and Shaping of Mechanically Robust and Functional Hydrogels Toward Wearable and Implantable Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrogels possess unique features such as softness, wetness, responsiveness, and biocompatibility, making them highly suitable for biointegrated applications that have close interactions with living organisms. However, conventional man&#8208;made hydrogels are usually soft and brittle, making them inferior to the mechanically robust biological hydrogels. To ensure reliable and durable operation of biointegrated wearable and implantable devices, mechanical matching and shape adaptivity of hydrogels to tissues and organs are essential. Recent advances in polymer science and processing technologies have enabled mechanical engineering and shaping of hydrogels for various biointegrated applications. In this review, we summarize polymer network structuring strategies at micro/nano scales for toughening hydrogels, and further discuss representative mechanical functionalities that exist in biological materials but are not easily achieved in synthetic hydrogels. We review three categories of processing technologies namely 3D printing, spinning, and coating for fabrication of tough hydrogel constructs with complex shapes, and the corresponding hydrogel toughening strategies are also highlighted. These developments enable adaptive fabrication of mechanically robust and functional hydrogel devices, and promote application of hydrogels in the fields of biomedical engineering, bioelectronics and soft robotics.

         <title>From Nature&#8208;Sourced Polysaccharide Particles to Advanced Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polysaccharides constitute over 90% of the carbohydrate mass in nature, which makes them a promising feedstock for manufacturing sustainable materials. Polysaccharide particles (PSPs) are used as effective scavengers, carriers of chemical and biological cargo, and as building blocks for the fabrication of macroscopic materials. The biocompatibility and degradability of PSPs are advantageous for their uses as biomaterials with more environmental friendliness. This review highlights the progresses in PSP applications as advanced functional materials, by describing PSP extraction, preparation, and surface functionalization with a variety of functional groups, polymers, nanoparticles, and biologically active species. This review also outlines the fabrication of PSP&#8208;derived materials, as well as their applications in soft robotics, sensing, scavenging, water harvesting, drug delivery, and bioengineering. The paper is concluded with an outlook providing perspectives in the development and applications of PSP&#8208;derived materials.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sensitive and Stable Multiplexed Biosensors Array in Fully Printed and Integrated Platforms for Reliable Perspiration Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrochemical biosensors have emerged as one of the promising tools for tracking human body physiological dynamics via non&#8208;invasive perspiration analysis. However, it remains a key challenge to integrate multiplexed sensors in a highly controllable and reproducible manner to achieve long&#8208;term reliable biosensing, especially on flexible platforms. Herein, we report the first time a fully inkjet printed and integrated multiplexed biosensing patch with remarkably high stability and sensitivity. These desirable characteristics are enabled by the unique interpenetrating interface design and precise control over active materials mass loading, owing to the optimized ink formulations and droplet&#8208;assisted printing processes. The sensors deliver sensitivities of 313.28&#160;&#181;A mm &#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 for glucose and 0.87&#160;&#181;A mm &#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 for alcohol sensing with minimal drift over 30 hours, which are among the best in literature. The integrated patch can be used for reliable and wireless diet monitoring or medical intervention via epidermal analysis, and would inspire the advances of wearable devices for intelligent healthcare applications.

         <title>Controlled Refolding of Denatured IL&#8208;12 Using in Situ Antigen&#8208;Capturing Nanochaperone Remarkably Reduces the Systemic Toxicity and Enhances Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Cytokines are powerful in cancer immunotherapy, however, their therapeutic potential has been limited by the severe systemic toxicity. Here we describe a potent strategy to reduce the toxicity of systemic cytokine therapy by delivering its denatured form using a finely designed nanochaperone. We demonstrate that even if the denatured protein cargos are occasionally released under normal physiological conditions they are still misfolded, while can effectively refold into native states and release to fuction in tumor microenvironment. Consequently, the systemic toxicities of cytokines are nearly completely overcome. Moreover, an immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;inducing chemotherapeutic is further loaded and delivered to tumor using this nanochaperone to trigger the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens (TAAs) which are subsequently captured in situ by nanochaperone and then reflows into lymph nodes (LNs) to promote antigen cross&#8208;presentation. This optimized personalized nanochaperone&#8208;vaccine demonstrates unprecedented suppressive effects against large advanced tumors, and in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy results in a significant abscopal effect and inhibition of postoperative tumor recurrence and metastasis. Hence, this approach provides a simple and universal delivery strategy to reduce the systemic toxicities of cytokines, as well as provides a robust personalized cancer vaccination platform, which may find wide applications in cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Development and Application of an Advanced Biomedical Material&#8208;Silk Sericin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sericin, a protein derived from silkworm cocoons, was considered as a waste product derived from silk industry for thousands of years due to a lack of understanding of its properties. However, in recent decades, a range of exciting properties of sericin have been studied and uncovered, including cytocompatibility, low&#8208;immunogenicity, photo&#8208;luminescence, antioxidant properties, as well as cell&#8208;function regulating activities. These properties make sericin&#8208;based biomaterials promising candidates for biomedical applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sericin, a protein derived from silkworm cocoons, was considered as a waste product derived from silk industry for thousands of years due to a lack of understanding of its properties. However, in recent decades, a range of exciting properties of sericin have been studied and uncovered, including cytocompatibility, low-immunogenicity, photo-luminescence, antioxidant properties, as well as cell-function regulating activities. These properties make sericin-based biomaterials promising candidates for biomedical applications. This review summarizes the properties and bioactivities of silk sericin and highlights the latest developments on sericin in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Furthermore, the extended application of sericin in developing flexible electronic devices and 3D bioprinting is also discussed. It is believed that sericin-based biomaterials have great potential of being developed into novel tissue engineering products and smart implantable devices for various medical applications towards improving clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
In the last decade, interfacial solar steam generation (ISSG), powered by natural sunlight garnered significant attention due to its great potential for low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly clean water production in alignment with the global decarbonization efforts. In this review, we aim to share the knowledge and engage with a broader readership about the current progress of ISSG technology and the facing challenges to promote further advancements towards practical applications. The first part of this review assesses the current strategies for enhancing energy efficiency of ISSG systems, including optimizing light absorption, reducing energy losses, harvesting additional energy, and lowering evaporation enthalpy. Subsequently, we elucidate the current challenges faced by ISSG technologies, notably salt accumulation and bio&#8208;fouling issues in practical applications and discuss contemporary methods to overcome these challenges. In the end, we introduce potential applications of ISSG, ranging from initial seawater desalination and industrial wastewater purification to power generation, sterilization, soil remediation, and innovative concept of solar sea farm, highlighting the promising potential of ISSG technology in contributing to sustainable and environmentally conscious practices. Based on the review and in&#8208;depth understanding of these aspects, we propose the future research focuses to address potential issues in both fundamental research and practical applications.
