         <title>Curved Nanographenes: Multiple Emission, Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence, and Non&#8208;Radiative Decay</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unusual photophysics of a class of curved chiral nanographenes (CNG) consisting of a corannulene and a tert&#8208;butylhexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene is investigated by time&#8208;resolved and temperature&#8208;dependent spectroscopy. Dual fluorescence and dual phosphorescence are found, as well as non&#8208;Kasha emission and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in a narrow temperature range. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations provide detailed understanding of the experimental findings.








Abstract
The intriguing and rich photophysical properties of three curved nanographenes (CNG 6, 7, and 8) are investigated by time&#8208;resolved and temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. CNG 7 and 8 exhibit dual fluorescence, as well as dual phosphorescence at low temperature in the main PL bands. In addition, hot bands are detected in fluorescence as well as phosphorescence, and, in the narrow temperature range of 100&#8211;140 K, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with lifetimes on the millisecond time&#8208;scale is observed. These findings are rationalized by quantum&#8208;chemical simulations, which predict a single minimum of the S1 potential of CNG 6, but two S1 minima for CNG 7 and CNG 8, with considerable geometric reorganization between them, in agreement with the experimental findings. Additionally, a higher&#8208;lying S2 minimum close to S1 is optimized for the three CNG, from where emission is also possible due to thermal activation and, hence, non&#8208;Kasha behavior. The presence of higher&#8208;lying dark triplet states close to the S1 minima provides mechanistic evidence for the TADF phenomena observed. Non&#8208;radiative decay of the T1 state appears to be thermally activated with activation energies of roughly 100&#160;meV and leads to disappearance of phosphorescence and TADF at T&#160;&gt;&#160;140&#160;K.

         <title>Deep Learning in Mechanical Metamaterials: From Prediction and Generation to Inverse Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Mechanical metamaterials are meticulously designed structures with exceptional mechanical properties determined by their microstructures and constituent materials. Tailoring their material and geometric distribution unlocks the potential to achieve unprecedented bulk properties and functions. However, current mechanical metamaterial design considerably relies on experienced designers' inspiration through trial and error, while investigating their mechanical properties and responses entails time&#8208;consuming mechanical testing or computationally expensive simulations. Nevertheless, recent advancements in deep learning have revolutionized the design process of mechanical metamaterials, enabling property prediction and geometry generation without prior knowledge. Furthermore, deep generative models can transform conventional forward design into inverse design. Many recent studies on the implementation of deep learning in mechanical metamaterials are highly specialized, and their pros and cons may not be immediately evident. This critical review provides a comprehensive overview of the capabilities of deep learning in property prediction, geometry generation, and inverse design of mechanical metamaterials. Additionally, this review highlights the potential of leveraging deep learning to create universally applicable datasets, intelligently designed metamaterials, and material intelligence. This article is expected to be valuable not only to researchers working on mechanical metamaterials but also those in the field of materials&#160;informatics.

         <title>Weaving Aerogels into 3D Ordered Hyperelastic Hybrid Carbon Assemblies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultralight and hyperelastic nanofiber&#8208;woven hybrid carbon assembly (NWHCA) is fabricated by nanofiber weaving of isotropic porous and mechanical brittle quasi&#8208;aerogels. The 3D&#8208;ordered lamella&#8211;bridge&#8208;structured NWHCA exhibits outstanding electrochemical activity and mechanical elasticity ascribing to the combination of metallogel&#8208;derived quasi&#8208;aerogel hybridization and nitrogen/phosphorus co&#8208;doping. Integrated wearable sensing devices based on NWHCA are demonstrated for detecting sophisticated human motions.








Abstract
The development of a 3D carbon assembly with a combination of extraordinary electrochemical and mechanical properties is desirable yet challenging. Herein, an ultralight and hyperelastic nanofiber&#8208;woven hybrid carbon assembly (NWHCA) is fabricated by nanofiber weaving of isotropic porous and mechanical brittle quasi&#8208;aerogels. Upon subsequent pyrolysis, metallogel&#8208;derived quasi&#8208;aerogel hybridization and nitrogen/phosphorus co&#8208;doping are integrated into the NWHCA. Finite element simulation indicates that the 3D lamella&#8211;bridge architecture of NWHCA with the quasi&#8208;aerogel hybridization contributes to resisting plastic deformation and structural damage under high compression, experimentally demonstrated by complete deformation recovery at 80% compression and unprecedented fatigue resistance (&gt;94% retention after 5000&#160;cycles). Due to the superelasticity and quasi&#8208;aerogel integration, the zinc&#8211;air battery assembled based on NWHCA shows excellent electrochemical performance and flexibility. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept integrated device is presented, in which the flexible battery powers a piezoresistive sensor, using the NWHCA as the air cathode and the elastic conductor respectively, which can detect full&#8208;range and sophisticated motions while attached to human skin. The nanofiber weaving strategy allows the construction of lightweight, superelastic, and multifunctional hybrid carbon assemblies with great potential in wearable and integrated electronics.

         <title>Selective Methionine Pool Exhaustion Mediated by a Sequential Positioned MOF Nanotransformer for Intense Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequential positioned metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanotransformer is designed to selectively exhaust the methionine pool via inhibiting the uptake of methionine and throttling its salvage pathway for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. The utilization of the MOF nanotransformer will motivate the development of novel and efficient antineoplastic platforms, offers a strategy for disturbing methionine homeostasis, and provides new insights into the treatments of other diseases.








Abstract
Cancer cells are addictive to exogenous methionine to gear toward tumor proliferation. Meanwhile, they can replenish methionine pool from polyamine metabolism through a methionine salvage pathway. However, the current developed therapeutic tactics for methionine depletion are still facing great challenges in terms of the selectivity, safety, and efficiency. Herein, a sequential positioned metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanotransformer is designed to selectively exhaust the methionine pool via inhibiting the uptake of methionine and throttling its salvage pathway for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. The MOF nanotransformer can restrain the open source and reduce the reflux of methionine to exhaust the methionine pool of cancer cells. Moreover, the intracellular traffic routes of the sequential positioned MOF nanotransformer match well with the distribution of polyamines, which is conducive to the oxidation of polyamines via its responsive deformability and nanozyme&#8208;augmented Fenton&#8208;like reaction for the final exhaustion of intracellular methionine. These results verify that the well&#8208;designed platform cannot only kill cancer cells efficiently but also promote the infiltration of CD8 and CD4 T cells for intensive cancer immunotherapy. Overall, it is believed that this work will inspire the construction of novel MOF&#8208;based antineoplastic platforms and provide new insights into the development of metabolic&#8208;related immunotherapy.

         <title>Angstrom&#8208;Confined Electrochemical Synthesis of Sub&#8208;Unit&#8208;Cell Non&#8208;Van Der Waals 2D Metal Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How thin can non&#8208;vanderWaals (non&#8211;vdW) materials be electrochemically synthesized? In this work, a bottom&#8208;up electrochemical synthesis of a (sub&#8208;)unit&#8211;cell&#8211;thick non&#8208;vdW material is presented. By utilizing the angstrom confinement within reduced graphene oxide stacks, 2D &#945;&#8208;Cr2O3 and 2D &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 are grown with a straightforward electrochemical method obtaining a polycrystalline network of atomically thin 2Dtransition&#8211;metal oxides.








Abstract
Bottom&#8208;up electrochemical synthesis of atomically thin materials is desirable yet challenging, especially for non&#8208;vanderWaals (non&#8211;vdW) materials. Thicknesses below a few nanometers have not been reported yet, posing the question&#160;how thin can non&#8208;vdW materials be electrochemically synthesized. This is important as materials with (sub&#8208;)unit&#8211;cell thickness often show remarkably different properties compared to their bulk form or thin films of several nanometers thickness. Here, a straightforward electrochemical method utilizing the angstrom&#8208;confinement of laminar reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanochannels is introduced to obtain a centimeter&#8208;scale network of atomically thin (&lt;4.3&#160;&#197;) 2D&#8208;transition metal oxides (2D&#8208;TMO). The angstrom&#8208;confinement provides a thickness limitation, forcing sub&#8208;unit&#8211;cell growth of 2D&#8208;TMO with oxygen and metal vacancies. It is showcased that Cr2O3, a material without significant catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in bulk form, can be activated as a high&#8208;performing catalyst if synthesized in the 2D sub&#8208;unit&#8211;cell form. This method displays the high activity of sub&#8208;unit&#8211;cell form while retaining the stability of bulk form, promising to yield unexplored fundamental science and applications. It is shown that while retaining the advantages of bottom&#8208;up electrochemical synthesis, like simplicity, high yield, and mild conditions, the thickness of TMO can be limited to sub&#8208;unit&#8211;cell dimensions.

&lt;p&gt;How thin can non-vanderWaals (non&#8211;vdW) materials be electrochemically synthesized? In this work, a bottom-up electrochemical synthesis of a (sub-)unit&#8211;cell&#8211;thick non-vdW material is presented. By utilizing the angstrom confinement within reduced graphene oxide stacks, 2D &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and 2D &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are grown with a straightforward electrochemical method obtaining a polycrystalline network of atomically thin 2Dtransition&#8211;metal oxides.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom-up electrochemical synthesis of atomically thin materials is desirable yet challenging, especially for non-vanderWaals (non&#8211;vdW) materials. Thicknesses below a few nanometers have not been reported yet, posing the question&#160;how thin can non-vdW materials be electrochemically synthesized. This is important as materials with (sub-)unit&#8211;cell thickness often show remarkably different properties compared to their bulk form or thin films of several nanometers thickness. Here, a straightforward electrochemical method utilizing the angstrom-confinement of laminar reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanochannels is introduced to obtain a centimeter-scale network of atomically thin (&amp;lt;4.3&#160;&#197;) 2D-transition metal oxides (2D-TMO). The angstrom-confinement provides a thickness limitation, forcing sub-unit&#8211;cell growth of 2D-TMO with oxygen and metal vacancies. It is showcased that Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a material without significant catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in bulk form, can be activated as a high-performing catalyst if synthesized in the 2D sub-unit&#8211;cell form. This method displays the high activity of sub-unit&#8211;cell form while retaining the stability of bulk form, promising to yield unexplored fundamental science and applications. It is shown that while retaining the advantages of bottom-up electrochemical synthesis, like simplicity, high yield, and mild conditions, the thickness of TMO can be limited to sub-unit&#8211;cell dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NiSi: A New Venue for Antiferromagnetic Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of high&#8208;temperature antiferromagnetism in NiSi with TN &#10878; 700 K is reported. The antiferromagnetism is accompanied by a small uncompensated ferromagnetic component, which can be independently tuned by a small magnetic field, resulting in a one&#8208;step magnetic switching transition. Thus, a new venue for spintronics research is envisaged in this technologically important material.








Abstract
Envisaging antiferromagnetic spintronics pivots on two key criteria of high transition temperature and tuning of underlying magnetic order using straightforward application of magnetic field or electric current. Here, it is shown that NiSi metal can provide suitable new platform in this quest. First, the study unveils high&#8208;temperature antiferromagnetism in single&#8208;crystal NiSi with N&#233;el temperature, TN &#10878; 700 K. Antiferromagnetic order in NiSi is accompanied by non&#8208;centrosymmetric magnetic character with small ferromagnetic component in the a&#8211;c plane. Second, it is found that NiSi manifests distinct magnetic and electronic hysteresis responses to field applications due to the disparity in two moment directions. While magnetic hysteresis is characterized by one&#8208;step switching between ferromagnetic states of uncompensated moment, electronic behavior is ascribed to metamagnetic switching phenomena between non&#8208;collinear spin configurations. Importantly, the switching behaviors persist to high temperature. The properties underscore the importance of NiSi in the pursuit of antiferromagnetic&#160;spintronics.

         <title>Slimming and Reinvigorating Tumor&#8208;Associated Dendritic Cells with Hierarchical Lipid Rewiring Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical lipid rewiring nanoparticles orchestrate the regulation of extracellular lipid uptake, cytoplasmic de novo lipid biosynthesis, and nuclear lipogenic gene transcription for metabolic reprogramming and slimming of tumor&#8208;associated dendritic cells (TADCs). These TADC&#8208;targeting nanoparticles reshape TADCs toward maturation, enhance TADC&#8208;mediated innate and adaptive immunity, and sensitize tumors to checkpoint blockade therapy.









Abstract
Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial mediators of innate and adaptive antitumor immunity, whereas exogenously and endogenously driven lipid accumulation causes immune tolerance of tumor&#8208;associated DCs (TADCs) and thereby diminishes tumor responsiveness to various therapies. Herein, a type of multilevel lipid rewiring nanoparticles (NPs) for TADC revitalization is designed. These self&#8208;assembled NPs specifically bind to the lipid transport receptor Msr1 on the TADC surface and orchestrate the restriction of extracellular lipid uptake, cytoplasmic de novo lipid biosynthesis and nuclear lipogenic gene transcription. It is found that the slimming of TADCs via the three&#8208;in&#8208;one lipid metabolic reprogramming substantially promotes their maturation and rehabilitate their functions in inflammatory cytokine production, cytotoxic T cell recruitment, and tumor inhibition. Significantly, tumor resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy is further overcome. The study presents a non&#8208;canonical strategy to remodel tumor&#8208;infiltrating immune cells and paves a new path for improving the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Sono&#8208;Driven STING Activation using Semiconducting Polymeric Nanoagonists for Precision Sono&#8208;Immunotherapy of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconducting polymeric nanoagonist (SPNM) is developed for in situ sono&#8208;driven STING activation to boost immunotherapy of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Upon sono&#8208;irradiation, SPNM produces singlet oxygen not only to induce immunogenic cell death but also to unleash caged STING agonists to trigger STING activation in situ, leading to enhanced systemic antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has offered new opportunities to treat head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC); however, its clinical applications are hindered by modest therapeutic outcomes and the &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; pharmacological activity of immunomodulatory agents. Strategies for precise spatiotemporal activation of antitumor immunity can tackle these issues but remain challenging. Herein, a semiconducting polymeric nanoagonist (SPNM) with in situ sono&#8208;activatable immunotherapeutic effects for precision sono&#8208;immunotherapy of HNSCC is reported. SPNM is self&#8208;assembled from a sonodynamic semiconducting polymer core conjugated with a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist (MSA&#8208;2) via a singlet oxygen cleavable linker. Under sono&#8208;irradiation, SPNM produces singlet oxygen not only to eradicate tumor cells to trigger immunogenic cell death but also to unleash caged STING agonists via the cleavage of diphenoxyethene bonds for in situ activation of the STING pathway in the tumor region. Such sono&#8208;driven STING activation mediated by SPNM promotes effector T cell infiltration and potentiates systemic antitumor immunity, eventually leading to tumor growth inhibition and long&#8208;term immunological memory. This study thus presents a promising strategy for the precise spatiotemporal activation of cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Emerging Xene&#8208;based Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts: Theory, Synthesis and Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In recent years, the emergence of novel two&#8208;dimensional monoelemental materials (Xenes), e.g., graphdiyne, borophene, phosphorene, antimonene, bismuthene, and stanene, has exhibited unprecedented potentials for their versatile applications as well as addressing new discoveries in fundamental science. Owing to their unique physicochemical, optical and electronic properties, emerging Xenes have been regarded as promising candidates in the community of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) as single&#8208;atom active sites or support matrixes, for significant improvement in intrinsic activity and selectivity. In order to comprehensively understand the relationships between structure and property of Xene&#8208;based SACs, this review represents a comprehensive summary from theoretical predictions to experimental investigations. Firstly, theoretical calculations regarding both the anchoring of Xene&#8208;based single&#8208;atom active sites on versatile support matrixes and doping/substituting heteroatoms at Xene&#8208;based support matrixes are briefly summarized. Secondly, controlled synthesis and precise characterization are presented for Xene&#8208;based SACs. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities for the development of Xene&#8208;based SACs are highlighted.

         <title>Trehalose&#8208;Guanosine Glycopolymer Hydrogels Direct Adaptive Glia Responses in CNS Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycopolymer&#8208;based supramolecular hydrogels are formulated by combining poly(trehalose&#8208;co&#8208;guanosine) (pTreGuo) glycopolymers with free guanosine (fGuo). Hydrogels with tunable microstructures and mechanical properties are produced through facile control of pTreGuo composition and fGuo concentration which alters G&#8208;quadruplex assembly. pTreGuo hydrogels direct adaptive glia repair responses after ischemic stroke to reduce the size of lesions and increase axon regrowth into lesion core environments.








Abstract
Neural tissue damaged after central nervous system (CNS) injury does not naturally regenerate but is instead replaced by non&#8208;neural fibrotic scar tissue that serves no neurological function.

&lt;p&gt;Glycopolymer-based supramolecular hydrogels are formulated by combining poly(trehalose-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-guanosine) (pTreGuo) glycopolymers with free guanosine (fGuo). Hydrogels with tunable microstructures and mechanical properties are produced through facile control of pTreGuo composition and fGuo concentration which alters G-quadruplex assembly. pTreGuo hydrogels direct adaptive glia repair responses after ischemic stroke to reduce the size of lesions and increase axon regrowth into lesion core environments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural tissue damaged after central nervous system (CNS) injury does not naturally regenerate but is instead replaced by non-neural fibrotic scar tissue that serves no neurological function. Scar-free repair to create a more permissive environment for regeneration requires altering the natural injury responses of glial cells. In this work, glycopolymer-based supramolecular hydrogels are synthesized to direct adaptive glia repair after CNS injury. Combining poly(trehalose-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-guanosine) (pTreGuo) glycopolymers with free guanosine (fGuo) generates shear-thinning hydrogels through stabilized formation of long-range G-quadruplex secondary structures. Hydrogels with smooth or granular microstructures and mechanical properties spanning three orders of magnitude are produced through facile control of pTreGuo hydrogel composition. Injection of pTreGuo hydrogels into healthy mouse brains elicits minimal stromal cell infiltration and peripherally derived inflammation that is comparable to a bioinert methyl cellulose benchmarking material. pTreGuo hydrogels alter astrocyte borders and recruit microglia to infiltrate and resorb the hydrogel bulk over 7&#160;d. Injections of pTreGuo hydrogels into ischemic stroke alter the natural responses of glial cells after injury to reduce the size of lesions and increase axon regrowth into lesion core environments.

         <title>Neuron&#8208;Inspired Sticky Artificial Spider Silk for Signal Transmission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Neurons exhibit excellent signal transmission capacity, which inspire artificial neuron materials for applications in the field of wearable electronics and soft robotics. In addition, the neuron fibers exhibit good mechanical robustness by sticking to the organs, which currently has rarely been studied. Here, a sticky artificial spider silk was developed by employing a proton donor&#8208;acceptor (PrDA) hydrogel fiber for application as artificial neuron fibers. Tuning the molecular electrostatic interactions by modulating the sequences of proton donors and acceptors, enables combination of excellent mechanical properties, stickiness, and ion conductivity. In addition, the PrDA hydrogel exhibits high spinning capacity for a wide range of donor&#8208;acceptor combinations. The PrDA artificial spider silk would shed light on the design of new generation of artificial neuron materials, bio&#8208;electrodes, and artificial synapses.

         <title>Bioinspired Luminescent HOF&#8208;based Foam as Ultrafast and Ultrasensitive Pressure and Acoustic Bimodal Sensor for Human&#8208;Machine Interactive Object and Information Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Bionic sensors have extensively served smart robots, medical equipment and flexible wearable devices. The luminescent pressure&#8208;acoustic bimodal sensor can be treated as a remarkable multifunctional integrated bionic device. Here, a blue&#8208;emitting hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;TTA) as luminogen combines with melamine foam (MF), generating the flexible and elastic HOF&#8208;TTA@MF (1 and 2) as pressure&#8211;auditory bimodal sensor. In luminescent pressure sensing process, 1 performs the excellent maximum sensitivity (132.02 kPa&#8722;1), low minimum detection limit (0.0&#8239;1333&#160;Pa), fast response time (20&#160;ms), high precision and great recyclability. 2 as luminescent auditory sensor exhibits the highest response to the 520&#160;Hz sound in 255&#8722;1453&#160;Hz. In the process of sensing sound of 520&#160;Hz, 2 possesses the high sensitivity (1&#8239;648&#8239;441.3 cps&#183;Pa&#8722;1&#183;cm&#8722;2), low detection limit (0.36&#160;dB) and ultrafast response time (10&#160;ms) within 11.47&#8722;91.77&#160;dB. The sensing mechanisms toward pressure and auditory have been analyzed detailly by finite element simulation. Furthermore, 1 and 2 as human&#8208;machine interactive bimodal sensor can recognize nine different objects and word information of &#8220;Health&#8221;, &#8220;Phone&#8221; and &#8220;TongJi&#8221; with high accuracy and strong robustness. This work provides a facile fabricated method of luminescent HOF&#8208;based pressure&#8208;auditory bimodal sensor, and endows the new recognition functions and dimension to bifunctional sensor.

Abstract
Designing mononuclear platinum(II) complexes that do not rely on intermolecular aggregation for high&#8208;performance red organic light&#8208;emitting diodes remains a formidable challenge. In this work, three robust red&#8208;emitting Pt(II) complexes w ere created by utilizing a rigid 4&#8208;coordination configuration, where the ligands w ere formed by linking electron&#8208;donor of triphenylamine (TPA) moieties with electron&#8208;acceptor of pyridine, isoquinoline, and/or &#948;&#8208;carboline units. The thermal stability, electrochemical, and photophysical properties of the complexes w ere thoroughly examined. The complexes display efficient red phosphorescence, with high photoluminescence quantum yields and short excited lifetimes. The OLEDs doped with these complexes exhibit high maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 31.8% with minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off even at high brightness. Significantly, the devices demonstrated exceptional long operational lifetime, with a T90 lifetime of over 14000 hours at initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, indicating the potential for these complexes to be practically utilized.

         <title>Effective Modulation of Inflammation and Oxidative Stress for Enhanced Regeneration of Intervertebral Discs Using 3D Porous Hybrid Protein Nanoscaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Degeneration of fibrocartilaginous tissues is often associated with complex pro&#8208;inflammatory factors. These include reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell&#8208;free nucleic acids (cf&#8208;NAs), and epigenetic changes in immune cells. To effectively control these complex inflammatory signaling, we developed an all&#8208;in&#8208;one nanoscaffold&#8208;based 3D porous hybrid protein (3D&#8208;PHP) self&#8208;therapeutic strategy for treating intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. The 3D&#8208;PHP nanoscaffold was synthesized by introducing a novel nanomaterial&#8208;templated protein assembly (NTPA) strategy. 3D&#8208;PHP nanoscaffolds that avoid covalent modification of proteins demonstrate inflammatory stimuli&#8208;responsive drug release, disc&#8208;mimetic stiffness, and excellent biodegradability. Enzyme&#8208;like 2D nanosheets incorporated into nanoscaffolds further enabled robust scavenging of ROS and cf&#8208;NAs, reducing inflammation and enhancing the survival of disc cells under inflammatory stress in vitro. Implantation of 3D&#8208;PHP nanoscaffolds loaded with bromodomain extraterminal inhibitor (BETi) into a rat nucleotomy disc injury model effectively suppressed inflammation in vivo, thus promoting restoration of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The resulting regeneration of disc tissue facilitated long&#8208;term pain reduction. Therefore, our self&#8208;therapeutic and epigenetic modulator&#8208;encapsulated hybrid protein nanoscaffold shows great promise as a novel approach to restore dysregulated inflammatory signaling and treat degenerative fibrocartilaginous diseases, including disc injuries, providing hope and relief to patients worldwide.

         <title>How to Adequately Describe Full Range Intercalation &#8211; a Two&#8208;Sided Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
One of the key&#8208;challenges in battery research is to quantitatively describe the intercalation storage capacity as a function of the reversible cell voltage. The reason that such endeavors have not yet been very successful, lies in the lack of an adequate charge carrier treatment. Using the most challenging example of nano&#8208;crystalline lithium iron phosphate where the full range from FePO4 to LiFePO4 is accessible without miscibility gap, we show how a quantitative description of literature results can be achieved even for such a huge window. For this purpose we apply point&#8208;defect thermodynamics and tackle the problem from the two end&#8208;member sides including saturation effects. In a first, rather heuristic treatment we interpolate in&#8208;between using the safe thermodynamic criterion of local phase stability. Already this straightforward approach works very satisfactorily. In order to also gain mechanistic insight, interactions among and between ions and electrons have to be taken account of. We show how to implement them into the analysis.

         <title>Electrocatalysts for Zinc&#8208;air Batteries Featuring Single Molybdenum Atoms in a Nitrogen&#8208;doped Carbon Framework</title>

Abstract
Bifunctional catalysts can facilitate two different electrochemical reactions with conflicting characteristics. Here we report a highly reversible bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries featuring a &#8220;core&#8208;shell structure&#8221; in which N&#8208;doped graphene sheets wrap around vanadium molybdenum oxynitride nanoparticles. Single Mo atoms are released from the particle core during synthesis and anchored to electronegative N&#8208;dopant species in the graphitic shell. The resultant Mo single&#8208;atom catalysts excel as active OER sites in pyrrolic&#8208;N and as active ORR sites in pyridinic&#8208;N environments. Zinc&#8208;air batteries with such bifunctional and multicomponent single&#8208;atom catalysts deliver high&#8208;power density (&#8764;376.4&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and long&#8208;cycle life of over 630&#160;h, outperforming noble&#8208;metal based benchmarks. Flexible zinc&#8208;air batteries that can tolerate a wide range of temperatures (&#8722;20 to 80&#176;C) under severe mechanical deformation are also demonstrated.

         <title>Superflexible Artificial Soft Wood</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Soft woods have attracted enormous interest due to their anisotropic cellular microstructure and unique flexibility. The conventional wood&#8208;like materials are usually subject to the conflict between the superflexibility and robustness. Inspired by the synergistic compositions of soft suberin and rigid lignin of cork wood which has good flexibility and mechanical robustness, we report an artificial soft wood by freeze&#8208;casting the soft&#8208;in&#8208;rigid (rubber&#8208;in&#8208;resin) emulsions, where the carboxy nitrile rubber confers softness and rigid melamine resin provides stiffness. The subsequent thermal curing induces micro&#8208;scale phase inversion and leads to a continuous soft phase strengthened by interspersed rigid ingredients. The unique configuration ensures crack resistance, structural robustness and superb flexibility, including wide&#8208;angle bending, twisting, and stretching abilities in various directions, as well as excellent fatigue resistance and high strength, overwhelming the natural soft wood and most wood&#8208;inspired materials. This superflexible artificial soft wood represents a promising substrate for bending&#8208;insensitive stress sensors.

         <title>Artificial Spider Silk with Buckled Sheath by Nano&#8208;Pulley Combing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Axial orientation of molecular chains always results in an increase in fibre strength and a decrease in toughness. Here, taking inspiration from the skin structure, artificial spider silk with a buckled sheath&#8211;core structure is developed, with mechanical strength and toughness reaching 1.61&#160;GPa and 466&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, respectively, exceeding those of Caerostris darwini silk. The buckled structure is achieved by nano&#8208;pulley combing of polyrotaxane hydrogel fibres through cyclic stretch&#8211;release training, which exhibits axial alignment of the polymer chains in fibre core and buckling in fibre sheath. The artificial spider silk also exhibits excellent supercontraction behavior, achieving a work capacity of 1.89&#160;kJ kg&#8722;1, and an actuation stroke of 82%. This work provides a new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance and intelligent fibre materials.

         <title>Lattice Strain Regulation Enables High&#8208;Performance Formamidinium Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) perovskite possesses an ideal optical bandgap and is a potential material for fabricating the most efficient single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Nevertheless, large formamidinium (FA) cations result in residual lattice strain, which reduces the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability of PSCs. Herein, we propose the modulation of lattice strain in FAPbI3 crystals via a &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic amine, i.e., 4&#8208;pyrene oxy butylamine (PYBA). PYBA pairs at the grain boundary serve as a template for the crystallization of FAPbI3 perovskite, thereby inducing a highly oriented crystal and a pure &#945;&#8208;phase film. The PYBA pairs with strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions provide a solid fulcrum for external compression strain, thus compensating for the inherent tension strain of FAPbI3 crystals. The strain release elevates the valence band of the perovskite crystals, thereby decreasing the bandgap and trap density. Consequently, the PYBA&#8208;regulated FAPbI3 PSC achieves an excellent PCE of 24.76%. Moreover, the resulting device exhibits improved operational stability and maintains over 80% of its initial PCE after 1500&#160;h under maximum power point tracking conditions.

         <title>Component Distribution Regulation in Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells through Selective Molecular Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with near ideal bandgap still lag behind the pure lead PSCs. Disordered heterojunctions caused by inhomogeneous Sn/Pb ratio in the binary perovskite film induce large recombination loss. Here, we report a Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite film with homogeneous component and energy distribution through introducing hydrazine sulfate (HS) in Sn perovskite precursor. HS could form hydrogen bond network and coordinate with FASnI3 thus no longer bond with Pb2+, which reduces the crystallization rate of tin perovskite to the level of lead analogue. The strong bonding between SO42&#8722; and Sn2+ could also suppress its oxidation. As a result, the Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs with HS exhibit a significantly improved VOC of 0.91 V along with a high efficiency of 23.17%. Meanwhile, the hydrogen bond interaction network, strong bonding between Sn2+ and sulfate ion also improve the thermal, storage and air stability of resulting devices.

         <title>Biomimetic Multicolor&#8208;Separating Photonic Skin using Electrically Stretchable Chiral Photonic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimodulus chiral photonic elastomers (CPEs) are modulated, and multicolor control with dynamic wavelength change from a single color is realized. Multicolor separation by mechanical stretching or electrical stretching occurs via the exploitation of engineered modulus&#8208;adjusted CPEs. Moreover, stretchable multicolor separation using a mixed array of CPEs is investigated for potential photonic camouflage applications.








Abstract
Structural color can be produced by nanoperiodic dielectric structures using soft materials. Chiral photonic elastomers (CPEs) produced from elastic chiral liquid crystal molecules can self&#8208;organize into a helical nanostructure, and the chiral nanostructural color can be tuned by stretching. However, the ability to control the separation of biomimetic multicolors for practical applications beyond simple uniaxial stretching of single&#8208;colored structures has been limited until now. Here, stretchable CPEs with simultaneous multicolor control, including electrical control, are presented. By engineering the heterogeneous elastic modulus of the CPEs, stretchable and simultaneous multicolor separations from an initially homogeneous color are realized. Electrically stretchable multicolor separation is investigated using a hybrid CPE structure on dielectric elastomer actuators, and multiarrayed color binning and chameleon&#8208;like photonic e&#8208;skin are further developed for device applications. Moreover, multicolor concealed camouflage switching and control of invisible photonic e&#8208;skin are demonstrated. This multicolor control of stretchable photonic systems improves the functionality of various potential photonic applications.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells by Tailoring Crystal Orientation and Passivating Surface Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple solution&#8208;processable passivator is introduced on the top surface of low&#8208;dimensional 2D perovskites. This passivator induces a vertical crystal orientation and simultaneously passivates the defects on the perovskites, leading to efficient charge transport with reduced recombination loss in the photoactive materials. The champion device exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 20.05% with negligible hysteresis and superior operational stability.








Abstract
Solar cells (PSCs) with quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites (RPP) exhibit greater environmental stability than 3D perovskites; however, the low power conversion efficiency (PCE) caused by anisotropic crystal orientations and defect sites in the bulk RPP materials limit future commercialization. Herein, a simple post&#8211;treatment is reported for the top surfaces of RPP thin films (RPP composition of PEA2MA4Pb5I16 &lt;n&gt; = 5) in which zwitterionic n&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;phenylnitrone (PBN) is used as the passivation material. The PBN molecules passivate the surface and grain boundary defects in the RPP and simultaneously induce vertical direction crystal orientations of the RPPs, which lead to efficient charge transport in the RPP photoactive materials. With this surface engineering methodology, the optimized devices exhibit a remarkably enhanced PCE of 20.05% as compared with the devices without PBN (&#8776;17.53%) and excellent long&#8208;term operational stability with 88% retention of the initial PCE under continuous 1&#8208;sun irradiation for over 1000&#160;h. The proposed passivation strategy provides new insights into the development of efficient and stable RPP&#8208;based PSCs.

         <title>Energy Efficient Neuro&#8208;Inspired Phase&#8211;Change Memory Based on Ge4Sb6Te7 as a Novel Epitaxial Nanocomposite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phase&#8208;change nanocomposite Ge4Sb6Te7 is reported to enable energy&#8208;efficient neuro&#8208;inspired phase&#8211;change memory (PCM). Ge4Sb6Te7 &#8208;based nanoscale PCM devices demonstrate multibit capability, low resistance drift, and bi&#8208;directional gradual resistance changes with &#8776;10&#215; resistance window using low energy (&#8776;1&#160;pJ) pulses; all facilitated by the unique microstructural and electro&#8211;thermal properties of Ge4Sb6Te7.








Abstract
Phase&#8211;change memory (PCM) is a promising candidate for neuro&#8208;inspired, data&#8208;intensive artificial intelligence applications, which relies on the physical attributes of PCM materials including gradual change of resistance states and multilevel operation with low resistance drift. However, achieving these attributes simultaneously remains a fundamental challenge for PCM materials such as Ge2Sb2Te5, the most commonly used material. Here bi&#8208;directional gradual resistance changes with &#8776;10&#215; resistance window using low energy pulses are demonstrated in nanoscale PCM devices based on Ge4Sb6Te7, a new phase&#8211;change nanocomposite material . These devices show 13 resistance levels with low resistance drift for the first 8 levels, a resistance on/off ratio of &#8776;1000, and low variability. These attributes are enabled by the unique microstructural and electro&#8211;thermal properties of Ge4Sb6Te7, a nanocomposite consisting of epitaxial SbTe nanoclusters within the Ge&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te matrix, and a higher crystallization but lower melting temperature than Ge2Sb2Te5. These results advance the pathway toward energy&#8208;efficient analog computing using PCM.

         <title>Revolutionizing Porous Liquids: Stabilization and Structural Engineering Achieved by A Surface Deposition Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Facile approaches capable of constructing stable and structurally diverse porous liquids (PLs) that can deliver high&#8208;performance applications are a long&#8208;standing, captivating, and challenging research area that requires significant attention. Herein, a facile surface deposition strategy was demonstrated to afford diverse type III&#8208;PLs possessing ultra&#8208;stable dispersion, external structure modification, and enhanced performance in gas storage and transformation by leveraging the expeditious and uniform precipitation of selected metal salts. The Ag(I) species&#8208;modified zeolite nanosheets were deployed as the porous host to construct type III&#8208;PLs with ionic liquids (ILs) containing bromide anion as the liquid phase, leading to stable dispersion driven by the formation of AgBr nanoparticles. The as&#8208;afforded type&#8208;III PLs displayed promising performance in CO2 capture/conversion and ethylene/ethane separation. Property and performance of the as&#8208;produced PLs could be tuned by the cation structure of the ILs, which can be harnessed to achieve polarity reversal of the porous host via ionic exchange. The surface deposition procedure could be further extended to produce PLs from Ba(II)&#8208;functionalized zeolite and ILs containing [SO4]2&#8722; anion driven by the formation and coating of BaSO4 salts. The as&#8208;produced PLs were featured by well&#8208;maintained crystallinity of the porous host, good fluidity and stability, enhanced gas uptake capacity, and attractive performance in small gas melecule utilization.

         <title>Exogenous Antigen Upregulation Empowers Antibody Targeted Nanochemotherapy of Leukaemia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is afflicted by high mortality rate and few treatment options. The lack of specific surface antigens severely hampers the development of targeted therapeutics and cell therapy. Here, we show that exogenous all&#8208;trans retinoic acid (ATRA) mediates selective and transient CD38 upregulation on leukaemia cells by up to 20 folds, which enables high&#8208;efficiency targeted nanochemotherapy of leukaemia with daratumumab antibody&#8208;directed polymersomal vincristine sulfate (DPV). Strikingly, treatment of two CD38&#8208;low expressing AML orthotopic models with ATRA and DPV portfolio strategy effectively eliminates circulating leukaemia cells and leukaemia invasion into bone marrow and organs, leading to exceptional survival benefits with 20&#8211;40% mice becoming leukaemia&#8208;free. The combination of exogenous CD38 upregulation and antibody&#8208;directed nanotherapeutics provides a unique and powerful targeted therapy for leukaemia.

         <title>Structural Color Mixing in Microcapsules through Exclusive Crystallization of Binary and Ternary Colloids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Colloidal crystals have been designed as photonic microparticles for various applications. However, conventional microparticles generally have only one stopband from a single lattice constant, which restricts the range of colors and optical codes available. Here, we&#160;create photonic microcapsules that contain two or three distinct crystalline grains, resulting in dual or triple stopbands that offer a wider range of colors through structural color mixing. To produce distinct colloidal crystallites from binary or ternary colloidal mixtures, we&#160;manipulate the interparticle interaction using depletion forces in double&#8208;emulsion droplets. Aqueous dispersions of binary or ternary colloidal mixtures in the innermost droplet are gently concentrated in the presence of a depletant and salt by imposing hypertonic conditions. Different&#8208;sized particles crystallize into their own crystals rather than forming random glassy alloys to minimize free energy. The average size of the crystalline grains can be adjusted with osmotic pressure, and the relative ratio of distinct grains can be controlled with the mixing ratio of particles. The resulting microcapsules with small grains and high surface coverage are almost optically isotropic, and exhibit highly&#8208;saturated mixed structural colors and multiple reflectance peaks. The mixed color and reflectance spectrum are controllable with the selection of particle sizes and mixing ratios.

Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have shown great promise for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via water splitting. However, the four&#8208;electron oxidation of water remains elusive toward oxygen evolution. Enabling this water oxidation pathway is critical to improve the yield and maximize atom utilization efficiency. A Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction is proposed for overcoming fundamental issues in COF&#8208;based photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS), such as inefficient light absorption, charge recombination, and poor water oxidation ability. It is shown that the construction of a novel 2D/2D Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions through in&#8208;situ growth of COFs on the O&#8208;vacancy WO3 nanosheets (Ov&#8208;WO3) via W&#8208;O&#8208;C chemical bond&#160;can remarkably promote photocatalytic OWS. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between the enhanced built&#8208;in electric field by interfacial W&#8208;O&#8208;C bond, strong water oxidation ability of Ov&#8208;WO3, and the ultrathin structure of TSCOF, both separation and utilization efficiency of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs can be&#160;significantly enhanced. An impressive photocatalytic hydrogen evolution half&#8208;rection rate of 593&#160;mmol h&#8722;1g&#8722;1 and overall water splitting rate of 146 (hydrogen) and 68 (oxygen)&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 were achieved on the COF&#8208;WO3 (TSCOFW) composite. This 2D/2D Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction with two&#8208;step excitation and precisely cascaded charge transfer pathway makes it responsible for the efficient solar&#8208;driven OWS without a sacrificial agent.

However, the four-electron oxidation of water remains elusive toward oxygen evolution. Enabling this water oxidation pathway is critical to improve the yield and maximize atom utilization efficiency. A Z-scheme heterojunction is proposed for overcoming fundamental issues in COF-based photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS), such as inefficient light absorption, charge recombination, and poor water oxidation ability. It is shown that the construction of a novel 2D/2D Z-scheme heterojunctions through in-situ growth of COFs on the O-vacancy WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets (Ov-WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) via W-O-C chemical bond&#160;can remarkably promote photocatalytic OWS.

         <title>Recent Advances in Laser&#8208;Induced Synthesis of MOF Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline materials with permanent pores constructed by self&#8208;assembly of organic ligands and metal clusters through coordination bonds. Due to their diversity and tunability, MOFs have been used as precursors to be converted into other types of functional materials by pyrolytic recrystallization. Laser&#8208;induced synthesis has been proven to be a powerful pyrolytic processing technique with fast and accurate laser irradiation, low loss, high efficiency, selectivity and programmability, which endow MOF derivatives with new features. Laser&#8208;induced MOF derivatives exhibit high versatility in multidisciplinary research fields. In this review, we first briefly introduce the basic principles of laser smelting and the types of materials for laser preparation of MOF derivatives. Subsequently, we focus on the peculiarity of the engineering of structural defects and their applications in catalysis, environmental protection, and energy fields. Finally, we highlight the challenges and opportunities at the current stage with the aim of elucidating the future direction of the rapidly growing field of laser&#8208;induced synthesis of MOF derivatives.

         <title>Manipulation of Charge Dynamics for Efficient and Bright Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Chiral Ligands</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) emerge as a promising class of optoelectronic devices for next&#8208;generation displays and lighting technology. However, the performance of blue PeLEDs lags far behind that of their green and red counterparts, including the unachieved trade&#8208;off between high efficiency and high luminance, severe efficiency roll&#8208;off, and unsatisfactory power efficiency. Here, a multi&#8208;functional chiral ligand of L&#8208;phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride is strategically introduced into quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional perovskites, which can effectively passivate defects, modulate the phase distribution, improve photoluminescence quantum yield, guarantee high&#8208;quality film morphology, and enhance charge transport. Furthermore, ladder&#8208;like hole transport layers are established, boosting charge injection and balance. The resultant sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs (the photoluminescence peak is 493&#160;nm, and the electroluminescence peak is 497&#160;nm) exhibit an external quantum efficiency of 12.43% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a record power efficiency of 18.42&#160;lm W&#8722;1, rendering that the performance is among the best blue PeLEDs.

         <title>A Rapid Self&#8208;pumping Organohydrogel Dressing with Hydrophilic Fractal Microchannels to Promote Burn Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Burn wounds pose great challenges for conventional dressings because massive exudates oversecreted from swollen tissues and blisters seriously delay wound healing. Herein, we&#160;report a self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressing with hydrophilic fractal microchannels that can rapidly drain excessive exudates with ca. 30 times enhancement in efficiency compared with the pure hydrogel, and effectively promote burn wound healing. We&#160;propose a creaming&#8208;assistant emulsion interfacial polymerization approach to create the hydrophilic fractal hydrogel microchannels in the self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel through a dynamic floating&#8208;colliding&#8208;coalescing process of organogel precursor droplets. In a murine burn wound model, the rapid self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressings can markedly reduce dermal cavity by ca. 42.5%, accelerate blood vessel regeneration by ca. 6.6 times, and hair follicle regeneration by ca. 13.5 times, compared with the commercial dressing (TegadermTM). This study paves an avenue for designing high&#8208;performance functional burn wound dressings.

         <title>Molecular Structure and Conformational Design of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Conjugated Polymers to Enable Predictable Optoelectronic Property</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tuning the optoelectronic properties of donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated polymers (D&#8208;A CPs) is of great importance in designing various organic optoelectronic devices ranging from photovoltaics, photodetectors, light emitting diodes, and photoresistors. However, there remains a critical challenge in precisely control of bandgap through synthetic approach, since the chain conformation also affects molecular orbital energy levels. Here, we explored several types of D&#8208;A CPs with different acceptor units that show a opposite trend in energy band gaps with the increasing length of oligothiophene donor units. By investigating their chain conformation and molecular orbital energy with experimental measurements and theoretical calculations, we found that the molecular orbital energy alignment between donor and acceptor units plays a crucial role in dictating the final optical bandgap of D&#8208;A CPs. For NDI polymers with donor and acceptor building blocks with staggered orbital energy alignment, the higher HOMO with increasing oligothiophene length leads to a narrowing of the optical bandgap despite decreased chain rigidity. On the other hand, for DPP polymers with donor and acceptor building blocks with sandwiched orbital energy alignment, the increased band gap with increasing oligothiophene length originates from the reduction of bandwidth due to more localized charge density distribution and more flexible chains with intrachain twisting. Thus, this work provides a molecular understanding on the role of backbone building blocks on the chain conformation and bandgaps of D&#8208;A CPs for organic optoelectronic devices through the molecular level conformation design and segment orbital energy alignment.

&lt;p&gt;Tuning the optoelectronic properties of donor-acceptor conjugated polymers (D-A CPs) is of great importance in designing various organic optoelectronic devices ranging from photovoltaics, photodetectors, light emitting diodes, and photoresistors. However, there remains a critical challenge in precisely control of bandgap through synthetic approach, since the chain conformation also affects molecular orbital energy levels. Here, we explored several types of D-A CPs with different acceptor units that show a opposite trend in energy band gaps with the increasing length of oligothiophene donor units. By investigating their chain conformation and molecular orbital energy with experimental measurements and theoretical calculations, we found that the molecular orbital energy alignment between donor and acceptor units plays a crucial role in dictating the final optical bandgap of D-A CPs. For NDI polymers with donor and acceptor building blocks with staggered orbital energy alignment, the higher HOMO with increasing oligothiophene length leads to a narrowing of the optical bandgap despite decreased chain rigidity. On the other hand, for DPP polymers with donor and acceptor building blocks with sandwiched orbital energy alignment, the increased band gap with increasing oligothiophene length originates from the reduction of bandwidth due to more localized charge density distribution and more flexible chains with intrachain twisting. Thus, this work provides a molecular understanding on the role of backbone building blocks on the chain conformation and bandgaps of D-A CPs for organic optoelectronic devices through the molecular level conformation design and segment orbital energy alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Stretchable Polymer Conductor Through the Mutual Plasticization Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable conductors play key roles in the dynamic interfacing of electronic devices with soft human tissues. However, it is difficult to simultaneously achieve high electrical conductivity and mechanical stretchability. Here, we prepared highly stretchable and conductive thin film electrodes by combining PEDOT:PSS and a mutually plasticized polymer dopant. Notably, harsh acid treatment for conductivity enhancement was avoided, and good solvent tolerance and high optical transparency were realized, all of which are essential to device fabrication. We further developed a transparent electrochromic display that can bear stretching up to 80% strain, demonstrating its promising application in next&#8208;generation optoelectronics.

         <title>Spatially Confined Silver Nanoparticles in Mercapto Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks to Compartmentalize Li Deposition Towards Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
As the promising next&#8208;generation energy storage solution lithium metal battery (LMB) has gained great attention but still suffers from troubles associated with the highly active metallic lithium. Herein, we&#160;aim to develop anode&#8208;free LMB engaging no Li disk or foil by modifying the Cu current collector with mercapto metal organic frameworks (MOFs) impregnating Ag nanoparticles (NPs). While the polar mercapto groups facilitate and guide Li+ transport, the highly lithiophilic Ag NPs help to enhance the electric conductivity and lower the energy barrier of Li nucleation. Furthermore, the MOF pores allow compartmentalizing bulk Li into a 3D matric Li storage so that not only the local current density is reduced, but also is the plating/stripping reversibility greatly enhanced. As a result, full cells pairing the prelithiated Ag@Zr&#8208;DMBD/Cu anodes with LiFePO4 cathodes demonstrate a high initial specific capacity of 159.8 mAh g&#8722;1, first&#8208;cycle Coulombic efficiency of 96.6%, and long&#8208;term cycling stability over 1000 cycles with 99.3% capacity retention at 1C. This study underlines the multi&#8208;aspect functionalization of MOFs to impart lithiophilicity, polarity, and porosity to achieve reversible Li plating/stripping, and paves the way for realizing high&#8208;performance anode&#8208;free LMBs through exquisite modification of the Cu current collector.

         <title>Imaging Field&#8208;Driven Melting of a Molecular Solid at the Atomic Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solid&#8208;liquid phase transitions are basic physical processes, but atomically&#8208;resolved microscopy has yet to capture their full dynamics. We have developed a new technique for controlling the melting and freezing of self&#8208;assembled molecular structures on a graphene field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) that allows phase transition behavior to be imaged using atomically&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy. This is achieved by applying electric fields to F4TCNQ&#8208;decorated FETs to induce reversible transitions between molecular solid and liquid phases at the FET surface. Nonequilibrium melting dynamics are visualized by rapidly heating the graphene substrate with electrical current and imaging the resulting evolution toward new 2D equilibrium states. An analytical model has been developed that explains observed mixed&#8208;state phases based on spectroscopic measurement of solid and liquid molecular energy levels. The observed non&#8208;equilibrium melting dynamics are consistent with Monte Carlo simulations.

         <title>Protocol in Evaluating Capacity of Zn&#8211;Mn Aqueous Batteries: A Clue of pH</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complex energy storage mechanism of Zn&#8211;Mn aqueous batteries (ZMABs), accompanied by abnormal capacity fluctuation, has been long debated since 1866. A pH clue to understand the different mechanisms and redesign the criteria to normalize the capacity contribution is proposed. A tunable H+/Zn2+/Mn2+ charge storage system is elaborated for a realistic evaluation of ZMABs.








Abstract
In the literature, Zn&#8211;Mn aqueous batteries (ZMABs) confront abnormal capacity behavior, such as capacity fluctuation and diverse &#8220;unprecedented performances.&#8221; Because of the electrolyte additive&#8208;induced complexes, various charge/discharge behaviors associated with different mechanisms are being reported. However, the current performance assessment remains unregulated, and only the electrode or the electrolyte is considered. The lack of a comprehensive and impartial performance evaluation protocol for ZMABs hinders forward research and commercialization. Here, a pH clue (proton&#8208;coupled reaction) to understand different mechanisms is proposed and the capacity contribution is normalized. Then, a series of performance metrics, including rated capacity (Cr) and electrolyte contribution ratio from Mn2+ (CfM), are systematically discussed based on diverse energy storage mechanisms. The relationship between Mn (II) &#8596; Mn (III) &#8596; Mn (IV) conversion chemistry and protons consumption/production is well&#8208;established. Finally, the concrete design concepts of a tunable H+/Zn2+/Mn2+ storage system for customized application scenarios, opening the door for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;safety and reliable energy storage system, are proposed.

         <title>Molecular Tuning of a Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Tricarboxamide Supramolecular Fibrous Hydrogel Enables Control over Viscoelasticity and Creates Tunable ECM&#8208;Mimetic Hydrogels and Bioinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining both the mechanical dynamics and the fibrous nanostructure of the native extracellular matrix in a synthetic material remains a challenge. In this study, the molecular tuning of benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide supramolecular structures to create fibrous hydrogels with control over the stress&#8208;relaxation timescale is studied. This enables their use as cell culture matrices and bioinks for 3D bioprinting.








Abstract
Traditional synthetic covalent hydrogels lack the native tissue dynamics and hierarchical fibrous structure found in the extracellular matrix (ECM). These dynamics and fibrous nanostructures are imperative in obtaining the correct cell/material interactions. Consequently, the challenge to engineer functional dynamics in a fibrous hydrogel and recapitulate native ECM properties remains a bottle&#8208;neck to biomimetic hydrogel environments. Here,&#160;the molecular tuning of a supramolecular benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) hydrogelator via simple modulation of hydrophobic substituents is reported. This tuning results in fibrous hydrogels with accessible viscoelasticity over 5 orders of magnitude, while maintaining a constant equilibrium storage modulus. BTA hydrogelators are created with systematic variations in the number of&#160;hydrophobic carbon atoms, and this is observed to control the viscoelasticity and stress&#8208;relaxation timescales in a logarithmic fashion. Some of these&#160;BTA hydrogels are shear&#8208;thinning, self&#8208;healing, extrudable, and injectable, and can be 3D printed into multiple layers. These hydrogels show high cell viability for chondrocytes and human mesenchymal stem cells, establishing their use in tissue engineering applications. This simple molecular tuning by changing hydrophobicity (with just a few carbon atoms) provides precise control over the viscoelasticity and 3D printability in fibrillar hydrogels and can be ported onto other 1D self&#8208;assembling structures. The molecular control and design of hydrogel network dynamics can push the field of supramolecular chemistry toward&#160;the design of new ECM&#8208;mimicking hydrogelators for numerous cell&#8208;culture and tissue&#8208;engineering applications and give access toward&#160;highly biomimetic bioinks for bioprinting.

         <title>In Situ Grown Silver&#8211;Polymer Framework with Coordination Complexes for Functional Artificial Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of creating a silver&#8211;polymer framework (SPF) is proposed, in which silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are in situ grown (for sensing) with simultaneous formation of metal&#8211;ligand coordination complexes (for actuating). The seamless sensing&#8211;actuation unification at nano&#8208;/molecular levels in a single homogenous material platform simultaneously imparts multimodal sensation and excellent load&#8208;lifting into soft robots, thus fully mimicking sensory motions (proprio&#8208;/exteroception) of biological organisms.








Abstract
Self&#8208;sensing actuators are critical to artificial robots with biomimetic proprio&#8208;/exteroception properties of biological neuromuscular systems. Existing add&#8208;on approaches, which physically blend heterogeneous sensor/actuator components, fall short of yielding satisfactory solutions, considering their suboptimal interfaces, poor adhesion, and electronic/mechanical property mismatches. Here, a single homogeneous material platform is reported by creating a silver&#8211;polymer framework (SPF), thus realizing the seamless sensing&#8211;actuation unification. The SPF&#8208;enabled elastomer is highly stretchable (1200%), conductive (0.076&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1), and strong (0.76&#160;MPa in&#8208;strength), where the stretchable polymer matrix synthesis and in situ silver nanoparticles reduction are accomplished simultaneously. Benefiting from the multimodal sensing capability from its architecture itself (mechanical and thermal cues), self&#8208;sensing actuation (proprio&#8208;deformations and external stimuli perceptions) is achieved for the SPF&#8208;based pneumatic actuator, alongside an excellent load&#8208;lifting attribute (up to 3700 times its own weight), substantiating its advantage of the unified sensing&#8211;actuation feature in a single homogenous material. In view of its human somatosensitive muscular systems imitative functionality, the reported SPF bodes well for use with next&#8208;generation functional tissues, including artificial skins, human&#8211;machine interfaces, self&#8208;sensing robots, and otherwise dynamic materials.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Controlled Helical Quantum Sieve Chiral Spectrometer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular&#8208;spin&#8208;sensitive&#8208;antenna (MSSA) that is capable of separation, recognition, and selective sensing to acheive spatiotemporal identification of chiral enantiomers is reported. By integrating the MSSA with a decision&#8208;making system based on neuromorphic artificial intelligence, rapid, transportable, and wearable spectrometry can be attained to distinguish and classify chiral molecules, such as butanol, limonene, and xylene isomers, with 95&#8211;98% accuracy.








Abstract
This article reports on a molecular&#8208;spin&#8208;sensitive&#8208;antenna (MSSA) that is based on stacked layers of organically functionalized graphene on a fibrous helical cellulose network for carrying out spatiotemporal identification of chiral enantiomers. The MSSA structures combine three complementary features: (i) chiral separation via a helical quantum sieve for chiral trapping, (ii) chiral recognition by a synthetically implanted spin&#8208;sensitive center in a graphitic lattice; and (iii) chiral selectivity by a chirality&#8208;induced&#8208;spin mechanism that polarizes the local electronic band&#8208;structure in graphene through chiral&#8208;activated Rashba spin&#8211;orbit interaction field. Combining the MSSA structures with decision&#8208;making principles based on neuromorphic artificial intelligence shows fast, portable, and wearable spectrometry for the detection and classification of pure and a mixture of chiral molecules, such as butanol (S and R), limonene (S and R), and xylene isomers, with 95&#8211;98% accuracy. These results can have a broad impact where the MSSA approach is central as a precautionary risk assessment against potential hazards impacting human health and the environment due to chiral molecules; furthermore, it acts as a dynamic monitoring tool of all parts of the chiral molecule life cycles.

         <title>Manipulation of Heterogeneous Surface Electric Potential Promotes Osteogenesis by Strengthening RGD Peptide Binding and Cellular Mechanosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By turning the dimension and aspect ratios of BaTiO3 (BTO) nanofillers,&#160;an anisotropic distribution of surface potential is observed on the BTO nanofibers/P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) (BTNF) nanocomposite membrane after polarization. After covering supercritical&#8208;sized calvarial defects in rats, the BTNF composite membrane facilitates improved bone regeneration that leads to almost complete healing after 12 weeks post&#8208;implantation, which is mediated by the heterogeneous electrical&#160;microenvironment. 








Abstract
The heterogeneity of extracellular matrix (ECM) topology, stiffness, and architecture is a key factor modulating cellular behavior and osteogenesis. However, the effects of heterogeneous ECM electric potential at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale on osteogenesis remain to be elucidated. Here, the heterogeneous distribution of surface potential&#160;is established by incorporating ferroelectric BaTiO3 nanofibers (BTNF) into poly(vinylidene fluoridetrifluoroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) matrix based on phase&#8208;field and first&#8208;principles simulation. By optimizing the aspect ratios of BTNF fillers, the anisotropic distribution of surface potential on BTNF/P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) nanocomposite membranes can be achieved by strong spontaneous electric polarization of BTNF fillers.&#160;These&#160;results indicate that heterogeneous surface potential distribution leads to a meshwork pattern of fibronectin (FN) aggregation, which increased FN&#8208;III7&#8208;10 (FN fragment) focal flexibility and anchor points as predicted by molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, integrin clustering, focal adhesion formation, cell spreading, and adhesion&#160;are enhanced sequentially. Increased traction of actin fibers amplifies mechanotransduction by promoting nuclear translocation of YAP/Runx2, which enhances osteogenesis in vitro and bone regeneration in vivo. The work thus provides fundamental insights into the biological effects of surface potential heterogeneity at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale on osteogenesis, and also develops a new strategy to optimize the performance of electroactive biomaterials for tissue regenerative therapies.

         <title>Engineering Female Germline Stem Cells with Exocytotic Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconductor polymer dots (Pdots) are utilized for imaging and siRNA delivery in female germline stem cells (FGSCs). Pdots show excellent biocompatibility and minimally disturb the differentiation of FGSCs. Pdots can escape from lysosomes and undergo active exocytosis. Pdot&#8208;siRNA can down&#8208;regulate the expression levels of target genes in both cultured FGSCs and 3D ovarian organoids.








Abstract
Germline stem cells (GSCs) are the only cell population capable of passing genetic information to offspring, making them attractive targets in reproductive biology and fertility research. However, it is generally more difficult to introduce exogenous biomolecules into GSCs than other cell types, impeding the exploration and manipulation of these cells for biomedical purposes. Herein, semiconductor polymer dots (Pdots)&#8208;based nanocomplex Pdot&#8208;siRNA is developed and achieves effective knockdown of target genes in female germline stem cells (FGSCs). Advantage of high fluorescence brightness of Pdots is taken for comprehensive investigation of their cellular uptake, intracellular trafficking, and exocytosis in FGSCs. Importantly, Pdots show excellent biocompatibility and minimally disturb the differentiation of FGSCs. Intracellular Pdots escape from the lysosomes and undergo active exocytosis, which makes them ideal nanocarriers for bioactive cargos. Moreover, Pdot&#8208;siRNA can penetrate into 3D ovarian organoids derived from FGSCs and down&#8208;regulate the expression levels of target genes. This study investigates the interface between a type of theranostic nanoparticles and FGSCs for the first time and sheds light on the manipulation and medical application of FGSCs.

Multifunctional conjugated additives (Fl&#8208;OEGA and Fl&#8208;C8A) are introduced into the perovskite&#8208;emitting layer of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). &#960;&#8208;Conjugated semiconducting additives effectively passivate defects, release residual tensile stress, and decrease the variation in the contact potential difference in perovskites with negligible sacrifice in charge transport, demonstrating highly efficient green&#8208;emitting PeLEDs with a maximum EQE of 21.3%.








Abstract
Further optimization of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is impeded by crystal deformation caused by residual stress and defect formation with subsequent non&#8208;radiative recombination. Molecular additives for defect passivation are widely studied; however, the majority have insulating properties that hinder charge injection and transport. Herein, highly efficient green&#8208;emitting PeLEDs are reported by introducing semiconducting molecular additives (Fl&#8208;OEGA and Fl&#8208;C8A). Transmission electron microscopy shows that conjugated additives exist primarily at the grain boundaries of perovskite, and Kelvin probe force microscopy confirms that the variation in contact potential difference between grain boundaries and perovskite crystal domains is significantly reduced. The residual tensile stress is reduced by 13% and the activation energy for ion migration increases in the Fl&#8208;OEGA&#8208;treated perovskite film, compared to those of the film without additives. Compared to insulating 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(ethylenedioxy)diethylamine (EDEA), the introduction of semiconducting additives prevents a significant reduction in the charge&#8208;transport capability. Furthermore, the PeLEDs with Fl&#8208;OEGA show a negligible shift in the turn&#8208;on voltage and a significantly smaller decrease in the current density with increasing Fl&#8208;OEGA compared to the devices with EDEA. Finally, the 3D CsPbBr3&#8211;PeLEDs show the highest external quantum efficiency of 21.3% by the incorporation of semiconducting Fl&#8208;OEGA as a new multifunctional additive.

         <title>Unraveling Thermal Transport Correlated with Atomistic Structures in Amorphous Gallium Oxide via Machine Learning Combined with Experiments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based models and experimental observations leads to a deep understanding of atomistic structures, thermal transport properties, and structure&#8211;thermal property correlations for disordered materials. A physics&#8208;inspired structural descriptor, namely the structural similarity factor, is proposed for disordered phases, with which the underlying relationship between structures and thermal conductivities is predicted in a linear form.








Abstract
Thermal transport properties of amorphous materials are crucial for their emerging applications in energy and electronic devices. However, understanding and controlling thermal transport in disordered materials remains an outstanding challenge, owing to the intrinsic limitations of computational techniques and the lack of physically intuitive descriptors for complex atomistic structures. Here, it is shown how combining machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based models and experimental observations can help to accurately describe realistic structures, thermal transport properties, and structure&#8211;property maps for disordered materials, which is illustrated by a practical application on gallium oxide. First, the experimental evidence is reported to demonstrate that machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials, generated in a self&#8208;guided fashion with minimum quantum&#8208;mechanical computations, enable the accurate modeling of amorphous gallium oxide and its thermal transport properties. The atomistic simulations then reveal the microscopic changes in the short&#8208;range and medium&#8208;range order with density and elucidate how these changes can reduce localization modes and enhance coherences&#8217; contribution to heat transport. Finally, a physics&#8208;inspired structural descriptor for disordered phases is proposed, with which the underlying relationship between structures and thermal conductivities is predicted in a linear form. This work may shed light on the future accelerated exploration of thermal transport properties and mechanisms in disordered functional materials.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Recruitment of Biomimetic Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles for Precise Tumor Vascular Disruption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel VDA&#8208;free biomimetic semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPNP) that consists of a photothermal semiconducting polymer agent camouflaged with a platelet membrane is developed. SPNP exhibits a photothermally controlled recruitment behavior that augments targeting and accumulation of SPNP specifically around injured tumor vessels, achieving precise tumor vascular disruption, inhibition of splenomegaly, and reversion of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment through two&#8208;stage light manipulation.








Abstract
Tumor vascular disrupting therapy has offered promising opportunities to treat cancer in clinical practice, whereas the overall therapeutic efficacy is notably limited due to the off&#8208;target effects and repeated dose toxicity of vascular disrupting agents (VDAs). To tackle this problem, a VDA&#8208;free biomimetic semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPNP) is herein reported for precise tumor vascular disruption through two&#8208;stage light manipulation. SPNP consists of a semiconducting polymer nanoparticle as the photothermal agent camouflaged with platelet membranes that specifically target disrupted vasculature. Upon the first photoirradiation, SPNP administered in vivo generates mild hyperthermia to trigger tumor vascular hemorrhage, which activates the coagulation cascade and recruits more SPNP to injured blood vessels. Such enhanced tumor vascular targeting of photothermal agents enables intense hyperthermia to destroy the tumor vasculature during the second photoirradiation, leading to complete tumor eradication and efficient metastasis inhibition. Intriguingly, the mechanism study reveals that this vascular disruption strategy alleviates splenomegaly and reverses the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by reducing myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells. Therefore, this study not only illustrates a light&#8208;driven self&#8208;recruitment strategy to enhance tumor vascular disruption via a single dose of biomimetic therapeutics but also deciphers the immunotherapeutic role of vascular disruption therapy that is conducive to clinical studies.

         <title>Photoallosteric Polymersomes toward On&#8208;Demand Drug Delivery and Multimodal Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoallosteric polymersome undergoes an ultrafast conformational transition from &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#945;&#8208;helix under near&#8208;infrared light illumination, because of the assembly&#8208;catalyzed photo&#8208;oxidation of the polymers in the nanoconfined vesicular membrane with minimized steric hindrance and energy barriers. The photoinduced allosteric behavior specifically enhances cell penetration and drug release properties for excellent cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Allosteric transitions can modulate the self&#8208;assembly and biological function of proteins. It remains, however, tremendously challenging to design synthetic allosteric polymeric assemblies with spatiotemporally switchable hierarchical structures and functionalities. Here, a photoallosteric polymersome is constructed that undergoes a rapid conformational transition from &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#945;&#8208;helix upon exposure to near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. In addition to improving nanoparticle cell penetration and lysosome escape, photoinduced allosteric behavior reconstructs the vesicular membrane structure, which stimulates the release of hydrophilic cytolytic peptide melittin and hydrophobic kinase inhibitor sorafenib. Combining on&#8208;demand delivery of multiple therapeutics with phototherapy results in apoptosis and immunogenic death of tumor cells, remold the immune microenvironment and achieve an excellent synergistic anticancer efficacy in vivo without tumor recurrence and metastasis. Such a light&#8208;modulated allosteric transition in non&#8208;photosensitive polymers provides new insight into the development of smart nanomaterials for biosensing and drug delivery applications.

         <title>Efficient Nanoscale Exciton Transport in Non&#8208;Fullerene Organic Solar Cells Enables Reduced Bimolecular Recombination of Free Charges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pulsed&#8208;photoluminescence quantum yield is used to evaluate the domain size of bulk&#8208;heterojunction&#8208;based organic solar cells. It is found that efficient exciton dynamics are correlated with highly reduced bimolecular recombination.








Abstract
The highest&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaic (OPV)&#8208;based solar cells, made from blends of electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;accepting organic semiconductors, are often characterized by strongly reduced (non&#8208;Langevin) bimolecular recombination. Although the origins of the reduced recombination are debated, mechanisms related to the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state and free&#8208;carrier encounter dynamics controlled by the size of donor and acceptor domains are proposed as underlying factors. Here,&#160;a novel photoluminescence&#8208;based probe is reported to accurately quantify the donor&#8211;acceptor domain size in OPV blends. Specifically, the domain size is measured in high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) systems and a comparative conventional fullerene system. It is found that the NFA&#8208;based blends form larger domains but that the expected reductions in bimolecular recombination attributed to the enhanced domain sizes are too small to account for the observed reduction factors. Further, it is shown that the reduction of bimolecular recombination is correlated to enhanced exciton dynamics within the NFA domains. This indicates that the processes responsible for efficient exciton transport also enable strongly non&#8208;Langevin recombination in high&#8208;efficiency NFA&#8208;based solar cells with low&#8208;energy offsets.

Here,&#160;a novel photoluminescence-based probe is reported to accurately quantify the donor&#8211;acceptor domain size in OPV blends. Specifically, the domain size is measured in high-efficiency non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) systems and a comparative conventional fullerene system. It is found that the NFA-based blends form larger domains but that the expected reductions in bimolecular recombination attributed to the enhanced domain sizes are too small to account for the observed reduction factors. Further, it is shown that the reduction of bimolecular recombination is correlated to enhanced exciton dynamics within the NFA domains. This indicates that the processes responsible for efficient exciton transport also enable strongly non-Langevin recombination in high-efficiency NFA-based solar cells with low-energy offsets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Healing of Fractured Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Empowered by a quantitative predictive framework, room&#8208;temperature area&#8208;selective nickel electrodeposition with a single commonly used electrolyte enables 100% restoration of tensile strength in a variety of fractured metals, including &#8220;unweldable&#8221; alloys and a 3D&#8208;printed complex structure. This framework could potentially enable a universal approach to repair fractured metals of various compositions, geometries, and length scales.








Abstract
Repairing fractured metals to extend their useful lifetimes advances sustainability and mitigates carbon emissions from metal mining and processing. While high&#8208;temperature techniques are being used to repair metals, the increasing ubiquity of digital manufacturing and &#8220;unweldable&#8221; alloys, as well as the integration of metals with polymers and electronics, call for radically different repair approaches. Herein, a framework for effective room&#8208;temperature repair of fractured metals using an area&#8208;selective nickel electrodeposition process refered to as electrochemical healing is presented. Based on a model that links geometric, mechanical, and electrochemical parameters to the recovery of tensile strength, this framework enables 100% recovery of tensile strength in nickel, low&#8208;carbon steel, two &#8220;unweldable&#8221; aluminum alloys, and a 3D&#8208;printed difficult&#8208;to&#8208;weld shellular structure using a single common electrolyte. Through a distinct energy&#8208;dissipation mechanism, this framework also enables up to 136% recovery of toughness in an aluminum alloy. To facilitate practical adoption, this work reveals scaling laws for the energetic, financial, and time costs of healing, and demonstrates the restoration of a functional level of strength in a fractured standard steel wrench. Empowered with this framework, room&#8208;temperature electrochemical healing can open exciting possibilities for the effective, scalable repair of metals in diverse applications.

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Manganese Atoms Stabilized on Ceria for Nitrous Oxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese atoms stabilized on ceria is the first highly active, selective, and stable material for ammonia oxidation to nitrous oxide. Atomic dispersion is achieved by simple impregnation and preserved over 70&#160;h on stream. Low&#8208;valent manganese species, complemented by the oxygen transfer ability of ceria, facilitate the supply of active oxygen species for the reaction, leading to the outstanding catalytic performance.








Abstract
Nitrous oxide, N2O, exhibits unique reactivity in oxidation catalysis, but the high manufacturing costs limit its prospective uses. Direct oxidation of ammonia, NH3, to N2O can ameliorate this issue but its implementation is thwarted by suboptimal catalyst selectivity and stability, and the lack of established structure&#8211;performance relationships. Systematic and controlled material nanostructuring offers an innovative approach for advancement in catalyst design. Herein low&#8208;valent manganese atoms stabilized on ceria, CeO2, are discovered as the first stable catalyst for NH3 oxidation to N2O, exhibiting two&#8208;fold higher productivity than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Detailed mechanistic, computational and kinetic studies reveal CeO2 as the mediator of oxygen supply, while undercoordinated manganese species activate O2 and facilitate N2O evolution via N&#63743;N bond formation between nitroxyl, HNO, intermediates. Synthesis via simple impregnation of a small metal quantity (1&#160;wt%) predominantly generates isolated manganese sites, while full atomic dispersion is achieved upon redispersion of sporadic oxide nanoparticles during reaction, as confirmed by advanced microscopic analysis and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Subsequently, manganese speciation is maintained, and no deactivation is observed over 70&#160;h on stream. CeO2&#8208;supported isolated transition metals emerge as a novel class of materials for N2O production, encouraging future studies to evaluate their potential in selective catalytic oxidations at large.

         <title>Reprogramming Hypoxic Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages by Nanoglycoclusters for Boosted Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) in hypoxic regions represent a promising target but are difficult for therapeutic intervention. A hypoxia&#8208;activated nanoglycocluster that orchestrates the size switch, affinity shift, and assembly efficiency change enables deep tumor penetration and efficient repolarization of hypoxic TAMs, facilitating the overall TAMs reprogramming effects. The tumor&#8208;penetrating nanoglycocluster can &#8220;warm&#8221; tumor immune microenvironment to inhibit tumor progression.








Abstract
The tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) in intratumoral hypoxic regions are key drivers of immune escape. Reprogramming the hypoxic TAMs to antitumor phenotype holds great therapeutic benefits but remains challenging for current drugs. Here, an in situ activated nanoglycocluster is reported to realize effective tumor penetration and potent repolarization of hypoxic TAMs. Triggered by the hypoxia&#8208;upregulated matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP&#8208;2), the nanoglycocluster is self&#8208;assembled from the administered mannose&#8208;containing precursor glycopeptides and presents densely&#8208;arrayed mannoses to multivalently engage with mannose receptors on M2&#8208;like TAMs for efficient phenotype switch. By virtue of the high diffusivity of precursor glycopeptides due to their low molecular mass and weak affinity with TAMs in perivascular regions, the nanoglycoclusters are capable of substantially accumulating in hypoxic areas to strongly interact with local TAMs. This enables the efficient repolarization of overall TAMs with a higher rate than the small&#8208;molecule drug R848 and CD40 antibody, and beneficial therapeutic effects in mouse tumor models especially when combining with PD&#8208;1 antibody. This on&#8208;demand activated immunoagent is endowed with tumor&#8208;penetrating properties and inspires the design of diverse intelligent nanomedicines for hypoxia&#8208;related cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Quad&#8208;Nanopore Array for High&#8208;Resolution Single&#8208;Molecule Analysis and Discrimination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quad&#8208;nanopore arrays are demonstrated to improve the sensitivity of solid&#8208;state nanopore&#8208;based sensing. The four closely arranged nanopores finely made by helium ion microscope alter the electric field distribution in the access region of the solid&#8208;state nanopores, creating regions that have a &#8220;retarding effect&#8221; for a single charged molecule, as proved by experiments and simulations.








Abstract
The ability to detect and distinguish biomolecules at the single&#8208;molecule level is at the forefront of today's biomedicine and analytical chemistry research. Increasing the dwell time of individual biomolecules in the sensing spot can greatly enhance the sensitivity of single&#8208;molecule methods. This is particularly important in solid&#8208;state nanopore sensing, where the detection of small molecules is often limited by the transit dwell time and insufficient temporal resolution. Here, a quad&#8208;nanopore is introduced, a square array of four nanopores (with a space interval of 30&#8211;50&#160;nm) to improve the detection sensitivity through electric field manipulation in the access region. It is shown that dwell times of short DNA strands (200&#160;bp) are prolonged in quad&#8208;nanopores as compared to single nanopores of the same diameter. The dependence of dwell times on the quad&#8208;pore spacing is investigated and it is found that the &#8220;retarding effect&#8221; increases with decreasing space intervals. Furthermore, ultra&#8208;short DNA (50&#160;bp) detection is demonstrated using a 10&#160;nm diameter quad&#8208;nanopore array, which is hardly detected by a single nanopore. Finally, the general utility of quad&#8208;nanopores has been verified by successful discrimination of two kinds of small molecules, metal&#8208;organic cage and bovine serum albumin (BSA).

         <title>TexSe1&#8211;x Photodiode Shortwave Infrared Detection and Imaging</title>

A high&#8208;performance, high&#8208;stability, and low&#8208;cost Te0.7Se0.3 infrared photodiode is fabricated throughcomplementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;compatible&#160;low&#8208;temperature thermal evaporation. The device achieves the fastest response among Te&#8208;based photodiodes, a low&#160;dark current density , the ability of matter identification, and superior electrical and thermal stabilities. This work paves a new way for CMOS&#8208;compatible infrared imagers.








Abstract
Short&#8208;wave infrared detectors&#160;are increasingly important in the fields of autonomous driving, food safety, disease diagnosis, and scientific research. However, mature short&#8208;wave infrared cameras such as InGaAs have the disadvantage of complex heterogeneous integration with complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) readout circuits, leading to high cost and low imaging resolution. Herein, a low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance, and high&#8208;stability TexSe1&#8211;x short&#8208;wave infrared photodiode detector is reported. The TexSe1&#8211;x thin film is fabricated through CMOS&#8208;compatible low&#8208;temperature evaporation and post&#8208;annealing process, showcasing the potential of direct integration on the readout circuit. The device demonstrates a broad&#8208;spectrum response of 300&#8211;1600&#160;nm, a room&#8208;temperature specific detectivity of 1.0 &#215; 1010 Jones, a &#8722;3&#160;dB bandwidth up to 116&#160;kHz, and a linear dynamic range of over 55&#160;dB, achieving the fastest response among Te&#8208;based photodiode devices and a dark current density 7 orders of magnitude smaller than Te&#8208;based photoconductive and field&#8208;effect transistor devices. With a simple Si3N4 packaging, the detector shows high electric stability and thermal stability, meeting the requirements for vehicular applications. Based on the optimized TexSe1&#8211;x photodiode detector, the applications in material identification and masking imaging is demonstrated. This work paves a new way for CMOS&#8208;compatible infrared imaging chips.

         <title>Heterosynaptic MoS2 Memtransistors Emulating Biological Neuromodulation for Energy&#8208;Efficient Neuromorphic Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterosynaptic MoS2 memtransistors are developed to enable tunable synaptic plasticity by applying paired voltage pulses at the drain and gate terminals serving as presynaptic neurons and neuromodulators, respectively, for energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic electronics. Consequently, a SET voltage of 2.0&#160;V and sub&#8208;1 fJ energy consumption are achieved, which are the best recorded values for three&#8208;terminal synaptic devices reported so far.








Abstract
Heterosynaptic neuromodulation is a key enabler for energy&#8208;efficient and high&#8208;level biological neural processing. However, such manifold synaptic modulation cannot be emulated using conventional memristors and synaptic transistors. Thus, reported herein is a three&#8208;terminal heterosynaptic memtransistor using an intentional&#8208;defect&#8208;generated molybdenum disulfide channel. Particularly, the defect&#8208;mediated space&#8208;charge&#8208;limited conduction in the ultrathin channel results in memristive switching characteristics between the source and drain terminals, which are further modulated using a gate terminal according to the gate&#8208;tuned filling of trap states. The device acts as an artificial synapse controlled by sub&#8208;femtojoule impulses from both the source and gate terminals, consuming lower energy than its biological counterpart. In particular, electrostatic gate modulation, corresponding to biological neuromodulation, additionally regulates the dynamic range and tuning rate of the synaptic weight, independent of the programming (source) impulses. Notably, this heterosynaptic modulation not only improves the learning accuracy and efficiency but also reduces energy consumption in the pattern recognition. Thus, the study presents a new route leading toward the realization of highly networked and energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic electronics.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Ammonia from Nitrate on Amorphous Graphene with Near 100% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous graphene that consists of disordered and strained pentagons, heptagons, and hexagons can catalyze the formation of&#160;ammonia at a&#160;high Faraday efficiency of &#8776;100% over a wide potential window, and crop yields are boosted when plants are cultivated with the electroreduced nitrate solution.








Abstract
Ammonia is an indispensable commodity in the agricultural and pharmaceutical industries. Direct nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia electroreduction is a decentralized route yet challenged by competing side reactions. Most catalysts are metal&#8208;based, and metal&#8208;free catalysts with high nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion activity are rarely reported. Herein, it is shown that amorphous graphene synthesized by laser induction and comprising strained and disordered pentagons, hexagons, and heptagons can electrocatalyze the eight&#8208;electron reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3 with a Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;100% and an ammonia production rate of 2859 &#181;g cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.93 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. X&#8208;ray pair&#8208;distribution function analysis and electron microscopy reveal the unique molecular features of amorphous graphene that facilitate NO3&#8722; reduction. In situ Fourier&#160;transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations establish the critical role of these features in stabilizing the&#160;reaction intermediates via structural relaxation. The enhanced catalytic activity enables the implementation of flow electrolysis for the on&#8208;demand synthesis and release of ammonia with &gt;70% selectivity, resulting in significantly increased yields and survival rates when applied to plant cultivation. The results of this study show significant promise for remediating nitrate&#8208;polluted water and completing the NOx cycle.

         <title>Centrifuge&#8208;Free Separation of Solution&#8208;Exfoliated 2D Nanosheets via Cross&#8208;Flow Filtration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polydisperse nature of graphene dispersions following liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation poses major manufacturing challenges since incumbent separation schemes rely on centrifugation, which is highly energy&#8208;intensive and possesses limited scalability. Here, cross&#8208;flow filtration is introduced as a centrifuge&#8208;free processing method that improves the throughput of graphene separation by two orders of magnitude in addition to substantially reducing environmental impact via inline recycling.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed graphene is a promising material for numerous high&#8208;volume applications including structural composites, batteries, sensors, and printed electronics. However, the polydisperse nature of graphene dispersions following liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation poses major manufacturing challenges, as incompletely exfoliated graphite flakes must be removed to achieve optimal properties and downstream performance. Incumbent separation schemes rely on centrifugation, which is highly energy&#8208;intensive and limits scalable manufacturing. Here, cross&#8208;flow filtration (CFF) is introduced as a centrifuge&#8208;free processing method that improves the throughput of graphene separation by two orders of magnitude. By tuning membrane pore sizes between microfiltration and ultrafiltration length scales, CFF can also be used for efficient recovery of solvents and stabilizing polymers. In this manner, life cycle assessment and techno&#8208;economic analysis reveal that CFF reduces greenhouse gas emissions, fossil energy usage, water consumption, and specific production costs of graphene manufacturing by 57%, 56%, 63%, and 72%, respectively. To confirm that CFF produces electronic&#8208;grade graphene, CFF&#8208;processed graphene nanosheets are formulated into printable inks, leading to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art thin&#8208;film conductivities exceeding 104 S m&#8722;1. This CFF methodology can likely be generalized to other van der Waals layered solids, thus enabling sustainable manufacturing of the diverse set of applications currently being pursued for 2D materials.

         <title>Robust Thermal Neutron Detection by LiInP2Se6 Bulk Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality, centimeter&#8208;sized LiInP2Se6 single crystals are successfully grown by the Bridgman method for the first time. The detailed and comprehensive crystal growth behaviors, microstructure features, electrical, and &#945;&#8208;particle/&#947;&#8208;ray/thermal neutron detection properties, defect mechanisms as well as radiation resistance are studied using a range of experimental and computational methods.








Abstract
Direct neutron detection based on semiconductor crystals holds promise to transform current neutron detector technologies and further boosts their widespread applications. It is, however, long impeded by the dearth of suitable materials in the form of sizeable bulk crystals. Here, high&#8208;quality centimeter&#8208;sized LiInP2Se6 single crystals are developed using the Bridgman method and their structure and property characteristics are systematically investigated. The prototype detectors fabricated from the crystals demonstrate an energy resolution of 53.7% in response to &#945;&#8208;particles generated from an 241Am source and robust, well&#8208;defined response spectra to thermal neutrons that exhibit no polarization or degradation effects under prolonged neutron/&#947;&#8208;ray irradiation. The primary mechanisms of Se&#8208;vacancy and InLi antisite defects in the carrier trapping process are also identified. Such insights are critical for further enhancing the energy resolution of LiInP2Se6 bulk crystals toward the intrinsic level (&#8776;8.6% as indicated by the chemical vapor transport&#8208;grown thin crystals). These results pave the way for practically adopting LiInP2Se6 single crystals in new&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state neutron detectors.

         <title>Preventing Vanishing Gradient Problem of Hardware Neuromorphic System by Implementing Imidazole&#8208;Based Memristive ReLU Activation Neuron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly compact and energy&#8208;efficient rectifying linear unit (ReLU) activation neuron is demonstrated using a 2T1R structure with a hybrid memristor using a copolymer/inorganic bilayer to emulate volatile and gradual conductance modulation. It is confirmed that memristor&#8208;based ReLU (mReLU) can effectively reduce the vanishing gradient problem of deep neural networks. Furthermore, an mReLU&#8208;based fully analog neuromorphic system is proposed.








Abstract
With advances in artificial intelligent services, brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic systems with synaptic devices are recently attracting significant interest to circumvent the von Neumann bottleneck. However, the increasing trend of deep neural network parameters causes huge power consumption and large area overhead of a nonlinear neuron electronic circuit, and it incurs a vanishing gradient problem. Here, a memristor&#8208;based compact and energy&#8208;efficient neuron device is presented to implement a rectifying linear unit (ReLU) activation function. To emulate the volatile and gradual switching of the ReLU function, a copolymer memristor with a hybrid structure is proposed using a copolymer/inorganic bilayer. The functional copolymer film developed by introducing imidazole functional groups enables the formation of nanocluster&#8208;type pseudo&#8208;conductive filaments by boosting the nucleation of Cu nanoclusters, causing gradual switching. The ReLU neuron device is successfully demonstrated by integrating the memristor with amorphous InGaZnO thin&#8208;film transistors, and achieves 0.5&#160;pJ of energy consumption based on sub&#8208;10&#160;&#181;A operation current and high&#8208;speed switching of 650&#160;ns. Furthermore, device&#8208;to&#8208;system&#8208;level simulation using neuron devices on the MNIST dataset demonstrates that the vanishing gradient problem is effectively resolved by five&#8208;layer deep neural networks. The proposed neuron device will enable the implementation of high&#8208;density and energy&#8208;efficient hardware neuromorphic systems.

         <title>In Situ STING&#8208;Activating Nanovaccination with TIGIT Blockade for Enhanced Immunotherapy of Anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1&#8208;Resistant Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic nanoplatform with spatiotemporally releasing of T&#8208;cell immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine&#8208;based inhibitory motif domain &#65288;TIGIT&#65289; block peptide in the tumor environment and cascade activating chemoagents inside tumor cells is constructed. Through blocking the TIGIT checkpoint and in situ activating stimulator of interferon genes signaling pathway, the nanoplatform&#160;enables efficient antitumor immune response to inhibit tumor growth of anti&#8208;programmed&#8208;cell&#8208;death&#8208;protein&#8208;1&#8208;resistant tumors.








Abstract
Immunotherapies comprising programmed cell death protein 1/PD ligand 1 (PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1) immune checkpoint inhibitors are effective cancer treatments. However, the low response rate and immunoresistance resulting from alternative immune checkpoint upregulation and inefficient immune stimulation by T cells are problematic. The present report describes a biomimetic nanoplatform that simultaneously blocks the alternative T&#8208;cell immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine&#8208;based inhibitory motif domain (TIGIT) checkpoint and activates the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway in situ for enhanced antitumor immunity. The nanoplatform is engineered by fusing a red blood cell membrane with glutathione&#8208;responsive liposome&#8208;encapsulated cascade&#8208;activating chemoagents (&#946;&#8208;lapachone and tirapazamine), and anchoring them with a detachable TIGIT block peptide (named as RTLT). In the tumor environment, the peptide is spatiotemporally released to reverse T&#8208;cell exhaustion and restore antitumor immunity. The cascade activation of chemotherapeutic agents causes DNA damage and inhibits the repair of double&#8208;stranded DNA, which induces robust in situ STING activation for an efficient immune response. The RTLT inhibits anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1&#8208;resistant tumor growth, and prevents tumor metastasis and recurrence in vivo by inducing antigen&#8208;specific immune memory. This biomimetic nanoplatform thus provides a promising strategy for in situ cancer vaccination.

         <title>Nacre&#8208;Inspired Bacterial Cellulose/Mica Nanopaper with Excellent Mechanical and Electrical Insulating Properties by Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nacre&#8208;inspired nanopaper is fabricated through an aerosol&#8208;assisted biosynthesis (AABS) strategy. Based on the AABS strategy and biomimetic structure design, the nanopaper has excellent mechanical properties, high dielectric strength, and ultralong corona resistance time. The dielectric&#8208;mechanical comprehensive performance of the nanopaper is far beyond that of various commercial mica papers.








Abstract
The exploration of extreme environments has become necessary for understanding and changing nature. However, the development of functional materials suitable for extreme conditions is still insufficient. Herein, a kind of nacre&#8208;inspired bacterial cellulose (BC)/synthetic mica (S&#8208;Mica) nanopaper with excellent mechanical and electrical insulating properties that has excellent tolerance to extreme conditions is reported. Benefited from the nacre&#8208;inspired structure and the 3D network of BC, the nanopaper exhibits excellent mechanical properties, including high tensile strength (375&#160;MPa), outstanding foldability, and bending fatigue resistance. In addition, S&#8208;Mica arranged in layers endows the nanopaper with remarkable dielectric strength (145.7 kV&#160;mm&#8722;1) and ultralong corona resistance life. Moreover, the nanopaper is highly resistant to alternating high and low temperatures, UV light, and atomic oxygen, making it an ideal candidate for extreme environment&#8208;resistant materials.

         <title>Bionic Tactile&#8208;Gustatory Receptor for Object Identification Based on All&#8208;Polymer Electrochemical Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iontronic tactile&#8208;gustatory receptors are designed using all&#8208;polymer electrochemical transistors, such that a single device can accurately recognize various objects perceived by the human tactile and gustatory system. Additionally, by combining device design and microfabrication innovation, an unprecedented device density of 104 167&#160;transistors&#160;cm&#8722;2 (yield of 97%) is realized, 1 to 5 orders higher than reported values.








Abstract
Human sensory receptors enable the real world to be perceived effortlessly. Hence, massive efforts have been devoted to the development of bionic receptors capable of identifying objects. Unfortunately, most of the existing devices are limited to single sensory emulation and are established on solid&#8208;state electronic technologies, which are incompatible with the biological reactions occurring in electrolyte media. Here, an iontronic tactile&#8208;gustatory receptor using an all&#8208;polymer electrochemical transistor (AECT) is presented. The sensor is biocompatible with the operation voltage of 0.1&#160;V, which is 1 to 2 orders lower than those of reported values. By this study, one receptor is able to accurately recognize various objects perceived by the human tactile and gustatory system without complex circuitry. Additionally, to promote its further application, flexible AECT arrays with channel length of 2&#160;&#181;m and density of 104 167&#160;transistors&#160;cm&#8722;2 (yield of 97%) are fabricated, 1 to 5 orders higher than those of related works. Finally, a flexible integrated network for electrocardiogram recording is successfully constructed. This study moves a step forward toward state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art bionic sensors.

         <title>Ultrahigh Performance, Serially Stackable, Breeze Driven Triboelectric Generator via Ambient Air Ionizing Channel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated charge&#8208;polarization&#8208;based flutter&#8208;driven triboelectric nanogenerator (CPF&#8208;TENG) that can generate high electrical output by utilizing ambient air ionizing channel (AAIC) is fabricated. Even with low velocity wind input, CPF&#8208;TENG with AAIC can generate high electrical output so the stacked device can completely harvest unidirectional wind energy. Consequently, the device can turn on several electronics and produce 342.3&#160;&#181;L&#160;h&#8722;1 of hydrogen.








Abstract
Currently, wind energy harvesting is in the limelight. However, with the existing electromagnetic wind generators, it is difficult to harvest multifariously&#8208;wasted breezes. To harvest energy from winds at a wide range of speeds, wind&#8208;driven triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are studied. However, a critical limitation of general wind&#8208;driven TENGs is that their power output is low. Therefore, an innovative strategy is necessary to generate high output power even from breeze. Herein, an approach to test a charge&#8208;polarization&#8208;based flutter&#8208;driven TENG (CPF&#8208;TENG) with ambient air ionizing channel (AAIC) is reported. Owing to AAIC, the device generates peak voltage and current outputs of 2000&#160;V and 4&#160;A, respectively. Moreover, because the proposed CPF&#8208;TENG can generate power from breeze, it can be stacked in series to completely harvest wind energy. The stacked CPF&#8208;TENG is demonstrated to operate 3000 light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and 12 hygrometers, separately, and produce hydrogen at a rate of 342.3&#160;&#181;L&#160;h&#8722;1 with the electrolysis cell.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Reconfigured, Dual&#8208;Layered Artificial Interphase Toward High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spontaneously reconfigured, dual&#8208;layered artificial interphase of LiF/LiBO&#8211;Ag is proposed to stabilize Li anode at high current densities. The LiF/LiBO top layer guarantees fast Li&#8208;ion transition, and the lithiophilic Li&#8211;Ag bottom layer enables uniform Li deposition. Benefiting from the well&#8208;orchestrated interphase design, the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries demonstrate a high practical specific energy (448.7&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1), superior high&#8208;rate performances, and high safety.








Abstract
The uncontrollable dendrite growth and unstable solid electrolyte interphase have long plagued the practical application of Li metal batteries. Herein, a dual&#8208;layered artificial interphase LiF/LiBO&#8211;Ag is demonstrated that is simultaneously reconfigured via an electrochemical process to stabilize the lithium anode. This dual&#8208;layered interphase consists of a heterogeneous LiF/LiBO glassy top layer with ultrafast Li&#8208;ion conductivity and lithiophilic Li&#8211;Ag alloy bottom layer, which synergistically regulates the dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition, even at high current densities. As a result, Li||Li symmetric cells with LiF/LiBO&#8211;Ag interphase achieve an ultralong lifespan (4500&#160;h) at an ultrahigh current density and area capacity (20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 20&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2). LiF/LiBO&#8211;Ag@Li anodes are successfully applied in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, showing excellent cycling performances in symmetric cells (8&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 8&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, 5000&#160;h) and full cells. Furthermore, a practical quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cell coupling with a high&#8208;nickel cathode exhibits stable cycling with a capacity retention of over 91% after 60 cycles at 0.5&#160;C, which is comparable or even better than that in liquid&#8208;state pouch cells. Additionally, a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cell (10.75&#160;Ah, 448.7&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1) is successfully accomplished. This well&#8208;orchestrated interphase design provides new guidance in engineering highly stable interphase toward practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Bifunctional Gas Diffusion Electrode Enables In Situ Separation and Conversion of CO2 to Ethylene from Dilute Stream</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional gas diffusion electrode is reported for integrated CO2 separation and electrochemical conversion to ethylene from low concentration CO2 stream (10&#160;vol%), bypassing the prerequisite of energy&#8208;intensive incumbent CO2 capture and regeneration, compression, and transportation steps.








Abstract
The requirement of concentrated carbon dioxide (CO2) feedstock significantly limits the economic feasibility of electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) which often involves multiple intermediate processes, including CO2 capture, energy&#8208;intensive regeneration, compression, and transportation. Herein, a bifunctional gas diffusion electrode (BGDE) for separation and eCO2R from a low&#8208;concentration CO2 stream is reported. The BGDE is demonstrated for the selective production of ethylene (C2H4) by combining high&#8208;density&#8208;polyethylene&#8208;derived porous carbon (HPC) as a physisorbent with polycrystalline copper as a conversion catalyst. The BGDE shows substantial tolerance to 10 vol% CO2 exhibiting a Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;45% toward C2H4 at a current density of 80 mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming previous reports that utilized such partial pressure (PCO2 = 0.1 atm and above) and unaltered polycrystalline copper. Molecular dynamics simulation and mixed gas permeability assessment reveal that such selective performance is ensured by high CO2 uptake of the microporous HPC as well as continuous desorption owing to the molecular diffusion and concentration gradient created by the binary flow of CO2 and nitrogen (CO2|N2) within the sorbent boundary. Based on detailed techno&#8208;economic analysis, it is concluded that this in situ process can be economically compelling by precluding the C2H4 production cost associated with the energy&#8208;intensive intermediate steps of the conventional decoupled process.

         <title>Amorphous Copper&#8208;Based Nanoparticles with Clusterization&#8208;Triggered Phosphorescence for Ultrasensing 2,4,6&#8208;Trinitrotoluene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel amorphous copper&#8208;based nanoparticles with ideal microstructure and abundant recongition sites, that are able to facilitate the electron transfer, are designed&#160;and prepared for phosphorescence&#8208;off detection of airborne 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrotoluene microparticulates with excellent specificity, instantaneous response time, and ultralow detection limit, which not only deepens the insights of photochemistry but also stretches metal&#8208;based nanostructures to new limits.








Abstract
Amorphous metal&#8208;based nanostructures have attracted great attention recently due to their facilitative electron transfer and abundant reactive sites, whereas it remains enigmatic as to whether amorphous copper&#8208;based nanoparticles (CuNPs) can be achieved. Here, for synthesizing amorphous CuNPs, glutathione is adopted as a ligand to inhibit the nucleation and crystallization process via its electrostatic repulsion. By subtly tailoring the solvent polarity, not only can amorphous glutathione&#8208;functionalized CuNPs (GSH&#8208;CuNPs) with phosphorescent performance be achieved after transferring the non&#8208;conjugation of GSH ligand to through&#8208;space conjugation, namely clusterization&#8208;triggered emission, but also the phosphorescence&#8208;off of GSH&#8208;CuNPs toward 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrotoluene (TNT) can be realized by the photoinduced electron&#8208;transfer process through the hydrogen bond channel, which is established between carboxyl and amino groups of GSH&#8208;CuNPs with the nitryl group of TNT. Benefitting from the intrinsic superiorities of the amorphous CuNPs, desired phosphorescence and detection performances of GSH&#8208;CuNPs toward airborne TNT microparticulates are undoubtedly realized, including high quantum yield (13.22%), excellent specificity in 33 potential interferents, instantaneous response, and ultralow detection limit (1.56 pg). The present GSH&#8208;CuNPs are expected to stretch amorphous metal&#8208;based nanostructures and deepen the insights into amorphous materials for optical detection.

         <title>1D Electronic Flat Bands in Untwisted Moir&#233; Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a strategy to create 1D&#8208;EFBs in untwisted heterostructures and experimentally realize it by van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy. The idea is that, the atomic relaxations of the anisotropic rectangular vdW layers introduce 1D buckling reversal regions, where electronic states are isolated in one direction and are localised in 1D extended states along the orthogonal direction. Therefore, 1D&#8208;EFBs are naturally emergent.








Abstract
After the preparation of 2D electronic flat band (EFB) in van der Waals (vdW) superlattices, recent measurements suggest the existence of 1D electronic flat bands (1D&#8208;EFBs) in twisted vdW bilayers. However, the realization of 1D&#8208;EFBs is experimentally elusive in untwisted 2D layers, which is desired considering their fabrication and scalability. Herein, the discovery of 1D&#8208;EFBs is reported in an untwisted in situ&#8208;grown two atomic&#8208;layer Bi(110) superlattice self&#8208;aligned on an SnSe(001) substrate using scanning probe microscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations. While the Bi&#8211;Bi dimers of Bi zigzag (ZZ) chains are buckled, the epitaxial lattice mismatch between the Bi and SnSe layers induces two 1D buckling reversal regions (BRRs) extending along the ZZ direction in each Bi(110)&#8208;11&#160;&#215;&#160;11 supercell. A series of 1D&#8208;EFBs arises spatially following BRRs that isolate electronic states along the armchair (AC) direction and localize electrons in 1D extended states along ZZ due to quantum interference at a topological node. This work provides a generalized strategy for engineering 1D&#8208;EFBs in utilizing lattice mismatch between untwisted rectangular vdW layers.

         <title>Tailoring the Plasticity of Topologically Close&#8208;Packed Phases via the Crystals&#8217; Fundamental Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to understand and tailor the deformability of brittle topologically close&#8208;packed precipitates in advanced alloys using the Nb&#8211;Co &#181;&#8208;phase as a model material is presented. The plasticity of the Nb&#8211;Co &#181;&#8208;phase is controlled by the Laves phase building block in its unit cell, leading to changes in hardness and stiffness, as well as a shift in the slip mechanism. The results provide opportunities for tailoring the plasticity of these phases by manipulating the interplanar spacing and local shear modulus of the crystal building blocks in their unit cells.








Abstract
Brittle topologically close&#8208;packed precipitates form in many advanced alloys. Due to their complex structures, little is known about their plasticity. Here, a strategy is presented to understand and tailor the deformability of these complex phases by considering the Nb&#8211;Co &#181;&#8208;phase as an archetypal material. The plasticity of the Nb&#8211;Co &#181;&#8208;phase is controlled by the Laves phase building block that forms parts of its unit cell. It is found that between the bulk C15&#8211;NbCo2 Laves and Nb&#8211;Co &#181;&#8208;phases, the interplanar spacing and local stiffness of the Laves phase building block change, leading to a strong reduction in hardness and stiffness, as well as a transition from synchroshear to crystallographic slip. Furthermore, as the composition changes from Nb6Co7 to Nb7Co6, the Co atoms in the triple layer are substituted such that the triple layer of the Laves phase building block becomes a slab of pure Nb, resulting in inhomogeneous changes in elasticity and a transition from crystallographic slip to a glide&#8208;and&#8208;shuffle mechanism. These findings open opportunities to purposefully tailor the plasticity of these topologically close&#8208;packed phases in the bulk by manipulating the interplanar spacing and local shear modulus of the fundamental crystal building blocks at the atomic scale.

         <title>Coacervation&#8208;Mediated Cytocompatible Formation of Supramolecular Hydrogels with Self&#8208;Evolving Macropores for 3D Multicellular Spheroid Culture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors develop a new synthetic strategy to engineer macroporous hydrogels (MPH) via the coacervation process of supramolecular assemblies crosslinked by host&#8211;guest complexation between &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin and anthracene dimer. The excellent structural dynamics and the cytocompatible void&#8208;forming process of MPH can better accommodate the dramatic volumetric expansion associated with the colony growth of encapsulated cells, thereby facilitating their cellular functions.








Abstract
Coacervation driven liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation of biopolymers has aroused considerable attention for diverse applications, especially for the construction of microstructured polymeric materials. Herein, a coacervate&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogel transition strategy is developed to create macroporous hydrogels (MPH), which&#160;are formed via the coacervation process of supramolecular assemblies (SA) built by the host&#8211;guest complexation between &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin and anthracene dimer. The weak and reversible supramolecular crosslinks endow the SA with liquid&#8208;like rheological properties, which facilitate the formation of SA&#8208;derived macroporous coacervates and the subsequent transition to MPH (pore size &#8776; 100&#160;&#181;m). The excellent structural dynamics (derived from SA) and the cytocompatible void&#8208;forming process of MPH can better accommodate the dramatic volumetric expansion associated with colony growth of encapsulated multicellular spheroids compared with the non&#8208;porous static hydrogel with similar initial mechanical properties. The findings of this work not only provide valuable guidance to the design of biomaterials with self&#8208;evolving structures but also present a promising strategy for 3D multicellular spheroid culture and other diverse biomedical applications.

         <title>Thermally Latent Bases in Dynamic Covalent Polymer Networks and their Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermally latent ammonium salt is synthesized and its on&#8208;demand release of a strong base is exploited for the selective activation of bond&#8208;exchange reactions in covalently crosslinked polymers. The thermally triggered (and local) change from a creep resistant behavior to a highly dynamic polymer network is demonstrated and applied for the reshaping/welding of 3D&#8208;printed objects and various composite structures.








Abstract
A novel strategy allowing temporal control of dynamic bond exchange in covalently crosslinked polymer networks via latent transesterification catalysts is introduced. Obtained by a straightforward air&#8208; and water&#8208;tolerant synthesis, the latent catalyst is designed for an irreversible temperature&#8208;mediated release of a strong organic base. Its long&#8208;term inactivity at temperatures below 50 &#176;C provides the unique opportunity to equip dynamic covalent networks with creep resistance and high bond&#8208;exchange rates, once activated. The presented thermally latent base catalyst is conveniently introducible in readily available building blocks and, as proof of concept, applied in a radically polymerized thiol&#8211;ene network. Light&#8208;mediated curing is used for 3D&#8208;printing functional objects, on which the possibility of spatially controlled reshaping and welding based on dynamic transesterification is illustrated. Since the catalyst is thermally activated, limitations regarding sample geometry and optical transparency do not apply, which facilitates a transfer to well&#8208;established industrial technologies. Consequently, fiber&#8208;reinforced and highly filled magneto&#8208;active thiol&#8211;ene polymer composites are fabricated by a thermal curing approach. The on&#8208;demand activation of dynamic transesterification is demonstrated by (magneto&#8208;assisted) reshaping experiments, highlighting a wide range of potential future applications offered by the presented concept.

         <title>Electrolytes with Solvating Inner Sheath Engineering for Practical Na&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new category of electrolyte solvation structure is presented by engineering the solvating inner sheath for sodium&#8208;sulfur batteries. In a localized saturated electrolyte with 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran, the saturated inner sheath features increased Na+&#8208;anion complex and decreased Na+&#8208;solvent distance, providing a durable Na anode interface and a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;solid sulfur conversion.








Abstract
Sodium&#8211;sulfur (Na&#8211;S) batteries with durable Na&#8208;metal stability, shuttle&#8208;free cyclability, and long lifespan are promising to large&#8208;scale energy storages. However, meeting these stringent requirements poses huge challenges with the existing electrolytes. Herein, a localized saturated electrolyte (LSE) is proposed with 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHF) as an inner sheath solvent, which represents a new category of electrolyte for Na&#8211;S system. Unlike the traditional high concentration electrolytes, the LSE is realized with a low salt&#8208;to&#8208;solvent ratio and low diluent&#8208;to&#8208;solvent ratio, which pushes the limit of localized high concentration electrolyte (LHCE). The appropriate molecular structure and solvation ability of MeTHF regulate a saturated inner sheath, which features a reinforced coordination of Na+ to anions, enlarged Na+&#8208;solvent distance, and weakened anion&#8208;diluent interaction. Such electrolyte configuration is found to be the key to build a sustainable interphase and a quasi&#8208;solid&#8211;solid sulfur redox process, making a dendrite&#8208;inhibited and shuttle&#8208;free Na&#8211;S battery possible. With this electrolyte, pouch cells with decent cycling performance under rather demanding conditions are demonstrated.

         <title>Skeletal Network Enabling New&#8208;Generation Thermoplastic Vulcanizates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brand&#8208;new design concept of a skeletal network is pioneered to realize the upcycling of conventional vulcanizates. The resultant materials, integrated with the superior strength/elasticity of conventional vulcanizates and the extrudable reprocessability of thermoplastics, can exploit a feasible alternative toward a new generation of thermoplastic vulcanizates.








Abstract
Upcycling of cross&#8208;linked rubbers is pressing. The introduction of dynamic covalent bonds into the networks is a popular tactic for recycling thermosetting polymers, but it is very challenging to integrate engineering performance and continuous yet stable reprocessability. Based on traditional rubber formulations, herein, a straightforward strategy is presented for constructing a skeletal network (SN) through interfacial crosslinking and percolation of rubbery granules in a rubber matrix. Rapid exchange reactions involving dynamic interfacial sulfides realize repeated &#8220;fragmentation and healing&#8221; in the solid&#8208;state and consequent reconfiguration of the SN topology of the elastomer, thus endowing the resultant SN elastomer with continuous yet stable re&#8208;extrudability. These SN elastomers with hierarchical structures exhibit high gel contents, high resilience, low creep, and reinforcibility competitive to traditional vulcanizates. Specifically, SN elastomers exhibit better overall performance than commercial thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) materials. Overall, a new concept of thermoplastic vulcanizates is proposed, which will promote the sustainable development of rubbers.

         <title>Solvation Structure Modulation of High&#8208;Voltage Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance K&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Graphite Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Within the tetramethylene sulfone (TMS):dimethyl carbonate (DMC) binary electrolyte system, carbonate molecules and anions with better solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase forming capability are more likely to enter the solvation shell of K+, while sulfone molecules get close to the anions. As a result, both the storage of K+ at the graphite anode and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion (FSI&#8722;) at the graphite cathode are enhanced.








Abstract
Due to the advantages of dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) and abundant resources, potassium&#8208;based dual&#8208;carbon batteries (K&#8208;DCBs) have wide application prospects. However, conventional carbonate ester&#8208;based electrolyte systems have obvious drawbacks such as poor oxidation resistance and difficulty in sustaining the anion intercalation process at high voltages, which seriously affect the capacity and cycle performance of K&#8208;DCBs. Therefore, a rational design of more efficient novel electrolyte systems is urgently required to realize high&#8208;performance K&#8208;DCBs. Herein, a solvation structure modulation strategy for the K&#8208;DCB electrolyte systems is reported. Consequently, substantial K+ ion storage improvement at the graphite anode and enhanced bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion (FSI&#8722;) intercalation capacity at the graphite cathode are successfully realized simultaneously. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the assembled K&#8208;DCB exhibited a discharge capacity of 103.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, and after 400 cycles, &#8776;90% capacity retention is observed. Moreover, the energy density of the K&#8208;DCB full cell reached 157.6&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, which is the best performance in reported K&#8208;DCBs till date. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of solvation modulation in improving the performance of K&#8208;DCBs.

         <title>Role of Interfacial Defects on Electro&#8211;Chemo&#8211;Mechanical Failure of Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electro&#8211;chemo&#8211;mechanical failure of solid&#8208;state electrolyte induced by interfacial defects is revealed by multiphysics simulation, through visualization of stress distribution, relative damage, and crack formation. It is found that the geometry of defect and aspect ratio are the dominating factors for the failure process of solid&#8208;state electrolyte. This work shows promising guidelines for suppressing failure of solid&#8208;state electrolyte.








Abstract
High&#8208;stress field generated by electroplating of lithium (Li) in pre&#8208;existing defects is the main reason for mechanical failure of solid&#8208;state electrolyte because it drives crack propagation in electrolyte, followed by Li filament growth inside and even internal short&#8208;circuit if the filament reaches another electrode. To understand the role of interfacial defects on mechanical failure of solid&#8208;state electrolyte, an electro&#8211;chemo&#8211;mechanical model is built to visualize distribution of stress, relative damage, and crack formation during electrochemical plating of Li in defects. Geometry of interfacial defect is found as dominating factor for concentration of local stress field while semi&#8208;sphere defect delivers less accumulation of damage at initial stage and the longest failure time for disintegration of electrolyte. Aspect ratio, as a key geometric parameter of defect, is investigated to reveal its impact on failure of electrolyte. Pyramidic defect with low aspect ratio of 0.2&#8211;0.5 shows branched region of damage near interface, probably causing surface pulverization of solid&#8208;state electrolyte, whereas high aspect ratio over 3.0 will trigger accumulation of damage in bulk electrolyte. The correction between interfacial defect and electro&#8211;chemo&#8211;mechanical failure of solid&#8208;state electrolyte is expected to provide insightful guidelines for interface design in high&#8208;power&#8208;density solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Electro&#8211;chemo&#8211;mechanical failure of solid-state electrolyte induced by interfacial defects is revealed by multiphysics simulation, through visualization of stress distribution, relative damage, and crack formation. It is found that the geometry of defect and aspect ratio are the dominating factors for the failure process of solid-state electrolyte. This work shows promising guidelines for suppressing failure of solid-state electrolyte.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-stress field generated by electroplating of lithium (Li) in pre-existing defects is the main reason for mechanical failure of solid-state electrolyte because it drives crack propagation in electrolyte, followed by Li filament growth inside and even internal short-circuit if the filament reaches another electrode. To understand the role of interfacial defects on mechanical failure of solid-state electrolyte, an electro&#8211;chemo&#8211;mechanical model is built to visualize distribution of stress, relative damage, and crack formation during electrochemical plating of Li in defects. Geometry of interfacial defect is found as dominating factor for concentration of local stress field while semi-sphere defect delivers less accumulation of damage at initial stage and the longest failure time for disintegration of electrolyte. Aspect ratio, as a key geometric parameter of defect, is investigated to reveal its impact on failure of electrolyte. Pyramidic defect with low aspect ratio of 0.2&#8211;0.5 shows branched region of damage near interface, probably causing surface pulverization of solid-state electrolyte, whereas high aspect ratio over 3.0 will trigger accumulation of damage in bulk electrolyte. The correction between interfacial defect and electro&#8211;chemo&#8211;mechanical failure of solid-state electrolyte is expected to provide insightful guidelines for interface design in high-power-density solid-state Li metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Confined Ionic&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Mediated Cation Diffusion through Layered Membranes for High&#8208;Performance Osmotic Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion transport in random stacked laminar graphene oxide (GO) membrane suffers from limited mass transport brought by insufficient wetting. The pre&#8208;addition of ionic liquids (ILs) in the layer spacing provides a continuous medium for fast ion transport, greatly solving this problem. Meanwhile, nanoconfinement between the charged GO nanosheets promotes the dissociation of ILs and rearrangement, bringing in additional space charges for the osmotic energy conversion.








Abstract
Ion&#8208;selective membranes act as the core components in osmotic energy harvesting, but remain with deficiencies such as low ion selectivity and a tendency to swell. 2D nanofluidic membranes as competitive candidates are still subjected to limited mass transport brought by insufficient wetting and poor stability in water. Here, an ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;infused graphene oxide (GO@IL) membrane with ultrafast ion transport ability is reported, and how the confined ionic liquid mediates selective cation diffusion is revealed. The infusion of ionic liquids endows the 2D membrane with excellent mechanical strength, anti&#8208;swelling properties, and good stability in aqueous electrolytes. Importantly, immiscible ionic liquids also provide a medium, allowing partial dehydration for ultrafast ion transport. Through molecular dynamics simulation and finite element modeling, that GO nanosheets induce ionic liquids to rearrange, bringing in additional space charges, which can be coupled with GO synergistically, is proved. By mixing 0.5/0.01&#160;m NaCl solution, the power density can achieve a record value of &#8776;6.7&#160;W m&#8722;2, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;art GO&#8208;based membranes. This work opens up a new route for boosting nanofluidic energy conversion because of the diversity of the ILs and 2D materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Contrast Bidirectional Optoelectronic Synapses based on 2D Molecular Crystal Heterojunctions for Motion Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bidirectional (excitatory and inhibitory) optoelectronic synapses are successfully prepared by using 2D molecular crystal heterojunctions. Superior contrast ratios (CR) of 1.53 &#215; 103 are demonstrated, transcending previous optoelectronic synapses, and the devices are applied for motion detection with an accuracy exceeding 90%.








Abstract
Light&#8208;stimulated optoelectronic synaptic devices are fundamental compositions of the neuromorphic vision system. However, there are still huge challenges to achieving both bidirectional synaptic behaviors under light stimuli and high performance. Herein, a bilayer 2D molecular crystal (2DMC) p&#8208;n heterojunction is developed to achieve high&#8208;performance bidirectional synaptic behaviors. The 2DMC heterojunction&#8208;based field effect transistor (FET) devices exhibit typical ambipolar properties and remarkable responsivity (R) of 3.58&#215;104 A W&#8722;1 under weak light as low as 0.008&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic behaviors are successfully realized by the same light stimuli under different gate voltages. Moreover, a superior contrast ratio (CR) of 1.53&#215;103 is demonstrated by the ultrathin and high&#8208;quality 2DMC heterojunction, which transcends previous optoelectronic synapses and enables application for the motion detection of the pendulum. Furthermore, a motion detection network based on the device is developed to detect and recognize classic motion vehicles in road traffic with an accuracy exceeding 90%. This work provides an effective strategy for developing high&#8208;contrast bidirectional optoelectronic synapses and shows great potential in the intelligent bionic device and future artificial vision.

         <title>Multistep Dissolution of Lamellar Crystals Generates Superthin Amorphous Ni(OH)2 Catalyst for UOR</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superthin amorphous nickel hydroxide (ANH) is synthesized as an efficient catalyst for urea oxidation reaction (UOR). This is achieved via a multistep dissolution of NiMO4&#183;H2O as confirmed by in situ Raman and cryogenic electron tomography (CryoET). The work provides an effective strategy for the preparation of highly active superthin amorphous catalysts.








Abstract
Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an ideal replacement of the conventional anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for efficient hydrogen production due to the favorable thermodynamics. However, the UOR activity is severely limited by the high oxidation potential of Ni&#8208;based catalysts to form Ni3+, which is considered as the active site for UOR. Herein, by using in situ cryoTEM, cryo&#8208;electron tomography, and in situ Raman, combined with theoretical calculations, a multistep dissolution process of nickel molybdate hydrate is reported, whereby NiMoO4&#183;xH2O nanosheets exfoliate from the bulk NiMoO4&#183;H2O nanorods due to the dissolution of Mo species and crystalline water, and further dissolution results in superthin and amorphous nickel (II) hydroxide (ANH) flocculus catalyst. Owing to the superthin and amorphous structure, the ANH catalyst can be oxidized to NiOOH at a much lower potential than conventional Ni(OH)2 and finally exhibits more than an order of magnitude higher current density (640&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), 30 times higher mass activity, 27 times higher TOF than those of Ni(OH)2 catalyst. The multistep dissolution mechanism provides an effective methodology for the preparation of highly active amorphous catalysts.

         <title>Bioinspired Self&#8208;Standing, Self&#8208;Floating 3D Solar Evaporators Breaking the Trade&#8208;Off between Salt Cycle and Heat Localization for Continuous Seawater Desalination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by water hyacinth, a self&#8208;standing and self&#8208;floating 3D solar evaporator with adiabatic foam particles and aligned water channels is built through a continuous directional freeze&#8208;casting technique. The solar evaporator can cut off the heat transfer from the top photothermal area to the bulk water without affecting the water supply, breaking the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between the salt cycle and heat localization.








Abstract
Facing the global water shortage challenge, solar&#8208;driven desalination is considered a sustainable technology to obtain freshwater from seawater. However, the trade&#8208;off between the salt cycle and heat localization of existing solar evaporators (SE) hinders its further practical applications. Here, inspired by water hyacinth, a self&#8208;standing and self&#8208;floating 3D SE with adiabatic foam particles and aligned water channels is built through a continuous directional freeze&#8208;casting technique. With the help of the heat insulation effect of foam particles and the efficient water transport of aligned water channels, this new SE can cut off the heat transfer from the top photothermal area to the bulk water without affecting the water supply, breaking the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between salt cycle and heat localization of traditional SEs. Additionally, its self&#8208;standing and self&#8208;floating features can reduce human maintenance. Its large exposure height can increase evaporation area and collect environmental energy, breaking the long&#8208;standing limitation of solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency of conventional SEs. With the novel structure employed, an evaporation flux of 2.25&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, and apparent solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency of 136.7% are achieved under 1&#160;sun illumination. This work demonstrates a new evaporator structure, and also provides a key insight into the structural design of next&#8208;generation salt&#8208;tolerant and high&#8208;efficiency SEs.

This work demonstrates a new evaporator structure, and also provides a key insight into the structural design of next-generation salt-tolerant and high-efficiency SEs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intrinsic Role of Volatile Solid Additive in High&#8208;Efficiency PM6:Y6 Series Nonfullerene Solar Cells</title>

The molecule&#8208;aggregate&#8208;domain transition dynamic process assisted by the volatile solid additive 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;methoxybenzophenone (2&#8208;HM) is demonstrated, the role of 2&#8208;HM in individual donor and acceptor systems is unlocked, and its function in altering the bulk heterojunction to achieve forefront &#8776;19% efficiency for binary organic nonfullerene solar cells is further revealed.








Abstract
Organic nonfullerene solar cells (ONSCs) have made unprecedented progress; however, morphology optimization of ONSCs is proven to be particularly challenging relative to classical fullerene&#8208;based devices. Here, a novel volatile solid additive (VSA), 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;methoxybenzophenone (2&#8208;HM), is reported for achieving high&#8208;efficiency ONSCs. 2&#8208;HM functions as a universal morphology&#8208;directing agent for several well&#8208;known PM6:Y6 series nonfullerene blends, viz. PM6:Y6, PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9, PM6:L8&#8208;BO, leading to a best efficiency of 18.85% at the forefront of reported binary ONSCs. VSAs have recently emerged, while the intrinsic kinetics is still unclear. Herein, a set of in situ and ex situ characterizations is employed to first illustrate the molecule&#8208;aggregate&#8208;domain transition dynamic process assisted by the VSA. More specifically, the role of 2&#8208;HM in individual donor PM6 and acceptor Y6 systems is unlocked, and the function of 2&#8208;HM in altering the PM6:Y6 bulk heterojunction blends is further revealed for enhanced photovoltaic performance. It is believed that the achievement brings not only a deep insight into emerging volatile solid additive, but also a new hope to further improve the molecular ordering, film microstructure, and relevant performance of ONSCs.

         <title>Arming Ru with Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Enriched RuO2 Sub&#8208;Nanometer Skin Activates Superior Bifunctionality for pH&#8208;Universal Overall Water Splitting</title>

The Ru@V&#8208;RuO2/C HMS core&#8211;shell heterostructure is explored by thermally controlled oxidation of the Ru/C hybrid microsheet to arm the oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched RuO2 sub&#8208;nanometer skin on Ru core, &#8211; displaying ultrasmall overpotentials of 176/201&#160;mV for the oxygen evolution reaction and 46/6&#160;mV toward the hydrogen evolution reaction&#160;at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4/1.0&#160;m KOH, respectively.








Abstract
Water electrolysis has been expected to assimilate the renewable yet intermediate energy&#8208;derived electricity for green H2 production. However, current benchmark anodic catalysts of Ir/Ru&#8208;based compounds suffer severely from poor dissolution resistance. Herein, an effective modification strategy is proposed by arming a sub&#8208;nanometer RuO2 skin with abundant oxygen vacancies to the interconnected Ru clusters/carbon hybrid microsheet (denoted as Ru@V&#8208;RuO2/C HMS), which can not only inherit the high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of the Ru, but more importantly, activate the superior activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in both acid and alkaline conditions. Outstandingly, it can achieve an ultralow overpotential of 176/201&#160;mV for OER and 46/6&#160;mV for the HER to reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in acidic and alkaline solution, respectively. Inspiringly, the overall water splitting can be driven with an ultrasmall cell voltage of 1.467/1.437&#160;V for 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4/1.0&#160;m KOH, respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that armoring the oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched RuO2 exoskeleton can cooperatively alter the interfacial electronic structure and make the adsorption behavior of hydrogen and oxygen intermediates much close to the ideal level, thus simultaneously speeding up the hydrogen evolution kinetics and decreasing the energy barrier of oxygen release.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Transfer Engineering via Janus Hydrogels Enables Ultrahigh Performance and Salt&#8208;Resistant Solar Desalination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Janus ion&#8208;selective hydrogel evaporator enabling cation&#8211;anion reverse diffusion away from the evaporation surfaces is reported. It stably removes salt throughout seven days via diffusion and electromigration, different from the current water&#8208;governed salt&#8208;resistant strategies, significantly lowering the heat loss and reaching a record&#8208;high evaporation rate of 6.86&#160;kg m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 in 15&#160;wt% brine.








Abstract
Emerging solar interfacial evaporation offers the most promising response to the severe freshwater crisis. However, the most challenging bottleneck is the conflict between resisting salt accumulation and maintaining high evaporation performance since conventional salt&#8208;resistant evaporators enhance water flow to remove salt, leading to tremendous heat loss. Herein, an ion&#8208;transfer engineering is proposed via a Janus ion&#8208;selective hydrogel that enables ion&#8208;electromigration salt removal, breaking the historical dependence on water convection, and significantly lowering the heat loss. The hydrogels drive cations downward and anions upward, away from the evaporation surfaces. An electrical potential is thus established inside the evaporator and salt in 15&#160;wt% brine is removed stably for seven days. A record&#8208;high evaporation rate of 6.86 kg m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 in 15&#160;wt% brine, 2.5&#160;times the previously reported works, is achieved. With the from&#8208;scratch salt&#8208;resistant route, comprehensive water&#8208;thermal analysis, and record&#8208;high performance, this work holds great potential for the future salt&#8208;resistant evaporators.

         <title>Poly(dimethylsiloxane)&#8208;block&#8208;PM6 Polymer Donors for High&#8208;Performance and Mechanically Robust Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with high&#8208;performance and &#8208;stretchability are developed by designing block copolymer donors comprising PM6 and elastomeric PDMS blocks (PM6&#8208;b&#8208;PDMS). High power conversion efficiency (PCE &#8776; 18%) and stretchability (crack onset point &gt; 18%) are demonstrated for the PM6&#8208;b&#8208;PDMS19k&#8208;based PSC. The PM6&#8208;b&#8208;PDMS19k&#8208;based intrinsically stretchable PSCs show superior mechanical stability (PCE retention &gt; 80% at 32% strain) than the PM6&#8208;based and PM6:PDMS&#8208;blend&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
High power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stretchability are the dual requirements for the wearable application of polymer solar cells (PSCs). However, most efficient photoactive films are mechanically brittle. In this work, highly efficient (PCE = 18%) and mechanically robust (crack&#8208;onset strain (COS) = 18%) PSCs are acheived by designing block copolymer (BCP) donors, PM6&#8208;b&#8208;PDMSx (x = 5k, 12k, and 19k). In these BCP donors, stretchable poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) blocks are covalently linked with the PM6 blocks to effectively increase the stretchability. The stretchability of the BCP donors increases with a longer PDMS block, and PM6&#8208;b&#8208;PDMS19k:L8&#8208;BO PSC exhibits a high PCE (18%) and 9&#8208;times higher COS value (18%) compared to that (COS = 2%) of the PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based PSC. However, the PM6:L8&#8208;BO:PDMS12k ternary blend shows inferior PCE (5%) and COS (1%) due to the macrophase separation between PDMS and active components. In the intrinsically stretchable PSC, the PM6&#8208;b&#8208;PDMS19k:L8&#8208;BO blend exhibits significantly greater mechanical stability PCE80% ((80% of the initial PCE) at 36% strain) than those of the PM6:L8&#8208;BO blend (PCE80% at 12% strain) and the PM6:L8&#8208;BO:PDMS ternary blend (PCE80% at 4% strain). This study suggests an effective design strategy of BCP PD to achieve stretchable and efficient PSCs.

The PM6-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PDMS&lt;sub&gt;19k&lt;/sub&gt;-based intrinsically stretchable PSCs show superior mechanical stability (PCE retention &amp;gt; 80% at 32% strain) than the PM6-based and PM6:PDMS-blend-based devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stretchability are the dual requirements for the wearable application of polymer solar cells (PSCs). However, most efficient photoactive films are mechanically brittle. In this work, highly efficient (PCE = 18%) and mechanically robust (crack-onset strain (COS) = 18%) PSCs are acheived by designing block copolymer (BCP) donors, PM6-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PDMS&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 5k, 12k, and 19k). In these BCP donors, stretchable poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) blocks are covalently linked with the PM6 blocks to effectively increase the stretchability. The stretchability of the BCP donors increases with a longer PDMS block, and PM6-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PDMS&lt;sub&gt;19k&lt;/sub&gt;:L8-BO PSC exhibits a high PCE (18%) and 9-times higher COS value (18%) compared to that (COS = 2%) of the PM6:L8-BO-based PSC. However, the PM6:L8-BO:PDMS&lt;sub&gt;12k&lt;/sub&gt; ternary blend shows inferior PCE (5%) and COS (1%) due to the macrophase separation between PDMS and active components. In the intrinsically stretchable PSC, the PM6-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PDMS&lt;sub&gt;19k&lt;/sub&gt;:L8-BO blend exhibits significantly greater mechanical stability PCE&lt;sub&gt;80%&lt;/sub&gt; ((80% of the initial PCE) at 36% strain) than those of the PM6:L8-BO blend (PCE&lt;sub&gt;80%&lt;/sub&gt; at 12% strain) and the PM6:L8-BO:PDMS ternary blend (PCE&lt;sub&gt;80%&lt;/sub&gt; at 4% strain). This study suggests an effective design strategy of BCP &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; to achieve stretchable and efficient PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Defect&#8208;Induced, Ferroelectric&#8208;Like Switching and Adjustable Dielectric Tunability in Antiferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In films of the canonical antiferroelectric PbZrO3, decreasing oxygen pressure during film deposition causes &#8220;ferroelectric&#8208;like&#8221; polarization switching (although the films retain the antiferroelectric orthorhombic phase). This is correlated with low&#8208;pressure bombardment&#8208;induced point&#8208;defect complexes that pin the antiferroelectric&#8211;ferroelectric phase&#8208;transition boundaries. In turn, by controlling the concentration of defect complexes, the dielectric tunability of PbZrO3 can be adjusted.








Abstract
Antiferroelectrics, which undergo a field&#8208;induced phase transition to ferroelectric order that manifests as double&#8208;hysteresis polarization switching, exhibit great potential for dielectric, electromechanical, and electrothermal applications. Compared to their ferroelectric cousins, however, considerably fewer efforts have been made to understand and control antiferroelectrics. Here, it is demonstrated that the polarization switching behavior of an antiferroelectric can be strongly influenced and effectively regulated by point defects. In films of the canonical antiferroelectric PbZrO3, decreasing oxygen pressure during deposition (and thus increasing adatom kinetic energy) causes unexpected &#8220;ferroelectric&#8208;like&#8221; polarization switching although the films remain in the expected antiferroelectric orthorhombic phase. This &#8220;ferroelectric&#8208;like&#8221; switching is correlated with the creation of bombardment&#8208;induced point&#8208;defect complexes which pin the antiferroelectric&#8211;ferroelectric phase boundaries, and thus effectively delay the phase transition under changing field. The effective pinning energy is extracted via temperature&#8208;dependent switching&#8208;kinetics studies. In turn, by controlling the concentration of defect complexes, the dielectric tunability of the PbZrO3 can be adjusted, including being able to convert between &#8220;positive&#8221; and &#8220;negative&#8221; tunability near zero field. This work reveals the important role and strong capability of defects to engineer antiferroelectrics for new performance and functionalities.

         <title>Coordination Chemistry of Large&#8208;Sized Yttrium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
d&#8208;electron&#8208;deficient elements like Y, typically Fenton&#8208;inactive, are activated into a Pt&#8208;like oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst through dynamic coordinative regulation. The experimental results validate that the as&#8208;designed YN4&#8208;Cl catalyst has good ORR activity and durability, rivalling the commercial Pt/C counterparts. This work provides a reliable and universal strategy for the design of d&#8208;electron&#8208;deficient single&#8208;atom catalysts with Pt&#8208;like ORR activity and Fenton&#8208;inactive character.








Abstract
Although being transition metals, the Fenton&#8208;inactive group 3&#8211;4 elements (Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, and Hf) can easily lose all the outermost s and d electrons, leaving behind ionic sites with nearly empty outermost orbitals that are stable but inactive for oxygen involved catalysis. Here, it is demonstrated that the dynamic coordination network can turn these commonly inactive ionic sites into platinum&#8208;like catalytic centers for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Using density functional theory calculations, a macrocyclic ligand coordinated yttrium single&#8208;atom (YN4) moiety is identified, which is originally ORR inactive because of the too strong binding of hydroxyl intermediate, while it can be activated by an axial ligand X through the covalency competition between Y&#63743;X and Y&#63743;OH bonds. Strikingly, it is also found that the binding force of the axially coordinated ligand is an effective descriptor, and the chlorine ligand is screened out with an optimal binding force that behaves self&#8208;adaptively to facilitate each ORR intermediate steps by dynamically changing its Y&#63743;Cl covalency. These experiments validate that the as&#8208;designed YN4&#8208;Cl moieties embedded within the carbon framework exhibit a high half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2 = 0.85&#160;V) in alkaline media, the same as that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst .

Solar Desalination
In article number 2300189, Lin Li and co&#8208;workers present a Janus ion&#8208;selective hydrogel interfacial evaporator, which enables ion&#8208;electromigration salt removal. The from&#8208;scratch salt&#8208;removal route breaks the limitations of the conventional water&#8208;convection enhanced routes, and significantly lowers heat loss, achieving a record&#8208;high evaporation rate and holding great promise for future solar interfacial evaporation applying desalination.

Memristive Neuron Devices
It is essential to introduce an appropriate activation function for the training of the deep neural networks. In article number 2300023, Byung Chul Jang, Sung&#8208;Yool Choi, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate memristive rectifying linear unit (ReLU) activation neurons for hardware neuromorphic systems by introducing imidazole&#8208;based memristors. The proposed memristive ReLU neurons will enable highly integrated hardware neural networks by connecting adjacent layers, with prevented performance degradation due to the vanishing gradient problem.

&lt;p&gt;It is essential to introduce an appropriate activation function for the training of the deep neural networks. In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202300023"&gt;2300023&lt;/a&gt;, Byung Chul Jang, Sung-Yool Choi, and co-workers demonstrate memristive rectifying linear unit (ReLU) activation neurons for hardware neuromorphic systems by introducing imidazole-based memristors. The proposed memristive ReLU neurons will enable highly integrated hardware neural networks by connecting adjacent layers, with prevented performance degradation due to the vanishing gradient problem.

Identification of Chiral Enantiomers
In article number 2209125, Hossam Haick and co&#8208;workers report a molecular&#8208;spin&#8208;sensitive&#8208;antenna (MSSA) made up of organically functionalized graphene layers on a fibrous helical cellulose network. The MSSA structure combines relativistic spin&#8211;orbit interaction coupled with organic spin&#8208;coherence and offers spatiotemporal chiral molecule separation, recognition, and selective identification of enantiomers. Coupled with neuromorphic artificial intelligence, it enables rapid classification of chiral molecules, resulting in portable spin&#8208;controlled spectrometry.

Cancer Immunotherapy
In article number 2210986, Mingming Ding and co&#8208;workers construct a photoallosteric polymersome (PAP) that undergoes a rapid conformational transition from &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#945;&#8208;helix upon exposure to near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. Photoinduced allosteric behavior specifically enhances cell penetration and lysosome escape and reconstructs the vesicular membrane structure for on&#8208;demand release of hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, thus remolding the immune microenvironment and achieving excellent synergistic anticancer efficacy in vivo without tumor recurrence and metastasis.

         <title>Plant&#8208;Derived Vesicle&#8208;Like Nanoparticles as Promising Biotherapeutic Tools: Present and Future</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plant&#8208;derived vesicle&#8208;like nanoparticles (PDVLNs) is a general term for vesicle&#8208;like nanostructure particles isolated from plants, which can be developed as therapeutic agents and drug carriers for their low immunogenicity and wide availability. PDVLNs have promising potential in human health and disease treatments. It is necessary to further develop standard operating procedures to promote the clinical application of PDVLNs.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are heterogeneous, phospholipid bilayer&#8208;enclosed biological particles that regulate cell communication by molecular cargo delivery and surface signaling. EVs are secreted by almost all living cells, including plant cells. Plant&#8208;derived vesicle&#8208;like nanoparticles (PDVLNs) is a generic term referring to vesicle&#8208;like nanostructure particles isolated from plants. Their low immunogenicity and wide availability make PDVLNs safer and more economical to be developed as therapeutic agents and drug carriers. Accumulating evidence indicates the key roles of PDVLNs in regulating interkingdom crosstalk between humans and plants. PDVLNs are capable of entering the human&#8208;body systemand delivering effector molecules to cells that modulate cell&#8208;signaling pathways. PDVLNs released by or obtained from plants thus have great influenceon human health and diseases. In this review, the biogenesis, detailed preparation methods, various physical and biochemical characteristics, biosafety, and preservation of PDVLNs are introduced, along with how these characteristics pertain to their biosafety and preservability.

     alt="Plant-Derived Vesicle-Like Nanoparticles as Promising Biotherapeutic Tools: Present and Future"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plant-derived vesicle-like nanoparticles (PDVLNs) is a general term for vesicle-like nanostructure particles isolated from plants, which can be developed as therapeutic agents and drug carriers for their low immunogenicity and wide availability. PDVLNs have promising potential in human health and disease treatments. It is necessary to further develop standard operating procedures to promote the clinical application of PDVLNs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are heterogeneous, phospholipid bilayer-enclosed biological particles that regulate cell communication by molecular cargo delivery and surface signaling. EVs are secreted by almost all living cells, including plant cells. Plant-derived vesicle-like nanoparticles (PDVLNs) is a generic term referring to vesicle-like nanostructure particles isolated from plants. Their low immunogenicity and wide availability make PDVLNs safer and more economical to be developed as therapeutic agents and drug carriers. Accumulating evidence indicates the key roles of PDVLNs in regulating interkingdom crosstalk between humans and plants. PDVLNs are capable of entering the human-body systemand delivering effector molecules to cells that modulate cell-signaling pathways. PDVLNs released by or obtained from plants thus have great influenceon human health and diseases. In this review, the biogenesis, detailed preparation methods, various physical and biochemical characteristics, biosafety, and preservation of PDVLNs are introduced, along with how these characteristics pertain to their biosafety and preservability. The potential applications of PDVLNs on different plant and mammalian diseases and PDVLN research standardization are then systematically discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomic Aerogel Materials (or Single&#8208;Atom Aerogels): An Interesting New Paradigm in Materials Science and Catalysis Science</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of atomic aerogel materials (or single&#8208;atom aerogels) is proposed for materials science and catalysis science; and their scientific significances, synthetic breakthrough, and potential applications are systematically summarized.








Abstract
The concept of &#8220;single&#8208;atom catalysis&#8221; is&#160;first proposed by Tao Zhang, Jun Li, and Jingyue Liu in 2011. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have a very high catalytic activity and greatly improved atom utilization ratio. At present, SACs have become frontier materials in the field of catalysis. Aerogels are highly porous materials with extremely low density and extremely high porosity. These pores play a key role in determining their surface reactivity and mechanical stability. The alliance of SACs and aerogels can fully reflect their structural advantages and lead to new enhancement effects. Herein, a general concept of &#8220;atomic aerogel materials&#8221; (AAMs) (or single&#8208;atom aerogels (SAAs)) is proposed to describe this interesting new paradigm in both material and catalysis fields. Based on the basic units of &#8220;gel,&#8221; the AAMs can be divided into two categories: carrier&#8208;level AAMs (with micro&#8208;, nano&#8208;, or sub&#8208;nanometer pore structures) and atomic&#8208;level AAMs (with atomic&#8208;defective or oxygen&#8208;bridged sub&#8208;nanopore structures). The basic unit of the former (i.e., single&#8208;atom&#8208;functionalized aerogels) is the carrier materials in nanostructures, and the latter (i.e., single&#8208;atom&#8208;built aerogels) is the single metal atoms in atomic structures. The atomic&#8208;defective or oxygen&#8208;bridged AAMs will be important development directions in versatile heterogeneous catalytic or noncatalytic fields. The design proposals, latent challenges, and coping strategies of this new &#8220;atomic nanosystem&#8221; in&#160;applications&#160;are pointed out as&#160;well.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Use of Covalent Organic Frameworks as Heterogenous Photocatalysts in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art development of pristine, functionalized, and hybrid covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for photocatalytic organic transformations is presented, arranged in a clear order that states the types of bonds in COFs that can be used in photocatalysis and the photocatalytic mechanisms behind these COFs which influence the performance of the applications.








Abstract
Organic photochemistry&#160;is&#160;intensely developed in the 1980s, in which the nature of excited electronic states and the energy and electron transfer processes are&#160;thoroughly studied and finally well&#8208;understood. This knowledge from molecular organic photochemistry can be transferred to the design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as active visible&#8208;light photocatalysts. COFs constitute a new class of crystalline porous materials with substantial application potentials. Featured with outstanding structural tunability, large porosity, high surface area, excellent stability, and unique photoelectronic properties, COFs are studied as potential candidates in various research areas (e.g., photocatalysis). This review aims to provide the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art insights into the design of COF photocatalysts (pristine, functionalized, and hybrid COFs) for organic transformations. The catalytic reaction mechanism of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts and the influence of dimensionality and crystallinity on heterogenous photocatalysis performance are also discussed, followed by perspectives and prospects on the main challenges and opportunities in future research of COFs and COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Principles of Design and Synthesis of Metal Derivatives from MOFs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 24, June 15, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have complex structures and can be made using low&#8208;cost methods, but their low electrical conductivity and instability limit their use. Metal&#8208;based derivatives of MOFs (MDs) may be a solution, retaining the complexity of MOFs while having improved stability and conductivity. This review covers various types of MDs including oxides, sulfides, nitrides, phosphides, transition metals, carbides, and more.








Abstract
Materials derived from metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have demonstrated exceptional structural variety and complexity and can be synthesized using low&#8208;cost scalable methods. Although the inherent instability and low electrical conductivity of MOFs are largely responsible for their low uptake for catalysis and energy storage, a superior alternative is MOF&#8208;derived metal&#8208;based derivatives (MDs) as these can retain the complex nanostructures of MOFs while exhibiting stability and electrical conductivities of several orders of magnitude higher. The present work comprehensively reviews MDs in terms of synthesis and their nanostructural design, including oxides, sulfides, phosphides, nitrides, carbides, transition metals, and other minor species. The focal point of the approach is the identification and rationalization of the design parameters that lead to the generation of optimal compositions, structures, nanostructures, and resultant performance parameters. The aim of this approach is to provide an inclusive platform for the strategies to design and process these materials for specific applications. This work is complemented by detailed figures that both summarize the design and processing approaches that have been reported and indicate potential trajectories for development. The work is also supported by comprehensive and up&#8208;to&#8208;date tabular coverage of the reported studies.

         <title>Extreme Water Uptake of Hygroscopic Hydrogels through Maximized Swelling&#8208;Induced Salt Loading</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The swelling dynamics of hydrogels in aqueous lithium chloride solutions are studied and unprecedented salt loadings and water vapor uptakes reaching 1.79 and 3.86&#160;gg&#8722;1 are acheived at relative humidity of 30% and 70%, respectively. This exceeds previously reported uptakes of hydrogels by 15%, while also avoiding the leakage problems common with salts.








Abstract
Hygroscopic hydrogels are emerging as scalable and low&#8208;cost sorbents for atmospheric water harvesting, dehumidification, passive cooling, and thermal energy storage. However, devices using these materials still exhibit insufficient performance, partly due to the limited water vapor uptake of the hydrogels. Here, the swelling dynamics of hydrogels in aqueous lithiumchloride solutions, the implications on hydrogel salt loading, and the resulting vapor uptake of the synthesized hydrogel&#8211;salt composites are characterized. By tuning the salt concentration of the swelling solutions and the cross&#8208;linking properties of the gels, hygroscopic hydrogels with extremely high salt loadings are synthesized, which enable unprecedented water uptakes of 1.79 and 3.86&#160;gg&#8722;1 at relative humidity (RH) of 30% and 70%, respectively. At 30% RH, this exceeds previously reported water uptakes of metal&#8211;organic frameworks by over 100% and of hydrogels by 15%, bringing the uptake within 93% of the fundamental limit of hygroscopic salts while avoiding leakage problems common in salt solutions. By modeling the salt&#8208;vapor equilibria, the maximum leakage&#8208;free RH is elucidated as a function of hydrogel uptake and swelling ratio. These insights guide the design of hydrogels with exceptional hygroscopicity that enable sorption&#8208;based devices to tackle water scarcity and the global energy crisis.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Wave Pumped Perovskite Lasers with Device Area Below 1&#160;&#181;m2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous&#8208;wave optically pumped perovskite sub&#8208;micrometer lasers are demonstrated. Their thresholds are comparable to or even lower than those of several&#8208;micrometer&#8208;sized counterparts owing to their enhanced exciton&#8211;photon coupling strength. The potential of exciton&#8211;polaritons in laser miniaturization is unveiled experimentally and theoretically to develop low&#8208;threshold semiconductor lasers with device sizes approaching the optical diffraction limit.








Abstract
Continuous&#8208;wave (CW) pumped lasers with device areas below 1&#160;&#181;m2 constitute a key step to meeting the energy efficiency requirement for on&#8208;chip optical communications. However, a debate about whether a sub&#8211;micrometer device size and low threshold can be simultaneously satisfied has persisted owing to insurmountable radiation losses when approaching the optical diffraction limit. Herein, a record&#8208;small CW optically pumped perovskite laser with a device area of 0.65&#160;&#181;m2 is demonstrated. The thresholds of sub&#8211;micrometer lasers can be found lower than those of several&#8208;micrometer counterparts, and are ascribed to the enlarged group refractive index and modal confinement resulting from the enhanced exciton&#8211;photon coupling. Moreover, the operation temperature is elevated to 150&#160;K through the reduction in heat generation. These findings unveil the potential of exciton&#8211;polaritons in laser miniaturization, providing an alternative for developing low&#8208;threshold semiconductor lasers without artificial optical cavities, to approach the optical diffraction limit.

         <title>Highly Efficient Solar&#8208;driven Dry Reforming of Methane on a Rh/LaNiO3 Catalyst through a Light&#8208;induced Metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal Charge Transfer Process</title>

Abstract
As an energy&#8208;saving and green method, solar&#8208;driven dry reforming of methane (DRM) is expected to introduce new activation processes and prevent sintering and coking of the catalysts. However, it still lacks an efficient way to the coordinate regulation of activation of reactants and lattice oxygen migration. In this work, Rh/LaNiO3 is designed as a highly efficient photothermal catalyst for solar&#8208;driven DRM, which performs production rates of 452.3&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gRh&#8722;1 for H2 and 527.6&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gRh&#8722;1 for CO2 under a light intensity of 1.5&#160;W cm&#8722;2, with an excellent stability. Moreover, a remarkable light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy efficiency (LTCEE) of 10.72% is achieved under a light intensity of 3.5&#160;W cm&#8722;2. The characterizations of surface electronic and chemical properties and theoretical analysis demonstrate that strong adsorption for CH4 and CO2, light&#8208;induced metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (MMCT) process and high oxygen mobility together bring Rh/LaNiO3 excellent performance for solar&#8208;driven DRM.

         <title>Separating Crystal Growth from Nucleation Enables the in&#8208;situ&#8208;controllable Synthesis of Nanocrystals for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;emitting Diodes</title>

Abstract
Colloidal perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) display bright luminescence for light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) applications; however, they require post&#8208;synthesis ligand exchange that may cause surface degradation and defect formation. In&#8208;situ&#8208;formed PNCs achieve improved surface passivation using a straightforward synthetic approach, but their LED performance in the green wavelength is not yet comparable with that of colloidal PNC devices. Here we find that the limitations of in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed PNCs stem from uncontrolled formation kinetics: conventional surface ligands confine perovskite nuclei but fail to delay crystal growth. We introduce a bifunctional carboxylic&#8208;acid&#8208;containing ammonium hydrobromide ligand that separates crystal growth from nucleation, leading to the formation of quantum&#8208;confined PNC solids exhibiting a narrow size distribution. Controlled crystallization is further coupled with defect passivation using deprotonated phosphinates, enabling improvements in photoluminescence quantum yield to near unity. We fabricate green LEDs with a maximum current efficiency of 109&#160;cd A&#8722;1 and average external quantum efficiency of 22.5% across 25 devices &#8211; exceeding the performance of colloidal PNC&#8208;based counterparts; We further document a 45.6&#8208;hour operating half&#8208;time for an unencapsulated device in N2 with an initial brightness of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>PdNi biatomic clusters from metallene unlock record&#8208;low onset dehydrogenation temperature for bulk&#8208;MgH2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrogen storage has long been a priority on the renewable energy research agenda. Due to its high volumetric and gravimetric hydrogen density, MgH2 is a desirable candidate for solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage. However, its practical use is constrained by high thermal stability and sluggish kinetics. Here, we report PdNi bilayer metallenes as catalysts for hydrogen storage of bulk&#8208;MgH2 near ambient temperature. Unprecedented 422 K beginning dehydrogenation temperature and up to 6.36&#160;wt.% reliable hydrogen storage capacity were achieved. Fast hydrogen desorption was also provided by the system (5.49&#160;wt.% in 1&#160;h, 523 K). The in&#8208;situ generated PdNi alloy clusters with suitable d&#8208;band centers were identified as the main active sites during the de/re&#8208;hydrogenation process by AC&#8208;TEM and theoretical simulations, while other active species including Pd/Ni pure phase clusters and Pd/Ni single atoms obtained via metallene ball milling, also enhance reaction. These findings present fundamental insights into active species identification and rational design of highly efficient hydrogen storage materials.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Phase&#8208;Transition Entropy into Electrochemical Thermopower and Peltier Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermocell generates thermopower from a temperature difference (&#916;T) between two electrodes. The converse process of thermocells is an electrochemical Peltier effect, which creates a &#916;T on the electrodes by applying an external current. The Seebeck coefficient (Se) of the electrochemical system is proportional to the entropy change of the redox reaction; therefore, a redox system having a significant entropy change is expected to increase the Se. In this study, a thermo&#8208;responsive polymer having a redox&#8208;active moiety, poly(N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;acrylamide ethyl)&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;n&#8208;propylviologen) (PNV), is used as the redox species of a thermocell. PNV2+ dication undergoes the coil&#8211;globule phase transition upon the reduction to PNV+ cation radical, and a large entropy change is introduced because water molecules are freed from the polymer chains. The Se of PNV thermocell drastically increased to +2.1&#160;mV K&#8722;1 at the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PNV. The entropy change calculated from the increment of Se agreed with the value evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry. Moreover, the electrochemical Peltier effect was observed when the device temperature was increased above the LCST. This study shows that the large entropy change associated with the coil&#8211;globule phase transition can be used in electrochemical thermal management and refrigeration technologies.

         <title>An Ultrastable Self&#8208;Assembled Antibacterial Nanospears Made of Protein</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent increasing reports of antibiotic resistance reveal an overwhelming threat to global public health, necessitating alternative approaches. By rational design and serendipity, a supramolecular nanostructure with a well&#8208;defined shape, geometry or architecture termed &#8220;nanospears&#8221; based on engineered proteins is spontaneously biofabricated via a bottom&#8208;up strategy with exceptional stability, broad&#8208;antibacterial activities and biocompatibility.








Abstract
Protein&#8208;based nanomaterials have broad applications in the biomedical and bionanotechnological sectors owing to their outstanding properties such as high biocompatibility and biodegradability, structural stability, sophisticated functional versatility, and being environmentally benign. They have gained considerable attention in drug delivery, cancer therapeutics, vaccines, immunotherapies, biosensing, and biocatalysis. However, so far, in the battle against the increasing reports of antibiotic resistance and emerging drug&#8208;resistant bacteria, unique nanostructures of this kind are lacking, hindering their potential next&#8208;generation antibacterial agents. Here, the discovery of a class of supramolecular nanostructures with well&#8208;defined shapes, geometries, or architectures (termed &#8220;protein nanospears&#8221;) based on engineered proteins, exhibiting exceptional broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activities, is reported. The protein nanospears are engineered via spontaneous cleavage&#8208;dependent or precisely tunable self&#8208;assembly routes using mild metal salt&#8208;ions (Mg2+, Ca2+, Na+) as a molecular trigger. The nanospears&#8217; dimensions collectively range from entire nano&#8208; to micrometer scale. The protein nanospears display exceptional thermal and chemical stability yet rapidly disassemble upon exposure to high concentrations of chaotropes (&gt;1 mm sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)). Using a combination of biological assays and electron microscopy imaging, it is revealed that the nanospears spontaneously induce rapid and irreparable damage to bacterial morphology via a unique action mechanism provided by their nanostructure and enzymatic action, a feat inaccessible to traditional antibiotics. These protein&#8208;based nanospears show promise as a potent tool to combat the growing threats of resistant bacteria, inspiring a new way to engineer other antibacterial protein nanomaterials with diverse structural and dimensional architectures and functional properties.

         <title>Engineering Amorphous&#8211;Crystallized Interface of ZrNx Barriers for Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of the amorphous&#8211;crystalline (a&#8211;c) interface on the blocking performance of ZrNx barrier films is investigated and the interface density is quantified for proving the interdiffusion channels by pattern recognition technology. The underlying mechanisms of a&#8211;c interfaces for blocking effects are further revealed&#160;in thermodynamic and kinetics properties, constructing stable inverted perovskite solar cells with amorphous ZrNx barriers.








Abstract
It is challenging to achieve long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells due to the corrosion and diffusion of metal electrodes. Integration of compact barriers into devices has been recognized as an effective strategy to protect the perovskite absorber and electrode. However, the difficulty is to construct a thin layer of a few nanometers that can delay ion migration and impede chemical reactions simultaneously, in which the delicate microstructure design of a stable material plays an important role. Herein, ZrNx barrier films with high amorphization are introduced in p&#8211;i&#8211;nperovskite solar cells. To quantify the amorphous&#8211;crystalline (a&#8211;c) density, pattern recognition techniques are employed. It is found the decreasing a&#8211;c interface in an amorphous film leads to dense atom arrangement and uniform distribution of chemical potential, which retards the interdiffusion at the interface between ions and metal atoms and protect the electrodes from corrosion. The resultant solar cells exhibit improved operational stability, which retains 88% of initial efficiency after continuous maximum power point tracking under 1&#8208;Sun illumination at room temperature (25 &#176;C) for 1500 h.

         <title>Coordination Chemistry as a Universal Strategy for a Controlled Perovskite Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The most efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are made from complex mixture of precursors, which are practically always dissolved in combinations of the volatile (and toxic) N, N&#8208;Dimethylformamide (DMF), and the non&#8208;volatile (and green) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvents. Typically, to then form a thin film, an extreme oversaturation of the perovskite precursor is initiated to trigger nucleation sites, e.g. by vacuum, an airstream or a so&#8208;called antisolvent. Unfortunately, most such oversaturation triggers do not expel the lingering (and highly coordinating) DMSO, which is highly coordinating, from the thin films; this detrimentally affects long&#8208;term stability. Here, for the first time, we introduce (the green) dimethyl sulfide (DMS) as a novel nucleation trigger for perovskite films combining, uniquely, high coordination and high vapor pressure. More precisely, DMS coordinates more strongly than all currently used solvents, hence replacing them, including DMSO, effectively during film formation. Crucially, DMS also has among the highest vapor pressures reported in literature, thus effectively leaving the thin film shortly after formation. This gives DMS a universal scope: DMS replaces other solvents by coordinating more strongly and removes itself once the film formation is finished. To demonstrate this novel coordination chemistry approach, we process MAPbI3 PSCs, typically dissolved in hard&#8208;to&#8208;remove (and green) DMSO achieving 21.6% efficiency, among the highest reported efficiencies for this system. To confirm the universality of our strategy, we tested DMS for FAPbI3 as another composition, which showed higher efficiency of 23.5% compared to 20.9% for fabricated device with CB. This work provides a universal strategy to control perovskite crystallization using coordination chemistry heralding the revival of perovskite compositions with pure DMSO, such as MAPbI3.

         <title>Tailoring the Amphiphilic Structure of Zwitterionic AIE Photosensitizers to Boost Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although photodynamic therapy (PDT) for thorough cancer treatment is hindered by the limited generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with short lifetime from photosensitizers, PDT&#8208;induced antitumor immune response remedies the defects. Previous studies showed that inducing immunogenic cell deaths is an attractive approach to activate antitumor immunity, which confers a robust adjuvanticity to dying cancer cells. In this work, amphiphilic luminogens with aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics (AIEgens) are rationally designed and synthesized. By modulating the hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;bridge and zwitterionic functional groups, these AIEgens exhibited tunable organelle specificity to lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane and enhanced ROS generation ability. Notably, the membrane&#8208;targeting AIEgen namely TPS&#8208;2 induced cell death and membrane rupture via PDT to facilitate the release of antigens and activation of immune cells. Furthermore, the size&#8208;controlled TPS&#8208;2 nanoaggregates were found to serve as an adjuvant, promoting antigen accumulation and delivery to sufficiently boost the in vivo antitumor immunity by only one dose injection in a prophylactic tumor vaccination model. This work thus provides new insights into optimizing AIE photosensitizers via a hydrophobicity&#8208;hydrophilicity balance strategy for evoking an antitumor immunity and directly suppressing the distanced tumor. A single small&#8208;molecular system for PDT&#8208;stimulated antitumor immunity is envisioned.

         <title>Precision covalent organic frameworks for surface nucleation control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Unwanted accumulation of ice and lime scale crystals on surfaces is a long&#8208;standing challenge with major economic and sustainability implications. Passive inhibition of icing and scaling by liquid&#8208;repellent surfaces are often inadequate, susceptible to surface failure under harsh conditions and unsuitable for long&#8208;term/real&#8208;life usages. Such surfaces often require a multiplicity of additional features such as optical transparency, robust impact resistance and ability to prevent contamination from low surface energy liquids. Unfortunately, most promising advances have relied on using perfluoro compounds (PFCs) which are bio&#8208;persistent and/or highly toxic. Here we&#160;show that organic, reticulated mesoporous frameworks, i.e., covalent organic frameworks (COFs), may offer a solution. By exploiting simple and scalable synthesis of defect&#8208;free COFs and rational post&#8208;synthetic functionalization, we&#160;prepared nanocoatings with precision nanoporosity (morphology) that can inhibit nucleation at molecular level without compromising the related contamination prevention and robustness. The results offer a simple strategy to exploit nanoconfinement effect, which remarkably delay nucleation of ice and scale formation on surfaces. Ice nucleation is suppressed down to &#8208;28&#160;&#176;C, scale formation is avoided for &gt;2 weeks in super saturated conditions and jets of organic solvents impacting at Weber numbers &gt;&#160;105 resisted with surfaces that also offers optical transparency (&gt;92%).

         <title>Enhanced Hot&#8208;Phonon Bottleneck Effect on Slowing Hot Carrier Cooling in Metal Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots With Alloyed A&#8208;Site</title>

Abstract
A deep understanding of the effect of the A&#8208;site cation cross&#8208;exchange on the hot&#8208;carrier relaxation dynamics in perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) has profound implications on the further development of disruptive photovoltaic technologies. In this study, we investigated the hot carrier cooling kinetics of pure FAPbI3, MAPbI3, CsPbI3 and alloyed FA0.5MA0.5PbI3, FA0.5Cs0.5PbI3, and MA0.5Cs0.5PbI3 QDs using ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. The lifetimes of the initial fast cooling stage (&lt;1&#160;ps) of all the organic cation&#8208;containing PQDs were shorter than those of the CsPbI3 QDs, as verified by the electron&#8208;phonon coupling strength extracted from the temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectra. The lifetimes of the slow cooling stage of the alloyed PQDs were longer under illumination greater than 1 sun, which was ascribed to the introduction of co&#8208;vibrational optical phonon modes in the alloyed PQDs. This facilitated efficient acoustic phonon upconversion and enhanced the hot&#8208;phonon bottleneck effect, as demonstrated by first&#8208;principles calculations.

         <title>Flagella of Tumor&#8208;targeting Bacteria Trigger Local Hemorrhage to Reprogram Tumor&#8208;associated Macrophages for Improved Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) exhibit an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype and lead to failure of antitumor therapy. Infiltrated erythrocytes during hemorrhage have been recognized as a promising strategy for polarizing TAMs. However, novel materials that precisely induce tumor hemorrhage without affecting normal coagulation still face challenges. Here, tumor&#8208;targeting bacteria (flhDC VNP) are genetically constructed to realize precise tumor hemorrhage. flhDC VNP colonize the tumor and overexpress flagella during proliferation. The flagella promote the expression of TNF&#945;, which induces local tumor hemorrhage. Infiltrated erythrocytes during the hemorrhage temporarily polarize macrophages to M1 subtype. In the presence of artesunate, this short&#8208;lived polarization is transformed into a sustained polarization because artesunate and heme form a complex which continuously produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, the flagella of active tumor&#8208;targeting bacteria may open up new strategies for reprogramming TAMs and improving antitumor therapy.

         <title>Microscale Imaging of Thermal Conductivity Suppression at Grain Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Grain&#8208;boundary engineering is an effective strategy to tune the thermal conductivity of materials, leading to improved performance in thermoelectric, thermal&#8208;barrier coatings and thermal management applications. Despite the central importance to thermal transport, a clear understanding of how grain boundaries modulate the microscale heat flow is missing, owing to the scarcity of local investigations. Here, thermal imaging of individual grain boundaries is demonstrated in thermoelectric SnTe via spatially resolved frequency&#8208;domain thermoreflectance. Measurements with microscale resolution reveal local suppressions in thermal conductivity at grain boundaries. Also, the grain&#8208;boundary thermal resistance &#8211; extracted employing a Gibbs excess approach &#8211; is found correlating with the grain&#8208;boundary misorientation angle. Extracting thermal properties, including thermal boundary resistances, from microscale imaging can provide comprehensive understanding of how microstructure affects heat transport, crucially impacting the materials design of high&#8208;performance thermal&#8208;management and energy&#8208;conversion devices.

         <title>Homogeneous Phase Distribution in Q&#8208;2D Perovskites via Co&#8208;assembly of Spacer Cations for Efficient Light&#8208;emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D (Q&#8208;2D) perovskites are promising candidates applied in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, delicate control on crystallization kinetics is needed to suppress severe phase segregation and wide phase distribution. Here, we investigate the crystallization kinetics of Q&#8208;2D perovskites via in&#8208;situ absorbance spectroscopy and for the first time find the multiphase distribution is governed by the arrangement, rather than diffusion, of spacer cations at nucleation stage, which associate with its assembling ability determined by molecular configuration. We conceive a &#8220;co&#8208;assembly&#8221; strategy by combining co&#8208;cations with different configuration characteristics, where bulky cations disturb the assembling between slender cations and lead&#8208;bromide sheet, contributing to homogeneous emitting phase with effective passivation. Correspondingly, in the phenylethylammonium (PEA+)&#8208;based Q&#8208;2D perovskites (&lt;n&gt; = 3), homogeneous phase distribution is achieved by incorporating co&#8208;cation triphenylmethaneammonium (TPMA+), the branching terminals of which suppress cations assembling into low&#8208;n phases and afford adequate cations as passivating ligands. Therefore, the champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the LED device reach 23.9%, which is among the highest performance of green Q&#8208;2D perovskite LEDs. This work reveals that arrangement of spacer cations is key factor that determine the crystallization kinetics in Q&#8208;2D perovskites, providing further guidance on the molecular design and phase modulation of Q&#8208;2D perovskites.

         <title>Fibrous Zr&#8208;MOF Nanozyme Aerogels with Macro&#8208;Nanoporous Structure for Enhanced Catalytic Hydrolysis of Organophosphate Toxins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with Lewis acid catalytic sites, such as zirconium&#8208;based MOFs (Zr&#8208;MOFs), comprise a growing class of phosphatase&#8208;like nanozymes that can degrade toxic organophosphate pesticides and nerve agents. Rationally engineering and shaping MOFs from as&#8208;synthesized powders into hierarchically porous monoliths is essential for their use in emerging applications, such as filters for air and water purification and personal protection gear. However, several challenges still limit the production of practical MOF composites, including the need for sophisticated reaction conditions, low MOF catalyst loadings in the resulting composites, and poor accessibility to MOF&#8208;based active sites. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a rapid synthesis method to introduce Zr&#8208;MOF nanozyme coating into cellulose nanofibers, resulting in the formation of processable monolithic aerogel composites with high MOF loadings. These composites contain Zr&#8208;MOF nanozymes embedded in the structure, and hierarchical macro&#8208;micro porosity enables excellent accessibility to catalytic active sites. This multi&#8208;faceted rational design strategy, including the selection of a MOF with many catalytic sites, fine&#8208;tuning the coating morphology, and the fabrication of a hierarchically structured monolithic aerogel, renders synergistic effects towards the efficient continuous hydrolytic detoxification of organophosphorus&#8208;based nerve agent simulants and pesticides from contaminated water.

         <title>Mechanoresponsive drug release from a flexible, tissue&#8208;adherent, hybrid hydrogel actuator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Soft robotic technologies for therapeutic biomedical applications require conformal and atraumatic tissue coupling that is amenable to dynamic loading for effective drug delivery or tissue stimulation. This intimate and sustained contact offers vast therapeutic opportunity for localized drug release. This paper introduces a new class of hybrid hydrogel actuator (HHA) that facilitates enhanced drug delivery. The multi&#8208;material soft actuator can elicit tunable mechanoresponsive release of charged drug from its alginate/acrylamide hydrogel layer with temporal control. Dosing control parameters include actuation magnitude, frequency, and duration. The actuator can safely adhere to tissue via a flexible, drug permeable adhesive bond that can withstand dynamic device actuation. Conformal adhesion of the hybrid hydrogel actuator to tissue leads to the improved mechanoresponsive spatial delivery of drug. Future integration of this hybrid hydrogel actuator with other soft robotic assistive technologies could enable a synergistic multi&#8208;pronged treatment approach for the treatment of disease.

         <title>Inhalable capsular polysaccharide&#8208;camouflaged gallium&#8208;polyphenol nanoparticles enhance lung cancer chemotherapy by depleting local lung microbiota</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Local lung microbiota is closely associated with lung tumorigenesis and therapeutic response. It is found that lung commensal microbes induce chemoresistance in lung cancer by directly inactivating therapeutic drugs via biotransformation. Accordingly, an inhalable microbial capsular polysaccharide (CP)&#8208;camouflaged gallium&#8208;polyphenol metal&#8208;organic network (MON) is designed to eliminate lung microbiota and thereby abrogate microbe&#8208;induced chemoresistance. As a substitute for iron uptake, Ga3+ released from MON acts as a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; to disrupt bacterial iron respiration, effectively inactivating multiple microbes. Moreover, CP cloaks endow MON with reduced immune clearance by masquerading as normal host&#8208;tissue molecules, significantly increasing residence time in lung tissue for enhanced antimicrobial efficacy. In multiple lung cancer mice models, microbe&#8208;induced drug degradation is remarkably inhibited when drugs are delivered by antimicrobial MON. Tumor growth is sufficiently suppressed and mouse survival is prolonged. Our&#160;work develops a novel microbiota&#8208;depleted nano&#8208;strategy to overcome chemoresistance in lung cancer by inhibiting local microbial inactivation of therapeutic drugs.

         <title>Ultrafast Subpicosecond Magnetisation Of a Two&#8208;Dimensional Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Strong spin&#8208;charge interactions in several ferromagnets are expected to lead to subpicosecond (sub&#8208;ps) magnetisation of the magnetic materials through control of the carrier characteristics via electrical means, which is essential for ultrafast spin&#8208;based electronic devices. Thus far, ultrafast control of magnetisation has been realized by optically pumping a large number of carriers into the d or f orbitals of a ferromagnet; however, it is extremely challenging to be implemented by electrical gating. This work demonstrates a new method for sub&#8208;ps magnetisation manipulation, called wavefunction engineering, in which w&#160;e control only the spatial distribution (wavefunction) of s (or p) electrons and require no change in the total carrier density. Using a ferromagnetic semiconductor (FMS) (In,Fe)As quantum well (QW), w&#160;e observe instant enhancement, as fast as 600 fs, of the magnetisation upon irradiating a femtosecond (fs) laser pulse. O&#160;ur analysis shows that the instant enhancement of the magnetisation is induced when the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) electron wavefunctions (WFs) in the FMS QW are rapidly moved by a photo&#8208;Dember electric field formed by an asymmetric distribution of the photocarriers. Because this WF engineering method can be equivalently implemented by applying a gate electric field, o&#160;ur results open a new way to realise ultrafast magnetic storage and spin&#8208;based information processing in present electronic systems.

         <title>Top&#8208;down fabrication of atomic patterns in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Atomic&#8208;scale engineering typically involves bottom&#8208;up approaches, leveraging parameters such as temperature, partial pressures, and chemical affinity to promote spontaneous arrangement of atoms. These parameters are applied globally, resulting in atomic scale features scattered probabilistically throughout the material. In a top&#8208;down approach, different regions of the material are exposed to different parameters resulting in structural changes varying on the scale of the resolution. In this work, we combine the application of global and local parameters in an aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to demonstrate atomic scale precision patterning of atoms in twisted bilayer graphene. The focused electron beam is used to define attachment points for foreign atoms through the controlled ejection of carbon atoms from the graphene lattice. The sample environment is staged with nearby source materials, such that the sample temperature can induce migration of the source atoms across the sample surface. Under these conditions, the electron&#8208;beam (top&#8208;down) enables carbon atoms in the graphene to be replaced spontaneously by diffusing adatoms (bottom&#8208;up). Using image&#8208;based feedback&#8208;control, arbitrary patterns of atoms and atom clusters are attached to the twisted bilayer graphene with limited human interaction. The role of substrate temperature on adatom and vacancy diffusion is explored by first&#8208;principles simulations.

         <title>Folding Double&#8208;Stranded DNA into Designed Shapes with Triplex&#8208;Forming Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The compaction and organization of genomic DNA is a central mechanism in eukaryotic cells, but engineered architectural control over double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) is notably challenging. Here, long dsDNA templates are folded into designed shapes via triplex&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly. Triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) bind purines in dsDNA via normal or reverse Hoogsteen interactions. In the triplex origami methodology, these non&#8208;canonical interactions are programmed to compact dsDNA (linear or plasmid) into well&#8208;defined objects, which demonstrate a variety of structural features: hollow and raster&#8208;filled, single&#8208; and multi&#8208;layered, with custom curvatures and geometries, and featuring lattice&#8208;free, square&#8208;, or honeycomb&#8208;pleated internal arrangements. Surprisingly, the length of integrated and free&#8208;standing dsDNA loops can be modulated with near&#8208;perfect efficiency; from hundreds down to only six bp (2&#160;nm). The inherent rigidity of dsDNA promotes structural robustness and non&#8208;periodic structures of almost 25.000&#160;nt are therefore formed with fewer unique starting materials, compared to other DNA&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly methods. Densely triplexed structures also resist degradation by DNase I. Triplex&#8208;mediated dsDNA folding is methodologically straightforward and orthogonal to Watson&#8208;Crick&#8208;based methods. Moreover, it enables unprecedented spatial control over dsDNA templates.

         <title>Paper&#8208;Based Laser&#8208;Pyrolyzed Electrofluidics: An Electrochemical Platform for Capillary&#8208;Driven Diagnostic Bioassays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile electrochemical platform that integrates paper&#8208;based microfluidics and laser&#8208;pyrolyzed permeable electronics is introduced. This platform combines efficient electrochemical sensing with rapid capillary wicking, making it suitable for a wide range of capillary&#8208;driven biosensing assays. The devices are constructed using readily available digital fabrication tools, providing exceptional adaptability for widespread implementation.








Abstract
Microfluidic paper&#8208;based analytical devices (&#181;PADs) are indispensable tools for disease diagnostics. The integration of electronic components into &#181;PADs enables new device functionalities and facilitates the development of complex quantitative assays. Unfortunately, current electrode fabrication methods often hinder capillary flow, considerably restricting &#181;PAD design architectures. Here, laser&#8208;induced graphenization is presented as an approach to fabricate porous electrodes embedded into cellulose paper. The resulting electrodes not only have high conductivity and electrochemical activity, but also retain wetting properties for capillary transport. Paper&#8208;based electrofluidics, including a lateral flow device for injection analysis of alkaline phosphatase in serum and a vertical flow device for quantitative detection of HPV16 with a CRISPR&#8208;based assay are demonstrated. It is expected that this platform will streamline the development of diagnostic devices that combine the operational simplicity of colorimetric lateral flow tests with the added benefits and possibilities offered by electronic signaling.

         <title>Emerging Spintronic Materials and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The explosive growth of the information era has put forward urgent requirements for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;speed and extremely efficient computations. In direct contrary to charge&#8208;based computations, spintronics aims to use spins as information carriers for data storage, transmission, and decoding, to help fully realize electronic device miniaturization and high integration for next&#8208;generation computing technologies. Currently, many novel spintronic materials have been developed with unique properties and multi&#8208;functionalities, including organic semiconductors (OSCs), organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs), and two&#8208;dimensional materials (2DMs). These materials are useful to fulfil the demand for developing diverse and advanced spintronic devices. Herein, we systematically reviewed these promising materials for advanced spintronic applications. Due to the distinct chemical and physical structures of OSCs, OIHPs, and 2DMs, their spintronic properties (spin transport and spin manipulation) were discussed separately. In addition, some multifunctionalities due to photoelectric and chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) were overviewed, including the spin&#8208;filter effect, spin&#8208;photovoltaics, spin&#8208;light emitting devices, and spin&#8208;transistor functions. Subsequently, we presented challenges and future perspectives of using these multifunctional materials for the development of advanced spintronics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explosive growth of the information era has put forward urgent requirements for ultra-high-speed and extremely efficient computations. In direct contrary to charge-based computations, spintronics aims to use spins as information carriers for data storage, transmission, and decoding, to help fully realize electronic device miniaturization and high integration for next-generation computing technologies. Currently, many novel spintronic materials have been developed with unique properties and multi-functionalities, including organic semiconductors (OSCs), organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs), and two-dimensional materials (2DMs). These materials are useful to fulfil the demand for developing diverse and advanced spintronic devices. Herein, we systematically reviewed these promising materials for advanced spintronic applications. Due to the distinct chemical and physical structures of OSCs, OIHPs, and 2DMs, their spintronic properties (spin transport and spin manipulation) were discussed separately. In addition, some multifunctionalities due to photoelectric and chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) were overviewed, including the spin-filter effect, spin-photovoltaics, spin-light emitting devices, and spin-transistor functions. Subsequently, we presented challenges and future perspectives of using these multifunctional materials for the development of advanced spintronics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Deformable Additive on Defects Passivation and Phase Segregation Inhibition Enables the Efficiency of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells over 24%</title>

Abstract
The defects and phase segregation in perovskite will significantly reduce the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, a deformable coumarin was employed as a multifunctional additive for formamidinium&#8208;cesium (FA&#8208;Cs) perovskite. During the annealing process of perovskite, the partial decomposition of coumarin passivates the Pb2+, iodine, and organic cation defects. Additionally, coumarin can affect colloidal size distributions, resulting in relatively large grain size and good crystallinity of target perovskite film. Hence, the carrier extraction/transport can be promoted, trap&#8208;assisted recombination is reduced, and energy levels are optimized in target perovskite films. Furthermore, the coumarin treatment can significantly release the residual stress. As a result, the champion PCEs of 23.18% and 24.14% are obtained for Br&#8208;rich (FA0.88Cs0.12PbI2.64Br0.36) and Br&#8208;poor (FA0.96Cs0.04PbI2.8Br0.12) based devices, respectively. The flexible PSCs based on Br&#8208;poor perovskite exhibit an excellent PCE of 23.13%, one of the highest values for flexible PSCs reported to date. Due to the inhibition of phase segregation, the target devices exhibit excellent thermal and light stability. This work provides new insights into the additive engineering of passivating defects, stress relief, and inhibition of phase segregation of perovskite films, offering a reliable method to develop state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells.

         <title>An Exciplex&#8208;Based Light&#8208;Emission Pathway for Solution&#8208;State Electrochemiluminescent Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) allows the design of unique light&#8208;emitting devices that use organic semiconductors in a liquid or gel state, which allows for simpler and more sustainable device fabrication and facilitates unconventional device form&#8208;factors. Compared to solid&#8208;state organic LEDs, ECL devices (ECLDs) have attracted less attention due to their currently much lower performance. ECLD operation is typically based on an annihilation pathway that involves electron transfer between reduced and oxidized luminophore species; the intermediate radical ions produced during annihilation dramatically reduce device stability. Here, we mitigate the effects of radical ions by using an exciplex formation pathway and demonstrate a remarkable improvement in luminance, luminous efficacy, and operational lifetime. Electron donor and acceptor molecules are dissolved at high concentrations and recombine as an exciplex upon their oxidization/reduction. The exciplex then transfers its energy to a nearby dye, allowing the dye to emit light without undergoing oxidation/reduction. Furthermore, by applying a mesoporous TiO2 electrode, we increase the contact area and hence the number of molecules participating in ECL, thereby obtaining devices with a very high luminance of 3,790&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a 30&#8208;fold improved operational lifetime. This study paves the way for the development of ECLDs into highly versatile light sources.

         <title>Large anomalous Nernst effects at room temperature in Fe3Pt thin films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Heat current in ferromagnets can generate a transverse electric voltage perpendicular to magnetization, which is known as anomalous Nernst effect (ANE). ANE originates intrinsically from the combination of large Berry curvature and density of states near the Fermi energy EF. It shows technical advantages over conventional longitudinal Seebeck effect in converting waste heat to electricity due to its unique transverse geometry. However, materials showing giant ANE especially at zero magnetic field, remain to be explored. Herein, we report the discovery of a large ANE thermopower of Syx &#8776; 2 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at room temperature in ferromagnetic Fe3Pt epitaxial films, which also shows a giant transverse thermoelectric conductivity of &#945;yx &#8776; 4 A K&#8722;1m&#8722;1 and a remarkable coercive field of about 1300&#160;Oe. Besides the consequent strong magnetic anisotropy, our theoretical analysis reveals that the strong spin&#8208;orbit interaction in addition to the hybridization between Pt 5d and Fe 3d electrons leads to a series of distinct energy gaps and large Berry curvature in the Brillouin zone, which is the key for the large ANE. These results highlight the important roles of both Berry curvature and spin&#8208;orbit coupling in achieving large ANE at zero magnetic field, providing pathways to explore materials with giant transverse thermoelectric effect without external magnetic field.

         <title>Direct&#8208;Current Electrical Detection of Surface&#8208;Acoustic&#8208;Wave&#8208;Driven Ferromagnetic Resonance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Surface acoustic wave (SAW) provides a promising platform to study spin&#8208;phonon coupling, which can be achieved by SAW&#8208;driven ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) for efficiently acoustic manipulation of spin. Although the magneto&#8208;elastic effective field model has achieved great success in describing SAW&#8208;driven FMR, the magnitude of the effective field acting on the magnetization induced by SAW still remain hard to access. Here, by integrating ferromagnetic stripes with SAW devices, we report direct&#8208;current detection for SAW&#8208;driven FMR based on electrical rectification. By analyzing FMR rectified voltage, we straightforwardly characterize and extract the effective fields, which exhibits advantages of better integration compatibility and lower cost than traditional methods such as vector network analyzer based techniques. Large nonreciprocal rectified voltage is obtained, which is attributed to the coexistence of in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane effective fields. The effective fields can be modulated by controlling the longitudinal and shear strains within the films to achieve almost 100% nonreciprocity ratio, demonstrating the potential for electrical switches. Besides the fundamental significance, our finding provides a unique opportunity for designable spin acousto&#8208;electronic device and its convenient signal readout.

         <title>On the mechanism of solvents catalyzed structural transformation in metal halide perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal halide perovskites show the capability of performing structural transformation, allowing the formation of functional heterostructures. Unfortunately, the elusive mechanism governing these transformations limits their technological application. Herein, we&#160;unravel the mechanism of 2D&#8208;3D structural transformation, and enlighten that is catalyzed by solvents. By combining a spatial&#8208;temporal cation interdiffusivity simulation with experimental findings, we&#160;validate that, protic solvents foster the dissociation degree of formadinium iodide (FAI) via dynamic hydrogen bond, then the stronger hydrogen bond of phenylethylamine (PEA) cation with selected solvents compared to dissociated FA cation facilitates 2D&#8208;3D transformation from (PEA)2PbI4 to FAPbI3. We&#160;discover that, the energy barrier of PEA out&#8208;diffusion and the lateral transition barrier of inorganic slab are diminished. Importantly, for 2D films, the protic solvents catalyze grain centers (GCs) and grain boundaries (GBs) transforming into 3D phases and quasi&#8208;2D phases, respectively. While in the solvent&#8208;free case, GCs transform into 3D&#8208;2D heterostructures along the direction perpendicular to the substrate, most GBs evolve into 3D phases. Finally, memristor devices fabricated using the transformed films with/without solvent&#8208;catalysis uncover that, GBs composed of 3D phases are more prone to the vertical ion migration. This work elucidates the fundamental mechanism of structural transformation, allowing their use to fabricate complex heterostructures.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Bridged Copper&#8208;Iron Atomic Pair as Dual&#8208;Metal Active Sites for Boosting Electrocatalytic NO Reduction</title>

Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitric oxide (NO) to ammonia (NH3) is a promising approach to NH3 synthesis. However, due to the lack of efficient electrocatalysts, the performance of electrocatalytic NO reduction reaction (NORR) is far from satisfactory. Herein, we report that an atomic copper&#8208;iron dual&#8208;site electrocatalyst bridged by an axial oxygen atom (O&#8208;Fe&#8208;N6&#8208;Cu) is anchored on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (CuFe DS/NC) for NORR. The CuFe DS/NC can significantly enhance the electrocatalytic NH3 synthesis performance (Faraday efficiency, 90%; yield rate, 112.52&#160;&#956;mol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) at &#8208;0.6&#160;V versus RHE, which is dramatically higher than the corresponding Cu single&#8208;atom, Fe single&#8208;atom and all NORR single&#8208;atom catalysts in the literature so far. Moreover, an assembled proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Zn&#8208;NO battery using CuFe DS/NC as the cathode outputs a power density of 2.30&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and NH3 yield of 45.52&#160;&#956;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1. The theoretical calculation result indicates that bimetallic sites can promote electrocatalytic NORR by changing the rate&#8208;determining step and accelerating the protonation process. This work provides a flexible strategy for the efficient sustainable NH3 synthesis.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Electropolymerized Three&#8208;Dimensional Microporous Cobalt&#8208;Porphyrin Nanofilm for Highly Effective Molecular Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide</title>

Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) based on molecular catalysts, e.g., cobalt porphyrin, is a promising approach to enhance carbon cycle and mitigate climate crisis. However, the electrocatalytic performance and accurate evaluations remains problems because of either the low loading amount or the low utilization rate of the electroactive CoN4 sites. W e herein synthesized a monomer, cobalt(II)&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(3,5&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl)porphyrin (CoP), electropolymerized it onto the crosslinked carbon nanotubes (CNTs) networks, affording a molecular electrocatalyst of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microporous nanofilm (EP&#8208;CoP, 2&#8764;3&#160;nm thickness) with highly dispersed CoN4 sites. The new electrocatalyst shortens the electron transfer pathway, accelerates the redox kinetics of CoN4 sites and improves the durability in the electrocatalytic CO2RR. From the intrinsic redox behavior of CoN4 sites, the effective utilization rate is obtained as 13.1%, much higher than that of the monomer assembled electrode (5.8%), and the durability is also promoted dramatically (&gt; 40&#160;h) in a H&#8208;type cell. In a commercial flow cell, EP&#8208;CoP can achieve a faradic efficiency for CO (FECO) over 92% at an overpotential of 160&#160;mV. At a higher overpotential of 620&#160;mV, the working current density can reach 310&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a high FECO of 98.6%, representing the best performance for electrodeposited molecular porphyrin electrocatalysts.

         <title>Thermally Stable Red&#8208;Emitting Oxide Ceramics for Laser Lighting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu2+&#8208;activated oxide&#8208;based bulk ceramics with red emission are reported. Cation&#8208;ordering in the double perovskites Sr3TaO5.5 and Sr3NbO5.5 contributes to the high external quantum efficiency and excellent thermal stability. It is further demonstrated that red&#8208;emitting Sr3TaO5.5:Eu2+ ceramic is a highly promising candidate for future high&#8208;power white laser lighting with a high luminous flux of 1115&#160;lm and ideal CRI (&#8776;90).








Abstract
Laser&#8208;driven phosphor&#8208;converted white light sources are highly desirable for their unprecedented energy efficiency and lighting quality. However, important challenges remain due to a lack of efficient and stable red&#8208;emitting materials. Here Eu2+&#8208;activated oxide&#8208;based double perovskites are explored as red emitters with thermally stable photoluminescence. Sr3TaO5.5:Eu2+ ceramics exhibit a red emission band peaking at 620&#160;nm upon blue laser pumping owing to the Eu2+ occupation at highly ordered substitutional lattice sites. A constructed laser&#8208;driven white light wheel under an incident power density of 19.2&#160;W&#160;mm&#8722;2 presents a record luminous flux of 1115&#160;lm with an excellent color rendering index of 90. This study invigorates the development of Eu2+&#8208;activated oxide&#8208;based ceramics with thermally stable luminescence for laser&#8208;pumped lighting and display applications.

         <title>Metasurfaces&#8208;Driven Hyperspectral Imaging via Multiplexed Plasmonic Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiplexed metasurface&#8211;driven plasmonic resonance energy transfer (PRET) hyperspectral imaging is created to probe biological light&#8211;matter interactions. Pixelated metasurfaces with engineered scattering spectra over the entire visible range, by the precision nanoengineering of gap plasmon and optical effects of metasurface clusters, are designed, fabricated, characterized by their full dark&#8208;field coloration, and are demonstrated for multiplexed real&#8208;time molecular sensing and imaging methods.








Abstract
Obtaining single&#8211;molecular&#8211;level fingerprints of biomolecules and electron&#8211;transfer dynamic imaging in living cells are critically demanded in postgenomic life sciences and medicine. However, the possible solution called plasmonic resonance energy transfer (PRET) spectroscopy remains challenging due to the fixed scattering spectrum of a plasmonic nanoparticle and limited multiplexing. Here, multiplexed metasurfaces&#8208;driven PRET hyperspectral imaging, to probe biological light&#8211;matter interactions, is reported. Pixelated metasurfaces with engineered scattering spectra are first designed over the entire visible range by the precision nanoengineering of gap plasmon and grating effects of metasurface clusters. Pixelated metasurfaces are created and their full dark&#8208;field coloration is optically characterized with visible color palettes and high&#8208;resolution color printings of the art pieces. Furthermore, three different biomolecules (i.e., chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and cytochrome c) are applied on metasurfaces for color palettes to obtain selective molecular fingerprint imaging due to the unique biological light&#8211;matter interactions with application&#8208;specific biomedical metasurfaces. This metasurface&#8208;driven PRET hyperspectral imaging will open up a new path for multiplexed real&#8208;time molecular sensing and imaging methods.

         <title>Transport Layer Engineering Toward Lower Threshold for Perovskite Lasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of transport layers on perovskite lasing actions are investigated. It is find that a selected hole&#8208;transport layer (PTAA) can reduce the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold of perovskite by suppressing hot&#8208;hole&#8208;induced Auger loss. An independent excitation&#8208;wavelength&#8208;influenced ASE threshold experiment further verifies the discovery.








Abstract
Charge&#8208;transport layers are essential for achieving electrically pumped perovskite lasers. However, their role in perovskite lasing is not fully understood. Here, the role of charge&#8208;transport layers on the lasing actions of perovskite films is explored by investigating the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) thresholds. A largely reduced ASE threshold and enhanced ASE intensity is demonstrated by introducing an additional hole transport layer poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA). It is shown that the key role of the PTAA layer is to accelerate the hot&#8208;carrier cooling process by extracting holes in perovskites. With reduced hot holes, the Auger recombination loss is largely suppressed, resulting in decreased ASE threshold. This argument is further supported by the fact that the ASE threshold can be further reduced from 25.7 to 7.2&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2 upon switching the pumping wavelength from 400 to 500&#160;nm to directly avoid excess hot&#8208;hole generation. This work exemplifies how to further reduce the ASE threshold with transport layer engineering through hot&#8208;hole manipulation. This is critical to maintaining the excellent gain properties of perovskites when integrating them into electrical devices, paving the way for electrically pumped perovskite lasers.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charge-transport layers are essential for achieving electrically pumped perovskite lasers. However, their role in perovskite lasing is not fully understood. Here, the role of charge-transport layers on the lasing actions of perovskite films is explored by investigating the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) thresholds. A largely reduced ASE threshold and enhanced ASE intensity is demonstrated by introducing an additional hole transport layer poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA). It is shown that the key role of the PTAA layer is to accelerate the hot-carrier cooling process by extracting holes in perovskites. With reduced hot holes, the Auger recombination loss is largely suppressed, resulting in decreased ASE threshold. This argument is further supported by the fact that the ASE threshold can be further reduced from 25.7 to 7.2&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; upon switching the pumping wavelength from 400 to 500&#160;nm to directly avoid excess hot-hole generation. This work exemplifies how to further reduce the ASE threshold with transport layer engineering through hot-hole manipulation. This is critical to maintaining the excellent gain properties of perovskites when integrating them into electrical devices, paving the way for electrically pumped perovskite lasers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Life&#8208;Cycle Assessment of Ti3C2Tx MXene Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A life&#8208;cycle assessment (LCA) of Ti3C2Tx MXene as an EMI&#8208;shielding coating is presented. MXene synthesis, including laboratory&#8208;scale systems and precursor generation utilizing TiO2, is examined for energy demand and environmental impacts. Findings demonstrate that laboratory electricity usage has the greatest impact on MXene production. Sustainable MXene synthesis toward the large&#8208;scale manufacturing of this intriguing 2D material is discussed.








Abstract
MXenes, 2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, have been investigated for diverse applications since their discovery; however, their life&#8208;cycle assessment (LCA) has not been studied. Here, a &#8220;cradle to gate&#8221; LCA is performed to assess the cumulative energy demand (CED) and environmental impacts of lab&#8208;scale synthesis of Ti3C2Tx, the most researched MXene composition. Electromagnetic interface (EMI) shielding is selected as it is one of MXenes' most promising applications and LCA of Ti3C2Tx synthesis is compared to aluminum and copper foils, two typical EMI&#8208;shielding materials. Two laboratory&#8208;scale MXene synthesis systems&#8212;gram and kilogram batches&#8212;are examined. The CED and environmental implications of Ti3C2Tx synthesis are investigated based on its precursor production, selective etching, delamination processes, laboratory location, energy mix, and raw material type. These&#160;results show that laboratory electricity usage for the synthesis processes accounts for &gt;70% of the environmental impacts. Manufacturing 1.0&#160;kg of industrial&#8208;scale aluminum and copper foil releases 23.0&#160;kg and 8.75&#160;kg of CO2, respectively, while 1.0&#160;kg of lab&#8208;scale MXene synthesis releases 428.10&#160;kg. Chemical usage is less impactful than electricity, which suggests that&#160;recycled resources and renewable energy can make MXene synthesis more sustainable. Understanding MXene LCA helps the industrialization of this material.

         <title>Surface Ligand Engineering Ruthenium Nanozyme Superior to Horseradish Peroxidase for Enhanced Immunoassay</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface modification can engineer charge transfer between Ru and ligands and facilitate intermediate radicals to react with colorimetric substrate, which significantly improves the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of Ru nanozymes superior to horseradish peroxidase. Following such a mechanism, polystyrene&#8208;sulfonate&#8208;modified Ru nanozymes can be used as an enzyme alternative in enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay to improve detection sensitivity up to 140&#8208;fold, validated with human alpha&#8208;fetoprotein.








Abstract
Nanozymes have great potential to be used as an alternative to natural enzymes in a variety of fields. However, low catalytic activity compared with natural enzymes limits their practical use. It is still challenging to design nanozymes comparable to their natural counterparts in terms of the specific activity. In this study, a surface engineering strategy is employed to improve the specific activity of Ru nanozymes using charge&#8208;transferrable ligands such as polystyrene sulfonate (PSS). PSS&#8208;modified Ru nanozyme exhibits a peroxidase&#8208;like specific activity of up to 2820&#160;U&#160;mg&#8722;1, which is twice that of horseradish peroxidase (1305&#160;U&#160;mg&#8722;1). Mechanism studies suggest that PSS readily accepts negative charge from Ru, thus reducing the affinity between Ru and &#183;OH. Importantly, the modified Ru&#8208;peroxidase&#160;nanozyme is successfully used to develop an immunoassay for human alpha&#8208;fetoprotein and achieves a 140&#8208;fold increase in detection sensitivity compared with traditional horseradish&#8208;peroxidase&#8208;based enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay. Therefore, this work provides a feasible route to design nanozymes with high specific activity that meets the practical use as an alternative to natural enzymes.

         <title>Gastrointestinal&#8208;Peristalsis&#8208;Inspired Hydrogel Actuators for NIR&#8208;Controlled Transport of Viscous Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the gastrointestinal peristalsis of mammals to propel viscous chyme (viscosity up to 2000 mPa s), a new type of double&#8208;layered tubular liquid actuators is designed and demonstrated. Under the control of applied NIR light, highly viscous liquids ranging from &#8776;1000 mPa s to &gt;80&#160;000 mPa s can be efficiently propelled to move directionally.








Abstract
Liquid transportation is fundamentally important in microfluidics, water collection, biosensing, and printing, and has attracted enormous research interest in the past decades. However, despite substantial progress, it remains a big challenge to achieve the controlled transport of viscous liquids (&gt;100 mPa s) commonly existing in daily life and the chemical industry. Inspired by the gastrointestinal peristalsis of mammalians that can efficiently transport viscous chyme (viscosity up to 2000 mPa s) by the synergistic combination of contraction driving force and lubrication, here, the design and construction of double&#8208;layered tubular hydrogel actuators for directional transport of highly viscous liquids ranging from &#8776;1000 mPa s to &gt;80&#160;000 mPa s under the control of an applied 808&#160;nm laser, which is attributed to the cooperation of outer layer contraction and water film lubrication of the inner layer, is reported. It is demonstrated that the actuators are capable of transporting polymerizing liquid whose viscosity significantly increases to &#8776;11&#160;182 mPa s in 2&#160;h. This work paves a new avenue toward directional transport of highly viscous liquids, which not only expands the research scope of liquid transportation, but will spur the design of new liquid actuators with potential applications in viscous&#8208;liquid&#8208;based microfluidics, artificial blood vessels, and soft robots.

         <title>Gate&#8208;Controlled Magnetotransport and Electrostatic Modulation of Magnetism in 2D Magnetic Semiconductor CrPS4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to its large bandwidth, we&#160;identify layered semiconducting antiferromagnet CrPS4 as an ideal candidate to realize field&#8208;effect transistors based on 2D magnetic materials. Low&#8208;temperature measurements exhibit a gate&#8208;tunable magnetoconductance exceeding 5000%, as well as the ability to continuously tune electrostatically the boundaries between different states in the magnetic phase diagram of the material.








Abstract
Using field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) to explore atomically thin magnetic semiconductors with transport measurements is difficult, because the very narrow bands of most 2D&#160;magnetic semiconductors cause carrier localization, preventing transistor operation. Here, it is shown that exfoliated layers of CrPS4&#8212;a 2D layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor whose bandwidth approaches 1&#160;eV&#8212;allow the realization of FETs that operate properly down to cryogenic temperature. Using these devices, conductance measurements as a function of temperature and magnetic field are performed to determine the full magnetic phase diagram, which includes a spin&#8208;flop and a spin&#8208;flip phase. The magnetoconductance, which&#160;depends strongly on gate voltage, is determined. reaching values as high as 5000% near the threshold for electron conduction. The gate voltage also allows the magnetic states to be tuned, despite the relatively large thickness of the CrPS4 multilayers employed in the study. The results show the need to employ 2D magnetic semiconductors with sufficiently large bandwidth to realize properly functioning transistors, and identify a candidate material to realize a fully gate&#8208;tunable half&#8208;metallic&#160;conductor.

An integrated free&#8208;standing functional carbon positive electrode (named MSCG) with a &#8220;point&#8208;line&#8208;plane&#8221; hierarchical architecture at the practical level of ultrahigh mass&#8208;loading (&gt;50 mg cm&#8211;2) is developed for dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs). The DIBs with ultrahigh&#8208;mass&#8208;loading MSCG electrodes achieves a high energy density of 379 Wh kg&#8211;1 based on the mass of electrode materials, which offers a promising strategy for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy&#8208;storage devices.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs) have been attracting great attention&#160;for the storage of stationary energy due to their low cost, environmental friendliness, and high working voltage. However, most reports on DIBs involve low&#8208;mass&#8208;loading electrodes (&lt;2.5&#160;mg), while the use of high mass&#8208;loading electrodes (&gt;10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2), which are critical for practical application, is overlooked. Herein, an integrated free&#8208;standing functional carbon positive electrode (named MSCG) with a &#8220;point&#8208;line&#8208;plane&#8221; hierarchical architecture at the practical level of ultrahigh mass&#8208;loading (&gt;50&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) is developed for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density DIBs. The rationally designed microstructure and the advanced assembly method that is adopted produce a well&#8208;interconnected ion/electron transport channel in the MSCG electrode, which confers rapid ion/electron kinetic properties while maintaining good mechanical properties. Consequently, the DIBs with ultrahigh&#8208;mass&#8208;loading MSCG electrodes exhibits a high discharge capacity of 100.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C (loading mass of 50&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and a long&#8208;term cycling performance with a capacity retention of 87.7% at 1 C after 500 cycles (loading mass of 23&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). Moreover, the DIB with the ultrahigh&#8208;mass&#8208;loading positive electrode achieves a high energy density of 379&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 based on the mass of electrode materials, the highest value recorded to date for any DIBs.

         <title>Pancreatic Tumor&#8208;Targeting Stemsome Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tumor&#8208;targeting strategy using stem cells without knowing the surface target receptors of the cancer cells is demonstrated for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, one of the intractable tumors that currently have no successful clinical strategy. The suggested promising strategy is especially effective for the treatment of other intractable tumors.








Abstract
Owing to the intrinsic ability of stem cells to target the tumor environment, stem&#8208;cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;functionalized nanocarriers can target and load active anticancer drugs. In this work, a strategy that focuses on stem cells that self&#8208;target pancreatic cancer cells is developed. In particular, malignant deep tumors such as pancreatic cancer cells, one of the intractable tumors that currently have no successful clinical strategy, are available for targeting and destruction. By gaining the targeting ability of stem cells against pancreatic tumor cells, stem cell membranes can encapsulate nano&#8208;polylactide&#8208;co&#8208;glycolide loaded with doxorubicin to target and reduce deep pancreatic tumor tissues. Considering the lack of known target proteins on pancreatic tumor cells, the suggested platform technology can be utilized for targeting any malignant tumors in which surface target receptors are unavailable.

         <title>Post&#8208;Maturation Reinforcement of 3D&#8208;Printed Vascularized Cardiac Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for reinforcing fully cellularized tissue is shown. Vascularized cardiac tissues are printed. Following tissue maturation, a biocompatible, tissue&#8208;penetrating small&#8208;molecule is deployed to generate significant improvement in the tissue's mechanical properties.








Abstract
Despite advances in biomaterials engineering, a large gap remains between the weak mechanical properties that can be achieved with natural materials and the strength of synthetic materials. Here, a method is presented for reinforcing an engineered cardiac tissue fabricated from differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and an extracellular matrix (ECM)&#8208;based hydrogel in a manner that is fully biocompatible. The reinforcement occurs as a post&#8208;fabrication step, which allows for the use of 3D&#8208;printing technology to generate thick, fully cellularized, and vascularized cardiac tissues. After tissue assembly and during the maturation process in a soft hydrogel, a small, tissue&#8208;penetrating reinforcer is deployed, leading to a significant increase in the tissue's mechanical properties. The tissue's robustness is demonstrated by injecting the tissue in a simulated minimally invasive procedure and showing that the tissue is functional and undamaged at the nano&#8208;, micro&#8208;, and macroscales.

         <title>Coexistence of Both Localized Electronic States and Electron Gas at Rutile TiO2 Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;mobility electrons and localized electronic states can coexist at rutile TiO2 surfaces as induced through argon&#8208;ion irradiation. Specifically, the localized states form robust shallow in&#8208;gap states, leading to an exotic metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition when cooling below a critical temperature. Furthermore, the localized states can be reactivated into free electrons through thermal heating or with external electric fields.








Abstract
Localized electron polarons formed through the coupling of excess electrons and ionic vibrations play a key role in the functionalities of materials. However, the mechanism of the coexistence of delocalized electrons and localized polarons remains underexplored. Here, the discovery of high&#8208;mobility 2D electron gas at the rutile TiO2 surfaces through argon ion irradiation induced oxygen vacancies is reported. Strikingly, the electron gas forms localized electronic states at lower temperatures, resulting in an abrupt metal&#8211;insulator transition. Moreover, it is found that the low&#8208;temperature conductivity in the insulating state is dominated by excess free electrons with a high mobility of &#8776;103 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, whereas the carrier density is dramatically suppressed with decreasing temperature. Remarkably, it reveals that the application of an electric field can lead to a collapse of the localized states, resulting in a metallic state. These results reveal the strongly correlated/coupled nature between the localized electrons and high&#8208;mobility electrons and offer a new pathway to probe and harvest the exotic electron states at the complex oxide surfaces.

         <title>Supramolecular Ionogels Tougher than Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrastrong and superstretchable ionogels tougher than that of metals are produced through the synergy of force&#8208;induced crystallization and halometallate ionic liquid created supramolecular ionic networks. The prepared ionogels with environmental applicability and sustainability are expected to replace lightweight high&#8208;strength materials, such as plastics and rubbers in the applications of aerospace, robotics, and other fields.








Abstract
Common natural and synthetic high&#8208;strength materials (such as rubber, plastics, ceramics, and metals) undergo the occurrence of poor deformability. Achieving high strength and large deformation simultaneously is a huge challenge. Herein, high&#8208;strength ionogels are developed through the synergy of force&#8208;induced crystallization and halometallate ionic liquid created supramolecular ionic networks. The prepared poly(vinyl alcohol)/halometallate ionic liquid ionogels show excellent mechanical properties, including ultimate fracture stress (63.1&#160;&#177;&#160;2.1&#160;MPa), strain (5248&#160;&#177;&#160;113%), and unprecedented toughness (1947&#160;&#177;&#160;52&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), which is much higher than that of most metals and alloys. Furthermore, the ionogels can achieve reversibility by water to realize green recovery and restoration of damaged mechanical properties.

         <title>Quantum Size Effect to Induce Colossal High&#8208;Temperature Energy Storage Density and Efficiency in Polymer/Inorganic Cluster Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quantum size effect is utilized to modulate the band structure of aluminum oxide clusters. Based on the &#8220;site isolation&#8221; strategy, a polymer/aluminum oxide cluster composite with uniform dispersion of the inorganic phase is prepared with one&#8208;pot synthesis, which exhibits a colossal storage energy density of 6.8&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and ultrahigh efficiency over 95% at 200&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics need to operate at high temperatures to meet the demand of electrostatic energy storage in modern electronic and electrical systems. The polymer nanocomposite approach, an extensively proved strategy for performance improvement, encounters a bottleneck of reduced energy density and poor discharge efficiency beyond 150&#160;&#176;C. In this work, a polymer/metal oxide cluster composite prepared based on the &#8220;site isolation&#8221; strategy is reported. Capitalizing on the quantum size effect, the bandgap and surface defect states of the ultrasmall inorganic clusters (2.2&#160;nm diameter) are modulated to markedly differ from regular&#8208;sized nanoparticles. Experimental results in conjunction with computational simulation demonstrate that the presence of ultrasmall inorganic clusters can introduce more abundant, deeper traps in the composite dielectric with respect to conventional polymer/nanoparticle blends. Unprecedented high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance, including colossal energy density (6.8&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3), ultrahigh discharge efficiency (95%) and superior stability at different electric field frequencies, are achieved in these polymer/cluster composites up to 200&#160;&#176;C. Along with the advantages in material preparation (inexpensive precursors and one&#8208;pot synthesis), such polymer/inorganic cluster composite approach is promising for high&#8208;temperature dielectric energy storage in practical power apparatus and electronic devices.

         <title>Probing the N&#233;el&#8208;Type Antiferromagnetic Order and Coherent Magnon&#8211;Exciton Coupling in Van Der Waals VPS3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#233;el&#8208;type AFM order of the VPS3 can break both spatial&#8208;inversion and time&#8208;reversal symmetries, which is verified by the magnetic&#8208;order&#8208;dependent second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG). Accordingly, The SHG intensity shows a close correlation with the N&#233;el&#8208;type magnetic order under varying temperatures, and an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin orientation can be further determined based on the specific six&#8208;fold symmetry.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnets have received intensive attention due to their terahertz resonance, multilevel magnetic&#8208;order states, and ultrafast spin dynamics. However, accurately identifying their magnetic configuration still remains a challenge owing to the lack of net magnetization and insensitivity to external fields. In this work, the N&#233;el&#8208;type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order in 2D antiferromagnet VPS3 with the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane anisotropy, which is demonstrated by the temperature&#8208;dependent spin&#8211;phonon coupling and second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), is experimentally probed. This long&#8208;range AFM order even persists at the ultrathin limit. Furthermore, strong interlayer exciton&#8211;magnon coupling (EMC) upon the N&#233;el&#8208;type AFM order is detected based on the monolayer WSe2/VPS3 heterostructure, which induces an enhanced excitonic state and further certifies the N&#233;el&#8208;type AFM order of VPS3. The discovery provides optical routes as the novel platform to study 2D antiferromagnets and promotes their potential applications in magneto&#8208;optics and opto&#8208;spintronic devices.

         <title>Hairy&#8208;Skin&#8208;Adaptive Viscoelastic Dry Electrodes for Long&#8208;Term Electrophysiological Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hairy&#8208;skin&#8208;adaptive viscoelastic dry electrode (VDE) with semiflowable, adhesive, moldable, stretchable, self&#8208;healing, and recyclable properties is prepared. The VDE fills skin wrinkles, bypasses hair, and shields against hair disturbance and strain&#8208;related motion artifacts, achieving stable electrocardiography monitoring with intense chest expansion, electromyography monitoring at large strain, and convenient electroencephalography monitoring.








Abstract
Long&#8208;term epidermal electrophysiological (EP) monitoring is crucial for disease diagnosis and human&#8211;machine synergy. The human skin is covered with hair that grows at an average rate of 0.3&#160;mm per day. This impedes a stable contact between the skin and dry epidermal electrodes, resulting in motion artifacts during ultralong&#8208;term EP monitoring. Therefore, accurate and high&#8208;quality EP signal detection remains challenging. To address this issue, a new solution&#8212;the hairy&#8208;skin&#8208;adaptive viscoelastic dry electrode (VDE) is reported. This innovative technology is capable of bypassing hair and filling into the skin wrinkles, leading to long&#8208;lasting and stable interface impedance. The VDE maintains a stable interface impedance for a remarkable period of 48 days and 100 cycles. The VDE is highly effective in shielding against hair disturbances in electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring, even during intense chest expansion, and in electromyography (EMG) monitoring during large strain. Furthermore, the VDE is easily attachable to the skull without requiring any electroencephalogram (EEG) cap or bandage, making it an ideal solution for EEG monitoring. This work represents a substantial breakthrough in the field of EP monitoring, providing a solution for the previously challenging issue of monitoring human EP signals on hairy skin.

         <title>Covalently Functionalized Leakage&#8208;Free Healable Phase&#8208;Change Interface Materials with Extraordinary High&#8208;Thermal Conductivity and Low&#8208;Thermal Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalently functionalized leakage&#8208;free phase&#8208;change thermal interface material is synthesized. The hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;forming functional groups enable a nearly perfect healing efficiency and recyclability. Elaborately designed multiwalled carbon nanotubes decorated with silver nanoparticles bridge silver&#8208;flake islands, resulting in extraordinary high thermal conductivity (43.4&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1) and low total thermal resistance (30.5&#160;mm2&#160;K W&#8722;1) for phase&#8208;change thermal interface materials.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) have received considerable attention to take advantage of both pad&#8208;type and grease&#8208;type thermal interface materials (TIMs). However, the critical drawbacks of leaking, non&#8208;recyclability, and low thermal conductivity (&#954;) hinder industrial applications of PCM TIMs. Here, leakage&#8208;free healable PCM TIMs with extraordinarily high &#954; and low total thermal resistance (Rt) are reported. The matrix material (OP) is synthesized by covalently functionalizing octadecanol PCM with polyethylene&#8208;co&#8208;methyl acrylate&#8208;co&#8208;glycidyl methacrylate polymer through the nucleophilic epoxy ring opening reaction. The OP changes from semicrystalline to amorphous above the phase&#8208;transition temperature, preventing leaking. The hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;forming functional groups in OP enable nearly perfect healing efficiencies in tensile strength (99.7%), &#954; (97.0%), and Rt (97.4%). Elaborately designed thermally conductive fillers, silver&#160;flakes&#160;and multiwalled carbon nanotubes decorated with silver nanoparticles (nAgMWNTs), are additionally introduced in the OP matrix (OP&#8208;Ag&#8208;nAgMWNT). The nAgMWNTs bridge silver&#8208;flake islands, resulting in extraordinarily high &#954; (43.4&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1) and low Rt (30.5&#160;mm2&#160;K W&#8722;1) compared with PCM TIMs in the literature. Excellent heat dissipation and recycling demonstration of the OP&#8208;Ag&#8208;nAgMWNT is also carried out using a computer graphic processing unit. The OP&#8208;Ag&#8208;nAgMWNT is a promising future TIM for thermal management of mechanical and electrical devices.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrostatic&#8208;attraction&#8208;driven&#160;carrier&#8208;free siRNA delivery nanoparticle (siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs) is designed by grafting cationic sulfur&#8208;substituted Nile Blue photosensitizer onto deblock PLK1 siRNA strands. The siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs exhibit rapid cellular uptake, efficient lysosome escape, and outstanding tumor&#8208;targeting ability.

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) holds immense promise for suppressing gene expression and treating various life&#8208;threatening diseases, including cancer. However, efficient delivery and lysosomal escape remain critical challenges that hinder the therapeutic effectiveness of siRNA. Herein, cationic photosensitizer (NB&#8208;Br) is grafted onto polo&#8208;like kinase 1 (PLK1) siRNA to form an amphiphilic siRNA&#8208;photosensitizer conjugate (siPLK1&#8208;NB), which can self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles (siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs) via electrostatic attraction. Notably, siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs exhibit rapid and efficient cell endocytosis, as well as outstanding tumor&#8208;targeting property in multiple tumor&#8208;bearing mice models. When siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs are located inside tumor cell lysosomes, the generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) after photoactivation can disrupt the lysosome membrane structure and facilitate siRNA escape from lysosomes. Under light irradiation, siPLK1&#8208;NB NPs can downregulate PLK1 expression and induce photodynamic killing, effectively inhibiting tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Consequently, this study provides a novel design strategy for carrier&#8208;free siRNA delivery systems. As far as it is known, this is the first report of a carrier&#8208;free siRNA delivery system based on electrostatic attraction.

&lt;p&gt;An electrostatic-attraction-driven&#160;carrier-free siRNA delivery nanoparticle (siPLK1-NB NPs) is designed by grafting cationic sulfur-substituted Nile Blue photosensitizer onto deblock PLK1 siRNA strands. The siPLK1-NB NPs exhibit rapid cellular uptake, efficient lysosome escape, and outstanding tumor-targeting ability. Moreover, the siPLK1-NB NPs can effectively suppress the target PLK1 gene, achieving RNAi and PDT synergistic cancer treatment.

         <title>Fabrication of Single&#8208;Crystalline CoCrFeNi Thin Films by DC Magnetron Sputtering: A Route to Surface Studies of High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>

Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) with their almost limitless number of possible compositions have raised widespread attention in material science. Next to wear and corrosion resistive coatings, their application as tunable electrocatalysts has recently moved into the focus. On the other hand, fundamental properties of HEA surfaces like atomic and electronic structure, surface segregation and diffusion as well as adsorption on HEA surfaces are barely explored. The lack of research is caused by the limited availability of single&#8208;crystalline samples. In the present work, the epitaxial growth of face centered cubic (fcc) CoCrFeNi films on MgO(100) is reported. Their characterisation by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrates that the layers with a homogeneous and close to equimolar elemental composition are oriented in [100] direction and aligned with the substrate to which they form an abrupt interface. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low&#8208;energy electron diffraction (LEED) and angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy are employed to study chemical composition and atomic and electronic structure of CoCrFeNi(100). It is demonstrated that epitaxially grown HEA films have the potential to fill the sample gap, allowing for fundamental studies of properties of and processes on well&#8208;defined HEA surfaces over the full compositional&#160;space.

         <title>Induction of Metabolic Reprogramming in Kidney by Singlet Diradical Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic compounds with an open&#8208;shell singlet diradical ground state, namely singlet diradicals, have recently gained attention in the fields of organic electronics, photovoltaics, and spintronics owing to their unique electronic structures and properties. Notably, singlet diradicals exhibit tunable redox amphoterism, which makes them excellent redox&#8208;active materials for biomedical applications. However, the safety and therapeutic efficacy of singlet diradicals in biological systems have not yet been explored. Herein, we present a newly designed singlet diradical nanomaterial, diphenyl&#8208;substituted biolympicenylidene (BO&#8208;Ph), exhibiting low cytotoxicity in vitro, non&#8208;significant acute nephrotoxicity in vivo, and the ability to induce metabolic reprogramming in kidney organoids. Integrated transcriptome and metabolome analyses reveal that the metabolism of BO&#8208;Ph stimulates glutathione synthesis and fatty acid degradation, increases the levels of intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid and carnitine cycles, and eventually boosts oxidative phosphorylation under redox homeostasis. Benefits of BO&#8208;Ph&#8208;induced metabolic reprogramming in kidney organoids include enhanced cellular antioxidant capacity and promoted mitochondrial function. The results of this study can facilitate the application of singlet diradical materials in the treatment of clinical conditions induced by mitochondrial abnormalities in kidney.

         <title>Mn&#8208;Oxygen Compounds Coordinated Ruthenium Sites with Deprotonated and Low Oxophilic Microenvironments for Membrane Electrolyzer&#8208;based H2&#8208;Production</title>

Abstract
Among the platinum&#8208;group metals, ruthenium (Ru), with a low water dissociation energy, has been considered a promising alternative to substitute Pt for catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, optimizing the adsorption/desorption energies of H* and OH* intermediates on Ru catalytic sites is extremely desirable but remains challenging. Inspired by the natural catalytic characteristics of Mn&#8208;oxygen complex, we report to design Mn&#8208;oxygen compounds coordinated Ru sites (MOC&#8208;Ru) with deprotonated and low oxophilic microenvironments for modulating the adsorption/desorption of H* and OH* to promote HER kinetics. Benefiting from the unique advantages of MOC structures, including weakened H&#8208;OH bond at interface, electron donation ability, and deprotonation capability, the MOC&#8208;Ru exhibits extremely low overpotential and ultralong stability in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Experimental observations and theoretical calculations elucidate that the MOC can accelerate water dissociation kinetics and promote OH* desorption in alkaline conditions, and trigger the long&#8208;range H* spillover for H2&#8208;release in acid conditions. The outstanding activity and stability of membrane electrolyzer display that the MOC&#8208;Ru catalyst holds great potential as cathode for H2&#8208;production. This study provides essential insights into the crucial roles of deprotonated and low oxophilic microenvironments in HER catalysis and offers new pathway to create efficient water&#8208;splitting cathode.

         <title>Meta&#8208;Aerogel Ion Motor for Nanofluid Osmotic Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Osmotic power, also known as &#8220;blue energy&#8221;, is a vast, sustainable and clean energy source that can be directly converted into electricity by nanofluidic membranes. However, the key technological bottleneck for large&#8208;scale osmotic electricity is that macroscopic&#8208;scale bulky membranes cannot synergistically satisfy the demands of high power density and low resistance without sacrificing scalability and mechanical robustness. Here, inspired by the anatomy and working principle of electric eels, which harness osmotic energy through embedded neuron&#8208;mediated fibril nanochannels with nanoconfined transport dynamics. We engineer fibrous nanofluidic meta&#8208;aerogel ion motors, 3D&#8208;assembled from nanofluidic cable fibers with actuatable stimulation/transport &#8220;ion highways&#8221;. The meta&#8208;aerogel exhibits the integrated coupling effect of boosted ion propulsion and surface&#8208;charge&#8208;dominated selective ion transport. Driven by osmosis, the meta&#8208;aerogel ion motor can produce an unprecedented output power density of up to 30.7&#160;W m&#8722;2 under a 50&#8208;fold salinity gradient. Advancing ultra&#8208;selective ion transport in nanofluidic meta&#8208;aerogels may provide a promising roadmap for blue energy harvesting.

         <title>Exchange&#8208;Interaction&#8208;Like Behavior in Ferroelectric Bilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Interlayer coupling in materials, such as exchange interactions at the interface between an antiferromagnet and a ferromagnet, can produce exotic phenomena not present in the parent materials. While such interfacial coupling in magnetic systems has been widely studied, there is considerably less work on analogous electric counterparts (i.e., akin to electric &#8220;exchange&#8208;bias&#8208;like&#8221; or &#8220;exchange&#8208;spring&#8208;like&#8221; interactions between two polar materials) despite the likelihood that such effects could also engender new features associated with anisotropic electric dipole alignment. Here, electric analogs of such exchange interactions are reported, and their physical origins are explained for bilayers of in&#8208;plane polarized Pb1&#8208;xSrxTiO3 ferroelectrics. Variation of the strontium content and thickness of the layers provides for deterministic control over the switching properties of the bilayer system resulting in phenomena analogous to an exchange&#8208;spring interaction and, leveraging added control of these interactions with an electric field, the ability to realize multistate&#8208;memory function. Such observations not only hold technological promise for ferroelectrics and multiferroics, but also extend the similarities between ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials to include the manifestation of exchange&#8208;interaction&#8208;like phenomena.

         <title>Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction: Ammonia Synthesis and the Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Natural nitrogen cycle has been severely disrupted by anthropogenic activities. The overuse of N&#8208;containing fertilizers induces the increase of nitrate level in surface and ground waters, and substantial emission of nitrogen oxides causes heavy air pollution. Nitrogen gas, as the main component of air, has been used for mass ammonia production for over a century, providing enough nutrition for agriculture to support world population increase. In the last decade, researchers have made great efforts to develop ammonia processes under ambient conditions to combat the intensive energy consumption and high carbon emission associated with the Haber&#8208;Bosch process. Among different techniques, electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) can achieve nitrate removal and ammonia generation simultaneously using renewable electricity as the power, and there is an exponential growth of studies in this research direction. Here we provide a timely and comprehensive review on the important progresses of electrochemical NO3RR, covering the rational design of electrocatalysts, emerging C&#8208;N coupling reactions, and advanced energy conversion and storage systems. Moreover, future perspectives are proposed to accelerate the industrialized NH3 production and green synthesis of chemicals, leading to a sustainable nitrogen cycle via prosperous N&#8208;based electrochemistry.

&lt;p&gt;Natural nitrogen cycle has been severely disrupted by anthropogenic activities. The overuse of N-containing fertilizers induces the increase of nitrate level in surface and ground waters, and substantial emission of nitrogen oxides causes heavy air pollution. Nitrogen gas, as the main component of air, has been used for mass ammonia production for over a century, providing enough nutrition for agriculture to support world population increase. In the last decade, researchers have made great efforts to develop ammonia processes under ambient conditions to combat the intensive energy consumption and high carbon emission associated with the Haber-Bosch process. Among different techniques, electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR) can achieve nitrate removal and ammonia generation simultaneously using renewable electricity as the power, and there is an exponential growth of studies in this research direction. Here we provide a timely and comprehensive review on the important progresses of electrochemical NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR, covering the rational design of electrocatalysts, emerging C-N coupling reactions, and advanced energy conversion and storage systems.

         <title>Templated 2D Polymer Heterojunctions for Improved Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D polymer heterojunctions are formed using a novel templating technique and are investigated as photocatalysts for proton reduction. Templated materials showed improved charge separation and reduced trapped charges at the donor&#8211;acceptor interface, which results in hydrogen evolution rates of 3&#8211;9 times that of either individual semiconductor and the ability to produce hydrogen in combination with the oxidation of reversible redox mediators, as well as sacrificial electron donors.








Abstract
2D polymers have emerged as one of the most promising classes of organic photocatalysts for solar fuel production due to their tunability, charge&#8208;transport properties, and robustness. They are&#160;however&#160;difficult to process and so there are limited studies into the formation of heterojunction materials incorporating these components. In this work, a novel templating approach is used to combine an imine&#8208;based donor polymer and an acceptor polymer formed through Knoevenagel condensation. Heterojunction formation is shown to be highly dependent on the topological match of the donor and acceptor polymers with the most active templated material found to be between three and nine times more active for photocatalysis than its constituent components. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that this improvement is due to faster charge separation and more efficient charge extraction in the templated heterojunction. The templated material shows a very high hydrogen evolution rate of &gt;20&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 m&#8722;2 with an ascorbic acid hole scavenger but also produces hydrogen in the presence of only water and a cobalt&#8208;based redox mediator. This suggests&#160;the improved charge&#8208;separation interface and reduced trapping accessed through this approach could be suitable for Z&#8208;scheme formation.

         <title>The Readiness of Water Molecules to Split into Hydrogen + Oxygen: A Proposed New Aspect of Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of dioxane to water leads to a significant blueshift in the frequency of the O&#63743;H stretch vibration derived from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) experiments, which is indicative of increased O&#63743;H bond strength (intramolecular bonding). This phenomenon is accompanied by a significant increase in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) onset potential. Structural&#8211;molecular realities of H2O are hereby linked to a key parameter of water electrolysis.








Abstract
The potential of the anode, at which the evolution of oxygen begins, is a key parameter that describes how well water is split in water electrolyzers. Research efforts related to electrocatalytically initiated water splitting that aim at reducing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential to date focus on the optimization of materials used to produce the electrodes. Descriptors for the readiness of the H2O molecule itself to break down into its components have not been considered in water electrolysis experiments so far. In a simple set of experiments, it is found that adding dioxane to aqueous solutions leads to a substantial blueshift of the frequency of the O&#63743;H stretch vibration which is a sign of an increased strength of the O&#63743;H bond (intramolecular bonding). This phenomenon coincides with a significant increase in the OER onset potential as derived from cyclic voltammetry experiments. Thus, the O&#63743;H stretch frequency can be an ideal indicator for the readiness of water molecules to be split in its cleavage products. This is thought to be first example of a study into the relationship between structural features of water as derived from Fourier transform infrared&#160;(FTIR) spectroscopic studies and key results derived from water electrolysis experiments.

         <title>Dry&#8208;Transferrable Photoresist Enabled Reliable Conformal Patterning for Ultrathin Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Photolithographic techniques, which are widely used in the silicon&#8208;based semiconductor industry, enable the manufacture of high&#8208;yield and high&#8208;resolution features at the micrometer and nanometer scale. However, conventional photolithographic processes cannot accommodate the micro/nanofabrication of flexible and stretchable electronics. In this study, a microfabrication approach that uses a synthesized environmentally friendly and dry&#8208;transferrable photoresist to enable the reliable conformal manufacturing of thin&#8208;film electronics is reported, which is also compatible with the existing cleanroom processes. Photoresists with high&#8208;resolution, high&#8208;density, and multiscale patterns can be transferred onto various substrates in a defect&#8208;free and conformal&#8208;contact manner, thus enabling multiple wafer reuses. Theoretical studies are conducted to investigate the damage&#8208;free peel&#8208;off mechanism of the proposed approach. The in situ fabrication of various electrical components, including ultralight and ultrathin biopotential electrodes, has been demonstrated, which offer lower interfacial impedance, durability, and stability, and the components are applied to collect electromyography signals with superior signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and quality. Additionally, an exemplary demonstration of a human&#8208;machine interface indicates the potential of these electrodes in many emerging applications, including healthcare, sensing, and artificial intelligence.

         <title>Aerosol&#8208;Jet&#8208;Printable Covalent Organic Framework Colloidal Inks and Temperature&#8208;Sensitive Nanocomposite Films</title>

Abstract
With molecularly well&#8208;defined and tailorable two&#8208;dimensional structures, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as leading material candidates for diverse applications including chemical sensing, storage, separation, and catalysis. In many of these contexts, the ability to directly and deterministically print COFs into arbitrary geometries would enable rapid optimization and deployment. However, previous attempts to print COFs have been restricted by low spatial resolution and/or post&#8208;deposition polymerization that complicates processing or limits the range of compatible COFs. Here, we overcome these limitations with a pre&#8208;synthesized, solution&#8208;processable colloidal ink that enables aerosol jet printing of COFs with micron&#8208;scale resolution. A key component of the ink formulation is the low&#8208;volatility solvent benzonitrile, which is critical to obtaining homogeneous printed COF film morphologies. The ink formulation is also compatible with other colloidal nanomaterials, thus facilitating the integration of COFs into printable nanocomposite films. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, boronate&#8208;ester COFs are integrated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to form printable COF&#8208;CNT nanocomposite films, in which the CNTs enhance charge transport and the temperature sensing performance of the COFs. In particular, the printed COF&#8208;CNT nanocomposite films show high in&#8208;plane COF crystallinity and exhibit tunable electrical conductivity as a function of CNT loading, COF pore size, and temperature, ultimately resulting in high&#8208;sensitivity temperature sensors that show electrical conductivity variation by 4 orders of magnitude between room temperature and 300&#176;C. Overall, this work establishes a flexible platform for COF additive manufacturing that can accelerate the incorporation of COFs into technologically significant applications.

Abstract
Cancer stem&#8208;like cells (CSCs), capable of indefinite self&#8208;renewal and differentiation, are considered to be the root cause of tumor radiotherapy (RT) resistance. However, the CSCs&#8208;targeted therapy still remains to be a great challenge because they are commonly located in the deep tumor making drugs hard to approach, and their hypoxic and acidic niche can further aggravate radioresistance. Herein, based on our finding that hypoxic CSCs highly express carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) on the cell membrane, a CAIX&#8208;targeted induced in situ self&#8208;assembly system on the surface of CSC is reported to overcome hypoxic CSC&#8208;mediated radioresistance. Via the sequential processes of &#8220;monomer release&#8208;target accumulation&#8208;surface self&#8208;assembly,&#8221; the constructed peptide&#8208;based drug delivery system (CA&#8208;Pt) exhibits the advantages of deep penetration, amplified CAIX inhibition, and enhanced cellular uptake, which greatly relieves the hypoxic and acidic microenvironment to promote the hypoxic CSC differentiation and combines with platinum to boost the RT&#8208;inducing DNA damage. In both lung cancer tumor mouse and zebrafish embryo models, CA&#8208;Pt treatment can effectively assist RT in suppressing tumor growth and preventing tumor invasion and metastasis. This study used a surface&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy to differentiate hypoxic CSCs, which may provide a universal treatment strategy for overcoming tumor radioresistance.

         <title>Localized Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Delivery of miR&#8208;29b Normalizes the Dysregulation of Bone Homeostasis Caused by Osteosarcoma whilst Simultaneously Inhibiting Tumor Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formulation of miR&#8208;29b:nanoparticles is developed that is delivered via a hyaluronic&#8208;based hydrogel to enable local and sustained release of the therapy and to study the potential of attenuating tumor growth whilst normalizing bone homeostasis. It is found that when miR&#8208;29b is delivered, compared to chemotherapy alone, the therapy provided a significant decrease in tumor burden, an increase in mouse survival, and a significant decrease in osteolysis caused by the tumor.








Abstract
Patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma undergo extensive surgical intervention and chemotherapy resulting in dismal prognosis and compromised quality of life owing to poor bone regeneration, which is further compromised with chemotherapy delivery. This study aims to investigate if localized delivery of miR&#8208;29b&#8212;which is shown to promote bone formation by inducing osteoblast differentiation and also to suppress prostate and cervical&#160;tumor growth&#8212;can suppress osteosarcoma tumors whilst simultaneously normalizing the dysregulation of bone homeostasis caused by osteosarcoma. Thus, the therapeutic potential of microRNA (miR)&#8208;29b is studied to promote bone remodeling in an orthotopic model of osteosarcoma (rather than in bone defect models using healthy mice), and in the context of chemotherapy, that is clinically relevant. A formulation of miR&#8208;29b:nanoparticles are developed that are delivered via a hyaluronic&#8208;based hydrogel to enable local and sustained release of the therapy and to study the potential of attenuating tumor growth whilst normalizing bone homeostasis. It is found that when miR&#8208;29b is delivered along with systemic chemotherapy, compared to chemotherapy alone, the therapy provided a significant decrease in tumor burden, an increase in mouse survival, and a significant decrease in osteolysis thereby normalizing the dysregulation of bone lysis activity caused by the tumor.

         <title>Emergent Ferroelectric Switching Behavior from Polar Vortex Lattice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Within the polar vortex lattice, low&#8208;field metastable switching events are demonstrated in coexistence with classical ferroelectric bi&#8208;stability. By changing the poled state of the vortex lattice one can tune the anisotropy of these low&#8208;field hysteresis loops, allowing for a novel method of non&#8208;destructive readout of the poled state with a simple in&#8208;plane capacitor.








Abstract
Topologically protected polar textures have provided a rich playground for the exploration of novel, emergent phenomena. Recent discoveries indicate that ferroelectric vortices and skyrmions not only host properties markedly different from traditional ferroelectrics, but also that these properties can be harnessed for unique memory devices. Using a combination of capacitor&#8208;based capacitance measurements and computational models, it is demonstrated that polar vortices in dielectric&#8211;ferroelectric&#8211;dielectric trilayers exhibit classical ferroelectric bi&#8208;stability together with the existence of low&#8208;field metastable polarization states. This behavior is directly tied to the in&#8208;plane vortex ordering, and it is shown that it can be used as a new method of non&#8208;destructive readout&#8208;out of the poled state.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Scale Structure Engineering of ZnSnO3 for Ultra&#8208;Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concept of multi&#8208;scale (electronic&#8208;crystal&#8208;geometric) structure design is proposed to develop the hollow amorphous ZnSnO3 cubes (HZTO) for optimizing Zn metal anodes. The as&#8208;prepared HZTO@Zn with high hydrogen evolution barrier, abundant zincophilic sites, and rapid Zn2+ migration can achieve dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition and ultra&#8208;long cycling over 6900 h.








Abstract
Suppressing the severe water&#8208;induced side reactions and uncontrolled dendrite growth of zinc (Zn) metal anodes is crucial for aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries to achieve ultra&#8208;long cyclic lifespans and promote their practical applications. Herein, a concept of multi&#8208;scale (electronic&#8208;crystal&#8208;geometric) structure design is proposed to precisely construct the hollow amorphous ZnSnO3 cubes (HZTO) for optimizing Zn metal anodes. In situ gas chromatography demonstrates that Zn anodes modified by HZTO (HZTO@Zn) can effectively inhibit the undesired hydrogen evolution. The pH stabilization and corrosion suppression mechanisms are revealed via operando pH detection and in situ Raman analysis. Moreover, comprehensive experimental and theoretical results prove that the amorphous structure and hollow architecture endow the protective HZTO layer with strong Zn affinity and rapid Zn2+ diffusion, which are beneficial for achieving the ideal dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode. Accordingly, excellent electrochemical performances for the HZTO@Zn symmetric battery (6900&#160;h at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 100&#160;times longer than that of bare Zn), HZTO@Zn||V2O5 full battery (99.3% capacity retention after 1100&#160;cycles), and HZTO@Zn||V2O5 pouch cell (120.6 Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 at 1 A&#160;g&#8722;1) are achieved. This work with multi&#8208;scale structure design provides significant guidance to rationally develop advanced protective layers for other ultra&#8208;long&#8208;life metal batteries.

         <title>Generation of 13.9&#8208;mJ Terahertz Radiation from Lithium Niobate Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of single&#8208;cycle 13.9&#8208;mJ extreme terahertz pulses from cryogenically cooled lithium niobate crystals and 1.2% energy conversion efficiency from 800&#160;nm to terahertz are demonstrated experimentally using the tilted pulse front technique driven by a home&#8208;built 30&#8208;fs, 1.2&#8208;Joule Ti:sapphire laser amplifier. The focused peak electric field strength&#160;was&#160;estimated to be 7.5&#160;MV&#160;cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Extremely strong&#8208;field terahertz (THz) radiation in free space has compelling applications in nonequilibrium condensed matter state regulation, all&#8208;optical THz electron acceleration and manipulation, THz biological effects, etc. However, these practical applications are constrained by the absence of high&#8208;intensity, high&#8208;efficiency, high&#8208;beam&#8208;quality, and stable solid&#8208;state THz light sources. Here, the generation of single&#8208;cycle 13.9&#8208;mJ extreme THz pulses from cryogenically cooled lithium niobate crystals and a 1.2% energy conversion efficiency from 800&#160;nm to THz are demonstrated experimentally using the tilted pulse&#8208;front technique driven by a home&#8208;built 30&#8208;fs, 1.2&#8208;Joule Ti:sapphire laser amplifier. The focused peak electric field strength is estimated to be 7.5&#160;MV&#160;cm&#8722;1. A record of 1.1&#8208;mJ THz single&#8208;pulse energy at a 450 mJ pump at room temperature is produced and observed that the self&#8208;phase modulation of the optical pump can induce THz saturation behavior from the crystals in the substantially nonlinear pump regime. This study lays the foundation for the generation of sub&#8208;Joule THz radiation from lithium niobate crystals and will inspire more innovations in extreme THz science and applications.

&lt;p&gt;Extremely strong-field terahertz (THz) radiation in free space has compelling applications in nonequilibrium condensed matter state regulation, all-optical THz electron acceleration and manipulation, THz biological effects, etc. However, these practical applications are constrained by the absence of high-intensity, high-efficiency, high-beam-quality, and stable solid-state THz light sources. Here, the generation of single-cycle 13.9-mJ extreme THz pulses from cryogenically cooled lithium niobate crystals and a 1.2% energy conversion efficiency from 800&#160;nm to THz are demonstrated experimentally using the tilted pulse-front technique driven by a home-built 30-fs, 1.2-Joule Ti:sapphire laser amplifier. The focused peak electric field strength is estimated to be 7.5&#160;MV&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. A record of 1.1-mJ THz single-pulse energy at a 450 mJ pump at room temperature is produced and observed that the self-phase modulation of the optical pump can induce THz saturation behavior from the crystals in the substantially nonlinear pump regime. This study lays the foundation for the generation of sub-Joule THz radiation from lithium niobate crystals and will inspire more innovations in extreme THz science and applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monolithic Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Energy&#8208;Efficient Water Adsorption Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolithic zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (UiO&#8208;66, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 and Zr&#8208;fumarate) with high density and exceptional water sorption capacity are developed to replace traditional refrigeration systems with energy&#8208;efficient alternatives. The adsorption characteristics of monolithic materials have been predicted using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and lattice&#8208;gas models. Unlike traditional MOFs, these monolithic MOFs have overcome processing issues, making them suitable for real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
Space cooling and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) accounts for roughly 10% of global electricity use and are responsible for ca. 1.13 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions annually. Adsorbent&#8208;based HVAC technologies have long been touted as an energy&#8208;efficient alternative to traditional refrigeration systems. However, thus far, no suitable adsorbents have been developed which overcome the drawbacks associated with traditional sorbent materials such as silica gels and zeolites. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude improvements in water adsorption and regeneration energy requirements. However, the deployment of MOFs in HVAC applications has been hampered by issues related to MOF powder processing. Herein, three high&#8208;density, shaped, monolithic MOFs (UiO&#8208;66, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, and Zr&#8208;fumarate) with exceptional volumetric gas/vapor uptake are developed&#8212;solving previous issues in MOF&#8208;HVAC deployment. The monolithic structures across the mesoporous range are visualized using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and lattice&#8208;gas models, giving accurate predictions of adsorption characteristics of the monolithic materials. It is also demonstrated that a fragile MOF such as Zr&#8208;fumarate can be synthesized in monolithic form with a bulk density of 0.76 gcm&#8722;3 without losing any adsorption performance, having a coefficient of performance (COP) of 0.71 with a low regeneration temperature (&#8804; 100 &#176;C).

         <title>Bi&#8208;Deficiency Leading to High&#8208;Performance in Mg3(Sb,Bi)2&#8208;Based Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation and tuning of complex defects can effectively enhance the thermoelectric performance of Mg3(Sb,Bi)2. This work proposes an approach to mitigate the negative scattering effect of Mg vacancies by Bi deficiency. The heterovalent vacancies provide a strong phonon scattering, leading to a significant reduction of the lattice thermal conductivity and a superior zT.








Abstract
Mg3(Sb,Bi)2 is a potential nearly&#8208;room temperature thermoelectric compound composed of earth&#8208;abundant elements. However, complex defect tuning and exceptional microstructural control are required. Prior studies have confirmed the detrimental effect of Mg vacancies (VMg) in Mg3(Sb,Bi)2. This study proposes an approach to mitigating the negative scattering effect of VMg by Bi deficiency, synergistically modulating the electrical and thermal transport properties to enhance the thermoelectric performance. Positron annihilation spectrometry and Cs&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy analyses indicated that the VMg tends to coalesce due to the introduced Bi vacancies (VBi). The defects created by Bi deficiency effectively weaken the scattering of electrons from the intrinsic VMg and enhance phonon scattering. A peak zT of 1.82 at 773 K and high conversion efficiency of 11.3% at &#8710;T = 473 K are achieved in the optimized composition of Mg3(Sb,Bi)2 by tuning the defect combination. This work demonstrates a feasible and effective approach to improving the performance of Mg3(Sb,Bi)2 as an emerging thermoelectric material.

         <title>Polymeric Memristor Based Artificial Synapses with Ultra&#8208;Wide Operating Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic polymeric memristive device using MDMO&#8208;PPV is demonstrated. The unencapsulated devices maintain reliable memristive switching behavior under an ultra&#8208;wide temperature range (77&#8211;573 K). XPS and ToF&#8208;SIMS depth profiling techniques are utilized to visualize the kinetic process of ion migration in the device. This work may allow the use of organic memristors as robust artificial synapses in ultra&#8208;wide temperature range for future neuromorphic applications.








Abstract
Neuromorphic electronics, being inspired by how the brain works, hold great promise to the successful implementation of smart artificial systems. Among several neuromorphic hardware issues, a robust device functionality under extreme temperature is of particular importance for practical applications. Given that the organic memristors for artificial synapse applications are demonstrated under room temperature, achieving a robust device performance at extremely low or high temperature is still utterly challenging. In this work, the temperature issue is addressed by tuning the functionality of the solution&#8208;based organic polymeric memristor. The optimized memristor demonstrates a reliable performance under both the cryogenic and high&#8208;temperature environments. The unencapsulated organic polymeric memristor shows a robust memristive response under test temperature ranging from 77 to 573&#160;K. Utilizing X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) depth profiling, the device working mechanism is unveiled by comparing the compositional profiles of the fresh and written organic polymeric memristors. A reversible ion migration induced by an applied voltage contributes to the characteristic switching behavior of the memristor. Herein, both the robust memristive response achieved at extreme temperatures and the verified device working mechanism will remarkably accelerate the development of memristors in neuromorphic systems.

         <title>A 3D&#8208;Printed Proton Pseudocapacitor with Ultrahigh Mass Loading and Areal Energy Density for Fast Energy Storage at Low Temperature</title>

         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;architectured high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading proton pseudocapacitors with cross&#8208;scale, high energy density, and oriented toward harsh environments are rationally designed via 3D printing technology. The 3D&#8208;printed pseudocapacitors can deliver a high energy density of 0.514 mWh cm&#8722;2 and excellent cycling stability at the ultralow temperature of &#8722;60&#176;C.








Abstract
The sluggish ionic transport in thick electrodes and freezing electrolytes has limited electrochemical energy storage devices in lots of harsh environments for practical applications. Here, a 3D&#8208;printed proton pseudocapacitor based on high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading 3D&#8208;printed WO3 anodes, Prussian blue analog cathodes, and anti&#8208;freezing electrolytes is developed, which can achieve state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance at low temperatures. Benefiting from the cross&#8208;scale 3D electrode structure using a 3D printing direct ink writing technique, the 3D&#8208;printed cathode realizes an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 7.39&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a high areal mass loading of 23.51&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the 3D&#8208;printed pseudocapacitor delivers an areal capacitance of 3.44 F&#160;cm&#8722;2 and excellent areal energy density (1.08 mWh&#160;cm&#8722;2). Owing to the fast ion kinetics in 3D electrodes and the high ionic conductivity of the hybrid electrolyte, the 3D&#8208;printed supercapacitor delivers 61.3% of the room&#8208;temperature capacitance even at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C. This work provides an effective strategy for the practical applications of energy storage devices with complex physical structure at extreme temperatures.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sluggish ionic transport in thick electrodes and freezing electrolytes has limited electrochemical energy storage devices in lots of harsh environments for practical applications. Here, a 3D-printed proton pseudocapacitor based on high-mass-loading 3D-printed WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; anodes, Prussian blue analog cathodes, and anti-freezing electrolytes is developed, which can achieve state-of-the-art electrochemical performance at low temperatures. Benefiting from the cross-scale 3D electrode structure using a 3D printing direct ink writing technique, the 3D-printed cathode realizes an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 7.39&#160;F&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a high areal mass loading of 23.51&#160;mg&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, the 3D-printed pseudocapacitor delivers an areal capacitance of 3.44 F&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and excellent areal energy density (1.08 mWh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Owing to the fast ion kinetics in 3D electrodes and the high ionic conductivity of the hybrid electrolyte, the 3D-printed supercapacitor delivers 61.3% of the room-temperature capacitance even at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C. This work provides an effective strategy for the practical applications of energy storage devices with complex physical structure at extreme temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intermediate Phase Engineering with 2,2&#8208;Azodi(2&#8208;Methylbutyronitrile)&#160;for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique intermediate phase engineering strategy is developed to overcome the incomplete and random transformation of PbI2 film with organic ammonium salts by simultaneously introducing 2,2&#8208;azodi(2&#8208;methylbutyronitrile) to both PbI2 precursor solution and organic ammonium salts. This helps to achieve perovskite solar cells with efficiency &gt;25% and good stability of remaining 96% initial efficiency in the maximum power point tracking measurement after 1000 h.








Abstract
Sequential deposition has been widely employed to modulate the crystallization of perovskite solar cells because it can avoid the formation of nucleation centers and even initial crystallization in the precursor solution. However, challenges remain in overcoming the incomplete and random transformation of PbI2 films with organic ammonium salts. Herein, a unique intermediate phase engineering strategy has been developed by simultaneously introducing 2,2&#8208;azodi(2&#8208;methylbutyronitrile) (AMBN) to both PbI2 and ammonium salt solutions to regulate perovskite crystallization. AMBN not only coordinates with PbI2 to form a favorably mesoporous PbI2 film due to the coordination between Pb2+ and the cyano group (C&#8801;N), but also suppresses the vigorous activity of FA+ ions by interacting with FAI, leading to the full PbI2 transformation with the preferred orientation. Therefore, perovskites with favorable facet orientations are obtained, and the defects are largely suppressed owing to the passivation of uncoordinated Pb2+ and FA+. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency over 25% with a stabilized efficiency of 24.8% is achieved. Moreover, the device exhibits an improved operational stability, retaining 96% of initial power conversion efficiency under 1000 h continuous white&#8208;light illumination with an intensity of 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 at &#8776;55&#160;&#176;C in N2 atmosphere.

         <title>Hierarchical Serpentine&#8208;Helix Combination for 3D Stretchable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural design of hierarchical 3D serpentine&#8208;helix combination, with repeating units winding in a helical manner, can enable large mechanical forces transferred down to a smaller scale with the dissipation of potentially damaging stresses by microscale buckling, endowing electronic devices made from hard&#8208;to&#8208;stretch materials with large stretchability in x&#8208;, y&#8208;, or z&#8208;axis direction, high structural stability, and extraordinary electromechanical performance.








Abstract
3D stretchable electronics attract growing interest due to their new and more complex functionalities compared to 1D or 2D counterparts. Among all 3D configuration designs, a 3D helical structure is commonly used as it can be designed to achieve outstanding stretching ratios as well as highly robust mechanical performance. However, the stretching ratio that mainly focuses on the axis direction hinders its applications. Inspired by hierarchies in a tendon, a novel structural design of hierarchical 3D serpentine&#8208;helix combination is proposed. The structural design constructed by a sequence with repeating small units winding in a helical manner around the axis can enable large mechanical forces transferred down to a smaller scale with the dissipation of potentially damaging stresses by microscale buckling, thereby endowing the electronic components made from high&#8208;performance but hard&#8208;to&#8208;stretch materials with large stretchability (&#8805;200%) in x&#8208;, y&#8208;, or z&#8208;axis direction, high structural stability, and extraordinary electromechanical performance. Two applications including a wireless charging patch and an epidermal electronic system are demonstrated. The epidermal electronic system made of several hierarchical 3D serpentine&#8208;helix combinations allows for high&#8208;fidelity monitoring of electrophysiological signals, galvanic skin response, and finger&#8208;movement&#8208;induced electrical signals, which can achieve good tactile pattern recognition when combined with an artificial neural network.

         <title>siRNA Delivery against Myocardial Ischemia Reperfusion Injury Mediated by Reversibly Camouflaged Biomimetic Nanocomplexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocomplexes (NCs) based on membrane&#8208;penetrating helical polypeptide and reversible, platelet&#8211;macrophage hybrid membrane (HM) cloaking are developed for efficient siSav1 delivery against myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury. HM coating drives the targeted accumulation of NCs in the injured myocardium, and acid&#8208;triggered membrane shedding allows efficient delivery of siSav1 into cardiomyocytes, which suppresses the Hippo pathway and induces cardiomyocyte regeneration.








Abstract
siRNA&#8208;mediated management of myocardial ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury is greatly hampered by the inefficient myocardial enrichment and cardiomyocyte transfection. Herein, nanocomplexes (NCs) reversibly camouflaged with a platelet&#8211;macrophage hybrid membrane (HM) are developed to efficiently deliver Sav1 siRNA (siSav1) into cardiomyocytes, suppressing the Hippo pathway and inducing cardiomyocyte regeneration. The biomimetic BSPC@HM NCs consist of a cationic nanocore assembled from a membrane&#8208;penetrating helical polypeptide (P&#8208;Ben) and siSav1, a charge&#8208;reversal intermediate layer of poly(l&#8208;lysine)&#8208;cis&#8208;aconitic acid (PC), and an outer shell of HM. Due to HM&#8208;mediated inflammation homing and microthrombus targeting, intravenously injected BSPC@HM NCs can efficiently accumulate in the IR&#8208;injured myocardium, where the acidic inflammatory microenvironment triggers charge reversal of PC to shed off both HM and PC layers and allow the penetration of the exposed P&#8208;Ben/siSav1 NCs into cardiomyocytes. In rats and pigs, BSPC@HM NCs remarkably downregulates Sav1 in IR&#8208;injured myocardium, promotes myocardium regeneration, suppresses myocardial apoptosis, and recovers cardiac functions. This study reports a bioinspired strategy to overcome the multiple systemic barriers against myocardial siRNA delivery, and holds profound potential for gene therapy against cardiac injuries.

         <title>Bioinspired Adaptable Indwelling Microneedles for Treatment of Diabetic Ulcers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the adaptive and self&#8208;regulating abilities of creatures in nature, indwelling microneedles are presented that can adjust their mechanical strengths to accommodate to surrounding tissues and release exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells. As the delivered exosomes can activate endogenous cells and regulate topical microenvironments, such indwelling microneedles demonstrate values in treating hard&#8208;healing wounds.








Abstract
Microneedles provide an effective strategy for transdermal drug delivery. Many endeavors have been devoted to developing smart microneedles that can respond to and interact with pathophysiological environments. Here, novel bioinspired adaptable indwelling microneedles with therapeutic exosome encapsulation are presented for diabetic wound healing by a combined fabrication strategy of template replication and 3D&#160;transfer printing. Such microneedles are composed of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)&#8208;exosomes&#8208;encapsulated adjustable poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel needle tips and detachable 3M medical tape supporting substrate. As the mechanical strength of the PVA hydrogel is ionically responsive due to Hofmeister effects, the hardness of the resultant microneedle tips can be upregulated by sulfate ions to ensure skin penetration and be softened by nitrate ions after tip&#8211;substrate detachment to adapt to the surrounding tissue and release exosomes. Because the MSC&#8208;exosomes can effectively activate fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, and macrophages, the indwelling microneedles are demonstrated with the function of promoting tissue regeneration and diabetic wound healing in full&#8208;thickness cutaneous wounds of diabetic rat models. These features indicate that the bioinspired adaptable indwelling microneedles are with practical values and clinical prospects in tissue and wound regeneration.

         <title>2D Materials&#8208;Based Electrochemical Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamental role played by the electrical double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC) of few layers graphene (FLG)&#8208;electrodes, in rising the electrical power output of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs, 530 mW m&#8722;2) is unveiled. Highly capacitive FLG electrodes are obtained by integrating electrolyte gel composites based on 2D&#8208;transition metal dichalcogenides. This work introduces a novel design concept leading to sustainable electrochemical&#8208;TENGs.








Abstract
The integration of 2D materials in triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is known to increase the mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical power conversion efficiency. 2D materials are used in TENGs with multiple roles as triboelectric material, charge&#8208;trapping fillers, or as electrodes. Here, novel TENGs based on few&#8208;layers graphene (FLG) electrodes and stable gel electrolytes composed of liquid phase exfoliated 2D&#8208;transition metal dichalcogenides and polyvinyl alcohol are developed. TENGs embedding FLG and gel composites show competitive open&#8208;circuit voltage (&#8776; 300 V), instant peak power (530 mW m&#8722;2), and stability (&gt; 11 months). These values correspond to a seven&#8208;fold higher electrical output compared to TENGs embedding bare FLG electrodes. It is demonstrated that such a significant improvement depends on the high electrical double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC) of FLG electrodes functionalized with the gel composites. The wet encapsulation of the TENGs is shown to be an effective strategy to increase their power output further highlighting the EDLC role. It is also shown that the EDLC is dependent upon the transition metal (W vs Mo) rather than the relative abundance of 1T or 2H phases. Overall, this work lays down the roots for novel sustainable electrochemical&#8208;(e)&#8208;TENGs developed exploiting strategies typically used in electrochemical capacitors.

         <title>Programmed Self&#8208;Assembly of Single Colloidal Gyroids for Chiral Photonic Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;gyroid structure&#8212;despite supporting a complete photonic bandgap&#8212;has thus far been overlooked for programming colloidal self&#8208;assembly, presumably due to its structural complexity. In this work, two distinct routes are demonstrated in silico for programmed self&#8208;assembly of single colloidal gyroids from synthetically feasible chiral patchy colloidal spheres, paving the way for realizing 3D chiral photonic crystals at optical frequencies.








Abstract
Gyroid structures are of extensive interest because they provide a rich platform for chiroptics as well as topological photonics. While the double&#8208;gyroid morphology as a bicontinuous structure is not uncommon in self&#8208;assembled soft materials, direct self&#8208;assembly of single&#8208;network gyroids has proven elusive. Here, an enantiomorphic pair of single&#8208;gyroid crystals comprising colloidal spheres is presented, and two distinct routes are demonstrated for programmed self&#8208;assembly of each single colloidal gyroid enantiomorph from rationally designed patchy spheres. The designer colloidal patchy spheres, which closely hew to their synthetic feasibility, are chiral, having either two staggered rectangular patches at opposite poles or four circular patches arranged in a well&#8208;defined geometry. The single colloidal gyroid, as well as its inverse structure, is shown to support a wide complete photonic bandgap in addition to exhibiting rich chiroptical properties, making them attractive chiral photonic crystals. The versatility of this single colloidal gyroid, the bottom&#8208;up routes devised here in silico, and the robustness of the design space for the chiral colloidal patchy spheres together make a strong case for single colloidal gyroids to supersede colloidal diamond, as a target for programmed self&#8208;assembly, in the quest for photonic crystals operating at optical&#160;frequencies.

         <title>Coupling Probiotics with 2D CoCuMo&#8208;LDH Nanosheets as a Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Platform for Precise NIR&#8208;II Photodynamic Therapy</title>

A probiotics&#8208;based tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive platform is designed to remodel the TME to in situ activate CoCuMo layered&#8208;double&#8208;hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets as effective photosensitizers for precise NIR&#8208;II PDT, which can effectively induce cell apoptosis and tumor eradication under 1270 nm laser irradiation.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has become a promising cancer treatment approach with superior advantages. However, it remains a grand challenge to develop tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive photosensitizers (PSs) for tumor&#8208;targeting precise PDT. Herein, the coupling Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) probiotics with 2D CoCuMo layered&#8208;double&#8208;hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets (LA&amp;LDH) is reported as a TME&#8208;responsive platform for precise NIR&#8208;II PDT. The CoCuMo&#8208;LDH nanosheets loaded on LA can be transformed from crystalline into amorphous through etching by the LA&#8208;metabolite&#8208;enabled low pH and overexpressed glutathione. The TME&#8208;induced in situ amorphization of CoCuMo&#8208;LDH nanosheets can boost its photodynamic activity for singlet oxygen (1O2) generation under 1270&#160;nm laser irradiation with relative 1O2 quantum yield of 1.06, which is the highest among previously reported NIR&#8208;excited PSs. In vitro and in vivo assays prove that the LA&amp;LDH can effectively achieve complete cell apoptosis and tumor eradication under 1270&#160;nm laser irradiation. This study proves that the probiotics can be used as a tumor&#8208;targeting platform for highly efficient precise NIR&#8208;II PDT.

         <title>Self&#8208;Organization of Iron Sulfide Nanoparticles into Complex Multicompartment Supraparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>

FeS2 NPs self&#8208;assemble into biomimetic supraparticles with multiple interconnected compartments. High complexity of the particles manifests in their functionality. They successfully encapsulate nucleic acid cargo, deliver it inside the cells, and protect it against degradation in the environment.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled compartments from nanoscale components are found in all life forms. Their characteristic dimensions are in 50&#8211;1000&#160;nm scale, typically assembled from a variety of bioorganic &#8220;building blocks&#8221;. Among the various functions that these mesoscale compartments carry out, protection of the content from the environment is central. Finding synthetic pathways to similarly complex and functional particles from technologically friendly inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) is needed for a multitude of biomedical, biochemical, and biotechnological processes. Here, it is shown that FeS2 NPs stabilized by l&#8208;cysteine self&#8208;assemble into multicompartment supraparticles (mSPs). The NPs initially produce &#8776;55&#160;nm concave assemblies that reconfigure into &#8776;75&#160;nm closed mSPs with &#8776;340 interconnected compartments with an average size of &#8776;5&#160;nm. The intercompartmental partitions and mSP surface are formed primarily from FeS2 and Fe2O3 NPs, respectively. The intermediate formation of cup&#8208;like particles enables encapsulation of biological cargo. This capability is demonstrated by loading mSPs with DNA and subsequent transfection of mammalian cells. Also it is found&#160;that the temperature stability of the DNA cargo is enhanced compared to the traditional delivery vehicles. These findings demonstrate that biomimetic compartmentalized particles can be used to successfully encapsulate and enhance temperature stability of the nucleic acid cargo for a variety of bioapplications.

         <title>Activatable Graphene Quantum&#8208;Dot&#8208;Based Nanotransformers for Long&#8208;Period Tumor Imaging and Repeated Photodynamic Therapy</title>

A versatile nanovehicle, a quantum dot nanotransformes, smartly transforms its shape in tumor acidic microenvironment to prolong the tumor retention, and then disassembles and releases the encapsulated photosensitizers to &#8220;turn on&#8221; the imaging contrast. The total drug dose in repeated photodynamic therapy is reduced because one injection is enough for four times of light irradiation.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is considered as an emerging therapeutic modality against cancer with high spatiotemporal selectivity because the utilized photosensitizers (PSs) are only active and toxic upon light irradiation. To maximize its effectiveness, PDT is usually applied repetitively for ablating various tumors. However, the total overdose of PSs from repeated administrations causes severe side effects. Herein, acidity&#8208;activated graphene quantum dots&#8208;based nanotransformers (GQD NT) are developed as PS vehicles for long&#8208;period tumor imaging and repeated PDT. Under the guidance of Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp peptide, GQD NT targets to tumor tissues actively, and then loosens and enlarges in tumor acidity, thus promising long tumor retention. Afterwards, GQD NT transforms into small pieces for better penetration in tumor. Upon laser irradiation, GQD NT generates mild hyperthermia that enhances cell membrane permeability and further promotes the PSs uptake. Most intriguingly, the as&#8208;prepared GQD NT not only &#8220;turns&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence/magnetic resonance signals, but also achieves efficient repeated PDT. Notably, the total PSs dose is reduced to 3.5&#160;&#181;mol&#160;kg&#8722;1, which is 10&#8211;30&#160;times lower than that of other reported works. Overall, this study exploits a smart vehicle to enhance accumulation, retention, and release of PSs in tumors through programmed deformation, thus overcoming the overdose obstacle in repeated PDT.

         <title>A Nanotherapeutic Strategy to Reverse NK Cell Exhaustion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cetuximab can target EGFR, and then induce the decrease of methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) content, accompanied by the inhibition of MTHFD2 activity by LY345899, leading to the boosting of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The generated ROS can oxidize C5SeSeC5 into seleninic acid, which can inhibit the expression of human leukocyte antigen E, further reverse the exhaustion of natural killer cells in conjunction with the antibody&#8208;dependent cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity effect mediated by cetuximab.








Abstract
As a specialized immune effector cell, natural killer (NK) cells play a very important role in immunotherapy, but tumor immunosuppression caused by abnormal expression of cancer cells seriously weakens its therapeutic effect and leads to exhaustion. Here, self&#8208;assembled selenium&#8208;containing nanoparticles (NPs) composed of cetuximab, C5SeSeC5, and inhibitor LY345899 are developed to reverse NK cell exhaustion. The obtained NPs can target epidermal growth factor receptor on the surface of cancer cells and locate it in mitochondria. The released LY345899 can inhibit the activity of methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 and produce excessive reactive oxygen species, leading to the formation of seleninic acid, further reducing the expression of human leukocyte antigen E , which is responsible for the NKG2A&#8208;related NK cell inhibition. As a result, the enhanced NK&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated immunotherapy in conjunction with the cetuximab&#8208;mediated antibody&#8208;dependent cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity effect can not only effectively inhibit the growth of xenograft tumors, but also significantly suppress the growth of untreated distant tumors via the abscopal effect. This work, the combination of seleninic acid, LY345899, and cetuximab, provides a new strategy for reversing NK cell exhaustion and has great potential for use in the treatment of metastatic tumors.

         <title>Experimental Demonstration of In&#8208;Memory Computing in a Ferrofluid System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;based ferrofluid system can implement a liquid in&#8208;memory computer when it is stimulated in direct current and its internal state is read in radio frequency mode. The liquid can recognize digits using either a custom pixel serialization scheme or reservoir computing with an ad&#8208;hoc read&#8208;out neural network layer.








Abstract
Magnetic fluids are excellent candidates for several important research fields including energy harvesting, biomedical applications, soft robotics, and exploration. However, notwithstanding relevant advancements such as shape reconfigurability, that have been demonstrated, there is no evidence for their computing capability, including the emulation of synaptic functions, which requires complex non&#8208;linear dynamics. Here, it is experimentally demonstrated that a Fe3O4 water&#8208;based ferrofluid (FF) can perform electrical analogue computing and be programmed using quasi direct current (DC) signals and read at radio frequency (RF) mode. Features have been observed in all respects attributable to a memristive behavior, featuring both short and long&#8208;term information storage capacity and plasticity. The colloid is capable of classifying digits of a 8&#160;&#215;&#160;8 pixel dataset using a custom in&#8208;memory signal processing scheme, and through physical reservoir computing by training a readout layer. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of in&#8208;memory computing using an amorphous FF system in a liquid aggregation state. This work poses the basis for the exploitation of a FF colloid as both an in&#8208;memory computing device and as a full&#8208;electric liquid computer thanks to its fluidity and the reported complex dynamics, via probing read&#8208;out and programming&#160;ports.

         <title>Bridging Synthesis and Controllable Doping of Monolayer 4 in. Length Transition&#8208;Metal Dichalcogenides Single Crystals with High Electron Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Fe&#8208;assisted epitaxial strategy to synthesize 4 in. length transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) single crystals on c&#8208;plane sapphire is designed, ultrahigh mobility and remarkable on/off current ratio are discovered due to the ultralow contact resistance. The introduction of Fe decreases the formation energy of parallel steps on sapphire surfaces and contributes to the edge&#8208;nucleation of unidirectional alignment of TMDCs domains.








Abstract
Epitaxial growth and controllable doping of wafer&#8208;scale atomically thin semiconductor single crystals are two central tasks to tackle the scaling challenge of transistors. Despite considerable efforts are devoted, addressing such crucial issues simultaneously under 2D confinement is yet to be realized. Here, an ingenious strategy to synthesize record&#8208;breaking 4 in. length Fe&#8208;doped transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) single crystals on industry&#8208;compatible c&#8208;plane sapphire without special miscut angle is designed. Atomically thin transistors with high electron mobility (&#8776;146 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and remarkable on/off current ratio (&#8776;109) are fabricated based on 4 in. length Fe&#8208;MoS2 single crystals, due to the ultralow contact resistance (&#8776;489 &#937; &#181;m). In&#8208;depth characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of Fe significantly decreases the formation energy of parallel steps on sapphire surfaces and contributes to the edge&#8208;nucleation of unidirectional alignment TMDCs domains (&gt;99%). This work represents a substantial leap in terms of bridging synthesis and doping of wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconductor single crystals, which should promote the further device downscaling and extension of Moore's law.

         <title>Brightening Blue Photoluminescence in Nonemission MOF&#8208;2 by Pressure Treatment Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Initially nonemission MOF&#8208;2 shows a conspicuous pressure&#8208;induced emission (PIE) with bright blue&#8208;light within 7.0&#160;GPa, and the excellent PIE is unprecedentedly retained to ambient conditions with photoluminescence quantum yield up to 70.4%. The hydrogen bonding cooperativity effect effectively elevates the rotational barrier of the linker rotors by pressure treatment engineering, which turns on the photoluminescence in MOF&#8208;2.








Abstract
As equally essential as the synthesis of new materials, maneuvering new structure configurations can endow the brand&#8208;new functional properties to existing materials, which is also one of the core goals in the synthesis community. In this respect, pressure&#8208;induced emission (PIE) that triggers photoluminescence (PL) in nonemission materials is an emerging stimuli&#8208;responsive smart materials technology. In the PIE paradigms, harvesting bright PL at ambient conditions, however, has remained elusive. Herein, a remarkable PIE phenomenon is reported in initially nonemission Zn(BDC)(DMF)(H2O) (MOF&#8208;2), which shows bright blue&#8208;emission at 455&#160;nm under pressure.

&lt;p&gt;Initially nonemission MOF-2 shows a conspicuous pressure-induced emission (PIE) with bright blue-light within 7.0&#160;GPa, and the excellent PIE is unprecedentedly retained to ambient conditions with photoluminescence quantum yield up to 70.4%. The hydrogen bonding cooperativity effect effectively elevates the rotational barrier of the linker rotors by pressure treatment engineering, which turns on the photoluminescence in MOF-2.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As equally essential as the synthesis of new materials, maneuvering new structure configurations can endow the brand-new functional properties to existing materials, which is also one of the core goals in the synthesis community. In this respect, pressure-induced emission (PIE) that triggers photoluminescence (PL) in nonemission materials is an emerging stimuli-responsive smart materials technology. In the PIE paradigms, harvesting bright PL at ambient conditions, however, has remained elusive. Herein, a remarkable PIE phenomenon is reported in initially nonemission Zn(BDC)(DMF)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) (MOF-2), which shows bright blue-emission at 455&#160;nm under pressure. Intriguingly, the bright blue PL with an excellent photoluminescence quantum yield up to 70.4% is unprecedentedly retained to ambient conditions upon decompression from 16.2&#160;GPa. The detailed structural analyses combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that hydrogen bonding cooperativity effect elevates powerfully the rotational barrier of the linker rotor to 3.87&#160;eV mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; from initial 0.91&#160;eV mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; through pressure treatment. The downgrade rotational freedom turns on PL of MOF-2 after releasing pressure completely. This is the first case of harvesting PIE to ambient conditions. These findings offer a new platform for the creation of promising alternatives to high-performance PL materials based on initially nonemission counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Organic Chiroptical Detector Favoring Circularly Polarized Light Detection from Near&#8208;Infrared to Ultraviolet and Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Amplifying Dissymmetry in Detectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized light detection has attracted growing attention due to the great applications in optical communication and biological detection. Organic chiroptical detectors with circularly polarized light detection ranging from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared are fabricated successfully. Furthermore, the external magnetic field can increase the factor of dissymmetry in electric current from 0.18 to 0.23 at room temperature.








Abstract
Circularly polarized light detection has attracted growing attention because of its unique application in security surveillance and quantum optics. Here, through designing a chiral polymer as a donor, a high&#8208;performance circularly polarized light detector is fabricated, successfully enabling detection from ultraviolet (300&#160;nm) to near&#8208;infrared (1100&#160;nm). The chiroptical detector presents an excellent ability to distinguish right&#8208;handed and left&#8208;handed circularly polarized light, where dissymmetries in detectivity, responsivity, and electric current are obtained and then optimized. The dissymmetry in electric current can be increased from 0.18 to 0.23 once an external magnetic field is applied. This is a very rare report on the dissymmetry tunability by an external field in chiroptical detectors. Moreover, the chirality&#8208;generated orbital angular momentum is one of the key factors determining the performance of the circularly polarized light detection. Overall, the organic chiroptical detector presents excellent stability in detection, which provides great potential for future flexible and compact integrated platforms.

         <title>Full Site&#8208;Specific Addressability in DNA Origami&#8208;Templated Silica Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA origami&#8208;templated silica nanostructures combine the excellent properties of both materials resulting in a new type of nanostructure with the precise programmability of DNA origami and the mechanical and structural resilience of silica. It is here shown that these structures also retain one of the most attractive features of DNA origami: complete site&#8208;specific addressability for guest molecule placement after silicification.








Abstract
DNA nanotechnology allows for the fabrication of nanometer&#8208;sized objects with high precision and selective addressability as a result of the programmable hybridization of complementary DNA strands. Such structures can template the formation of other materials, including metals and complex silica nanostructures, where the silica shell simultaneously acts to protect the DNA from external detrimental factors. However, the formation of silica nanostructures with site&#8208;specific addressability has thus far not been explored. Here, it is shown that silica nanostructures templated by DNA origami remain addressable for post silicification modification with guest molecules even if the silica shell measures several nm in thickness. The conjugation of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides is used to different silicified DNA origami structures carrying a complementary ssDNA handle as well as DNA&#8208;PAINT super&#8208;resolution imaging to show that ssDNA handles remain unsilicified and thus ensure retained addressability. It is also demonstrated that not only handles, but also ssDNA scaffold segments within a DNA origami nanostructure remain accessible, allowing for the formation of dynamic silica nanostructures. Finally, the power of this approach is demonstrated by forming 3D DNA origami crystals from silicified monomers. These results thus present a fully site&#8208;specifically addressable silica nanostructure with complete control over size and shape.

         <title>Heterologous Assembly of Pleomorphic Bacterial Microcompartment Shell Architectures Spanning the Nano&#8208; to Microscale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembling shell proteins derived from bacterial microcompartments are a promising new biomaterial with applications in drug delivery, metabolic engineering, cell&#8208;free synthesis, and bioelectronics. A synthetic platform produces pleomorphic shells spanning the nano&#8208; to microscale that are rapidly purified. Geometric models of new morphologies suggest shared design principles with asymmetric carbon and viral protein analogs.








Abstract
Many bacteria use protein&#8208;based organelles known as bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) to organize and sequester sequential enzymatic reactions. Regardless of their specialized metabolic function, all BMCs are delimited by a shell made of multiple structurally redundant, yet functionally diverse, hexameric (BMC&#8208;H), pseudohexameric/trimeric (BMC&#8208;T), or pentameric (BMC&#8208;P) shell protein paralogs. When expressed without their native cargo, shell proteins have been shown to self&#8208;assemble into 2D sheets, open&#8208;ended nanotubes, and closed shells of &#8776;40&#160;nm diameter that are being developed as scaffolds and nanocontainers for applications in biotechnology. Here, by leveraging a strategy for affinity&#8208;based purification, it is demonstrated that a wide range of empty synthetic shells, many differing in end&#8208;cap structures, can be derived from a glycyl radical enzyme&#8208;associated microcompartment. The range of pleomorphic shells observed, which span &#8776;2 orders of magnitude in size from &#8776;25&#160;nm to &#8776;1.8&#160;&#181;m, reveal the remarkable plasticity of BMC&#8208;based biomaterials. In addition, new capped nanotube and nanocone morphologies are observed that are consistent with a multicomponent geometric model in which architectural principles are shared among asymmetric carbon, viral protein, and BMC&#8208;based structures.

         <title>A Nitroxide Radical Conjugated Polymer as an Additive to Reduce Nonradiative Energy Loss in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitroxide radical side chain substituted conjugated polymer, GDTA, employed as a solid additive to generally boost the power conversion efficiencies of organic solar cells from a broad range of photovoltaic material systems, especially for the nonfullerene acceptor&#8208;based cells, is reported.








Abstract
Nonfullerene&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based organic solar cells (NFA&#8208;OSCs) are now set off to the 20% power conversion efficiency milestone. To achieve this, minimizing all loss channels, including nonradiative photovoltage losses, seems a necessity. Nonradiative recombination, to a great extent, is known to be an inherent material property due to vibrationally induced decay of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) states or their back electron transfer to the triplet excitons. Herein, it is shown that the use of a new conjugated nitroxide radical polymer with 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl piperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl side groups (GDTA) as an additive results in an improvement of the photovoltaic performance of NFA&#8208;OSCs based on different active layer materials. Upon the addition of GDTA, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) improve simultaneously. This approach is applied to several material systems including state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art donor/acceptor pairs showing improvement from 15.8% to 17.6% (in the case of PM6:Y6) and from 17.5% to 18.3% (for PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9). Then, the possible reasons behind the observed improvements are discussed. The results point toward the suppression of the CT state to triplet excitons loss channel. This work presents a facile, promising, and generic approach to further improve the performance of NFA&#8208;OSCs.

         <title>A Conformable Ultrasound Patch for Cavitation&#8208;Enhanced Transdermal Cosmeceutical Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft, conformable embodiment of a wearable ultrasound patch for transdermal delivery of cosmeceuticals to the skin is reported. The patch comprises a 2D array of bulk piezoelectric transducers embedded in a poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrate. The patch demonstrates a 26.2&#8208;fold enhancement in the delivery of niacinamide to porcine skin in vitro with 10 min ultrasound application.








Abstract
Increased consumer interest in healthy&#8208;looking skin demands a safe and effective method to increase transdermal absorption of innovative therapeutic cosmeceuticals. However, permeation of small&#8208;molecule drugs is limited by the innate barrier function of the stratum corneum. Here, a conformable ultrasound patch (cUSP) that enhances transdermal transport of niacinamide by inducing intermediate&#8208;frequency sonophoresis in the fluid coupling medium between the patch and the skin is reported. The cUSP consists of piezoelectric transducers embedded in a soft elastomer to create localized cavitation pockets (0.8 cm2, 1&#160;mm deep) over larger areas of conformal contact (20 cm2). Multiphysics simulation models, acoustic spectrum analysis, and high&#8208;speed videography are used to characterize transducer deflection, acoustic pressure fields, and resulting cavitation bubble dynamics in the coupling medium. The final system demonstrates a 26.2&#8208;fold enhancement in niacinamide transport in a porcine model in vitro with a 10 min ultrasound application, demonstrating the suitability of the device for short&#8208;exposure, large&#8208;area application of sonophoresis for patients and consumers suffering from skin conditions and premature skin aging.

         <title>Colorful Electrochromic Displays with High Visual Quality Based on Porous Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design strategy that is structured around a new type of porous metamaterial is developed to circumvent the critical problem in electrochromic displays, which offers personalized devices that exhibit non&#8208;iridescent and large viewable angles, fast switching responses, excellent cycling performance, and extremely low power consumption.








Abstract
The introduction of metamaterials into electrochromic (EC) displays has recently inspired a great breakthrough in the EC field, as this can offer a variety of new attractive features, from a very wide gamut of colors to very fast switching times. However, such metamaterial&#8208;based EC displays still face significant constraints when developing from single electrodes to full devices, because other supportive&#160;components in devices, such as counter electrodes and electrolytes, significantly affect light propagation and the subsequent perceived color quality in metamaterial&#8208;based EC devices. Herein, a new, cost&#8208;effective device design structured around a new type of porous metamaterial is reported to circumvent the critical problem in metamaterial&#8208;based EC displays. Owing to its unique design, the metamaterial&#8208;based EC device achieves good color quality with no drop in brightness or shift in color chromaticity when compared with a single electrode. Moreover, the porous&#8208;metamaterial&#8208;based EC device can exhibit non&#8208;iridescence and be viewed from a wide range of angles (5&#176;&#8211;85&#176;) and has fast switching response (2.4 and 2.5 s for coloration and bleaching, respectively), excellent cycling performance (at least 2000 cycles), and extremely low power consumption (4.0&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Multimodal&#8208;Driven Magnetic Microrobots with Enhanced Bactericidal Activity for Biofilm Eradication and Removal from Titanium Mesh</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic microrobots, composed of halloysite nanotubes (backbone), iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles (magnetic actuators), and coated with polyethylenimine in order to load ampicillin, exhibit multimodal and reconfigurable motion. These magnetic microrobots are used to kill and remove efficiently Staphylococcus aureus biofilm colonized on titanium mesh used for bone restoration.








Abstract
Modern micro/nanorobots can perform multiple tasks for biomedical and environmental applications. Particularly, magnetic microrobots can be completely controlled by a rotating magnetic field and their motion powered and controlled without the use of toxic fuels, which makes them most promising for biomedical application. Moreover, they are able to form swarms, allowing them to perform specific tasks at a larger scale than a single microrobot. In this work, they developed magnetic microrobots composed of halloysite nanotubes as backbone and iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles as magnetic material allowing magnetic propulsion and covered these with polyethylenimine to load ampicillin and prevent the microrobots from disassembling. These microrobots exhibit multimodal motion as single robots as well as in swarms. In addition, they can transform from tumbling to spinning motion and vice&#8208;versa, and when in swarm mode they can change their motion from vortex to ribbon and back again. Finally, the vortex motion mode is used to penetrate and disrupt the extracellular matrix of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm colonized on titanium mesh used for bone restoration, which improves the effect of the antibiotic's activity. Such magnetic microrobots for biofilm removal from medical implants could reduce implant rejection and improve patients&#8217; well&#8208;being.

         <title>Highly Efficient Mixed Conduction in a Fused Oligomer n&#8208;Type Organic Semiconductor Enabled by 3D Transport Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fused and highly electron&#8208;deficient oligomeric organic semiconductor bridging the small&#8208;molecule and polymeric semiconductor domains is presented. By careful control of side&#8208;chain motifs, a highly efficient mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor is obtained. The high performance is ascribed to favorable interactions between semiconductor and aqueous electrolyte that result in a molecular packing with oblique orientation enabling 3D transport pathways.








Abstract
Tailoring organic semiconductors to facilitate mixed conduction of ionic and electronic charges when interfaced with an aqueous media has spurred many recent advances in organic bioelectronics. The field is still restricted, however, by very few n&#8208;type (electron&#8208;transporting) organic semiconductors with adequate performance metrics. Here, a new electron&#8208;deficient, fused polycyclic aromatic system, TNR, is reported with excellent n&#8208;type mixed conduction properties including a &#181;C* figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value exceeding 30 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for the best performing derivative. Comprising three naphthalene bis&#8208;isatin moieties, this new molecular design builds on successful small&#8208;molecule mixed conductors; by extending the molecular scaffold into the oligomer domain, good film&#8208;forming properties, strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, and consequently excellent charge&#8208;transport properties are obtained. Through judicious optimization of the side chains, the linear oligoether and branched alkyl chain derivative bgTNR is obtained which shows superior mixed conduction in an organic electrochemical transistor configuration including an electron mobility around 0.3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. By optimizing the side chains, the dominant molecular packing can be changed from a preferential edge&#8208;on orientation (with high charge&#8208;transport anisotropy) to an oblique orientation that can support 3D transport pathways which in turn ensure highly efficient mixed conduction properties across the bulk semiconductor film.

         <title>Horizontal and Vertical Coalescent Microrobotic Collectives Using Ferrofluid Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed coalescent collective system exploits the ferrofluid droplets' splitting and coalescence properties to trigger the formation of horizontal and vertical collectives. Under a&#160;time&#8208;varying magnetic field, the droplet swarm exhibits a variety of morphologies ranging from vortex&#8208;like, chain&#8208;like, and crystal&#8208;like patterns, to vertical layer&#8208;upon&#8208;layer patterns. The reconfigurability of these droplet collectives significantly extends the functionality of ferrofluid&#8208;based soft robots.

Many artificial miniature robotic collectives have been developed to overcome the inherent limitations of inadequate individual capabilities. However, the basic building blocks of the reported collectives are mainly in the solid state, where the morphological boundaries of internal individuals are clear and cannot genuinely merge. Miniature robotic collectives based on liquid units still need to be explored; such on&#8208;demand mergeable swarm systems are advantageous for adapting to the changing external environment. Here, a strategy to achieve a coalescent collective system we&#160;presented that exploits the ferrofluid droplets' splitting and coalescence properties to trigger the formation of horizontal multimodal and vertical gravity&#8208;resistant collectives and unveil pattern&#8208;enabled robotic functionalities. When subjected to a time&#8208;varying magnetic field, the droplet swarm exhibits a variety of morphologies ranging from horizontal collectives, including vortex&#8208;like, chain&#8208;like, and crystal&#8208;like patterns to vertical layer&#8208;upon&#8208;layer patterns. Using experiments and simulations, the formation and transformation of different morphological collectives are shown and their robust environmental adaptability are demonstrated. Potential applications of the multimodal droplet collectives are presented, including exploring an unknown environment, targeted object delivery, and fluid flow filtration in a lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip. This work may facilitate the design of microrobotic swarm systems and expand the range of materials for miniature robots.

&lt;p&gt;The proposed coalescent collective system exploits the ferrofluid droplets' splitting and coalescence properties to trigger the formation of horizontal and vertical collectives. Under a&#160;time-varying magnetic field, the droplet swarm exhibits a variety of morphologies ranging from vortex-like, chain-like, and crystal-like patterns, to vertical layer-upon-layer patterns. The reconfigurability of these droplet collectives significantly extends the functionality of ferrofluid-based soft robots.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Small Molecule Organic Solar Cells Enabled by a Symmetric&#8208;Asymmetric Alloy Acceptor with a Broad Composition Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and stable ternary system by introducing a new asymmetric electron acceptor SSe&#8208;NIC into the MPhS&#8208;C2:BTP&#8208;eC9 host system is developed, which exhibits a record&#8208;high PCE of 18.02% and demonstrates better operational stability as compared to the host system.








Abstract
Using a combinatory blending strategy is demonstrated as a promising path for designing efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) by boosting the short&#8208;circuit current density and fill factor. Herein, a high&#8208;performance ternary all&#8208;small molecule OSC (all&#8208;SMOSCs) using a narrow&#8208;bandgap alloy acceptor containing symmetric and asymmetric molecules (BTP&#8208;eC9 and SSe&#8208;NIC) and a wide&#8208;bandgap small molecule donor MPhS&#8208;C2 is reported. Introducing the synthesized SSe&#8208;NIC into the MPhS&#8208;C2:BTP&#8208;eC9 host system can broaden the absorption spectrum, modulate energy offsets, and optimize the molecular packing of the host materials. After systematically optimizing the weight ratio of MPhS&#8208;C2:BTP&#8208;eC9:SSe&#8208;NIC, a champion efficiency of 18.02% is achieved. Impressively, the ternary system not only delivered a broad composition tolerance with device efficiencies over 17% throughout the whole blend ratios, but also exhibited less non&#8208;geminate recombination and energy loss, and better&#8208;light&#8208;soaking stability than the corresponding binary systems. This work promotes the development of high&#8208;performance ternary all&#8208;SMOSCs and heralds their brighter application prospects.

         <title>Impairing Tumor Metabolic Plasticity via a Stable Metal&#8208;Phenolic&#8208;Based Polymeric Nanomedicine to Suppress Colorectal Cancer</title>

         <dc:description>
pOEG&#8208;b&#8208;D&#8208;SH@NP with favorable stability and enhanced tumor&#8208;targeting ability simultaneously inhibits oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in CT26 cells, and shifts the balance of programmed cell death from apoptosis toward necroptosis, which induces severe energy crisis and avoids single&#8208;targeting therapeutic tolerance due to metabolic plasticity, thus potently suppressing colorectal cancer growth and peritoneal intestinal metastasis in mouse models.








Abstract
Targeting metabolic vulnerability of tumor cells is a promising anticancer strategy. However, the therapeutic efficacy of existing metabolism&#8208;regulating agents is often compromised due to tolerance resulting from tumor metabolic plasticity, as well as their poor bioavailability and tumor&#8208;targetability. Inspired by the inhibitive effect of N&#8208;ethylmaleimide on the mitochondrial function, a dendronized&#8208;polymer&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;phenolic nanomedicine (pOEG&#8208;b&#8208;D&#8208;SH@NP) encapsulating maleimide&#8208;modified doxorubicin (Mal&#8208;DOX) is developed to enable improvement in the overall delivery efficiency and inhibition of the tumor metabolism via multiple pathways. It is observed that Mal&#8208;DOX and its derived nanomedicine induces energy depletion of CT26 colorectal cancer cells more efficiently than doxorubicin, and shifts the balance of programmed cell death from apoptosis toward necroptosis. Notably, pOEG&#8208;b&#8208;D&#8208;SH@NP simultaneously inhibits cellular oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, thus potently suppressing cancer growth and peritoneal intestinal metastasis in mouse models. Overall, the study provides a promising dendronized&#8208;polymer&#8208;derived nanoplatform for the treatment of cancers through impairing metabolic plasticity.

         <title>Target&#8208;Driven Design of Deep&#8208;UV Nonlinear Optical Materials via Interpretable Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A target&#8208;driven materials design framework combining high&#8208;throughput calculations, crystal structure prediction, and machine learning is proposed to accelerate the discovery of deep&#8208;UV NLO materials. The machine learning regression model for predicting birefringence is developed for the first time. As&#160;an application, eight compounds with promising NLO&#8208;related properties which show potential applications in the deep&#8208;UV region are identified.








Abstract
The development of a data&#8208;driven science paradigm is greatly revolutionizing the process of materials discovery. Particularly, exploring novel nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with the birefringent phase&#8208;matching ability to deep&#8208;ultraviolet (UV) region is of vital significance for the field of laser technologies. Herein, a target&#8208;driven materials design framework combining high&#8208;throughput calculations (HTC), crystal structure prediction, and interpretable machine learning (ML) is proposed to accelerate the discovery of deep&#8208;UV NLO materials. Using a dataset generated from HTC, an ML regression model for predicting birefringence is developed for the first time, which exhibits a possibility of achieving fast and accurate prediction. Essentially, crystal structures are adopted as the only known input of this model to establish a close structure&#8208;property relationship mapping birefringence. Utilizing the ML&#8208;predicted birefringence which can affect the shortest phase&#8208;matching wavelength, a full list of potential chemical compositions based on an efficient screening strategy is identified. Further, eight structures with good stability are discovered to show potential applications in the deep&#8208;UV region, owing to their promising NLO&#8208;related properties. This study provides a new insight into the discovery of NLO materials and this design framework can identify desired materials with high performances in the broad chemical space at a low computational cost.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Doped Heterointerfaced Ru/RuSe2 Nanosheets with Optimized H and H2O Adsorption Boost Hydrogen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of Cu&#8208;doped Ru/RuSe2 heterogeneous nanosheets for highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media is designed and synthesized. The superior HER performance is attributed to a synergistic effect of the unique heterogeneous interface structure and Cu doping, which leads to the optimized H and H2O adsorption to boost hydrogen evolution catalysis.








Abstract
Ruthenium chalcogenide is a highly promising catalytic system as a Pt alternative for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, well&#8208;studied ruthenium selenide (RuSe2) still exhibits sluggish HER kinetics in alkaline media due to the inappropriate adsorption strength of H and H2O. Herein, xx report a new design of Cu&#8208;doped Ru/RuSe2 heterogeneous nanosheets (NSs) with optimized H and H2O adsorption strength for highly efficient HER catalysis in alkaline media. Theoretical calculations reveal that the superior HER performance is attributed to a synergistic effect of the unique heterointerfaced structure and Cu doping, which not only optimizes the electronic structure with a suitable d&#8208;band center to suppress proton overbinding but also alleviates the energy barrier with enhanced H2O adsorption. As a result, Cu&#8208;doped heterogeneous Ru/RuSe2 NSs exhibit a small overpotential of 23&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, a low Tafel slope of 58.5&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 and a high turnover frequency (TOF) value of 0.88 s&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mV for HER in alkaline media, which is among the best catalysts in noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts toward HER. The present Cu&#8208;doped Ru/RuSe2 NSs interface catalyst is very stable for HER by showing no activity decay after 5000&#8208;cycle potential sweeps. This work heralds that heterogeneous interface modulation opens up a new strategy for the designing of more efficient electrocatalysts.

Herein, xx report a new design of Cu-doped Ru/RuSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterogeneous nanosheets (NSs) with optimized H and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O adsorption strength for highly efficient HER catalysis in alkaline media. Theoretical calculations reveal that the superior HER performance is attributed to a synergistic effect of the unique heterointerfaced structure and Cu doping, which not only optimizes the electronic structure with a suitable d-band center to suppress proton overbinding but also alleviates the energy barrier with enhanced H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O adsorption. As a result, Cu-doped heterogeneous Ru/RuSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NSs exhibit a small overpotential of 23&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a low Tafel slope of 58.5&#160;mV&#160;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a high turnover frequency (TOF) value of 0.88 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 100&#160;mV for HER in alkaline media, which is among the best catalysts in noble metal-based electrocatalysts toward HER. The present Cu-doped Ru/RuSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NSs interface catalyst is very stable for HER by showing no activity decay after 5000-cycle potential sweeps. This work heralds that heterogeneous interface modulation opens up a new strategy for the designing of more efficient electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Space&#8208;Confined Metal Ion Strategy for Carbon Materials Derived from Cobalt Benzimidazole Frameworks with High Desalination Performance in Simulated Seawater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various metal ions (Mg2+, Al3+, Ca2+, Ti4+, Mn2+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Ba2+, Ce4+) with different valence states are confined in the quasi&#8208;microcube shaped cobalt benzimidazole frameworks (CoZIF9) using a space&#8208;confined synthesis strategy. A series of derived carbon materials with limited metal ions are obtained through high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis and applied in capacitive deionization.








Abstract
Various metal ions with different valence states (Mg2+, Al3+, Ca2+, Ti4+, Mn2+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Ba2+, Ce4+) are successfully confined in quasi&#8208;microcube shaped cobalt benzimidazole frameworks using a space&#8208;confined synthesis strategy. More importantly, a series of derived carbon materials that confine metal ions are obtained by high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. Interestingly, the derived carbon materials exhibited electric double&#8208;layer and pseudocapacitance properties because of the presence of metal ions with various valence states. Moreover, the presence of additional metal ions within carbon materials may create new phases, which can accelerate Na+ insertion/extraction and thus increase electrochemical adsorption. Density functional theory results showed that carbon materials in which Ti ions are confined exhibit enhanced insertion/extraction of Na+ resulting from the presence of the characteristic anatase crystalline phases of TiO2. The Ti&#8208;containing materials have an impressive desalination capacity (62.8&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1) in capacitive deionization (CDI) applications with high cycling stability. This work provides a facile synthetic strategy for the confinement of metal ions in metal&#8211;organic frameworks and thus supports the further development of derived carbon materials for seawater desalination by CDI.

         <title>Module&#8208;Assembled Elastomer Showing Large Strain Stiffening Capability and High Stretchability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elastomer with controlled polymer network structure is synthesized via the module&#8208;assembly strategy. The elastomer shows not only a high mechanical strength, stretchability, and damage tolerance, but also unprecedented strain&#8208;stiffening capability, where the apparent stiffness increases by &#8776;2000&#8208;fold upon stretching. This unusual strain stiffening is caused by strain&#8208;induced ordering of network chains.








Abstract
Elastomers are indispensable materials due to their flexible, stretchable, and elastic nature. However, the polymer network structure constituting an elastomer is generally inhomogeneous, limiting the performance of the material. Here, a highly stretchable elastomer with unprecedented strain&#8208;stiffening capability is developed based on a highly homogeneous network structure enabled by a module assembly strategy. The elastomer is synthesized by efficient end&#8208;linking of a star&#8208;shaped aliphatic polyester precursor with a narrow molecular&#8208;weight distribution. The resulting product shows high strength (&#8776;26&#160;MPa) and remarkable stretchability (stretch ratio at break &#8776;1900%), as well as good fatigue resistance and notch insensitivity. Moreover, it shows extraordinary strain&#8208;stiffening capability (&gt;2000&#8208;fold increase in the apparent stiffness) that exceeds the performance of any existing soft material. These unique properties are due to strain&#8208;induced ordering of the polymer chains in a uniformly stretched network, as revealed by in situ X&#8208;ray scattering analyses. The utility of this great strain&#8208;stiffening capability is demonstrated by realizing a simple variable stiffness actuator for soft robotics.

         <title>Fill in the Blank: Transferrable Deep Learning Approaches to Recover Missing Physical Field Information</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tackling with engineering problems requires filling in missing information and translation from limited data input to understand complex material behaviors. This study provides a deep&#8208;learning&#8208;based method to complete mechanical fields given part of the domain, further identify the internal composite microstructures, and solve the inverse problem in an efficient way, which overcomes the difficulty conventional approaches are faced with.








Abstract
Solving materials engineering tasks is often hindered by limited information, such as in inverse problems with only boundary data information or design tasks with a simple objective but a vast search space. To address these challenges, multiple deep learning (DL) architectures are leveraged to predict missing mechanical information given limited known data in part of the domain, and further characterize the composite geometries from the recovered mechanical fields for 2D and 3D complex microstructures. In 2D, a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) is utilized to complete partially masked field maps and predict the composite geometry with convolutional models with great accuracy and generality by making precise predictions on field data with mixed stress/strain components, hierarchical geometries, distinct materials properties and various types of microstructures including ill&#8208;posed inverse problems. In 3D, a Transformer&#8208;based architecture is implemented to predict complete 3D mechanical fields from input field snapshots. The model manifests excellent performance regardless of microstructural complexity and recovers the entire bulk field even from a single surface field image, allowing internal structural characterization from only boundary measurements. The whole frameworks provide efficient ways for analysis and design with incomplete information and allow the direct inverse translation from properties back to materials structures.

         <title>Bifunctional Ultrathin RhRu0.5&#8208;Alloy Nanowire Electrocatalysts for Hydrazine&#8208;Assisted Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifunctional ultrathin RhRu0.5&#8208;alloy wavy nanowire electrocatalysts are designed and synthesized via a facile solvothermal method, demonstrating excellent performance for the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and offering an attractive electrocatalyst system for hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolysis without ammonia as a byproduct.








Abstract
Hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolysis offers a feasible path for low&#8208;voltage green hydrogen production. Herein, the design and synthesis of ultrathin RhRu0.5&#8208;alloy wavy nanowires as bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the anodic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is reported. It is shown that the RhRu0.5&#8208;alloy wavy nanowires can achieve complete electrooxidation of hydrazine with a low overpotential and high mass activity, as well as improved performance for the HER. The resulting RhRu0.5 bifunctional electrocatalysts enable, high performance hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolysis delivering a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at an ultralow cell voltage of 54 mV and a high current density of 853&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 0.6&#160;V. The RhRu0.5&#160;electrocatalysts further demonstrate a stable operation at a high current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 80 hours of testing period with little irreversible degradation. The overall performance greatly&#160;exceeds that of the previously reported hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolyzers, offering a pathway for efficiently converting hazardous hydrazine into molecular hydrogen.

         <title>Molecular Sensitization Enabled High Performance Organic Metal Halide Hybrid Scintillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new material design concept is developed for the preparation of high performance organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid scintillation materials via low&#8208;temperature processes. With metal halides as X&#8208;ray sensitizer and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) organic cations as emitter, a single crystalline 0D organic metal halide hybrid ((TPA&#8208;P)2ZnBr4) is discovered to exhibit radioluminescence with an absolute light yield of 14,700 &#177; 800 Photons/MeV and a short decay lifetime of 9.96&#160;ns.








Abstract
Scintillators, one of the essential components in medical imaging and security checking devices, rely heavily on rare&#8208;earth&#8208;containing inorganic materials. Here, a new type of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid scintillators containing earth abundant elements that can be prepared via low&#8208;temperature processes is reported. With room temperature co&#8208;crystallization of an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) organic halide, 4&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylamino) phenyl)&#8208;1&#8208;(propyl)&#8208;pyrindin&#8208;1ium bromide (TPA&#8208;PBr), and a metal halide, zinc bromide (ZnBr2), a zero&#8208;dimensional (0D)&#160;organic metal halide hybrid (TPA&#8208;P)2ZnBr4 with a yellowish&#8208;green emission peaked at 550&#160;nm has been developed. In this hybrid material, dramatically enhanced X&#8208;ray scintillation of TPA&#8208;P+ is achieved via the sensitization by ZnBr42&#8722;. The absolute light yield (14,700&#160;&#177;&#160;800 Photons/MeV) of (TPA&#8208;P)2ZnBr4 is found to be higher than that of anthracene (&#8776;13,500 Photons/MeV), a well&#8208;known organic scintillator, while its X&#8208;ray absorption is comparable to those of inorganic scintillators. With TPA&#8208;P+ as an emitting center, short photoluminescence and radioluminescence decay lifetimes of 3.56 and 9.96&#160;ns have been achieved. Taking the advantages of high X&#8208;ray absorption of metal halides and efficient radioluminescence with short decay lifetimes of organic cations, the material design paves a new pathway to address the issues of low X&#8208;ray absorption of organic scintillators and long decay lifetimes of inorganic scintillators simultaneously.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Small High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles: Efficient Nanozyme for Enhancing Tumor Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultra&#8208;small PtPdRuRhIr high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles (US&#8208;HEANPs) are fabricated by the universal metal&#8208;ligand cross&#8208;linking strategy. This strategy takes advantage of simplicity, scalability, and genericity. The developed US&#8208;HEANPs exhibit excellent peroxidase&#8208;like activity and possess a high photothermal conversion effect. Under the synergistic effects of peroxidase&#8208;like activity and photothermal action, the US&#8208;HEANPs can effectively ablate cancer cells and treat tumors.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys nanoparticles (HEANPs) are receiving extensive attention due to their broad compositional tunability and unlimited potential in bioapplication. However, developing new methods to prepare ultra&#8208;small high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles (US&#8208;HEANPs) faces severe challenges owing to their intrinsic thermodynamic instability. Furthermore, there are few reports on studying the effect of HEANPs in tumor therapy. Herein, the fabricated PtPdRuRhIr US&#8208;HEANPs act as bifunctional nanoplatforms for the highly efficient treatment of tumors. The US&#8208;HEANPs are engineered by the universal metal&#8208;ligand cross&#8208;linking strategy. This simple and scalable strategy is based on the aldol condensation of organometallics to form the target US&#8208;HEANPs. The synthesized US&#8208;HEANPs exhibit excellent peroxidase&#8208;like (POD&#8208;like) activity and can catalyze the endogenous hydrogen peroxide to produce highly toxic hydroxyl radicals. Furthermore, the US&#8208;HEANPs possess a high photothermal conversion effect for converting 808&#160;nm near&#8208;infrared light into heat energy. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that under the synergistic effect of POD&#8208;like activity and photothermal action, the US&#8208;HEANPs can effectively ablate cancer cells and treat tumors. It is believed that this work not only provides a new perspective for the fabrication of HEANPs, but also opens the high&#8208;entropy nanozymes research direction and their biomedical application.

         <title>Asymmetrically Coordinated CoB1N3 Moieties for Selective Generation of High&#8208;Valence Co&#8208;Oxo Species via Coupled Electron&#8211;Proton Transfer in Fenton&#8208;like Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Asymmetrically coordinated CoB1N3 offers an external electric field for the cleavage of O&#63743;H bond to boost the selective conversion of high&#8208;valence Co&#8208;Oxo species in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, upon which the rational design of tunable active sites at atomic level in triggering efficient Fenton&#8208;like reactions is expected.








Abstract
High&#8208;valence metal species generated in peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like processes are promising candidates for selective degradation of contaminants in water, the formation of which necessitates the cleavage of O&#63743;H and O&#63743;O bonds as well as efficient electron transfer. However, the high dissociation energy of O&#63743;H bond makes its cleavage quite challenging, largely hampering the selective generation of reactive oxygen species. Herein, an asymmetrical configuration characterized by a single cobalt atom coordinated with boron and nitrogen (CoB1N3) is established to offer a strong local electric field, upon which the cleavage of O&#63743;H bond is thermodynamically favored via a promoted coupled electron&#8211;proton transfer process, which serves an essential step to further allow O&#63743;O bond cleavage and efficient electron transfer. Accordingly, the selective formation of Co(IV)&#63742;O in a single&#8208;atom Co/PMS system enables highly efficient removal performance toward various organic pollutants. The proposed strategy also holds true in other heteroatom doping systems to configure asymmetric coordination, thus paving alternative pathways for specific reactive species conversion by rationalized design of catalysts at atomic level toward environmental applications and more.

         <title>Atomic Displacements Enabling the Observation of the Anomalous Hall Effect in a Non&#8208;Collinear Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis shows that in thin films of some non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets the magnetic atoms can be displaced away from high&#8208;symmetry positions. The resulting spin canting allows for control of domain structure. In Mn3SnN this allows for the observation of an unusual temperature&#8208;dependent anomalous Hall effect that indicates the presence of a coherent spin&#8208;rotational non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnetic phase.








Abstract
Antiferromagnets with non&#8208;collinear spin structures display various properties that make them attractive for spintronic devices. Some of the most interesting examples are an anomalous Hall effect despite negligible magnetization and a spin Hall effect with unusual spin polarization directions. However, these effects can only be observed when the sample is set predominantly into a single antiferromagnetic domain state. This can only be achieved when the compensated spin structure is perturbed and displays weak moments due to spin canting that allows for external domain control. In thin films of cubic non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets, this imbalance is previously assumed to require tetragonal distortions induced by substrate strain. Here, it is shown that in Mn3SnN and Mn3GaN, spin canting is due to structural symmetry lowering induced by large displacements of the magnetic manganese atoms away from high&#8208;symmetry positions. These displacements remain hidden in X&#8208;ray diffraction when only probing the lattice metric and require measurement of a large set of scattering vectors to resolve the local atomic positions. In Mn3SnN, the induced net moments enable the observation of the anomalous Hall effect with an unusual temperature dependence, which is conjectured to result from a bulk&#8208;like temperature&#8208;dependent coherent spin rotation within the kagome&#160;plane.

         <title>An Integrally Formed Janus Hydrogel for Robust Wet&#8208;Tissue Adhesive and Anti&#8208;Postoperative Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrally formed asymmetrically adhesive hydrogel is fabricated by controlling the interfacial distribution of free &#8211;COOH groups via simply adjusting the stirring speed. The difference in adhesive strength achieves as high as 20 times between the two sides of one hydrogel, which attains one&#8208;sided robust adhesion to the wet tissue, simultaneously preventing the postoperative adhesion for the opposite side.








Abstract
Facile fabrication of asymmetrically adhesive hydrogel with robust wet tissue adhesion simultaneously with effective anti&#8208;postoperative adhesion still remains a great challenge. In this work, an integrally formed Janus hydrogel is facilely fabricated in one step by controlling the interfacial distribution of free carboxyl groups on the two sides of hydrogels. At a lower stirring speed, the generated bigger sized emulsion droplets mainly occupy the top surface of hydrogel, which effectively hinders the exposition of carboxyl groups on the top surface, driving them to be more distributed on the bottom surface, ultimately resulting in the poor adhesion of top surface but robust adhesion of bottom surface to various wet tissue even underwater. The difference in adhesive strength achieves as high as 20 times between the two surfaces. In vivo rabbit experiment outcomes clearly validate that the bottom surface of hydrogel firmly adheres to the stomach defect, and the other opposite surface can efficiently address the postoperative adhesion problem. Besides, this hydrogel exhibits superior mechanical toughness and conductivity which has been used as a highly adhesive strain sensor to real&#8208;time monitor the beating heart in vivo. This simple yet effective strategy provides a much more feasible approach for creating Janus hydrogels bioadhesives.

         <title>Dopant&#8208;Free Pyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Based (PPr) Polymeric Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Efficient Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells with Stability Over 6000&#160;h</title>

A new series of hydrophobic conducting polymers containing pyrrolopyrrole (PPr) and thioalkylated/alkylated bithiophene (SBT/BT) moieties is designed and synthesized to serve as hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) for tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells to attain a power conversion efficiency of 7.6% with shelf&#8208;storage stability over 6000 h, which opens a new avenue for future development of non&#8208;poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) HTMs with great performance and stability.








Abstract
A new set of pyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based (PPr) polymers incorporated with thioalkylated/alkylated bithiophene (SBT/BT) is synthesized and explored as hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) for Sn&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs). Three bithiophenyl spacers bearing the thioalkylated hexyl (SBT&#8208;6), thioalkylated tetradecyl (SBT&#8208;14), and tetradecyl (BT&#8208;14) chains are utilized to examine the effect of the alkyl chain lengths. Among them, the TPSCs are fabricated using PPr&#8208;SBT&#8208;14 as HTMs through a two&#8208;step approach by attaining a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.6% with a remarkable long&#8208;term stability beyond 6000 h, which has not been reported elsewhere for a non&#8208;PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based TPSC. The PPr&#8208;SBT&#8208;14 device is stable under light irradiation for 5 h in air (50% relative humidity) at the maximum power point (MPP). The highly planar structure, strong intramolecular S(alkyl)&#183;&#183;&#183;S(thiophene) interactions, and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation of SBT enable the PPr&#8208;SBT&#8208;14 device to outperform the standard poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene,&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl (P3HT) and other devices. The longer thio&#8208;tetradecyl chain in SBT&#8208;14 restricts molecular rotation and strongly affects the molecular conformation, solubility, and film wettability over other polymers. Thus, the present study makes a promising dopant&#8208;free polymeric HTM model for the future design of highly efficient and stable TPSCs.

         <title>Managing Interfacial Defects and Carriers by Synergistic Modulation of Functional Groups and Spatial Conformation for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Photovoltaics Based on Vacuum Flash Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective interfacial defect and carrier management strategy is developed by synergistically modulating organic functional groups and spatial conformation of organic ammonium salt modification molecules. The 3&#8208;ammonium propionic acid iodide&#8208;modified device based on vacuum flash technology achieves an alluring peak efficiency of 24.72% (certified 23.68%), which is among highly efficient devices fabricated without antisolvents.








Abstract
Interfacial nonradiative recombination loss is a huge barrier to advance the photovoltaic performance. Here, one effective interfacial defect and carrier dynamics management strategy by synergistic modulation of functional groups and spatial conformation of ammonium salt molecules is proposed. The surface treatment with 3&#8208;ammonium propionic acid iodide (3&#8208;APAI) does not form 2D perovskite passivation layer while the propylammonium ions and 5&#8208;aminopentanoic acid hydroiodide post&#8208;treatment lead to the formation of 2D perovskite passivation layers. Due to appropriate alkyl chain length, theoretical and experimental results manifest that &#63743;COOH and &#63743;NH3+ groups in 3&#8208;APAI molecules can form coordination bonding with undercoordinated Pb2+ and ionic bonding and hydrogen bonding with octahedron PbI64&#8722;, respectively, which makes both groups be simultaneously firmly anchored on the surface of perovskite films. This will strengthen defect passivation effect and improve interfacial carrier transport and transfer. The synergistic effect of functional groups and spatial conformation confers 3&#8208;APAI better defect passivation effect than 2D perovskite layers. The 3&#8208;APAI&#8208;modified device based on vacuum flash technology achieves an alluring peak efficiency of 24.72% (certified 23.68%), which is among highly efficient devices fabricated without antisolvents. Furthermore, the encapsulated 3&#8208;APAI&#8208;modified device degrades by less than 4% after 1400&#160;h of continuous one sun illumination.

Transdermal Drug Delivery
In article 2300066, Canan Dagdeviren and co&#8208;workers report a soft, conformable embodiment of a wearable ultrasound patch for transdermal delivery of cosmeceuticals to the skin. The patch comprises a 2D array of bulk piezoelectric transducers embedded in a poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrate. The patch demonstrates a 26.2&#8208;fold enhancement in the delivery of niacinamide to porcine skin in vitro with 10 min ultrasound application.

Hydrogel Bioadhesive
In article number 2300394, Tao Liu, Zhenzhen Liu, and co&#8208;workers propose a facile strategy to construct an asymmetrically adhesive hydrogel bioadhesive in one&#8208;step. The difference in adhesive strength achieved is as high as 20 times that between the two sides of one hydrogel, attaining one&#8208;sided robust adhesion to wet tissue, simultaneously preventing post&#8208;operative adhesion for the opposite side.

Artificial Intelligence
The search for new advanced materials has been a slow process, in which testing numerous compositions, morphologies etc. for their properties slows down discovery. High&#8208;throughput screening methods can greatly benefit from incorporating artificial intelligence, notably machine learning, techniques. These two routes combine in a cycle of materials science and technology progress reviewed by Cefe L&#243;pez in article number 2208683.

Colloidal Self Assembly
In article number 2211197, Dwaipayan Chakrabarti and co&#8208;workers report on the self&#8208;assembly of enantiomorphic single colloidal gyroid crystals in silico from designer chiral patchy spheres. Each of these crystals is shown to support a complete photonic bandgap, whilst also exhibiting rich chiroptical properties. This computational study introduces single colloidal gyroids as attractive targets for chiral photonic crystals operating at optical frequencies. Image credit: Wesley Flavell.

In&#8208;Memory Computing
In article number 2211406, Alessandro Chiolerio and co&#8208;workers report that an Fe3O4 water&#8208;based ferrofluid can perform electrical analogue computing and can be programmed using quasi&#8208;direct&#8208;current (DC) signals and read at radio&#8208;frequency (RF) mode. The colloid is capable of classifying digits of an 8 &#215; 8 pixel dataset through physical reservoir computing by training a readout layer.

Multicompartment Supraparticles
In article number 2211244, J. Scott VanEpps, Nicholas A. Kotov, and co&#8208;workers report how l&#8208;cysteine&#8208;stabilized FeS2 nanoparticles self&#8208;assemble into supraparticles with multiple interconnected compartments. Their structure can be described by graph theoretical representations that show similar organization and complexity to those of viruses. Similarly to the latter, the inorganic supraparticles pack the nucleic acid cargo for intracellular delivery while protecting it against environmental factors, such as temperature.

In article number 2211935, Renjie Hu, Wei Qin, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate how a chiral polymer PCDTPT can achieve clear resolution of circularly polarized light (CPL) from ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared regions based on the optimized device structures. The chirality&#8208;generated orbital angular momentum is one of the key factors determining the performance of circularly polarized light detection. Moreover, a magnetic field can enhance circularly polarized light detection, which provides a new perspective for the subsequent development of polarized light detectors.

         <title>Convective Thermal Metamaterials: Exploring High&#8208;Efficiency, Directional, and Wave&#8208;Like Heat Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Providing a new knob for controlling heat transfer, convective effects have gained significant interest in the design of thermal metamaterials. With the introduced efficient, directional, and wave&#8208;like heat transfer, many novel phenomena are observed in dissipative regime. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advancements in this emerging field are brought under the same umbrella, and a future perspective on promising directions is provided.








Abstract
Convective thermal metamaterials are artificial structures where convection dominates in the thermal process. Due to the field coupling between velocity and temperature, convection provides a new knob for controlling heat transfer beyond pure conduction, thus allowing active and robust thermal modulations. With the introduced convective effects, the original parabolic Fourier heat equation for pure conduction can be transformed to hyperbolic. Therefore, the hybrid diffusive system can be interpreted in a wave&#8208;like fashion, reviving many wave phenomena in dissipative diffusion. Here, recent advancements in convective thermal metamaterials are reviewed and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art discoveries are classified into the following four aspects, enhancing heat transfer, porous&#8208;media&#8208;based thermal effects, nonreciprocal heat transfer, and non&#8208;Hermitian phenomena. Finally, a prospect is cast on convective thermal metamaterials from two aspects. One is to utilize the convective parameter space to explore topological thermal effects. The other is to further broaden the convective parameter space with spatiotemporal modulation and multi&#8208;physical effects.

         <title>Graphene Spin Valves&#160;for Spin Logic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of spin logic devices and spin&#8208;FETs in graphene marks an important step for the future development of spin&#8208;based computing technology. Their low on/off switching energy, low Joule heating losses, and scalability are attractive features from a device perspective. The non&#8208;volatile nature of graphene spin logic devices can be exploited for logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory applications for neuromorphic computing architectures.








Abstract
An alternative to charge&#8208;based electronics identifies the spin degree of freedom for information communication and processing. The long spin&#8208;diffusion length in graphene at room temperature demonstrates its ability for highly scalable spintronics. The development of the graphene spin valve (SV) has inspired spin devices in graphene including spin field&#8208;effect transistors and spin majority logic gates. A comprehensive picture of spin transport in graphene SVs is required for further development of spin logic. This review examines the advances in graphene SVs and their role in the development of spin logic devices. Different transport and scattering mechanisms in charge and spin are discussed. Furthermore, the on/off switching energy between graphene SVs and charge&#8208;based FETs is compared to highlight their prospects for low&#8208;power devices. The challenges and perspectives that need to be addressed for the future development of spin logic devices are then outlined.

         <title>Intrinsic Optical Properties and Emerging Applications of Gold Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in nanoscience and technology have been promoted to reveal the physical origin of the intrinsic optical properties of gold nanostructures with consideration of size, shape, phase, composition, hybridization, assembly, and nanopatterning. The perspectives on the future developments, challenges, and opportunities of gold nanostructures are discussed to provide insights for improving their optical properties and performance in various applications.








Abstract
The collective oscillation of free electrons at the nanoscale surface of gold nanostructures is closely modulated by tuning the size, shape/morphology, phase, composition, hybridization, assembly, and nanopatterning, along with the surroundings of the plasmonic surface located at a dielectric interface with air, liquid, and solid. This review first introduces the physical origin of the intrinsic optical properties of gold nanostructures and further summarizes stimuli&#8208;responsive changes in optical properties, metal&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced optical signals, luminescence spectral shaping, chiroptical response, and photogenerated hot carriers. The current success in the landscape of nanoscience and nanotechnology mainly originates from the abundant optical properties of gold nanostructures in the thermodynamically stable face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase. It has been further extended by crystal phase engineering to prepare thermodynamically unfavorable phases (e.g., kinetically stable) and heterophases to modulate their intriguing phase&#8208;dependent optical properties. A broad range of promising applications, including but not limited to full&#8208;color displays, solar energy harvesting, photochemical reactions, optical sensing, and microscopic/biomedical imaging, have fostered parallel research on the multitude of physical effects occurring in gold nanostructures.

Artificial intelligence in general and machine learning in particular are gaining ever more importance in science and technology. In materials science, they are taking over tedious screening tasks and helping design and discover materials based on both explicit and tacit previous knowledge possessed by the scientist. Social and humanistic aspects are acquiring tremendous importance, as power and explainability seem to grow at the expense of each other.








Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining strength, and materials science can both contribute to and profit from it. In a simultaneous progress race, new materials, systems, and processes can be devised and optimized thanks to machine learning (ML) techniques, and such progress can be turned into innovative computing platforms. Future materials scientists will profit from understanding how ML can boost the conception of advanced materials. This review covers aspects of computation from the fundamentals to directions taken and repercussions produced by computation to account for the origins, procedures, and applications of AI. ML and its methods are reviewed to provide basic knowledge of its implementation and its potential. The materials and systems used to implement AI with electric charges are finding serious competition from other information&#8208;carrying and processing agents. The impact these techniques have on the inception of new advanced materials is so deep that a new paradigm is developing where implicit knowledge is being mined to conceive materials and systems for functions instead of finding applications to found materials. How far this trend can be carried is hard to fathom, as exemplified by the power to discover unheard of materials or physical laws buried in data.

         <title>Recent Advances in 4D Printing of Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 23, June 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) exhibit attractive stimuli&#8208;responsive properties, showing great application potential in soft robotics, biomedicine, optics, etc. The advent of 4D printing opens a new door for the design and fabrication of LCEs with programmable stimuli&#8208;responsive properties and 3D geometries. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in 4D printing of LCEs are reviewed, with emphasis on both mechanisms and potential applications.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are renowned for their large, reversible, and anisotropic shape change in response to various external stimuli due to their lightly cross&#8208;linked polymer networks with an oriented mesogen direction, thus showing great potential for applications in robotics, bio&#8208;medics, electronics, optics, and energy. To fully take advantage of the anisotropic stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors of LCEs, it is preferable to achieve a locally controlled mesogen alignment into monodomain orientations. In recent years, the application of 4D printing to LCEs opens new doors for simultaneously programming the mesogen alignment and the 3D geometry, offering more opportunities and higher feasibility for the fabrication of 4D&#8208;printed LCE objects with desirable stimuli&#8208;responsive properties. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in 4D printing of LCEs are reviewed, with emphasis on both the mechanisms and potential applications. First, the fundamental properties of LCEs and the working principles of the representative 4D printing techniques are briefly introduced. Then, the fabrication of LCEs by 4D printing techniques and the advantages over conventional manufacturing methods are demonstrated.

     alt="Recent Advances in 4D Printing of Liquid Crystal Elastomers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) exhibit attractive stimuli-responsive properties, showing great application potential in soft robotics, biomedicine, optics, etc. The advent of 4D printing opens a new door for the design and fabrication of LCEs with programmable stimuli-responsive properties and 3D geometries. The state-of-the-art advances in 4D printing of LCEs are reviewed, with emphasis on both mechanisms and potential applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are renowned for their large, reversible, and anisotropic shape change in response to various external stimuli due to their lightly cross-linked polymer networks with an oriented mesogen direction, thus showing great potential for applications in robotics, bio-medics, electronics, optics, and energy. To fully take advantage of the anisotropic stimuli-responsive behaviors of LCEs, it is preferable to achieve a locally controlled mesogen alignment into monodomain orientations. In recent years, the application of 4D printing to LCEs opens new doors for simultaneously programming the mesogen alignment and the 3D geometry, offering more opportunities and higher feasibility for the fabrication of 4D-printed LCE objects with desirable stimuli-responsive properties. Here, the state-of-the-art advances in 4D printing of LCEs are reviewed, with emphasis on both the mechanisms and potential applications. First, the fundamental properties of LCEs and the working principles of the representative 4D printing techniques are briefly introduced. Then, the fabrication of LCEs by 4D printing techniques and the advantages over conventional manufacturing methods are demonstrated. Finally, perspectives on the current challenges and potential development trends toward the 4D printing of LCEs are discussed, which may shed light on future research directions in this new field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular One&#8208; and Two&#8208;qubit Systems with very Long Coherence Times</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
General&#8208;purpose quantum computation and quantum simulation require multi&#8208;qubit architectures with precisely defined, robust interqubit interactions, coupled with local addressability. This is an unsolved challenge, primarily due to scalability issues. These issues often derive from poor control over interqubit interactions. Molecular systems are promising materials for the realization of large&#8208;scale quantum architectures, due to their high degree of positionability and the possibility to precisely tailor interqubit interactions. The simplest quantum architecture is the two&#8208;qubit system, with which quantum gate operations can be implemented. To be viable, a two&#8208;qubit system must possess long coherence times, the interqubit interaction must be well defined and the two qubits must also be addressable individually within the same quantum manipulation sequence. Here we present results on the investigation of the spin dynamics of chlorinated triphenylmethyl organic radicals, in particular perchlorotriphenylmethyl (PTM) radical, a mono&#8208;functionalized PTM and a biradical PTM dimer. We find extraordinarily long ensemble coherence times up to 148 &#956;s at all temperatures below 100&#160;K. We demonstrate two&#8208;qubit and, importantly, individual qubit addressability in the biradical system. These results underline the potential of molecular materials for the development of quantum architectures.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis and Excited&#8208;State Dynamics of Null Exciton&#8208;Coupled Diketopyrrolopyrroles Oligo&#8208;Grids</title>

Abstract
Exciton coupling in molecular aggregates plays a vital role in impacting and fine&#8208;tuning optoelectronic materials and their efficiencies in devices. A versatile platform to decipher aggregation&#8208;property relationships is built around multichromophoric architectures. Here, we designed a series of cyclic diketopyrrolopyrroles (DPPs) oligomers featuring nanoscale gridarene structures and rigid bifluorenyl spacers. Dimers and trimers, that is, [2]Grid and [3]Grid, were synthesized via one&#8208;pot Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions. The two of them, which are cyclic rigid nanoarchitectures of rather different sizes, were characterized by means of steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. This was not only meant to systematically investigate exciton couplings among DPPs but also to determine their excited&#8208;state dynamics. [2]Grid and [3]Grid exhibited monomer&#8208;like spectroscopic signatures in the steady&#8208;state measurements, from which we derive null exciton couplings. Moreover, in apolar solvent, high fluorescence quantum yields and excited&#8208;state dynamics that resembled DPP monomer were gathered. In polar solvent, the localized singlet excited state on a single DPP dissociates into the adjacent null coupling DPPs with charge transfer characteristics. This pathway facilitates the evolution of charge&#8208;separated states. [2]Grid, for example, reveals an efficient population of the symmetry&#8208;broken charge&#8208;separated state (SB&#8208;CS) in benzonitrile. Notable is the fact that the SB&#8208;CS of [2]Grid is, on one hand, in an equilibrium with the singlet excited state and promotes, on the other hand, the formation of the triplet excited state with a yield of 32% via charge recombination.

         <title>Defective Metal Oxides: Lessons from CO2RR and Applications in NOxRR</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boosting the intrinsic activity of active sites on oxide surfaces is a critical factor in promoting electrochemical conversion reactions. A special focus is placed on the structure&#8211;performance relationship of oxygen vacancies in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR)/nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) electrocatalysts. This work examines the formation/characterization of defects for CO2RR, taking learnings, challenges, and future directions in designing defective oxides for the emerging field of NO3RR.








Abstract
Sluggish reaction kinetics and the undesired side reactions (hydrogen evolution reaction and self&#8208;reduction) are the main bottlenecks of electrochemical conversion reactions, such as the carbon dioxide and nitrate reduction reactions (CO2RR and NO3RR). To date, conventional strategies to overcome these challenges involve electronic structure modification and modulation&#160;of the&#160;charge&#8208;transfer behavior. Nonetheless, key aspects of surface modification, focused on boosting the intrinsic activity of active sites on the catalyst surface, are yet to be fully understood. Engingeering of oxygen vacancies (OVs) can tune surface/bulk electronic structure and improve surface active sites of electrocatalysts. The continuous breakthroughs and significant progress in the last decade position engineering of OVs as a potential technique for advancing electrocatalysis. Motivated by this, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art findings of the roles of OVs in both the CO2RR and the NO3RR are presented. The review starts with a description of approaches to constructing and techniques for characterizing OVs. This is followed by an overview of the mechanistic understanding of the CO2RR and a detailed discussion on the roles of OVs in the CO2RR. Then, insights into the NO3RR mechanism and the potential of OVs on NO3RR based on early findings are&#160;highlighted. Finally, the challenges in designing CO2RR/NO3RR electrocatalysts and perspectives in studying OV engineering are provided.

         <title>Interface Engineering Toward Expedited Li2S Deposition in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: A Critical Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li2S deposition, the final discharge step contributing 75% capacity to Li&#8211;S batteries, remains a formidable issue due to its sluggish kinetics. The inferior deposition kinetics stem from the huge interfacial impedances, suggesting its interface&#8208;dominated nature. In this review, the progress and outlook of interface engineering for Li2S deposition, associated with the underlying mechanisms and potential problem&#8208;solving strategies, are reviewed.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) with superior energy density are among the most promising candidates of next&#8208;generation energy storage techniques. As the key step contributing to 75% of the overall capacity, Li2S deposition remains a formidable challenge for LSBs applications because of its sluggish kinetics. The severe kinetic issue originates from the huge interfacial impedances, indicative of the interface&#8208;dominated nature of Li2S deposition. Accordingly, increasing efforts have been devoted to interface engineering for efficient Li2S deposition, which has attained inspiring success to date. However, a systematic overview and in&#8208;depth understanding of this critical field are still absent. In this review, the principles of interface&#8208;controlled Li2S precipitation are presented, clarifying the pivotal roles of electrolyte&#8211;substrate and electrolyte&#8211;Li2S interfaces in regulating Li2S depositing behavior. For the optimization of the electrolyte&#8211;substrate interface, efforts on the design of substrates including metal compounds, functionalized carbons, and organic compounds are systematically summarized. Regarding the regulation of electrolyte&#8211;Li2S interface, the progress of applying polysulfides catholytes, redox mediators, and high&#8208;donicity/polarity electrolytes is overviewed in detail. Finally, the challenges and possible solutions aiming at optimizing Li2S deposition are given for further development of practical LSBs. This review would inspire more insightful works and, more importantly, may enlighten other electrochemical areas concerning heterogeneous deposition processes.

Two chlorine regioisomeric units are developed and incorporated into star polymer PM6 to achieve one of the most efficient polymer donors for organic solar cells. It is demonstrated that Cl&#8208;regioisomerization not only affects molecular coplanarity, crystallinity, and aggregation behavior, but also modulates electrostatic potential, donor&#8211;acceptor interaction, and phase&#8208;separation morphology, which are of great importance for device performance.








Abstract
Terpolymerization and regioisomerization strategies are combined to develop novel polymer donors to overcome the difficulty of improving organic solar cells (OSCs) performance. Two novel isomeric units, bis(2&#8208;hexyldecyl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;chlorothiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;3,6&#8208;dicarboxylate (TTO) and bis(2&#8208;hexyldecyl) 2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;chlorothiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;3,6&#8208;dicarboxylate (TTI), are obtained and incorporated into the PM6 backbone via random copolymerization to form a series of terpolymers. Interestingly, it is found that different chlorine (Cl) substituent positions can significantly change the molecular planarity and electrostatic potential (ESP) owing to the steric hindrance effect of the heavy Cl atom, which leads to different molecular aggregation behaviors and miscibility between the donor and acceptor. The TTO unit features a higher number of multiple S&#183;&#183;&#183;O non&#8208;covalent interactions, more positive ESP, and fewer isomer structures than TTI. As a result, the terpolymer PM6&#8208;TTO&#8208;10 exhibits a much better molecular coplanarity, stronger crystallinity, more obvious aggregation behavior, and proper phase separation in the blend film, which are conducive to more efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer. Consequently, the PM6&#8208;TTO&#8208;10:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based OSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 18.37% with an outstanding fill factor of 79.97%, which are among the highest values reported for terpolymer&#8208;based OSCs. This work demonstrates that terpolymerization combined with Cl regioisomerization is an efficient approach for achieving high&#8208;performance polymer donors.

         <title>Chloride&#8208;Based Additive Engineering for Efficient and Stable Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key role of methylammonium chloride additive in directing the crystallization of 1.8&#160;eV perovskites to induce more effective halide homogenization is elucidated. The as&#8208;formed perovskite demonstrates suppressed halide segregation, improved optoelectronic properties, and ambient stability. In conjunction with a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (Me&#8208;4PACz), a VOC of 1.25&#160;V and steady&#8208;state PCE of 17% are achieved.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite based tandem solar cells are promising to achieve power conversion efficiency beyond the theoretical limit of their single&#8208;junction counterparts. However, overcoming the significant open&#8208;circuit voltage deficit present in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells remains a major hurdle for realizing efficient and stable perovskite tandem cells. Here, a holistic approach to overcoming challenges in 1.8&#160;eV perovskite solar cells is reported by engineering the perovskite crystallization pathway by means of chloride additives. In conjunction with employing a self&#8208;assembled monolayer as the hole&#8208;transport layer, an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.25&#160;V and a power conversion efficiency of 17.0% are achieved. The key role of methylammonium chloride addition is elucidated in facilitating the growth of a chloride&#8208;rich intermediate phase that directs crystallization of the desired cubic perovskite phase and induces more effective halide homogenization. The as&#8208;formed 1.8&#160;eV perovskite demonstrates suppressed halide segregation and improved optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Rich MoSe2 2H/1T Hybrid Nanoparticles Prepared from Femtosecond Laser Ablation in Liquid and Their Enhanced Photothermal Conversion Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of spherical MoSe2 2H/1T hybrid nanoparticles are formed by ablating MoSe2 powder in isopropyl alcohol with a femtosecond laser: onion&#8208;structured nanoparticles and polycrystalline nanoparticles. Different formation mechanisms are identified for the two types of nanoparticles and the spherical nanoparticles have high photothermal conversion efficiencies thanks to defects and structural disorder in the nanoparticles.








Abstract
MoSe2 2H/1T hybrid nanoparticles are prepared by femtosecond laser ablation of MoSe2 powder in isopropyl alcohol with different laser powers and ablation times, and their formation mechanisms and photothermal conversion efficiencies (PTCEs) are studied. Two types of spherical nanoparticles are observed. The first type is onion&#8208;structured nanoparticles that are formed by nucleation on the surfaces of melted droplets followed by inward growth of {002} planes of MoSe2. The second type is polycrystalline nanoparticles, formed by coalescence of crystalline nanoclusters fragmented from the powder during the laser ablation. The nanoparticle size in all samples shows a bimodal distribution, corresponding to different fragmentation mechanisms. The 2H&#8208;to&#8208;1T phase transition in the nanoparticles is likely caused by electron doping from the laser&#8208;induced plasma. The PTCEs of the nanoparticles increase with laser power and ablation time; the highest PTCE is around 38%. After examining the bandgaps and the Urbach energies of the nanoparticles, it is found that the high PTCEs are primarily attributed to defects and structural disorder in the laser&#8208;synthesized nanoparticles, which allow absorption of photons with energies smaller than the bandgap energy and facilitate non&#8208;radiative recombination of photoexcited carriers.

         <title>Therapeutic DNAzymes: From Structure Design to Clinical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the tortuous development period, the research direction of therapeutic deoxyribozymes changes from verification of therapeutic ability to precise design, material construction, and collaborative application. This review summarizes the development process of therapeutic deoxyribozymes and analyzes the problems within the process and the corresponding solutions.








Abstract
Therapeutic DNAzymes have unceasingly intrigued the scientific community owing to their prosperous gene regulation capability. The efficacy of DNAzymes against many types of diseases has been extensively studied for over two decades. However, the high expectations for DNAzymes are still not translated to the clinic because of their low effectiveness in vivo. Over the last five years, several aspects have been considered to optimize DNAzyme&#8208;integrated therapeutics, including structural stability, mechanism exploration, cell internalization rate, cofactor activation, and off&#8208;target effects. Hence, this review first discusses the early monotherapy and structural design of DNAzymes. Subsequently, the latest modes of action are reviewed, followed by an elaboration on structural stabilization strategies considering the catalytic core and substrate&#8208;binding arms. DNAzyme&#8208;based synergistic therapy is then examined, highlighting responsive carrier construction, synergistic effects, the latest discovered advanced functions, and off&#8208;target concerns. Beyond this, key clinical advances in DNAzyme&#8208;based therapy are elucidated by showcasing clinical progress. Finally, future trends and development challenges for DNAzyme&#8208;powered therapeutics in the coming years are discussed in detail.

         <title>Surface Reconstruction for Efficient and Stable Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells with Greatly Suppressed Residual Strain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface reconstruction strategy is employed to achieve a strain&#8208;free perovskite film with simultaneously reduced defect density, suppressed ion migration, and improved energy level alignment. The resultant monolithic perovskite/black&#8208;silicon tandem realizes a certified stabilized efficiency &#8776;29.0%, which is among the best performances for perovskite/silicon tandems based on tunnel oxide passivated contacts.








Abstract
Despite the swift rise in power conversion efficiency (PCE) to more than 32%, the instability of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is still one of the key obstacles to practical application and is closely related to the residual strain of perovskite films. Herein, a simple surface reconstruction strategy is developed to achieve a global incorporation of butylammonium cations at both surface and bulk grain boundaries by post&#8208;treating perovskite films with a mixture of N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide and n&#8208;butylammonium iodide in isopropanol solvent, enabling strain&#8208;free perovskite films with simultaneously reduced defect density, suppressed ion migration, and improved energy level alignment. As a result, the corresponding single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells yield a champion PCE of 21.8%, while maintaining 100% and 81% of their initial PCEs without encapsulation after storage for over 2500&#160;h in N2 and 1800&#160;h in air, respectively. Remarkably, a certified stabilized PCE of 29.0% for the monolithic perovskite/silicon tandems based on tunnel oxide passivated contacts is further demonstrated. The unencapsulated tandem device retains 86.6% of its initial performance after 306 h at maximum power point (MPP) tracking under continuous xenon&#8208;lamp illumination without filtering ultraviolet light (in air, 20&#8211;35 &#176;C, 25&#8211;75%RH, most often &#8776;60%RH).

The unencapsulated tandem device retains 86.6% of its initial performance after 306 h at maximum power point (MPP) tracking under continuous xenon-lamp illumination without filtering ultraviolet light (in air, 20&#8211;35 &#176;C, 25&#8211;75%RH, most often &#8776;60%RH).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Albumin&#8208;Hitchhiking Drug Delivery to Tumor&#8208;Draining Lymph Nodes Precisely Boosts Tumor&#8208;Specific Immunity through Autophagy Modulation of Immune Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;responsive &#8220;albumin&#8208;hitchhiking&#8221; micelle POR/DT is established by self&#8208;assembly of tumor&#8208;targeting oxaliplatin prodrug (POR) and lipophilized trehalose prodrug (DT). POR prodrug can cause tumor cells&#8217; immunogenic death and antigen release, while lipophilic modification enhances autophagy inducer's binding to endogenous albumin and realizes TDLN&#8208;selective reflux, where it upregulates autophagy&#8208;mediated antigen processing and presentation in DCs.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are the first sites where tumor components reach and dendritic cells (DCs) present tumor&#8208;associated antigens to T cells. DCs rely on autophagy to process tumor antigens into epitope peptides to form epitope&#8208;MHC complexes. Selective delivery of autophagy&#8208;stimulating drugs to TDLNs may be a precise strategy to boost chemotherapy&#8208;induced antitumor immunity. Here, a multistage stimulating strategy is proposed to activate the antitumor immunity cascade by inducing immunogenic death of tumor cells and elevating antigen presentation of DCs in TDLNs. A tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive &#8220;albumin&#8208;hitchhiking&#8221; micelle is established by self&#8208;assembling tumor&#8208;targeting oxaliplatin prodrug and lipophilized trehalose prodrug. This demonstrates that lipophilic modification of trehalose with a DSPE tail and the precise exposure in the tumor site enhances its binding to endogenous albumin and realizes TDLNs&#8208;selective reflux, where it upregulates antigen processing and presentation of DCs. This study introduces an approach for targeted delivery to TDLNs and provides insights into mechanisms of autophagy in tumor&#8208;specific immunity.

         <title>Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries with an Ultralarge Discharge Capacity per Cycle and an Ultralong Cycle Life</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;electrode rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (T&#8208;RZABs) have a hydrophobic discharge cathode, a hydrophilic charge cathode, and a zinc&#8208;free anode. The decoupled cathodes enable fast ORR/OER kinetics and avoid oxidization of the ORR catalyst. The zinc&#8208;free anode suppresses hydrogen evolution and prevents Zn dendrites. The T&#8208;RZABs have an energy density of 151.8 Wh kg&#8722;1 and a cost of 46.7 US dollars kWh&#8722;1.








Abstract
A conventional two&#8208;electrode rechargeable zinc&#8211;air battery (RZAB) has two major problems: 1) opposing requirements for the oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions from the catalyst at the air cathode; and 2) zinc&#8208;dendrite formation, hydrogen generation, and zinc corrosion at the zinc anode. To tackle these problems, a three&#8208;electrode RZAB (T&#8208;RZAB) including a hydrophobic discharge cathode, a hydrophilic charge cathode, and a zinc&#8208;free anode is developed. The decoupled cathodes enable fast ORR and OER kinetics, and avoid oxidization of the ORR catalyst. The zinc&#8208;free anode using tin&#8208;coated copper foam that induces the growth of (002)Zn planes, suppresses hydrogen evolution, and prevents Zn corrosion. As a result, the T&#8208;RZABs have a high discharge capacity per cycle of 800 mAh cm&#8722;2, a low voltage gap between the discharge/charge platforms of 0.66&#160;V, and an ultralong cycle life of 5220 h at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. A large T&#8208;RZAB with a discharge capacity of 10 Ah per cycle with no obvious degradation after cycling for 1000 h is developed. Finally, a T&#8208;RZAB pack that has an energy density of 151.8 Wh kg&#8722;1 and a low cost of 46.7 US dollars kWh&#8722;1&#160;is assembled.

         <title>Reinforcing Co&#63743;O Covalency via Ce(4f)&#9472;O(2p)&#9472;Co(3d) Gradient Orbital Coupling for High&#8208;Efficiency Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Ce on CoO is prepared as a model to identify the active sites of rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based transition metal oxides toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the corresponding catalytic mechanism is elucidated. The Ce&#63743;O&#63743;Co unit site is identified as the active center. The enhanced OER performance is ascribed to reinforce Co&#63743;O covalency through Ce(4f)&#9472;O(2p)&#9472;Co(3d) gradient orbital coupling.








Abstract
Rare&#8208;earth (RE)&#8208;based transition metal oxides (TMO) are emerging as a frontier toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), yet the knowledge regarding their electrocatalytic mechanism and active sites is very limited. In this work, atomically dispersed Ce on CoO is successfully designed and synthesized by an effective plasma (P)&#8208;assisted strategy as a model (P&#8208;Ce SAs@CoO) to investigate the origin of OER performance in RE&#8211;TMO systems. The P&#8208;Ce SAs@CoO exhibits favorable performance with an overpotential of only 261&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and robust electrochemical stability, superior to individual CoO. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy reveal that the Ce&#8208;induced electron redistribution inhibits Co&#63743;O bond breakage in the Co&#63743;O&#63743;Ce unit site. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the gradient orbital coupling reinforces the Co&#63743;O covalency of the Ce(4f)&#9472;O(2p)&#9472;Co(3d) unit active site with an optimized Co&#8208;3d&#8208;eg occupancy, which can balance the adsorption strength of intermediates and in turn reach the apex of the theoretical OER maximum, in excellent agreement with experimental observations. It is believed that the establishment of this Ce&#8211;CoO model can set a basis for the mechanistic understanding and structural design of high&#8208;performance RE&#8211;TMO catalysts.

         <title>Enhancing Bioavailability of Fertilizer through an Amyloid&#8208;Like Protein Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocompatible and biodegradable protein coating can enhance droplet deposition and adhesion on superhydrophobic plant leaves. This coating packaging with fertilizers through electrostatic and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions affords a top&#8208;level retention capability for fertilizers, which could further improve the bioavailability of fertilizers and reduce at least 30% fertilizer use in scale&#8208;up applications in agriculture.








Abstract
Foliar fertilization acts as a ubiquitous component of conventional crop production, which brings considerable economic and ecological costs. Due to droplets rebounding and splashing during spraying and rain erosion, low bioavailability of fertilizer results in severe environmental pollution. Contrary to conventional fertilizer formulations with polymers, surfactants, and organic reagents, a method of improving fertilizer bioavailability based on a biocompatible protein coating is presented herein. In this system, whey protein concentrate (WPC) can undergo amyloid&#8208;like aggregation after the reduction of its disulfide bond by the reducing agent tris(2&#8208;carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP). Such aggregation affords a fast formation of the optically transparent and colorless phase&#8208;transitioned WPC (PTW) coating at the solid/water interface, with robust interfacial adhesion stability. Upon packaging with fertilizers through electrostatic and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, such reliable interfacial adhesion thereby facilitates the effective deposition of fertilizers on superhydrophobic and hydrophobic leaf surfaces, with excellent adhesion stability. Based on practical farmland test, this work demonstrates that the application of PTW can significantly boost the bioavailability of fertilizers and decrease at least 30% fertilizer use in large&#8208;scale crop planting. This innovative strategy has the great potential to offer a transformative step forward in managing fertilizer contamination and overuse in future agriculture.

         <dc:description>
Na2Ti3O7 microspheres with unique chemically bonded interfaces that demonstrate unparalleled cycling stability over the entire temperature range are fabricated as anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), highlighting the critical importance of manipulating the interfacial chemistry in SIBs, including the material and electrode/electrolyte interfaces.








Abstract
Titanates have been widely reported as anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, their wide temperature suitability and cycle life remain fundamental issues that hinder their practical application. Herein, a novel hollow Na2Ti3O7 microsphere (H&#8208;NTO) with a unique chemically bonded NTO/C(N) interface is reported. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the NTO/C(N) interface stabilizes the crystal structure, and the optimized interface enables the H&#8208;NTO anode to stably operate for 80&#160;000 cycles in a conventional ester electrolyte with negligible capacity loss. Optimizing the electrolyte allows the H&#8208;NTO electrode to cycle stably for 200 calendar days without capacity degradation at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. The excellent cycling stability is attributed to the NTO/C(N) interface and the stable solid electrolyte interphase formed by the highly adaptable electrolyte/electrode interface. Titanate exhibits solvent co&#8208;intercalation behavior in ether&#8208;based electrolytes, and its robust structure ensures that it can adapt to large volume changes at low temperatures. This study provides a unique perspective on the long&#8208;cycle mechanism of titanate anodes and highlights the critical importance of manipulating the interfacial chemistry in SIBs, including the material and electrode/electrolyte interfaces.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Narrowband Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitter Fusing Indolocarbazole Donors for BT. 2020 Red Electroluminescence and Ultralong Operation Lifetime</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pure&#8208;red multi&#8208;resonance emitter fused with indolocarbazole segments is developed, simultaneously redshifting and narrowing the emission color. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diode realizes BT.2020 red coordinates of (0.708, 0.292), also achieving an impressive maximum external quantum efficiency of 34.4% and an ultralong LT95 of over 10&#160;000&#160;h at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Polycyclic heteroaromatics with multi&#8208;resonance (MR) characteristics are attractive materials for narrowband emitters in wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, MR emitters with pure&#8208;red colors are still rare and usually exhibit problematic spectral broadening when redshifting emission. Here, a narrowband pure&#8208;red MR emitter is reported by fusing indolocarbazole segments into a boron/oxygen&#8208;embedded skeleton, realizing BT.2020 red electroluminescence for the first time together with a high efficiency and an ultralong lifetime. The rigid indolocarbazole segment possesses a strong electron&#8208;donating ability due to its para&#8208;positioned nitrogen&#8211;&#960;&#8211;nitrogen backbone and also enlarges the &#960;&#8208;extension of the MR skeleton to suppress structural displacement during radiation, achieving concurrently redshifted and narrowed emission spectrum. An emission maximum at 637 nm with a full width at half&#8208;maxima of merely 32&#160;nm (0.097&#160;eV) is recorded in toluene. The corresponding device simultaneously exhibits CIE coordinates of (0.708, 0.292) precisely matching the BT.2020 red point, a high external quantum efficiency of 34.4% with low roll&#8208;off and an ultralong LT95 (time to 95% of the initial luminance) of &gt;10&#160;000&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. These performance characteristics are superior even to those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite and quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;based devices for this specific color, paving the way toward practical applications.

         <title>Brightened Bicomponent Perovskite Nanocomposite Based on F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer for Micro&#8208;LED Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bicomponent perovskite nanocomposite based on F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer realizes near 100% quantum yield under excitation of 460 nm blue light. Color gamut of 135.90% NTSC and 101.47% BT.2020 is achieved when the bicomponent perovskite nanocomposites, as color conversion materials, combine with a GaN micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diode (micro&#8208;LED) array.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are&#160;making their way toward next&#8208;generation display applications, such as serving as color conversion layers in micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diode (micro&#8208;LED)&#160;arrays. Red PQDs containing iodine exhibit weaker brightness compared with their green counterpart when employed as color conversion layers. Therefore, PQDs with enhanced brightness are highly favorable for micro/mini&#8208;LED displays. A universal strategy of bicomponent perovskite nanocomposite (BPNC) with significantly enhanced photoluminescence (PL) intensity is proposed through the built&#8208;in F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the core CsPbBr3 to the shell &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3, and it is confirmed that it is through a pair of combined quasi&#8208;degenerate energy levels in the blue spectra region that the FRET is conducted, resulting in a high excitation wavelength selectivity. Owing to the highly efficient energy transition route from blue excitation to red emission established by the FRET, the BPNC exhibits the brightest single&#8208;peak red photoluminescence with near 100% quantum yield. The BPNC with FRET is further proven to be adaptable to a wide range of emission wavelengths. The BPNCs in a blue micro&#8208;LED array are employed as color downconversion layers, and excellent color conversion properties and high color gamut are demonstrated. This strategy of BPNC paves a road to the full&#8208;color micro&#8208;LED&#160;displays.

         <title>Activatable Sonoafterglow Nanoprobes for T&#8208;Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encompassing sonosensitizers, substrates, and quenchers, an ultrasound&#8208;induced afterglow imaging nanoprobe that can emit afterglow in deep&#8208;seated organs is presented. Only in response to granzyme B that is overexpressed by cytotoxic T cells, such a nanoprobe can be activated to emit sonoafterglow, permitting in vivo longitudinal monitoring of T&#8208;cell dysfunction in deep&#8208;seated autoimmune hepatitis after intravenous injection.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time imaging of immune systems benefits early diagnosis of disease and precision immunotherapy; however, most existing imaging probes either have &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; signals with poor correlation to immune responses, or rely on light excitation with limited imaging depth. In this work, an ultrasound&#8208;induced afterglow (sonoafterglow) nanoprobe is developed to specifically detect granzyme B for accurate imaging of T&#8208;cell immunoactivation in vivo. The sonoafterglow nanoprobe (Q&#8208;SNAP) consists of sonosensitizers, afterglow substrates, and quenchers. Upon ultrasound irradiation, sonosensitizers generate singlet oxygen, which converts substrates to high&#8208;energy dioxetane intermediates that slowly release energy after ultrasound cessation. Due to the proximity, energy from substrates can be transferred to quenchers, leading to afterglow quenching. Only in the presence of granzyme B,&#160;quenchers are liberated from Q&#8208;SNAP, resulting in bright afterglow emission with a limit of detection (LOD, 2.1&#160;nm) much lower than most existing fluorescent probes. Due to the deep&#8208;tissue&#8208;penetrating ultrasound, sonoafterglow can be induced through a tissue of 4&#160;cm thickness. Based on the correlation between sonoafterglow and granzyme B, Q&#8208;SNAP not only distinguishes autoimmune hepatitis from healthy liver as early as 4 h after probe injection, but also effectively monitors the cyclosporin&#8208;A&#8208;mediated reversal of T&#8208;cell hyperactivation. Q&#8208;SNAP thus offers the possibilities of dynamic monitoring of T&#8208;cell dysfunction and evaluation of prophylactic immunotherapy in deep&#8208;seated lesions.

         <title>Azide&#8208;Masked Resiquimod Activated by Hypoxia for Selective Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel azide&#8208;masked resiquimod prodrug (R848&#8208;N3) is designed to block its active amino group, which can be selectively activated in hypoxic tumors. The combination of R848&#8208;N3 and polymer vascular disrupting agent (CA4&#8208;NPs) results in higher tumor selectivity than the intratumor (i.t.) injection of R848 and combination with anti&#8208;PD1 can achieve 40% tumor cure rate without obvious side effects.








Abstract
Resiquimod (R848) is an immunomodulator that causes a severe systemic inflammatory reaction due to low tumor selectivity, thus hindering its use in cancer therapy. Therefore, an azide&#8208;masked prodrug (R848&#8208;N3) of R848 is developed, which is selectively activated to R848 in hypoxic tumors. R848&#8208;N3 significantly reduces pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines in treated mice to 1/12 compared to R848 at the same dose. In addition, combretastatin A4 nanoparticles (CA4&#8208;NPs) are used to enhance the tumor selectivity of R848&#8208;N3 by elevating the level of tumor hypoxia. R848&#8208;N3+CA4&#8208;NPs has higher tumor selectivity than the intratumoral injection of R848 at 1&#160;h after administration. The concentration of the active R848 in the tumor is 21.45&#8208;fold that in the heart. Benefiting from the high tumor selectivity of R848&#8208;N3, R848&#8208;N3+CA4&#8208;NPs+anti&#8208;PD1 exerted 94.1% tumor suppression and 40.0% tumor cure. Therefore, this work highlights the potential of azide&#8208;masking strategy in the development of tumor&#8208;selective prodrugs with reduced toxicity.

&lt;p&gt;A novel azide-masked resiquimod prodrug (R848-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is designed to block its active amino group, which can be selectively activated in hypoxic tumors. The combination of R848-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and polymer vascular disrupting agent (CA4-NPs) results in higher tumor selectivity than the intratumor (i.t.) injection of R848 and combination with anti-PD1 can achieve 40% tumor cure rate without obvious side effects.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Multi&#8208;Resonant Mie Resonator Arrays for Broadband Light Trapping in Ultrathin c&#8208;Si Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanophotonic design strategy to realize Mie&#8208;resonator arrays that can combine antireflection and light&#8208;trapping functions in a single, thin layer is discussed. The proposed light&#8208;trapping antireflection coating is experimentally demonstrated on a 2.8&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) solar cell, resulting in a 48% enhancement in the short&#8208;circuit current as compared to a planar cell and an absolute efficiency of 11.2%.








Abstract
Effective photon management is critical to realize high power conversion efficiencies for thin crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) solar cells. Standard few&#8208;100&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;thick bulk cells achieve light trapping with macroscopic surface textures covered by thin, continuous antireflection coatings. Such sizeable textures are challenging to implement on ultrathin cells. Here, it is illustrated how nanoscale Mie&#8208;resonator&#8208;arrays with a bimodal size distribution support multiple resonances that can work in concert to achieve simultaneous antireflection and light&#8208;trapping across the broad solar spectrum. The effectiveness of these light&#8208;trapping antireflection coatings is experimentally demonstrated on a 2.8&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick c&#8208;Si solar cell. The measured short&#8208;circuit current and corresponding power conversion efficiency are notably improved, achieving efficiencies as high as 11.2%. Measurements of the saturation current density on completed cells indicate that thermal oxides can effectively limit surface recombination. The presented design principles are applicable to a wide range of solar cells.

         <title>A&#160;Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Activatable Molecular Pro&#8208;Theranostic Agent for Photodynamic and Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fibroblast activation protein &#945; (FAP&#945;)&#8208;activatable pro&#8208;theranostic probe&#160;(FMP) has&#160;activated fluorescence and photoacoustic&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy immunotherapy for the simultaneous killing of cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and cancer cells. FMP&#8208;mediated immunotherapy can not only improve tumor immunogenicity, but also exhaust CAFs, promote cytotoxic T lymphocytes and aPD&#8208;L1 to enter the CAF&#8208;rich tumors, thus strengthening the synergistic antitumor immune response.








Abstract
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the major components of the tumor&#8208;associated matrix and play an important role in tumor progression and immunosuppression. Therefore, precise theranostics of CAFs are beneficial for CAFs&#8208;targeted therapies. However, imaging agents enabling precise theranostics of CAFs have been rarely exploited. To tackle this issue, a molecular pro&#8208;theranostic probe (FMP) with activatable fluorescence, photoacoustic (PA) imaging, and photodynamic therapy (PDT) is developed in response to fibroblast activation protein &#945; (FAP&#945;) overexpressed in &gt;90% types of CAFs and some tumor cells. Attributed to efficient activatable phototoxicity toward CAFs and tumor cells, together with activated immunogenic cell death (ICD), complete tumor regression of primary tumors and abscopal effect of distant tumors are observed in a 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice model. By integration with PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, enhanced systemic immune responses are evoked to obtain long&#8208;lasting tumor suppression of both primary and distant tumors as well as arrest systemic cancer metastasis in living mice.

An LGWH&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation system based on 3D superhydrophilic foam offers a record&#8208;high steam generation for clean water production and salt recovery from high salinity water (seawater or wastewater)








Abstract
Clean water scarcity and energy shortage have become urgent global problems due to population growth and human industrial development. Low&#8208;grade waste heat (LGWH) is a widely available and ubiquitous byproduct of human activities worldwide, which can provide effective power to address the fresh water crisis without additional energy consumption and carbon emissions. In this regard, 3D superhydrophilic polyurethane/sodium alginate (PU/SA) foam and LGWH&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation systems are developed, which can precipitate over 80&#160;L&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 steam generation from seawater and has favorable durability for purification of high salinity wastewater. The excellent water absorption ability, unobstructed water transport, and uniform thin water layer formed on 3D skeletons of PU/SA foam ensure the strong heat exchange between LGWH and fluidic water. As a result, the heat&#8208;localized PU/SA foam enables the efficient energy utilization and ultrafast water evaporation once LGWH is introduced into PU/SA foam as heat flow. In addition, the precipitated salt on PU/SA foam can be easily removed by mechanical compression, and almost no decrease in water evaporation rate after salt precipitation and removal for many times. Meanwhile, the collected clean water has high rejection of ions of 99.6%, which meets the World Health Organization (WHO) standard of drinking water. Above all, this LGWH&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation system presents a promising and easily accessible solution for clean water production and water&#8211;salt separation without additional energy burden for the society.

         <title>Dynamical Behaviors of Oscillating Metallosurfactant Coacervate Microdroplets under Redox Stress</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic coacervation is presented from redox&#8208;active metallosurfactants as a model system to study non&#8208;equilibrium phenomena in life. The compartmentalized protocell coacervates display collective dynamics that synchronize into system oscillations, showing autonomous death/regeneration and contraction/expansion cycles sustaining both in solution and at colloidal interface, allowing for dynamic sequestration, mass transport and passing through nanosized channels.








Abstract
Living systems create complex structures and functions by mastering self&#8208;organization in a variety of equilibrium and non&#8208;equilibrium states. Mimicking the dynamical phenomena with synthetic cell&#8208;like entities (protocells) under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions offers an important step toward the representation of minimum life. Here, the cell&#8208;sized coacervate microdroplets assembled from associative metallosurfactant coacervation via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) that exhibits non&#8208;equilibrium behaviors are reported. The compartmentalized protocell coacervates display collective dynamics that synchronize into system oscillations, showing autonomous death/regeneration and contraction/expansion cycles with external redox stress. The collective oscillation of abiotic metallosurfactant microdroplets can sustain both in solution and at the colloidal interface, allowing for dynamic sequestration, mass transport, and passing through nanosized channels, reminiscent of red blood cells&#160;that can deform and squeeze through narrow capillaries. The design of self&#8208;oscillating cell&#8208;sized constructs will shed a light on the creation of life&#8208;like soft materials with autonomous motion driven by complex chemical stimuli, which can be further used as nonbiological models for dynamic aggregates and intercellular communication.

         <title>Active Thermal Metasurfaces for Remote Heating/Cooling by Mimicking Negative Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A long&#8208;focus thermal lens with equivalent negative thermal conductivity is designed and experimentally realized to achieve a remote heating/cooling effect. The thermal lens consists of active thermal metasurfaces, which are constructed by p/n&#8208;type semiconductor pairs driven by a DC power supply. The proposed method can also achieve other novel thermal effects, such as thermal superlens and thermal tunneling effects.








Abstract
Remote temperature control can be obtained by a long&#8208;focus thermal lens that can focus heat fluxes into a spot far from the back surface of the lens and create a virtual thermal source/sink in the background material, around which the temperature field distribution can be remotely controlled by varying the parameters of the thermal lens. However, because of the lack of negative thermal conductivity, existing thermal lenses have extremely short focal lengths and cannot be used to remotely control the temperature field around the virtual thermal source/sink. In this study, a general approach is proposed to equivalently realize materials with negative thermal conductivity using elaborately distributed active thermal metasurfaces (ATMSs). Subsequently, the proposed ATMS is used to implement a novel thermal lens with a long focal length designed using transformation thermodynamics, and finally realize the ATMS with realistic materials and experimentally verify the performance of the designed long&#8208;focus thermal lens (measured focal length of 19.8&#160;mm) for remote heating/cooling. The proposed method expands the scope of the thermal conductivity and provides new pathways to realize unprecedented thermal effects with effective negative thermal conductivity, such as &#8220;thermal surface plasmon polaritons,&#8221; a thermal superlens, the thermal tunneling effect, and the thermal invisible gateway.

         <title>Hierarchically Ordered Macro&#8211;Mesoporous Electrocatalyst with Hydrophilic Surface for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt supported on carbon electrocatalyst with hollow&#8208;wall and 3D&#8208;ordered macroporous structures and hydrophilic surface is successfully prepared, showing high electrocatalytic performance in the oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer versatile templates/precursors to prepare supported metal catalysts. However, the afforded catalysts usually exhibit microporous structures and unsuitable wettability, which will restrict the accessibility of active sites in liquid&#8208;phase reactions. Herein, an etching&#8211;functionalization strategy is developed for the construction of a tannic&#8208;acid&#8208;functionalized MOF with a unique hollow&#8208;wall and 3D&#8208;ordered macroporous (H&#8208;3DOM) structure. The functional MOF can be further employed as an ideal precursor for the synthesis of cobalt supported on oxygen/nitrogen&#8208;co&#8208;doped carbon composites with H&#8208;3DOM structures, and hydrophilic surface. The H&#8208;3DOM structure can improve the external surface area to maximize the exposure of active sites. Moreover, the oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups can enhance the surface wettability to guarantee the external active sites to be more electrochemically accessible in aqueous electrolyte. Benefitting from these outstanding characteristics, H&#8208;3DOM&#8208;Co/ONC exhibits high electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction, superior to its counterparts without the hierarchically ordered structure and surface functionalization.

         <title>An Ion&#8208;Channel&#8208;Restructured Zwitterionic Covalent Organic Framework Solid Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A zwitterionic covalent organic framework (Zwitt&#8208;COF) is developed as a solid electrolyte for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries. The Zwitt&#8208;COF solid electrolyte exhibits a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity with a wide electrochemical window, leading to superior long&#8208;term cycle performance in the battery. Theoretical simulations reveal that Zwitt&#8208;COF promotes the dissociation of Li&#8208;ion pairs and provides ion channels for effective Li+ transport.








Abstract
Organic solid electrolytes offer an effective route for safe and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries. However, it remains a challenge to devise a new strategy to promote the dissociation of strong ion pairs and the transport of ionic components in organic solid electrolytes. Herein, a zwitterionic covalent organic framework (Zwitt&#8208;COF) with well&#8208;defined chemical and pore structures is prepared as a solid electrolyte capable of accelerating the dissociation and transport of Li ions. The Zwitt&#8208;COF solid electrolyte exhibits a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 1.65&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 with a wide electrochemical stability window. Besides, the Zwitt&#8208;COF solid electrolyte displays stable Li plating/stripping behavior via effective inhibition of the formation of Li dendrites and dead Li, leading to superior long&#8208;term cycle performance with retention of 99% discharge capacity and 98% Coulombic efficiency in an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal battery. Theoretical simulations reveal that the incorporation of zwitterionic groups into COF can facilitate the dissociation of strong ion pairs and reconstruct the AA&#8208;stacking configuration by dissociative adsorption of Li+ ions on Zwitt&#8208;COF producing linear hexagonal ion channels in the Zwitt&#8208;COF solid electrolyte. This strategy based on Zwitt&#8208;COF can provide an alternative way to construct various solid&#8208;state Li batteries.

         <title>Selective Potassium Deposition Enables Dendrite&#8208;Resistant Anodes for Ultrastable Potassium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
K@Bi80/NrGO anode is successfully designed as a dendrite&#8208;resistant anode. The K@Bi80/NrGO||K@Bi80/NrGO symmetric cell achieves an ultrastable reversible cycle up to 3000 h at a current density of 0.2 mA cm&#8211;2. The newly designed anode is expected to provide a fresh impetus to advance the development of potassium&#8208;metal anodes and beyond.








Abstract
Instability at the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and uncontrollable growth of potassium dendrites have been pressing issues for potassium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a self&#8208;supporting electrode composed of bismuth and nitrogen&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide (Bi80/NrGO) is designed as an anode host for potassium&#8208;metal batteries. Following the molten potassium diffusion into Bi80/NrGO, the resulting K@Bi80/NrGO exhibits unique hollow pores that provide K+&#8208;diffusion channels and deposition space to buffer volume expansion, thus maintaining the electrode structure and SEI stability. The K@Bi80/NrGO also provides a controlled electric field that promotes uniform K+ flux, abundant potassiophilic N sites, and Bi alloying active sites, collectively enabling precise nucleation and selective deposition of potassium to achieve dendrite&#8208;resistant anodes. With the K@Bi80/NrGO&#8208;based optimized electrodes, the assembled K@Bi80/NrGO symmetrical cells can sustain stable cycling over 3000&#160;h at a current density of 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Full cells with a&#160;Prussian blue cathode and K@Bi80/NrGO anode exhibit high stability (with no degradation for 1960 cycles at 1000&#160;mA g&#8722;1) with 99% Coulombic efficiency. This work may lead to the design of anodes with the triple attributes of precise nucleation, smooth diffusion, and dendrite inhibition, ideal for developing stable potassium&#8208;metal anodes and beyond.

With the K@Bi&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;/NrGO-based optimized electrodes, the assembled K@Bi&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;/NrGO symmetrical cells can sustain stable cycling over 3000&#160;h at a current density of 0.2&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Full cells with a&#160;Prussian blue cathode and K@Bi&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt;/NrGO anode exhibit high stability (with no degradation for 1960 cycles at 1000&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with 99% Coulombic efficiency. This work may lead to the design of anodes with the triple attributes of precise nucleation, smooth diffusion, and dendrite inhibition, ideal for developing stable potassium-metal anodes and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unconventional Giant &#8220;Magnetoresistance&#8221; in Bosonic Semiconducting Diamond Nanorings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale &#8220;diamond rings&#8221; provide unconventional giant &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221; for the development of new quantum devices. The unconventional giant &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221; caused by the trapping of Cooper pairs within the heavily boron&#8208;doped diamond nanorings, distinguishes itself from the conventional giant magnetoresistance originating from spin&#8208;dependent scattering of single electrons in layered magnetic materials.








Abstract
The emergence of superconductivity in doped insulators such as cuprates and pnictides coincides with their doping&#8208;driven insulator&#8211;metal transitions. Above the critical doping threshold, a metallic state sets in at high temperatures, while superconductivity sets in at low temperatures. An unanswered question is whether the formation of Cooper pairsin a well&#8208;established metal will inevitably transform the host material into a superconductor, as manifested by a resistance drop. Here, this question is addressed by investigating the electrical transport in nanoscale rings (full loops) and half loops manufactured from heavily boron&#8208;doped diamond. It is shown that in contrast to the diamond half&#8208;loops (DHLs) exhibiting a metal&#8211;superconductor transition, the diamond nanorings (DNRs) demonstrate a sharp resistance increase up to 430% and a giant negative &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221; below the superconducting transition temperature of the starting material. The finding of the unconventional giant negative &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221;, as distinct from existing categories of magnetoresistance, that is, the conventional giant magnetoresistance&#160;in magnetic multilayers, the colossal magnetoresistance&#160;in perovskites, and the geometric magnetoresistance in semiconductor&#8211;metal hybrids, reveals the transformation of the DNRs from metals to bosonic semiconductors upon the formation of Cooper pairs. DNRs like these could be used to manipulate Cooper pairs in superconducting quantum devices.

         <title>Expanding Embedded 3D Bioprinting Capability for Engineering Complex Organs with Freeform Vascular Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In vitro replication of the external geometry of specific organs and their internal structures simultaneously remains one of the greatest challenges in the biofabrication field. This study introduces a generalizable bioprinting strategy of sequential printing in a reversible ink template (SPIRIT) to address this limitation. Moreover, the SPIRIT technique significantly reduces the printing time compared to conventional bioprinting strategies.








Abstract
Creating functional tissues and organs in vitro on demand is a major goal in biofabrication, but the ability to replicate the external geometry of specific organs and their internal structures such as blood vessels simultaneously remains one of the greatest impediments. Here, this limitation is addressed by developing a generalizable bioprinting strategy of sequential printing in a reversible ink template (SPIRIT). It is demonstrated that this microgel&#8208;based biphasic (MB) bioink can be used as both an excellent bioink and a suspension medium that supports embedded 3D printing due to its shear&#8208;thinning and self&#8208;healing behavior. When encapsulating human&#8208;induced pluripotent stem cells, the MB bioink is 3D printed to generate cardiac tissues and organoids by extensive stem cell proliferation and cardiac differentiation. By incorporating MB bioink, the SPIRIT strategy enables the effective printing of a ventricle model with a perfusable vascular network, which is not possible to fabricate using extant 3D printing strategies. This SPIRIT technique offers an unparalleled bioprinting capability to replicate the complex organ geometry and internal structure in a faster manner, which will accelerate the biofabrication and therapeutic applications of tissue and organ constructs.

         <title>Stacking Faults Inducing Oxygen Anion Activities in Li2MnO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacking faults can promote the properties of materials in Li2MnO3. In this paper, the role and reasons for stacking faults in Li2MnO3&#160;are explored, revealing the importance of the O local environment. It is found that the longer Li&#63743;O bonds and smaller Li&#63743;O&#63743;Li bond angles induced by stacking faults promote O activities and Li ion migration.








Abstract
Controllable anionic redox for a transformational increase in the energy density is the pursuit of next generation Li&#8208;ion battery cathode materials. Its activation mechanism is coupled with the local coordination environment around O, which posts experimental challenges for control. Here, the tuning capability of anionic redox is shown by varying O local environment via experimentally controlling the density of stacking faults in Li2MnO3, the parent compound of Li&#8208;rich oxides. By combining computational analysis and spectroscopic study, it is quantitatively revealed that more stacking faults can trigger smaller Li&#63743;O&#63743;Li bond angles and larger Li&#63743;O bond distance in local Li&#8208;rich environments and subsequently activate oxygen redox reactivity, which in turn enhances the reactivity of Mn upon the following reduction process. This study highlights the critical role of local structure environment in tuning the anionic reactivity, which provides guidance in designing high&#8208;capacity layered cathodes by appropriately adjusting stacking faults.

         <title>Ablation of Gap Junction Protein Improves the Efficiency of Nanozyme&#8208;Mediated Catalytic/Starvation/Mild&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
FePGOGA&#160;nanozymes are constructed by Fe(III)&#8208;mediated oxidative polymerization, and co&#8208;loaded with GOx and Cx43 blockade peptides GAP19. The FePGOGAs exhibit excellent cascade peroxidase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;like activities that efficiently generate ROS and prevent ROS efflux through Cx43 degradation. The good synergistic effects of the catalytic/starvation/mildPTT therapies are confirmed in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated tumor catalytic therapy is typically hindered by gap junction proteins that form cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell channels to remove cytotoxic ROS, thereby protecting tumor cells from oxidative damage. In this work, a multifunctional nanozyme, FePGOGA, is designed and prepared by Fe(III)&#8208;mediated oxidative polymerization (FeP), followed by glucose oxidase (GOx) and GAP19 peptides co&#8208;loading through electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. The FePGOGA nanozyme exhibits excellent cascade peroxidase&#8208; and glutathione&#8208;oxidase&#8208;like activities that efficiently catalyze hydrogen peroxide conversion to hydroxyl radicals and convert reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione disulfide. The loaded GOx starves the tumors and aggravates tumor oxidative stress through glucose decomposition, while GAP19 peptides block the hemichannels by inducing degradation of Cx43, thus increasing the accumulation of intracellular ROS, and decreasing the transport of intracellular glucose. Furthermore, the ROS reacts with primary amines of heat shock proteins to destroy their structure and function, enabling tumor photothermal therapy at the widely sought&#8208;after mild temperature (mildPTT, &#8804;45&#160;&#176;C). In vivo experiments demonstrate the significant antitumor effectof FePGOGA on cal27 xenograft tumors under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. This study demonstrates the successful ablation of gap junction proteins to overcome resistance to ROS&#8208;mediated therapy, providing a regulator to suppress tumor self&#8208;preservation during tumor starvation, catalytic therapy, and mildPTT.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Tailored 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson Perovskites for Reconfigurable Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive mechanistic study of reconfigurable optoelectronic properties based on a nontrivial library of 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson perovskites with diamino group ligands by exposing/removing moisture is presented. The key to the moisture&#8208;controlled reconfigurable properties lies in the formation of hydrogen bonding between the diamino group and water molecules, preventing their escape.








Abstract
Humidity&#8208; and moisture&#8208;induced degradation has been a longstanding problem in perovskite materials, affecting their long&#8208;term stability during applications. Counterintuitively, the moisture is leveraged to tailor the reversible hydrochromic behaviors of a new series of 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites for reconfigurable optoelectronics. In particular, the hydrogen bonds between organic cations and water molecules can be dynamically modulated via moisture removal/exposure. Remarkably, such modulation confines the movement of the organic cations close to the original position, preventing their escape from crystal lattices. Furthermore, this mechanism is elucidated by theoretical analysis using first&#8208;principles calculations and confirmed with the experimental characterizations. The reversible fluorescent transition 2D DJ perovskites show excellent cyclical properties, presenting untapped opportunities for reconfigurable optoelectronic applications. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, an anti&#8208;counterfeiting display is shown based on patterned reversible 2D DJ perovskites. The results represent a new avenue of reconfigurable optoelectronic application with 2D DJ perovskites for humidity detection, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensing, and other emerging photoelectric intelligent technologies.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Thin Lithium Silicide Interlayer for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;thin nanoporous lithium silicide&#8208;based interlayer, acting as a mixed ionic and electronic conductor, is proposed for high energy and safe all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8208;batteries using lithium anode. The interlayer not only regulates LiBCC deposition and stripping but also serves as a 3D scaffold for Li ad&#8208;atom formation, LiBCC nucleation, and long&#8208;range transport of ions and electrons at solid&#8208;state electrolyte/LiBCC interface.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with metallic lithium (LiBCC) anode and solid electrolyte (SE) are under active development. However, an unstable SE/LiBCC interface due to electrochemical and mechanical instabilities hinders their operation. Herein, an ultra&#8208;thin nanoporous mixed ionic and electronic conductor (MIEC) interlayer (&#8776;3.25 &#181;m), which regulates LiBCC deposition and stripping, serving as a 3D scaffold for Li0 ad&#8208;atom formation, LiBCC nucleation, and long&#8208;range transport of ions and electrons at SE/LiBCC interface is demonstrated. Consisting of lithium silicide and carbon nanotubes, the MIEC interlayer is thermodynamically stable against LiBCC and highly lithiophilic. Moreover, its nanopores (&lt;100 nm) confine the deposited LiBCC to the size regime where LiBCC exhibits &#8220;smaller is much softer&#8221; size&#8208;dependent plasticity governed by diffusive deformation mechanisms. The LiBCC thus remains soft enough not to mechanically penetrate SE in contact. Upon further plating, LiBCC grows in between the current collector and the MIEC interlayer, not directly contacting the SE. As a result, a full&#8208;cell having Li3.75Si&#8208;CNT/LiBCC foil as an anode and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 as a cathode displays a high specific capacity of 207.8 mAh g&#8722;1, 92.0% initial Coulombic efficiency, 88.9% capacity retention after 200 cycles (Coulombic efficiency reaches 99.9% after tens of cycles), and excellent rate capability (76% at 5 C).

         <title>Monolayer Superconductivity and Tunable Topological Electronic Structure at the Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk FeTe0.55Se0.45 is a promising candidate for topological superconductivity but the inhomogeneity from doping raises doubts about the existence of Majorana modes. This work explores thin films of FeTe1&#8208;ySey (Fe(Te,Se)) grown on Bi2Te3 that reveal superconductivity at the monolayer limit. Control over the interfacial electronic structure is demonstrated to maintain the spin&#8208;momentum locking necessary for topological superconductivity with significantly less doping.








Abstract
The interface between 2D topological Dirac states and an s&#8208;wave superconductor is expected to support Majorana&#8208;bound states (MBS) that can be used for quantum computing applications. Realizing these novel states of matter and their applications requires control over superconductivity and spin&#8208;orbit coupling to achieve spin&#8208;momentum&#8208;locked topological interface states (TIS) which are simultaneously superconducting. While signatures of MBS have been observed in the magnetic vortex cores of bulk FeTe0.55Se0.45, inhomogeneity and disorder from doping make these signatures unclear and inconsistent between vortices. Here superconductivity is reported in monolayer (ML) FeTe1&#8211;ySey (Fe(Te,Se)) grown on Bi2Te3 by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Spin and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES) directly resolve the interfacial spin and electronic structure of Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 heterostructures. For y&#160;= 0.25, the Fe(Te,Se) electronic structure is found to overlap with the Bi2Te3 TIS and the desired spin&#8208;momentum locking is not observed. In contrast, for y&#160;= 0.1, reduced inhomogeneity measured by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and a smaller Fe(Te,Se) Fermi surface with clear spin&#8208;momentum locking in the topological states are found. Hence, it is demonstrated that the Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 system is a highly tunable platform for realizing MBS where reduced doping can improve characteristics important for Majorana interrogation and potential applications.

         <title>Controlled Interfacial Polymer Self&#8208;Assembly Coordinates Ultrahigh Drug Loading and Zero&#8208;Order Release in Particles Prepared under Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controlled interfacial polymer self&#8208;assembly enables the engineering of a microparticle that simultaneously features efficient protein and peptide encapsulation (up to 99.9%), ultrahigh mass fraction of therapeutics (up to 49.9%), and zero&#8208;order release of payloads. The developed strategy sets a new paradigm to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacological performances of water&#8208;soluble therapeutics.








Abstract
Microparticles are successfully engineered through controlled interfacial self&#8208;assembly of polymers to harmonize ultrahigh drug loading with zero&#8208;order release of protein payloads. To address their poor miscibility with carrier materials, protein molecules are transformed into nanoparticles, whose surfaces are covered with polymer molecules. This polymer layer hinders the transfer of cargo nanoparticles from oil to water, achieving superior encapsulation efficiency (up to 99.9%). To control payload release, the polymer density at the oil&#8211;water interface is enhanced, forming a compact shell for microparticles. The resultant microparticles can harvest up to 49.9% mass fraction of proteins with zero&#8208;order release kinetics in vivo, enabling an efficient glycemic control in type 1 diabetes. Moreover, the precise control of engineering process offered through continuous flow results in high batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility and, ultimately, excellent scale&#8208;up feasibility.

         <title>Orbital Symmetry Engineering in Fused Polycyclic Heteroaromatics toward Extremely Narrowband Green Emissions with an FWHM of 13&#160;nm</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular orbital interactions are demonstrated to be crucial to the energy gap and spectral bandwidth of multi&#8208;resonance emitters. Correspondingly, the first indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole embedded green fluorophore is developed with the smallest full width at half maximum of 13&#160;nm (0.064&#160;eV), accompanied by high external quantum efficiency of 30.9% and significantly alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off.








Abstract
Multiresonance (MR) molecules generally face spectral broadening issues with redshifted emissions. Thus, green emitters with full widths at half maximum (FWHMs) of &lt;20&#160;nm are rarely reported, despite being highly desired. Herein, by properly fusing indolo(3,2,1&#8208;jk)carbazole (ICZ) and naphthalene moieties, green MR emitters are reported, which have FWHMs of merely 13&#160;nm (0.064&#160;eV) and 14&#160;nm (0.069&#160;eV) in dichloromethane, accompanied by high photoluminescence quantum yields of &gt;95%, which represent not only the smallest FWHMs among all green MR emitters but also the first green emitters based on ICZ MR derivatives. Theoretical studies reveal that the orbital interactions between the antisymmetric sites of the segments play an important role in extending the conjugation length in the fusion architectures while simultaneously maintaining a small FWHM. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit green emission peaks at 508&#8211;509&#160;nm and the first green electroluminescence FWHM of &lt;20&#160;nm ever reported. Benefiting from the preferential horizontal dipole orientation, a high maximum external quantum efficiency of up to 30.9% is obtained, which remains at 28.9% and 23.2% under luminances of 1000 and 10&#160;000 cd&#160;m&#8722;2, respectively, outperforming most reported green devices based on narrowband emitters.

         <title>Hygrothermic Wood Actuated Robotic Hand</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hygrothermic wood actuator with asymmetric water affinity is developed, which generates stretching and bending responses to moisture and thermal/light stimulation. Multiple advantages are realized, including good mechanical properties, multi&#8208;stimulus response, complex deformation, wide working temperature range, low manufacturing cost, and biocompatibility. A robotic hand and grippers are designed for dexterous object&#8211;hand interactions and fire rescue scenarios.








Abstract
Stimulus&#8211;responsive actuators play a vital role in the new generation of intelligent systems. However, poor mechanical performance, complicated fabrication processes, and the inability to complex deformation limit their practical applications. Herein, these challenges are overcome via designing a strong hygrothermic wood actuator with asymmetric water affinity. The actuator is readily constructed by sandwiching polypyrrole&#8208;coated wood with a Ni complex hygroscopic gel top layer for moisture absorption and a polyimide bottom layer as the water barrier. The resulting hygrothermic wood spontaneously stretches and bends itself in response to moisture and thermal/light stimulation. A robotic hand and a series of grippers made of hygrothermic wood demonstrate dexterous object&#8211;hand interactions during grasping and holding, while the reversible hygrothermic property allows the actuator to be potentially applied in fire rescue scenarios to rescue trapped objects. A combination of good mechanical properties, multi&#8208;stimulus&#8208;response, complex deformation, wide working temperature range, low manufacturing cost, and biocompatibility are simultaneously realized by one device. It is thus believed that such a strong wood actuator will open up a new avenue for building intelligent robotic hand systems.

         <title>Efficient Inorganic Vapor&#8208;Assisted Defects Passivation for Perovskite Solar Module</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CS2 vapor passivation strategy is proposed to reduce defects in FAPbI3 films. It is revealed that the CS2 can strongly coordinate with the undercoordinated Pb2+ and passivate iodide vacancy defects, aligns the interface to facilitate the carrier transport, resulting in remarkably enhance efficiency of the devices (25.20% for 0.08&#160;cm2 and 20.66% for 40.6&#160;cm2).








Abstract
Surface trap as intrinsic defects&#8208;mediated non&#8208;radiative charge recombination is a major obstacle to achieving the reliable fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency and large&#8208;area perovskite photovoltaics. Here a CS2 vapor&#8208;assisted passivation strategy is proposed for perovskite solar module, aiming to passivate the iodine vacancy and uncoordinated Pb2+ caused by ion migration. Significantly, this method can avoid the disadvantages of inhomogeneity film caused by spin&#8208;coating&#8208;assisted passivation and reconstruction of perovskite surface from solvent. The CS2 vapor passivated perovskite device presents a higher defect formation energy (0.54&#160;eV) of iodine vacancy than the pristine (0.37&#160;eV), while uncoordinated Pb2+ is bonded with CS2. The shallow level defect passivation of iodine vacancy and uncoordinated Pb2+ has obviously enhanced the device efficiencies (25.20% for 0.08&#160;cm2 and 20.66% for 40.6&#160;cm2) and the stability, exhibiting an average T80&#8208;lifetime of 1040&#160;h working at the maximum power point, and maintaining over 90% of initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h at RH&#160;=&#160;30% and 30&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Wide&#8208;Humidity Range Applicable, Anti&#8208;Freezing, and Healable Zwitterionic Hydrogels for Ion&#8208;Leakage&#8208;Free Iontronic Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solketal, outperforming the commonly used solvent glycerol, endows healable zwitterionic hydrogels with wide&#8208;humidity range applicability and freeze resistance. The optimized zwitterionic hydrogel satisfactorily serves as a dielectric layer to construct iontronic sensors with no ionic leakage, high sensitivity, and environmental stability. A whole&#8208;body healable, stretchable, and highly&#8208;sensitive sensor based on the zwitterionic hydrogels and composites is demonstrated.








Abstract
Hydrogels have entered the spotlight for applications in soft electronics. It is essential and challenging to obtain hydrogels that can function properly under varying environmental circumstances, that is, 30&#8211;90% relative humidity (RH) and &#8722;20 to 40&#160;&#176;C due to their intrinsic nature to lose and absorb water upon variations in humidity and temperature. In this work, a green solvent, solketal, is introduced into poly 3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;methylprop&#8208;2&#8208;enoyloxy)ethyl azaniumyl propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate (poly(DMAPS)) zwitterionic hydrogels. Compared to glycerol, solketal endows hydrogels with greater possibility for further modification as well as improved water content and mechanical performance consistency over 30&#8211;90% RH. Encouragingly, the optimized hydrogel demonstrates its unique merits as a dielectric layer in iontronic sensors, featuring non&#8208;leaky ions, high sensitivity (1100 kPa&#8722;1), wide humidity, and temperature range applicability. A wide&#8208;humidity range healable and stretchable electrode is attained by combining the hydrogel substrate with Ag paste. A&#160;full&#8208;device healable and highly&#8208;sensitive sensor is developed. This study is a pioneering work that tackles the broad humidity range applicability issue of hydrogels, and demonstrates the ion&#8208;leakage&#8208;free ionic skins with zwitterionic dielectrics. The outcomes of the study will considerably promote advancements in the fields of hydrogel electronics and iontronic sensors.

         <title>Extremely Tough, Stretchable Gel Electrolytes with Strong Interpolymer Hydrogen Bonding Prepared Using Concentrated Electrolytes to Stabilize Lithium&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>

Extremely tough and stretchable gel electrolytes are prepared by leveraging the strong interpolymer hydrogen bonding in concentrated electrolytes. The tough gel electrolyte can be used as an artificial protective layer for lithium (Li)&#8208;metal anodes. The hydrogen&#8208;bonded gel&#8208;coated Li&#8208;metal anode considerably enhances the cycling stability of a Li symmetric cell as well as a Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NMC622) full cell.








Abstract
Extremely tough and stretchable gel electrolytes, which can be prepared by leveraging the strong interpolymer hydrogen bonding in concentrated lithium (Li)&#8208;salt electrolytes, are reported. These electrolytes can be realized by optimizing the competitive hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between polymer chains, solvent molecules, Li cations, and counteranions. Free polar solvent molecules, which typically impede interpolymer hydrogen bonding, are scarce in concentrated electrolytes; this feature can be exploited to prepare hydrogen&#8208;bonded gel electrolytes with unprecedented toughness. In contrast, free solvent molecules are abundant in electrolytes with typical concentrations, yielding considerably weaker gel electrolytes. The tough gel electrolyte can be used an artificial protective layer for Li&#8208;metal anodes, as it considerably enhances the cycling stability of a Li symmetric cell through uniform Li deposition/dissolution. Additionally, employing the gel electrolyte as the protecting layer significantly improves the cycling performance of the Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 full cell.

         <title>Ti3C2Tx MXene van der Waals Gate Contact for GaN High Electron Mobility Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ti3C2Tx MXene films are integrated into GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) as gate contacts, wherein van der Waals heterojunctions are formed between MXene films and GaN without direct chemical bonding. The Schottky gate GaN HEMTs with enhanced gate controllability exhibit a record high ION/IOFF current ratio of &#8776;1013 and a near&#8208;ideal subthreshold swing of 61&#160;mV dec&#8722;1.








Abstract
Gate controllability is a key factor that determines the performance of GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). However, at the traditional metal&#8208;GaN interface, direct chemical interaction between metal and GaN can result in fixed charges and traps, which can significantly deteriorate the gate controllability. In this study, Ti3C2Tx MXene films are integrated into GaN HEMTs as the gate contact, wherein van der Waals heterojunctions are formed between MXene films and GaN without direct chemical bonding. The GaN HEMTs with enhanced gate controllability exhibit an extremely low off&#8208;state current (IOFF) of 10&#8722;7 mA&#160;mm&#8722;1, a record high ION/IOFF current ratio of &#8776;1013 (which is six orders of magnitude higher than conventional Ni/Au contact), a high off&#8208;state drain breakdown voltage of 1085&#160;V, and a near&#8208;ideal subthreshold swing of 61 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1. This work shows the great potential of MXene films as gate electrodes in wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductor devices.

         <title>Unusual Temperature Dependence of Water Sorption in Semicrystalline Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Materials typically lose their water sorption capability with increasing temperature. Can this temperature effect be reversed? By leveraging the phase transformation of semicrystalline hydrogels, an unusual water sorption behavior is demonstrated where the water uptake can be doubled with an increased temperature of 25&#160;&#176;C. This finding will enable a new degree of freedom to harness moisture and heat.








Abstract
Water vapor sorption is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature and plays an important role in various applications, including humidity regulation, energy storage, thermal management, and water harvesting. In particular, capturing moisture at elevated temperatures is highly desirable to prevent dehydration and to enlarge the tunability of water uptake. However, owing to the thermodynamic limit of conventional materials, sorbents inevitably tend to capture less water vapor at higher temperatures, impeding their broad applications. Here, an inverse temperature dependence of water sorption in poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels, where their water uptake can be doubled with increasing temperature from 25 to 50&#160;&#176;C, is reported. With mechanistic modeling of water&#8211;polymer interactions, this unusual water sorption is attributed to the first&#8208;order phase transformation of PEG structures, and the key parameters for a more generalized strategy in materials development are identified. This work elucidates a new regime of water sorption with an unusual temperature dependence, enabling a promising engineering space for harnessing moisture and heat.

         <title>Artificial Tendrils Mimicking Plant Movements by Mismatching Modulus and Strain in Core and Shell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological principles of tendril movement and coiling in plants are studied and used as design criteria to implement coiling movements in an artificial multimaterial fiber (MMFs) system. The MMFs are composed of a shape&#8208;memory core and an elastic shell, such that the core enables the implementation of strain displacement in the MMF by physical means and provides thermally controlled reversible coiling movement.








Abstract
Motile organs have evolved in climbing plants enabling them to find a support and, after secure attachment, to reach for sunlight without investing in a self&#8208;supporting stem. Searching movements, the twining of stems, and the coiling of tendrils are involved in successful plant attachment. Such coiling movements have great potential in robotic applications, especially if they are reversible. Here, the underlying mechanism of tendril movement based on contractile fibers is reported, as illustrated by a function&#8211;morphological analysis of tendrils in several liana species and the encoding of such a principle in a core&#8211;shell multimaterial fiber (MMF) system. MMFs are composed of a shape&#8208;memory core fiber (SMCF) and an elastic shell. The shape&#8208;memory effect of the core fibers enables the implementation of strain mismatch in the MMF by physical means and provides thermally controlled reversible motion. The produced MMFs show coiling and/or uncoiling behavior, with a high reversible actuation magnitude of &#8776;400%, which is almost 20 times higher compared with similar stimuli for sensitive soft actuators. The movements in these MMFs rely on the crystallization/melting behavior of oriented macromolecules of SMCF.

         <title>Diagnosing and Correcting the Failure of the Solid&#8208;State Polymer Electrolyte for Enhancing Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clogging of &#8220;dead&#8221; polysulfides on the electrode interface in a diffusion&#8208;restricted solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte (SPE) is identified as a critical failure cause of solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries, which can be addressed by applying single&#8208;atom electrocatalysis to tailor the chemical environment in the SPE.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) attract great interest in developing high&#8208;performance yet reliable solid&#8208;state batteries. However, understanding of the failure mechanism of the SPE and SPE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries remains in its infancy, posing a great barrier to practical solid&#8208;state batteries. Herein, the high accumulation and clogging of &#8220;dead&#8221; lithium polysulfides (LiPS) on the interface between the cathode and SPE with intrinsic diffusion limitation is identified as a critical failure cause of SPE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries. It induces a poorly reversible chemical environment with retarded kinetics on the cathode&#8211;SPE interface and in bulk SPEs, starving the Li&#8211;S redox in solid&#8208;state cells. This observation is different from the case in liquid electrolytes with free solvent and charge carriers, where LiPS dissolve but remain alive for electrochemical/chemical redox without interfacial clogging. Electrocatalysis demonstrates the feasibility of tailoring the chemical environment in diffusion&#8208;restricted reaction media for reducing Li&#8211;S redox failure in the SPE. It enables Ah&#8208;level solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S pouch cells with a high specific energy of 343&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 on the cell level. This work may shed new light on the understanding of the failure mechanism of SPE for bottom&#8208;up improvement of solid&#8208;state Li&#8211;S batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Solid-state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) attract great interest in developing high-performance yet reliable solid-state batteries. However, understanding of the failure mechanism of the SPE and SPE-based solid-state batteries remains in its infancy, posing a great barrier to practical solid-state batteries. Herein, the high accumulation and clogging of &#8220;dead&#8221; lithium polysulfides (LiPS) on the interface between the cathode and SPE with intrinsic diffusion limitation is identified as a critical failure cause of SPE-based solid-state Li&#8211;S batteries. It induces a poorly reversible chemical environment with retarded kinetics on the cathode&#8211;SPE interface and in bulk SPEs, starving the Li&#8211;S redox in solid-state cells. This observation is different from the case in liquid electrolytes with free solvent and charge carriers, where LiPS dissolve but remain alive for electrochemical/chemical redox without interfacial clogging. Electrocatalysis demonstrates the feasibility of tailoring the chemical environment in diffusion-restricted reaction media for reducing Li&#8211;S redox failure in the SPE. It enables Ah-level solid-state Li&#8211;S pouch cells with a high specific energy of 343&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; on the cell level. This work may shed new light on the understanding of the failure mechanism of SPE for bottom-up improvement of solid-state Li&#8211;S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Graphene Biointerface for Cardiac Arrhythmia Diagnosis and Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of graphene biointerfaces for cardiac electrophysiology is presented. The devices feature effective electrochemical properties: low impedance and high charge storage and injection capacities. The transparency of graphene allows for simultaneous optical mapping and optogenetic stimulation while performing electrical measurements and stimulation. This report indicates that graphene biointerfaces are fundamental for future diagnosis and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.








Abstract
Heart rhythm disorders, known as arrhythmias, cause significant morbidity and are one of the leading causes of mortality. Cardiac arrhythmias are frequently treated by implantable devices, such as pacemakers and defibrillators, or by ablation therapy guided by electroanatomical mapping. Both implantable and ablation therapies require sophisticated biointerfaces for electrophysiological measurements of electrograms and delivery of therapeutic stimulation or ablation energy. In this work, a graphene biointerface for in vivo cardiac electrophysiology is reported for the first time. Leveraging sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;thick tissue&#8208;conformable graphene arrays, sensing and stimulation of the open mammalian heart are demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the graphene biointerface treatment of atrioventricular block (the kind of arrhythmia where the electrical conduction from the atria to the ventricles is interrupted) is demonstrated. The graphene arrays show effective electrochemical properties, namely interface impedance down to 40&#160;&#937;&#8201;cm2 at 1&#160;kHz, charge storage capacity up to 63.7&#160;mC&#160;cm&#8722;2, and charge injection capacity up to 704&#160;&#181;C&#160;cm&#8722;2. Transparency of the graphene structures allows for simultaneous optical mapping of cardiac action potentials, calcium transients, and optogenetic stimulation while performing electrical measurements and stimulation. The report presents evidence of the significant potential of graphene biointerfaces for advanced cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia therapy.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Stable Hyperfluorescence Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Improved Color Purities and Ultrahigh Power Efficiencies Based on Low&#8208;Polar Sensitizing Systems</title>

         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitizer with low polarity, high steric hindrance, and concentration&#8208;quenching free feature is created, based on which low&#8208;polar sensitizing systems with small carrier injection barrier and full exciton utilization are achieved for hyperfluorescence organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, providing high color purity, record&#8208;high electroluminescence efficiencies and long operational lifetime.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance (MR) molecules with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are emerging as promising candidates for high&#8208;definition displays because of their narrow emission spectra. However, the electroluminescence (EL) efficiencies and spectra of MR&#8208;TADF molecules are highly sensitive to hosts and sensitizers when applied to organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), and the highly polar environments in devices often lead to significantly broadened EL spectra. In this study, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept TADF sensitizer (BTDMAC&#8208;XT) with low polarity, high steric hindrance, and concentration&#8208;quenching free feature is constructed, which acts as a good emitter in doped and non&#8208;doped OLEDs with high external quantum efficiencies (&#951;exts) of 26.7% and 29.3%, respectively. By combining BTDMAC&#8208;XT with conventional low&#8208;polarity hosts, low&#8208;polarity sensitizing systems with a small carrier injection barrier and full exciton utilization are constructed for the MR&#8208;TADF molecule BN2. Hyperfluorescence (HF) OLEDs employing the low&#8208;polar sensitizing systems successfully improve the color quality of BN2 and afford an excellent &#951;ext of 34.4%, a record&#8208;high power efficiency of 166.3&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 and a long operational lifetime (LT50&#160;=&#160;40309&#160;h) at an initial luminance of 100&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. These results provide instructive guidance for the sensitizer design and device optimization for energy&#8208;efficient and stable HF&#8208;OLEDs with high&#8208;quality light.

         <title>Reconfigurable Multilevel Optical PUF by Spatiotemporally Programmed Crystallization of Supersaturated Solution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of reconfigurable multilevel optical physical unclonable function (PUF) based on the stochastic crystallization of supersaturated solution, intended for a hierarchical identification process with recyclable tokens, is presented. The global parameters introduced in this study act as prefixes to classify PUFs into subgroups, which allows for a fast authentication process.








Abstract
Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are&#160;emerging as an alternative to information security by providing an advanced level of cryptographic keys with non&#8208;replicable characteristics, yet the cryptographic keys of conventional PUFs are not reconfigurable from the ones assigned at the manufacturing stage and the overall authentication process slows down as the number of entities in the dataset or the length of cryptographic key increases. Herein, a supersaturated solution&#8208;based PUF (S&#8208;PUF) is presented that utilizes stochastic crystallization of a supersaturated sodium acetate solution to allow a time&#8208;efficient, hierarchical authentication process together with on&#8208;demand rewritability of cryptographic keys. By controlling the orientation and the average grain size of the sodium acetate crystals via a spatiotemporally programmed temperature profile, the S&#8208;PUF now includes two global parameters, that is, angle of rotation and divergence of the diffracted beam, in addition to the speckle pattern to produce multilevel cryptographic keys, and these parameters function as prefixes for the classification of each entity for a fast authentication process. At the same time, the reversible phase change of sodium acetate enables repeated reconfiguration of the cryptographic key, which is expected to offer new possibilities for a next&#8208;generation, recyclable anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform.

         <title>Vertical Array of Graphite Oxide Liquid Crystal by Microwire Shearing for Highly Thermally Conductive Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly vertically ordered liquid crystals of giant graphite oxide (more than 100&#160;&#181;m in lateral dimension) is realized by microwire shearing, which endows the composite with a record high through&#8208;plane thermal conductivity of 94&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, 15% higher than that of pure Indium foil (81.8&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1).








Abstract
Excellent through&#8208;plane thermally conductive composites are highly demanded for efficient heat dissipation. Giant sheets have large crystalline domain and significantly reduce interface phonon scattering, making them promising to build highly thermally conductive composites. However, realizing vertical orientation of giant sheets remains challenging due to their enormous mass and huge hydrodynamic drag force. Here,&#160;we&#160;achieve highly vertically ordered liquid crystals of giant graphite oxide (more than 100&#160;&#181;m in lateral dimension) by microwire shearing, which endows the composite with a recorded through&#8208;plane thermal conductivity of 94&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. Microscale shearing fields induced by vertical motion of microwires conquer huge hydrodynamic energy barrier and vertically reorient giant sheets. The resulting liquid crystals exhibit extremely retarded relaxation and impart large&#8208;scale vertical array with bidirectional ordering degree as high as 0.82. The graphite array&#8208;based composites demonstrate an ultrahigh thermal enhancement efficiency of over 35 times per unit volume. Furthermore, the composites improve cooling efficiency by 93% for thermal management tests compared to commercial thermal interface materials. This work offers a novel methodology to precisely manipulate the orientation of giant particles and promote large&#8208;scale fabrication of vertical array with advanced functionalities.

         <title>Novel Organic Superbase Dopants for Ultraefficient N&#8208;Doping of Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of two organic superbase dopants as ultra&#8208;efficient n&#8208;dopants for OSCs is reported. In&#8208;depth studies reveal that the dopants lead to record&#8208;high conductivity in doped N2200 and PC61BM films, and exhibit particularly high polaron generation efficiency and doping efficiency. A possible deprotonation&#8208;induced nucleophilic&#8208;attack n&#8208;doping mechanism is suggested for the organic superbase dopants.








Abstract
Doping is a powerful technique for engineering the electrical properties of organic semiconductors (OSCs), yet efficient n&#8208;doping of OSCs remains a central challenge. Herein, the discovery of two organic superbase dopants, namely P2&#8208;t&#8208;Bu and P4&#8208;t&#8208;Bu as ultra&#8208;efficient n&#8208;dopants for OSCs is reported. Typical n&#8208;type semiconductors such as N2200 and PC61BM are shown to experience a significant increase of conductivity upon doping by the two dopants. In particular, the optimized electrical conductivity of P2&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;doped PC61BM reaches a record&#8208;high value of 2.64&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1. The polaron generation efficiency of P2&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;doped in PC61BM is found to be over 35%, which is 2&#8211;3 times higher than that of benchmark n&#8208;dopant N&#8208;DMBI. In addition, a deprotonation&#8208;initiated, nucleophilic&#8208;attack&#8208;based n&#8208;doping mechanism is proposed for the organic superbases, which involves the deprotonation of OSC molecules, the nucleophilic attack of the resulting carbanions on the OSC's &#960;&#8208;bonds, and the subsequent n&#8208;doping through single electron transfer process between the anionized and neutral OSCs. This work highlights organic superbases as promising n&#8208;dopants for OSCs and opens up opportunities to explore and develop highly efficient n&#8208;dopants.

         <title>Achieving High Quantum Efficiency Broadband NIR Mg4Ta2O9:Cr3+ Phosphor Through Lithium&#8208;Ion Compensation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A blue light excitable Cr3+&#8208;doped&#160;Mg4Ta2O9phosphor is explored, and 61.25% of the record EQE detected at 450&#160;nm excitation&#160;is&#160;achieved through lithium&#8208;ion compensation. As a key and efficient broadband NIR transmitter, it can achieve high optical output power of the NIR light source. It provides a new option&#160;for the next&#8208;generation&#160;compact NIR light source and can be utilized to improve the current detection sensitivity based on intelligent NIR spectroscopy technology.








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;efficient broadband near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs) are urgently needed to improve the detection sensitivity and spatial resolution of current smart NIR spectroscopy&#8208;based techniques. Nonetheless, the performance of NIR pc&#8208;LED has severely limited owing to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) bottleneck of NIR light&#8208;emitting materials. Herein, a blue LED excitable Cr3+&#8208;doped tetramagnesium ditantalate (Mg4Ta2O9, MT) phosphor is advantageously modified through lithium ion as a key efficient broadband NIR emitter to achieve high optical output power of the NIR light source. The emission spectrum encompasses the 700&#8211;1300&#160;nm electromagnetic spectrum of first biological window (&#955;max&#160;= 842&#160;nm) with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of &#8776;2280 cm&#8722;1 (&#8776;167&#160;nm), and achieves a record EQE of 61.25% detected at 450&#160;nm excitation through Li&#8208;ion compensation. A prototype NIR pc&#8208;LED is fabricated with MT:Cr3+, Li+ to evaluate its potential practical application, which reveals an NIR output power of 53.22&#160;mW at a driving current of 100&#160;mA, and a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 25.09% at 10&#160;mA. This work provides an ultra&#8208;efficient broadband NIR luminescent material, which shows great promise in practical applications and presents a novel option for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;power compact NIR light sources.

         <title>Two Functions from a Single Photoresist: Tuning Microstructure Degradability from Light&#8208;Stabilized Dynamic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;in&#8208;one photoresist for 3D direct laser writing applications is introduced, which allows the degradation properties of the printed structure to be carefully tuned by simply altering the laser intensity during the fabrication process. The unique ability to fabricate 3D microstructures consisting of both degradable and nondegradable segments from a single photoresist is a critical advancement in photoresist technology.








Abstract
A photoresist&#8212;based on a light&#8208;stabilized dynamic material driven by an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium photo&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of triazolinediones with naphthalenes&#8212;whose ability to intrinsically degrade postprinting can be tuned by a simple adjustment of laser intensity during 3D laser lithography is introduced. The resist's ability to form stable networks under green light irradiation that degrade in the dark is transformed into a tunable degradable 3D printing material platform. In&#8208;depth characterization of the printed microstructures via atomic force microscopy before and during degradation reveals the high dependency of the final structures&#8217; properties on the writing parameters. Upon identifying the ideal writing parameters and their effect on the network structure, it is possible to selectively toggle between stable and fully degradable structures. This simplifies the direct laser writing manufacturing process of multifunctional materials significantly, which typically requires the use of separate resists and consecutive writing efforts to achieve degradable and nondegradable material sections.

         <title>A Scalable Platform for Fabricating Biodegradable Microparticles with Pulsatile Drug Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Particles Uniformly Liquified and Sealed to Encapsulate Drugs (PULSED) is a high&#8208;throughput method for fabricating biodegradable microparticles that release drug in a discrete pulse after a tunable delay. The PULSED encapsulation technique is compatible with crystalline and semi&#8208;crystalline polymers, and is gentle enough to preserve the bioactivity of proteins.








Abstract
Pulsatile drug delivery systems have the potential to improve patient adherence and therapeutic efficacy by providing a sequence of doses in a single injection. Herein, a novel platform, termed Particles Uniformly Liquified and Sealed to Encapsulate Drugs (PULSED) is developed, which enables the high&#8208;throughput fabrication of microparticles exhibiting pulsatile release. In PULSED, biodegradable polymeric microstructures with an open cavity are formed using high&#8208;resolution 3D printing and soft lithography, filled with drug, and sealed using a contactless heating step in which the polymer flows over the orifice to form a complete shell around a drug&#8208;loaded core. Poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) particles with this structure can rapidly release encapsulated material after delays of 10 &#177; 1, 15 &#177; 1, 17 &#177; 2, or 36 &#177; 1 days in vivo, depending on polymer molecular weight and end group. The system is even compatible with biologics, releasing over 90% of bevacizumab in its bioactive form after a two&#8208;week delay in vitro. The PULSED system is highly versatile, offering compatibility with crystalline and amorphous polymers, easily injectable particle sizes, and compatibility with several newly developed drug loading methods. Together, these results suggest that PULSED is a promising platform for creating long&#8208;acting drug formulations that improve patient outcomes due to its simplicity, low cost, and scalability.

         <title>High Energy Harvesting Performances Silicone Elastomer via Filling Soft Dielectric with Stretching Deformability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft dielectric with good interfacial interaction, dielectric enhancement, and deformability is developed and used as novel filler for dielectric elastomer, significantly improving the stretched breakdown strength of nanocomposite under 800% plane strain. Dielectric elastomer generator based on this soft filler shows high power generation energy density (130.5 mJ g&#8722;1) and record electromechanical conversion efficiency (44.5%).








Abstract
Dielectric elastomer generators (DEGs) with high generated energy density and high conversion efficiency are of great interest. Among several dielectric elastomers (DEs), silicone elastomer filled with ceramic fillers have been extensively studied for their high elasticity, insulation, and permittivity. However, the stretched breakdown strength (Ebs) of such composites decreases significantly under large strain, thus sharply reduces its energy harvesting performances. In this study, a polar rubber&#8208;based dielectric (GNBR) is synthetized and creatively used as &#8220;soft filler&#8221; for silicone elastomer. Benefiting from the deformability under stretching and its inherent strong interface bonding with silicone elastomer, this soft filler effectively avoids the formation of weak interface under large strain and reduces the local field strength of interface area. As expected, the composite filled with soft filler (GNBR/PMVS) shows enhanced Ebs of 2.8 times that of composite with traditional hard filler (TiO2/PMVS) under equibiaxial strain of 200%. As a result, GNBR/PMVS composite exhibits maximum energy density of 130.5 mJ g&#8722;1 with up&#8208;to&#8208;date highest power conversion efficiency of reported DEG (44.5%). The findings will provide new insights in the rational design of DE composites characterized by high stretched breakdown strength for advanced energy harvesting system.

         <title>Launching and Manipulation of Higher&#8208;Order In&#8208;Plane Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in Low&#8208;Dimensional Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly confined, directionally dependent in&#8208;plane hyperbolic light propagation is demonstrated in a heterostructure composed of a 3C&#8208;SiC nanowire on &#945;&#8208;MoO3 flake. Such low&#8208;dimensional heterostructure showcases the efficient and precise manipulation of the extremely anisotropic light&#8208;matter interactions at the deeply subwavelength scale, opening opportunities for a wide range of IR applications.








Abstract
Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) are stimulated by coupling infrared (IR) photons with the polar lattice vibrations. Such HPhPs offer low&#8208;loss, highly confined light propagation at subwavelength scales with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane or in&#8208;plane hyperbolic wavefronts. For HPhPs, while a hyperbolic dispersion implies multiple propagating modes with a distribution of wavevectors at a given frequency, so far it has been challenging to experimentally launch and probe the higher&#8208;order modes that offer stronger wavelength compression, especially for in&#8208;plane HPhPs. In this work, the experimental observation of higher&#8208;order in&#8208;plane HPhP modes stimulated on a 3C&#8208;SiC nanowire (NW)/&#945;&#8208;MoO3 heterostructure is reported where leveraging both the low&#8208;dimensionality and low&#8208;loss nature of the polar NWs, higher&#8208;order HPhPs modes within 2D &#945;&#8208;MoO3 crystal are launched by the 1D 3C&#8208;SiC NW. The launching mechanism is further studied and the requirements for efficiently launching of such higher&#8208;order modes are determined. In addition, by altering the geometric orientation between the 3C&#8208;SiC NW and &#945;&#8208;MoO3 crystal, the manipulation of higher&#8208;order HPhP dispersions as a method of tuning is demonstrated. This work illustrates an extremely anisotropic low dimensional heterostructure platform to confine and configure electromagnetic waves at the deep&#8208;subwavelength scales for a range of IR applications including sensing, nano&#8208;imaging, and on&#8208;chip photonics.

         <title>Improved Carrier Management via a Multifunctional Modifier for High&#8208;Quality Low&#8208;Bandgap Sn&#8211;Pb Perovskites and Efficient All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites and excellent contacts at the perovskite/C60 interface are developed by introducing a one&#8208;in&#8208;all modifier. The introduction of cysteine hydrochloride (CysHCl) to Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites restrains non&#8208;radiative recombination and facilitates electron transfer. Consequently, the CysHCl&#8208;processed devices achieve the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.15% for low&#8208;bandgap (LBG) Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cell (PSC) and 26.16% for all&#8208;perovskite monolithic tandem devices.








Abstract
All&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs) hold great promise in terms of ultrahigh efficiency, low manufacturing cost, and flexibility, stepping forward to the next&#8208;generation photovoltaics. However, their further development is hampered by the relatively low performance of low&#8208;bandgap (LBG) tin (Sn)&#8211;lead (Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Improving the carrier management, including suppressing trap&#8208;assisted non&#8208;radiative recombination and promoting carrier transfer, is of great significance to enhance the performance of Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs. Herein, a carrier management strategy is reported for using cysteine hydrochloride (CysHCl) simultaneously as a bulky passivator and a surface anchoring agent for Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite. CysHCl processing effectively reduces trap density and suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination, enabling the growth of high&#8208;quality Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite with greatly improved carrier diffusion length of &gt;8&#160;&#181;m. Furthermore, the electron transfer at the perovskite/C60 interface is accelerated due to the formation of surface dipoles and favorable energy band bending. As a result, these advances enable the demonstration of champion efficiency of 22.15% for CysHCl&#8208;processed LBG Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs with remarkable enhancement in both open&#8208;circuit voltage and fill factor. When paired with a wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite subcell, a certified 25.7%&#8208;efficient all&#8208;perovskite monolithic tandem device is further demonstrated.

         <title>Trans&#8208;Reflective Structural Color Filters Assisting Multifunctional&#8208;Integrated Semitransparent Photovoltaic Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of multifunctional STOPVs for smart windows are presented, based on strong resonance effect of asymmetrical MIM microcavities. These devices present a recorded QUE of 80%, flowery trans&#8208;reflective structural colors scanning visible region, superior UV&#8208;blocking (300&#8211;400&#160;nm) of 95%, and IR&#8208;rejection (700&#8211;1400&#160;nm) of 100%, of which, the rear two performances are individually better than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial optical films for solar window.








Abstract
Multifunction&#8208;integrated semitransparent organic photovoltaic cells (STOPVs), with high power generation, colorful transmittance/reflectance, excellent&#160;ultraviolet (UV) protection, and thermal insulation, are fully in line with the concept of architectural aesthetics and photoprotection characteristics for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic&#8208;window. For the indelible rainbow color photovoltaic window, one crucial issue is to realize the integration of these photons&#8208; and photoelectric&#8208;related multifunction. Herein, dynamic transmissive and reflective structural color controllable filters, with asymmetrical metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;metal (MIM) configurations (20&#160;nm&#8208;Ag&#8208;HATCN&#8208;30&#160;nm&#8208;Ag) through machine learning, are deliberately designed for colorful STOPV devices. This endows the resultant integrated devices with &#8776;5% enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) than the bare&#8208;STOPVs, gifted UV (300&#8211;400&#160;nm) blocking rates as high as 93.5, 94.1, 90.2, and 94.5%, as well as a superior&#160;infrared radiation (IR) (700&#8208;1400&#160;nm) rejection approaching 100% for transparent purple&#8208;, blue&#8208;, green&#8208; and red&#8208;STOPV cells, respectively. Most importantly, benefiting from the photonic recycling effect beyond microcavity resonance wavelength, a reported quantum utilization efficiency (QUE) as high as 80%, is first presented for the transparent&#8208;green&#8208;STOPVs with an ultra&#8208;narrow bandgap of 1.2&#160;eV. These asymmetrical Febry&#8208;P&#233;rot transmissive and reflective structural color filters can also be extended to silicon&#8208; and perovskite&#8208;based optoelectric devices and make it possible to integrate additional target optical functions for multi&#8208;purpose optoelectric devices.

This endows the resultant integrated devices with &#8776;5% enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) than the bare-STOPVs, gifted UV (300&#8211;400&#160;nm) blocking rates as high as 93.5, 94.1, 90.2, and 94.5%, as well as a superior&#160;&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;infrared radiation&lt;/span&gt; (IR) (700-1400&#160;nm) rejection approaching 100% for transparent purple-, blue-, green- and red-STOPV cells, respectively. Most importantly, benefiting from the photonic recycling effect beyond microcavity resonance wavelength, a reported quantum utilization efficiency (QUE) as high as 80%, is first presented for the transparent-green-STOPVs with an ultra-narrow bandgap of 1.2&#160;eV. These asymmetrical Febry-P&#233;rot transmissive and reflective structural color filters can also be extended to silicon- and perovskite-based optoelectric devices and make it possible to integrate additional target optical functions for multi-purpose optoelectric devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superlattice Nanofilm on a Touchscreen for Photoexcited Bacteria and Virus Killing by Tuning Electronic Defects in the Heterointerface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering electronic defects in ZnO&#8211;Fe2O3 superlattice heterointerfaces is applied for smartphone&#8208;/solar&#8208;triggered bactericidal and virucidal touchscreens, even against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and H1N1 viruses under simulated solar or low&#8208;power LED light irradiation. Meanwhile, this superlattice nanofilm on a touchscreen exhibits excellent light transmission (&gt;90%), abrasion resistance (106 times the round&#8208;trip friction), and biocompatibility.








Abstract
Currently, the global COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has significantly increased the public attention toward the spread of pathogenic viruses and bacteria on various high&#8208;frequency touch surfaces. Developing a self&#8208;disinfecting coating on a touchscreen is an urgent and meaningful task. Superlattice materials are among the most promising photocatalysts owing to their efficient charge transfer in abundant heterointerfaces. However, excess electronic defects at the heterointerfaces result in the loss of substantial amounts of photogenerated charge carrier. In this study, a ZnO&#63743;Fe2O3 superlattice nanofilm is designed via atomic layer deposition for photocatalytic bactericidal and virucidal touchscreen. Additionally, electronic defects in the superlattice heterointerface are engineered. Photogenerated electrons and holes will be rapidly separated and transferred into ZnO and Fe2O3 across the heterointerfaces owing to the formation of Zn&#63743;O, Fe&#63743;O, and Zn&#63743;Fe covalent bonds at the heterointerfaces, where ZnO and Fe2O3 function as electronic donors and receptors, respectively. The high generation capacity of reactive oxygen species results in a high antibacterial and antiviral efficacy (&gt;90%) even against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and H1N1 viruses under simulated solar or low&#8208;power LED light irradiation. Meanwhile, this superlattice nanofilm on a touchscreen shows excellent light transmission (&gt;90%), abrasion resistance (106 times the round&#8208;trip friction), and biocompatibility.

         <title>Move Aside Pentacene: Diazapentacene&#8208;Doped para&#8208;Terphenyl, a Zero&#8208;Field Room&#8208;Temperature Maser with Strong Coupling for Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>

6,13&#8208;Diazapentacene doped in para&#8208;terphenyl is discovered to act as a maser, the microwave analogue of lasers. As&#160;only the second material ever discovered to mase at room&#8208;temperature and zero external magnetic&#8208;field,&#160;optical and paramagnetic characterizations of this new material, to spearhead studies of maser materials for quantum sensors, magnetic spintronics, and tailored organic materials in optoelectronics, are presented.








Abstract
Masers can deliver ultralow&#8208;noise amplification of microwave signals in medical imaging and deep&#8208;space communication, with recent research being rekindled through the discovery of gain media operating at room&#8208;temperature, eschewing bulky cryogenics that hindered their use. This work shows the discovery of 6,13&#8208;diazapentacene doped in para&#8208;terphenyl (DAP:PTP) as a maser gain medium that can operate at room&#8208;temperature, without an external magnetic field. With a maser output power of &#8722;10 dBm, it is on par with pentacene&#8208;doped para&#8208;terphenyl in masing power, while possessing compelling advantages such as faster amplification startup times, being pumped by longer wavelength light at 620 nm and greater chemical stability from nitrogen groups. Furthermore, the maser bursts from DAP:PTP allow one to reach the strong coupling regime for cavity quantum electrodynamics, with a high&#160;cooperativity of 182. The optical and microwave spin dynamics of DAP:PTP are studied in order to evaluate its capabilities as a maser gain medium, where it features fast intersystem crossing and an advantageously higher triplet quantum yield. The results pave the way for the future discovery of similar maser materials and help designate them as promising candidates for quantum sensors, optoelectronic devices and the study of cavity quantum electrodynamic effects at&#160;room&#8208;temperature.

         <title>Achieving Ferroelectricity in a Centrosymmetric High&#8208;Performance Semiconductor by Strain Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>In a high&#8208;performance semiconductor Bi2O2Se, a strain&#8208;induced ferroelectric transition is demonstrated by the appearance of butterfly loops and 180&#176; phase switching in the piezoelectric force microscopy measurements, together with the evolution of optical second&#8208;harmonic generation. Materials with paraelectrics at ambient pressure and ferroelectrics under strain are rare.








Abstract
Phase engineering by strain in 2D semiconductors is of great importance for a variety of applications. Here, a study of the strain&#8208;induced ferroelectric (FE) transition in bismuth oxyselenide (Bi2O2Se) films, a high&#8208;performance (HP) semiconductor for next&#8208;generation electronics, is presented. Bi2O2Se is not FE at ambient pressure. At a loading force of &#8819;400 nN, the piezoelectric force responses exhibit butterfly loops in magnitude and 180&#176; phase switching. By carefully ruling out extrinsic factors, these features are attributed to a transition to the FE phase. The transition is further supported by the appearance of a sharp peak in optical second&#8208;harmonic generation under uniaxial strain. In general, solids with paraelectrics at ambient pressure and FE under strain are rare. The FE transition is discussed using first&#8208;principles calculations and theoretical simulations. The switching of FE polarization acts as a knob for Schottky barrier engineering at contacts and serves as the basis for a memristor with a huge on/off current ratio of 106. This work adds a new degree of freedom to HP electronic/optoelectronic semiconductors, and the integration of FE and HP semiconductivity paves the way for many exciting functionalities, including HP neuromorphic computing and bulk&#160;piezophotovoltaics.

         <dc:description>
An ultrathin crystalline ferroelectric polymer based on trichloromethyl (CCl3)&#8208;terminated poly(vinylidene difluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifloroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) is developed on AlOX to realize negative&#8208;capacitance metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors (MOSFETs) with a MoS2 channel. Systematic adjustment of the thickness ratio between the polymer and dielectric AlOX achieves a hysteresis&#8208;free FET with a minimum subthreshold swing of 28 mV dec&#8722;1, operating at less than 2 V.








Abstract
Negative&#8208;capacitance field&#8208;effect transistors (NC&#8208;FETs) have gathered enormous interest as a way to reduce subthreshold swing (SS) and overcome the issue of power dissipation in modern integrated circuits. For stable NC behavior at low operating voltages, the development of ultrathin ferroelectrics (FE), which are compatible with the industrial process, is of great interest. Here, a new scalable ultrathin ferroelectric polymer layer is developed based on trichloromethyl (CCl3)&#8208;terminated poly(vinylidene difluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifloroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) to achieve the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance of NC&#8208;FETs. The crystalline phase of 5&#8211;10&#160;nm ultrathin P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) is prepared on AlOX by a newly developed brush method, which enables an FE/dielectric (DE) bilayer. FE/DE thickness ratios are then systematically tuned at ease to achieve ideal capacitance matching. NC&#8208;FETs with optimized FE/DE thickness at a thickness limit demonstrate hysteresis&#8208;free operation with an SS of 28&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 at &#8776;1.5&#160;V, which competes with the best reports. This P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)&#8208;brush layer can be broadly adapted to NC&#8208;FETs, opening an exciting avenue for low&#8208;power devices.

&lt;/i&gt; to realize negative-capacitance metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) with a MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; channel. Systematic adjustment of the thickness ratio between the polymer and dielectric AlO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; achieves a hysteresis-free FET with a minimum subthreshold swing of 28 mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, operating at less than 2 V.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negative-capacitance field-effect transistors (NC-FETs) have gathered enormous interest as a way to reduce subthreshold swing (SS) and overcome the issue of power dissipation in modern integrated circuits. For stable NC behavior at low operating voltages, the development of ultrathin ferroelectrics (FE), which are compatible with the industrial process, is of great interest. Here, a new scalable ultrathin ferroelectric polymer layer is developed based on trichloromethyl (CCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)-terminated poly(vinylidene difluoride-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-trifloroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) to achieve the state-of-the-art performance of NC-FETs. The crystalline phase of 5&#8211;10&#160;nm ultrathin P(VDF-TrFE) is prepared on AlO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; by a newly developed brush method, which enables an FE/dielectric (DE) bilayer. FE/DE thickness ratios are then systematically tuned at ease to achieve ideal capacitance matching. NC-FETs with optimized FE/DE thickness at a thickness limit demonstrate hysteresis-free operation with an SS of 28&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8776;1.5&#160;V, which competes with the best reports. This P(VDF-TrFE)-brush layer can be broadly adapted to NC-FETs, opening an exciting avenue for low-power devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast, High&#8208;Strain, and Strong Uniaxial Hydrogel Actuators from Recyclable Nanofibril Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel actuators benefit from high actuation strain and mechanical properties that mimic biological tissues but suffer from low actuation rates and limited controllability. It is shown that the performance of hydrogel actuators can be improved by orders of magnitude using uniaxial fibrillar hydrogels that focus the entire swelling in the actuation direction&#8211;a significant advancement toward hydrogel&#8208;based lifelike machines.








Abstract
Polymer hydrogels mimic biological tissues and are suitable for future lifelike machines. However, their actuation is isotropic, so they must be crosslinked or placed in a turgor membrane to achieve high actuation pressures, severely impeding their performance. Here, it is shown that organizing cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) in anisotropic hydrogel sheets leads to mechanical in&#8208;plane reinforcement that generates a uniaxial, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane strain with performance far surpassing polymer hydrogels. These fibrillar hydrogel actuators expand uniaxially by 250 times with an initial rate of 100&#8211;130%&#160;s&#8722;1, compared to &lt;10 times and &lt;1%&#160;s&#8722;1 in directional strain rate for isotropic hydrogels, respectively. The blocking pressure reaches 0.9&#160;MPa, similar to turgor actuators, while the time to reach 90% of the maximum&#160;pressure is 1&#8211;2&#160;min, compared to 10&#160;min to hours for polymer hydrogel actuators. Uniaxial actuators that lift objects 120&#160;000 times their weight and soft grippers are showcased. In addition, the hydrogels can be recycled without a loss in performance. The uniaxial swelling allows adding channels through the gel for local solvent delivery, further increasing the actuation rate and cyclability. Thus, fibrillar networks can overcome the major drawbacks of hydrogel actuators and is a significant advancement towards hydrogel&#8208;based lifelike machines.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Efficient Electrochemical Catalysts for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular design and crystal engineering strategy are applied to construct thiol&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). This MOF platform is successfully decorated with&#160;nickel&#8211;sulfur links cooperating in the network. The prepared 2D MOF with enhanced electro&#8208;conductivity and modified electronic structure demonstrates superior activity and robust stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which paves the way to design MOFs at a molecular level.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) solids with their variable functionalities are relevant for energy conversion technologies. However, the development of electroactive and stable MOFs for electrocatalysis still faces challenges. Here, a molecularly engineered MOF system featuring a 2D coordination network based on mercaptan&#8211;metal links (e.g., nickel, as for Ni(DMBD)&#8208;MOF) is designed. The crystal structure is solved from microcrystals by a continuous&#8208;rotation electron diffraction (cRED) technique. Computational results indicate a metallic electronic structure of Ni(DMBD)&#8208;MOF due to the Ni&#8211;S coordination, highlighting the effective design of the thiol ligand for enhancing electroconductivity. Additionally, both experimental and theoretical studies indicate that (DMBD)&#8208;MOF offers advantages in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over non&#8208;thiol (e.g., 1,4&#8208;benzene dicarboxylic acid) analog (BDC)&#8208;MOF, because it poses fewer energy barriers during the rate&#8208;limiting *O intermediate formation step. Iron&#8208;substituted NiFe(DMBD)&#8208;MOF achieves a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 at a small overpotential of 280&#160;mV, indicating a new MOF platform for efficient OER catalysis.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystalline BaZr0.2Ti0.8O3 Membranes Enabled High Energy Density in PEI&#8208;Based Composites for High&#8208;Temperature Electrostatic Capacitors</title>

         <dc:description>
The sandwich structured BaZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (BZT)/polyetherimide&#8211;boron nitride composites are prepared through layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer technique with water&#8208;dissolvent transfer method and hot&#8208;pressing process. By inserting the single&#8208;crystalline BZT membranes as the inner layer, the composites exhibit good dielectric&#8208;temperature stability and ultra&#8208;high energy&#8208;density. This study paves a scalable way to develop novel high&#8208;temperature dielectric materials and capacitors with superior energy storage performance.








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors are promising for high power energy storage, but their breakdown strength (Eb) and energy density (Ue) usually degrade rapidly at high temperatures. Adding boron nitride (BN) nanosheets can improve the Eb and high&#8208;temperature endurance but with a limited Ue due to its low dielectric constant. Here, freestanding single&#8208;crystalline BaZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (BZT) membranes with high dielectric constant are fabricated, and introduced into BN doped polyetherimide (PEI) to obtain laminated PEI&#8211;BN/BZT/PEI&#8211;BN composites. At room temperature, the composite shows a maximum Ue of 17.94&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3&#160;at 730&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1, which is more than two times the pure PEI. Particularly, the composites exhibit excellent dielectric&#8208;temperature stability between 25&#160;and 150&#160;&#176;C. An outstanding Ue&#160;=&#160;7.90&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3&#160;is obtained at a relatively large electric field of 650&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;under 150&#160;&#176;C, which is superior to the most high&#8208;temperature dielectric capacitors reported so far. Phase&#8208;field simulation reveals that the depolarization electric field generated at the BZT/PEI&#8211;BN interfaces can effectively reduce carrier mobility, leading to the remarkable enhancement of the Eb and Ue over a wide temperature range. This work provides a promising and scalable route to develop sandwich&#8208;structured composites with prominent energy storage performances for high&#8208;temperature capacitive applications.

A gradient hydrogel&#8208;based microbial community is presented to simulate the real intestinal microbiome for bridging microbiome&#8208;drug interaction research and treatment decision. This model reveals three mechanisms of drug&#8208;microbiota interaction: immunological effect, bio&#8208;accumulation, and drug metabolism, which provide innovative regulatory approaches for improving the anti&#8208;cancer effect of drugs.








Abstract
Despite the recognition that the gut microbiota acts a clinically significant role in cancer chemotherapy, both mechanistic understanding and translational research are still limited. Maximizing drug efficacy requires an in&#8208;depth understanding of how the microbiota contributes to therapeutic responses, while microbiota modulation is hindered by the complexity of the human body. To address this issue, a 3D experimental model named engineered microbiota (EM) is reported for bridging microbiota&#8208;drug interaction research and therapeutic decision&#8208;making. EM can be manipulated in vitro and faithfully recapitulate the human gut microbiota at the genus/species level while allowing co&#8208;culture with cells, organoids, and isolated tissues for testing drug responses. Examination of various clinical and experimental drugs by EM reveales that the gut microbiota affects drug efficacy through three pathways: immunological effects, bioaccumulation, and drug metabolism. Guided by discovered mechanisms, custom&#8208;tailored strategies are adopted to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of drugs on orthotopic tumor models with patient&#8208;derived gut microbiota. These strategies include immune synergy, nanoparticle encapsulation, and host&#8211;guest complex formation, respectively. Given the important role of the gut microbiota in influencing drug efficacy, EM will likely become an indispensable tool to guide drug translation and clinical decision&#8208;making.

         <title>A Sulfur Heterocyclic Quinone Cathode Towards&#160;High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Cycle Aqueous Zn&#8208;Organic Batteries</title>

A fully composited benzo[b]naphtho[2',3':5,6][1,4]dithiino[2,3&#8208;i]thianthrene&#8208;5,7,9,14,16,18&#8208;hexone/reduced graphene oxide (BNDTH/RGO)&#160;is designed to simultaneously conquer the low utilization of active sites, intrinsic poor conductivity, and strong solubility of organic electrode materials, realizing the construction of Zn&#8208;organic batteries with record&#8208;high cycling stability. This work brings new opportunities for the exploration of ultra&#8208;stable organic cathode materials for Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Organic materials have attracted much attention in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their sustainability and structure&#8208;designable, but their further development is hindered by the high solubility, poor conductivity, and low utilization of active groups, resulting in poor cycling stability, terrible rate capability, and low capacity. In order to solve these three major obstacles, a novel organic host, benzo[b]naphtho[2&#8217;,3&#8217;:5,6][1,4]dithiino[2,3&#8208;i]thianthrene&#8208;5,7,9,14,16,18&#8208;hexone (BNDTH), with abundant electroactive groups and stable extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure is synthesized and composited with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) through a solvent exchange composition method to act as the cathode material for AZIBs. The well&#8208;designed BNDTH/RGO composite exhibits a high capacity of 296&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (nearly a full utilization of the active groups), superior rate capability of 120&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, and a long lifetime of 58&#160;000 cycles with a capacity retention of 65% at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Such excellent performance can be attributed to the ingenious structural design of the active molecule, as well as the unique solvent exchange composition strategy that enables effective dispersion of excess charge on the active molecule during discharge/charge process. This work provides important insights for the rational design of organic cathode materials and has significant guidance for realizing ideal high performance in AZIBs.

         <title>Tuning 2D Magnetism in Cobalt Monoxide Nanosheets Via In Situ Nickel&#8208;Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nickel&#8208;doped cobalt monoxide (Ni&#8208;doped CoO) nanosheets with a high substitution doping concentration is proposed for the first time. 2D Ni&#8208;doped CoO exhibits obvious ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature of &#8776;180 K, in sharp contrast to the pristine non&#8208;ferromagnetic 2D CoO, opening up a prospective way for tuning the magnetism of 2D nonlayered oxide semiconductors.








Abstract
Element doping has become an effective strategy to engineer the magnetic properties of two&#8208;dimensional&#160;(2D) materials and is widely explored in van der Waals layered transition metal dichalcogenides. However, the high&#8208;concentration substitution doping of 2D nonlayered metal oxides, which can preserve the original crystal texture and guarantee the homogeneity of doping distribution, is still a critical challenge due to the isotropic bonding of closed&#8208;packed structures. In this work, the synthesis of high&#8208;quality 2D nonlayered nickel&#8208;doped cobalt monoxide nanosheets via in situ atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition method is reported. High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy confirmed that nickel atoms are doped at the intrinsic cobalt atom sites. The nickel doping concentration is stable at &#8776;15%, superior to most magnetic dopants doping in 2D materials and metal oxides. Magnetic measurements showed that pristine cobalt monoxide is nonferromagnetic, whereas nickel&#8208;doped cobalt monoxide exhibits robust ferromagnetic behavior with a Curie temperature of &#8776;180 K. Density functional theory calculations reveal that nickel atoms can improve the internal ferromagnetic correlation, giving rise to significant ferromagnetic performance of cobalt monoxide nanosheets. These results provide a valuable case for tuning the competing correlated states and magnetic ordering by substitution doping in 2D nonlayered oxide semiconductors.

         <title>Maximum Emission Peak Over 1500&#160;nm of Organic Assembly for Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier&#8208;Crossing NIR&#8208;IIb Phototheranostics of Orthotopic Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic assembly with the maximum absorption peak at 1400&#160;nm and emission peak at 1512&#160;nm with trailing over 1700&#160;nm is prepared through the self&#8208;assembly of organic small molecule IR&#8208;1064 for blood&#8211;brain barrier&#8208;crossing NIR&#8208;IIb phototheranostics of orthotopic glioblastoma.








Abstract
The development of blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB)&#8208;crossing phototheranostic agents in second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II), especially in the range of 1500&#8211;1700&#160;nm (NIR&#8208;IIb), affords great opportunities for glioblastoma (GBM) management. Herein, an organic assembly (denoted as LET&#8208;12) with the maximum absorption peak at 1400&#160;nm and emission peak at 1512&#160;nm with trailing over 1700&#160;nm through the self&#8208;assembly of organic small molecule IR&#8208;1064 is designed and subsequently decorated with choline and acetylcholine analogs. The LET&#8208;12 can effectively cross BBB through the brain's choline&#8208;like receptors&#8208;mediated transcytosis and accumulated in tumor tissues, thus achieving fluorescence/photoacoustic (FL/PA) duplex imaging of orthotopic GBM with &#8776;3.0&#160;mm depth and a superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal tissue signal ratio (20.93 &#177; 0.59 for FL imaging and 32.63 &#177; 1.16 for PA imaging, respectively). Owing to its good photothermal conversion ability, the LET&#8208;12 also can serve as a photothermal conversion agent, achieving obvious tumor repression of orthotopic murine GBM model after once treatment. The findings indicate that the LET&#8208;12 holds great potential for BBB&#8208;crossing NIR&#8208;IIb phototheranostics of orthotopic GBM. This self&#8208;assembly strategy of organic small molecules opens a new avenue for the construction of NIR&#8208;IIb phototheranostics.

By combining crystal graph attention networks with a newly created dataset, a compound space spanning 1 billion materials is scanned for new stable materials. As a result, the number of known theoretically synthesizable materials is increased by 30%. The resulting materials are then studied for extreme values of several properties.








Abstract
Crystal&#8208;graph attention neural networks have emerged recently as remarkable tools for the prediction of thermodynamic stability. The efficacy of their learning capabilities and their reliability is however subject to the quantity and quality of the data they are fed.

&lt;p&gt;By combining crystal graph attention networks with a newly created dataset, a compound space spanning 1 billion materials is scanned for new stable materials. As a result, the number of known theoretically synthesizable materials is increased by 30%. The resulting materials are then studied for extreme values of several properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crystal-graph attention neural networks have emerged recently as remarkable tools for the prediction of thermodynamic stability. The efficacy of their learning capabilities and their reliability is however subject to the quantity and quality of the data they are fed. Previous networks exhibit strong biases due to the inhomogeneity of the training data. Here a high-quality dataset is engineered to provide a better balance across chemical and crystal-symmetry space. Crystal-graph neural networks trained with this dataset show unprecedented generalization accuracy. Such networks are applied to perform machine-learning-assisted high-throughput searches of stable materials, spanning 1 billion candidates. In this way, the number of vertices of the global &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&#160;= 0&#160;K phase diagram is increased by 30% and find more than &#8776;150&#160;000 compounds with a distance to the convex hull of stability of less than 50&#160;meV&#160;atom&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Ferroelectric Domain Wall Engineering Enables Thermal Modulation in PMN&#8211;PT Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal conductivity modulation in PMN&#8211;xPT single crystals is demonstrated with a maximum enhancement of more than 20% at the intermediate poling state (intermediate d33). The enhancement is attributed to the reduction in domain wall density due to alternating current poling. The thermal conductivity decreases at optimized poling (maximum d33) due to increasing domain size inhomogeneity.








Abstract
Acting like thermal resistances, ferroelectric domain walls can be manipulated to realize dynamic modulation of thermal conductivity (k), which is essential for developing novel phononic circuits. Despite the interest, little attention has been paid to achieving room&#8208;temperature thermal modulation in bulk materials due to challenges in obtaining a high thermal conductivity switching ratio (khigh/klow), particularly in commercially viable materials. Here, room&#8208;temperature thermal modulation in 2.5&#160;mm&#8208;thick Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3&#8211;xPbTiO3 (PMN&#8211;xPT) single crystals is demonstrated. With the use of advanced poling conditions, assisted by the systematic study on composition and orientation dependence of PMN&#8211;xPT, a range of thermal conductivity switching ratios with a maximum of &#8776;1.27 is observed. Simultaneous measurements of piezoelectric coefficient (d33) to characterize the poling state, domain wall density using polarized light microscopy (PLM), and birefringence change using quantitative PLM&#160;reveal that compared to the unpoled state, the domain wall density at intermediate poling states (0&lt; d33&lt;d33,max) is lower due to the enlargement in domain size. At optimized poling conditions (d33,max), the domain sizes show increased inhomogeneity that leads to enhancement in the domain wall density. This work highlights the potential of commercially available PMN&#8211;xPT single crystals among other relaxor&#8208;ferroelectrics for achieving temperature control in solid&#8208;state devices.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 at 4.7&#160;V by Interface Stabilization and Band Structure Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modified&#160;LCO has a gradient doping of Mg, uniform doping of Ni in Li layers, and uniform LiMgxNi1&#8722;xPO4 coating. The doping and coating simultaneously modify the band structure to improve the oxygen redox reversibility during cycles. Therefore, the modified LCO shows excellent cycling performance both at 4.6 V and 4.7 V.








Abstract
Lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) is widely used in Li&#8208;ion batteries due to its high volumetric energy density, which is generally charged to 4.3 V. Lifting the cut&#8208;off voltage of LCO from 4.3 V to 4.7 V will increase the specific capacity from 150 to 230 mAh g&#8208;1 with a significant improvement of 53%. However, LCO suffers serious problems of H1&#8208;3/O1 phase transformation, unstable interface between cathode and electrolyte, and irreversible oxygen redox reaction at 4.7 V. Herein, interface stabilization and band structure modification are proposed to strengthen the crystal structure of LCO for stable cycling of LCO at an ultrahigh voltage of 4.7 V. Gradient distribution of magnesium and uniform doping of nickel in Li layers inhibit the harmful phase transitions of LCO, while uniform LiMgxNi1&#8722;xPO4 coating stabilizes the LCO&#8208;electrolyte interface during cycles. Moreover, the modified band structure improves the oxygen redox reaction reversibility and electrochemical performance of the modified LCO. As a result, the modified LCO has a high capacity retention of 78% after 200 cycles at 4.7 V in the half cell and 63% after 500 cycles at 4.6 V in the full cell. This work makes the capacity of LCO one step closer to its theoretical specific capacity.

         <title>Walking Ferroelectric Liquid Droplets with Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The motion of ferroelectric liquid dropletson a ferroelectric solid substrate is controlled by a light beam of moderate intensity. Upon entering the ferroelectric phase, droplets are either attracted toward the center of the beam or repelled, depending on which side of the ferroelectric substrate is exposed to light. Moving the beam results in walking the ferroelectric droplet over long distances on the substrate.








Abstract
The motion of ferroelectric liquid sessile droplets deposited on a ferroelectric lithium niobate substrate can be controlled by a light beam of moderate intensity irradiating the substrate at a distance of several droplet diameters from the droplet itself. The ferroelectric liquid is a nematic liquid crystal, in which almost complete polar ordering of the molecular dipoles generates an internal macroscopic polarization locally collinear to the mean molecular long axis. Upon entering the ferroelectric phase, droplets are either attracted toward the center of the beam or repelled, depending on the side of the lithium niobate exposed to light irradiation. Moreover, moving the beam results in walking the ferroelectric droplet over long distances on the substrate. This behavior is understood as due to the coupling between the polarization of the ferroelectric droplet and the polarization photoinduced in the irradiated region of the lithium niobate substrate. Indeed, the effect is not observed in the conventional nematic phase, suggesting the crucial role of the ferroelectric liquid crystal polarization.

         <title>Cuproptosis Induced by ROS Responsive Nanoparticles with Elesclomol and Copper Combined with &#945;PD&#8208;L1 for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2212267, Nianzeng Xing, Haihua Xiao, and co&#8208;workers provides a novel therapeutic strategy to achieve synergistic cancer immunotherapy via cuproptosis induced by ROS&#8208;responsive nanomedicine loaded with elesclomol and copper (NP@ESCu). With this approach, the tumor microenvironment is reprogrammed, and the expression of PD&#8208;L1 is increased, which consequently improves responsiveness of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Cuproptosis is a new cell death that depends on copper (Cu) ionophores to transport Cu into cancer cells, which induces cell death. However, existing Cu ionophores are small molecules with a short blood half&#8208;life making it hard to transport enough Cu into cancer cells. Herein, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive polymer (PHPM) is designed, which is used to co&#8208;encapsulate elesclomol (ES) and Cu to form nanoparticles (NP@ESCu). After entering cancer cells, ES and Cu, triggered by excessive intracellular ROS, are readily released. ES and Cu work in a concerted way to not only kill cancer cells by cuproptosis, but also induce immune responses. In vitro, the ability of NP@ESCu to efficiently transport Cu and induce cuproptosis is investigated. In addition, the change in the transcriptomes of cancer cells treated with NP@ESCu is explored by RNA&#8208;Seq. In vivo, NP@ESCu is found to induce cuproptosis in the mice model with subcutaneous bladder cancer, reprograming the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, NP@ESCu is further combined with anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein ligand&#8208;1&#160;antibody (&#945;PD&#8208;L1). This study provides the first report of combining nanomedicine that can induce cuproptosis with &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#160;for enhanced cancer therapy, thereby providing a novel strategy for future cancer therapy.

With this approach, the tumor microenvironment is reprogrammed, and the expression of PD-L1 is increased, which consequently improves responsiveness of immunotherapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuproptosis is a new cell death that depends on copper (Cu) ionophores to transport Cu into cancer cells, which induces cell death. However, existing Cu ionophores are small molecules with a short blood half-life making it hard to transport enough Cu into cancer cells. Herein, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive polymer (PHPM) is designed, which is used to co-encapsulate elesclomol (ES) and Cu to form nanoparticles (NP@ESCu). After entering cancer cells, ES and Cu, triggered by excessive intracellular ROS, are readily released. ES and Cu work in a concerted way to not only kill cancer cells by cuproptosis, but also induce immune responses. In vitro, the ability of NP@ESCu to efficiently transport Cu and induce cuproptosis is investigated. In addition, the change in the transcriptomes of cancer cells treated with NP@ESCu is explored by RNA-Seq. In vivo, NP@ESCu is found to induce cuproptosis in the mice model with subcutaneous bladder cancer, reprograming the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, NP@ESCu is further combined with anti-programmed cell death protein ligand-1&#160;antibody (&#945;PD-L1). This study provides the first report of combining nanomedicine that can induce cuproptosis with &#945;PD-L1&#160;for enhanced cancer therapy, thereby providing a novel strategy for future cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Immunotherapy
In article 2212267, Haihua Xiao, Nianzeng Xing, and co&#8208;workers present a novel therapeutic strategy to achieve synergistic cancer immunotherapy via cuproptosis induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive nanomedicine loaded with elesclomol and copper (NP@ESCu). With this approach, the tumor microenvironment is reprogrammed, and the expression of PD&#8208;L1 is increased, which consequently improves responsiveness of immunotherapy.

Perovskite Solar Modules
In article number 2211593, Yang Wang, Yanlin Song, and co&#8208;workers propose a strategy of vapor&#8208;assisted defect passivation to manage defects in perovskite solar modules. CS2 can strongly coordinate with undercoordinated Pb2+ and passivate iodide vacancy defects, resulting in remarkable enhancement of the device efficiency (25.20% for 0.08 cm2 and 20.66% for 40.6 cm2).

         <title>Molecular Complementarity of Proteomimetic Materials for Target&#8208;Specific Recognition and Recognition&#8208;Mediated Complex Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nature, proteins perform various recognition&#8208;mediated molecular functions relying on the principle of molecular complementarity. This review introduces how diverse synthesizable and modifiable materials with elaborate structural and molecular designs can achieve the molecular complementarity in mediating complex protein&#8208;like functions, such as allosteric regulation, signal transduction, enzymatic reactions, and stimuli&#8208;responsive motions, expanding the landscape of their proteomimetic applications.








Abstract
As biomolecules essential for sustaining life, proteins are generated from long chains of 20 different &#945;&#8208;amino acids that are folded into unique 3D structures. In particular, many proteins have molecular recognition functions owing to their binding pockets, which have complementary shapes, charges, and polarities for specific targets, making these biopolymers unique and highly valuable for biomedical and biocatalytic applications. Based on the understanding of protein structures and microenvironments, molecular complementarity can be exhibited by synthesizable and modifiable materials. This has prompted researchers to explore the proteomimetic potentials of a diverse range of materials, including biologically available peptides and oligonucleotides, synthetic supramolecules, inorganic molecules, and related coordination networks. To fully resemble a protein, proteomimetic materials perform the molecular recognition to mediate complex molecular functions, such as allosteric regulation, signal transduction, enzymatic reactions, and stimuli&#8208;responsive motions; this can also expand the landscape of their potential bio&#8208;applications. This review focuses on the recognitive aspects of proteomimetic designs derived for individual materials and their conformations. Recent progress provides insights to help guide the development of advanced protein mimicry with material heterogeneity, design modularity, and tailored functionality. The perspectives and challenges of current proteomimetic designs and tools are also discussed in relation to future applications.

         <title>Molecular Electronics: Creating and Bridging Molecular Junctions and Promoting Its Commercialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive investigation of nanogap electrode fabrication protocols according to new classification principles is provided. How to integrate molecules into nanogap electrodes to form molecular junctions and highlight recent efforts toward the commercialization of molecular circuits are summarized, eventually overcoming the Achilles&#8217; heel of molecular electronics as a whole.








Abstract
Molecular electronics is driven by the dream of expanding Moore's law to the molecular level for next&#8208;generation electronics through incorporating individual or ensemble molecules into electronic circuits. For nearly 50 years, numerous efforts have been made to explore the intrinsic properties of molecules and develop diverse fascinating molecular electronic devices with the desired functionalities. The flourishing of molecular electronics is inseparable from the development of various elegant methodologies for creating nanogap electrodes and bridging the nanogap with molecules. This review first focuses on the techniques for making lateral and vertical nanogap electrodes by breaking, narrowing, and fixed modes, and highlights their capabilities, applications, merits, and shortcomings. After summarizing the approaches of growing single molecules or molecular layers on the electrodes, the methods of constructing a complete molecular circuit are comprehensively grouped into three categories: 1) directly bridging one&#8208;molecule&#8211;electrode component with another electrode, 2) physically bridging two&#8208;molecule&#8211;electrode components, and 3) chemically bridging two&#8208;molecule&#8211;electrode components. Finally, the current state of molecular circuit integration and commercialization is discussed and perspectives are provided, hoping to encourage the community to accelerate the realization of fully scalable molecular electronics for a new era of integrated microsystems and applications.

         <title>Modulations in Superconductors: Probes of Underlying Physics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulations in superconductors are summarized comprehensively, which includes state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques and those established methods. The significance of modulations in exploring the superconductivity is highlighted by applications into several newly discovered superconductors. Three directions for development of modulations are also outlined.








Abstract
The importance of modulations is elevated to an unprecedented level, due to the delicate conditions required to bring out exotic phenomena in quantum materials, such as topological materials, magnetic materials, and superconductors. Recently, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art modulation techniques in material science, such as electric&#8208;double&#8208;layer transistor, piezoelectric&#8208;based strain apparatus, angle twisting, and nanofabrication, have been utilized in superconductors. They not only efficiently increase the tuning capability to the broader ranges but also extend the tuning dimensionality to unprecedented degrees of freedom, including quantum fluctuations of competing phases, electronic correlation, and phase coherence essential to global superconductivity. Here, for a comprehensive review, these techniques together with the established modulation methods, such as elemental substitution, annealing, and polarization&#8208;induced gating, are contextualized. Depending on the mechanism of each method, the modulations are categorized into stoichiometric manipulation, electrostatic gating, mechanical modulation, and geometrical design. Their recent advances are highlighted by applications in newly discovered superconductors, e.g., nickelates, Kagome metals, and magic&#8208;angle graphene. Overall, the review is to provide systematic modulations in emergent superconductors and serve as the coordinate for future investigations, which can stimulate researchers in superconductivity and other fields to perform various modulations toward a thorough understanding of quantum materials.

         <title>Ferroelectric Transistors for Memory and Neuromorphic Device Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments in hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectric materials and their applications are comprehensively reviewed, with an in&#8208;depth analysis of ferroelectric transistors and their array structures. The relevant technological issues and their solutions are also discussed. This review provides a roadmap for the development of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric memory and neuromorphic devices based on ferroelectric transistors.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials have been intensively investigated for high&#8208;performance nonvolatile memory devices in the past decades, owing to their nonvolatile polarization characteristics. Ferroelectric memory devices are expected to exhibit lower power consumption and higher speed than conventional memory devices. However, non&#8208;complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility and degradation due to fatigue of traditional perovskite&#8208;based ferroelectric materials have hindered the development of high&#8208;density and high&#8208;performance ferroelectric memories in the past. The recently developed hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectric materials have attracted immense attention in the development of advanced semiconductor devices. Because hafnia is typically used in CMOS processes, it can be directly incorporated into current semiconductor technologies. Additionally, hafnia&#8208;based ferroelectrics show high scalability and large coercive fields that are advantageous for high&#8208;density memory devices. This review summarizes the recent developments in ferroelectric devices, especially ferroelectric transistors, for next&#8208;generation memory and neuromorphic applications. First, the types of ferroelectric memories and their operation mechanisms are reviewed. Then, issues limiting the realization of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric transistors and possible solutions are discussed. The experimental demonstration of ferroelectric transistor arrays, including 3D ferroelectric NAND and its operation characteristics, are also reviewed. Finally, challenges and strategies toward the development of next&#8208;generation memory and neuromorphic applications based on ferroelectric transistors are outlined.

         <title>Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 22, June 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiency of proton exchange membrane based electrolyzers is highly dependent on the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the anode. The recent progress on the design of acidic OER electrocatalysts is reviewed, along with theoretical and experimental studies on the intrinsic mechanisms. Furthermore, some unresolved but urgent questions and the perspectives regarding future research for acidic OER electrocatalysts are provided.








Abstract
The well&#8208;established proton exchange membrane (PEM)&#8208;based water electrolysis, which operates under acidic conditions, possesses many advantages compared to alkaline water electrolysis, such as compact design, higher voltage efficiency, and higher gas purity. However, PEM&#8208;based water electrolysis is hampered by the low efficiency, instability, and high cost of anodic electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this review, the recently reported acidic OER electrocatalysts are comprehensively summarized, classified, and discussed. The related fundamental studies on OER mechanisms and the relationship between activity and stability are particularly highlighted in order to provide an atomistic&#8208;level understanding for OER catalysis. A stability test protocol is suggested to evaluate the intrinsic activity degradation. Some current challenges and unresolved questions, such as the usage of carbon&#8208;based materials and the differences between the electrocatalyst performances in acidic electrolytes and PEM&#8208;based electrolyzers are also discussed. Finally, suggestions for the most promising electrocatalysts and a perspective for future research are outlined. This review presents a fresh impetus and guideline to the rational design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance acidic OER electrocatalysts for PEM&#8208;based water electrolysis.
