         <title>Resonant Interlayer Coupling in NbSe2&#8208;Graphite Epitaxial Moir&#233; Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory derived calculations, this work reveals strong interlayer coupling and moir&#233; replicas of the graphite &#960; states in molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy grown van der Waals heterostructures of monolayer&#8208;NbSe2/graphite, with implications for its collective phases that form.








Abstract
Moir&#233; heterostructures, created by stacking 2D materials together with a finite lattice mismatch or rotational twist, represent a new frontier of designer quantum materials. Typically, however, this requires the painstaking manual assembly of heterostructures formed from exfoliated materials. Here, clear spectroscopic signatures of moir&#233; lattice formation in epitaxial heterostructures of monolayer (ML) NbSe2 grown on graphite substrates are observed.&#160;Angle&#8208;resolved photoemission measurements and theoretical calculations of the resulting electronic structure reveal moir&#233; replicas of the graphite &#960; states forming pairs of interlocking Dirac cones. Interestingly, these intersect the NbSe2 Fermi surface at the k$k$&#8208;space locations where NbSe2's charge&#8208;density wave (CDW) gap is maximal in the bulk. This provides a natural route to understand the lack of CDW enhancement for ML&#8208;NbSe2/graphene as compared to a more than fourfold enhancement for NbSe2 on insulating support substrates, and opens new prospects for using moir&#233; engineering for controlling the collective states of 2D&#160;materials.

         <title>Opportunities of Semiconducting Oxide Nanostructures as Advanced Luminescent Materials in Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review discusses the challenges of wide and ultrawide bandgap semiconducting oxides as a suitable material platform for photonics. They offer great versatility in terms of tuning microstructure, native defects, doping, anisotropy, and micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;structuring. The review focuses on their light emission, light&#8208;confinement in optical cavities, and their prospects for single photon sources. 








Abstract
The luminescence properties of semiconductors are key to the development of photonics. In recent years, the targeted semiconductor materials have shifted from narrow&#8208;bandgap to wide&#8208; and ultra&#8208;wide&#8208;bandgap ones, which means spanning the domains of operation for devices beyond those possible with conventional semiconductors in the fields of high&#8208;power devices and deep&#8208;ultraviolet photodetectors. Furthermore, materials nanostructures with one or more dimensions at the nanoscale drive additional novelties in their optical properties, boosting innovative features. The next step in advanced materials necessarily goes through the quantum &#8211; photonic link, in which electromagnetic waves and electronic quantum states display all possible degrees of freedom. To achieve effective advances in this field, both innovative research in materials science and the development of suitable strategies to assess the quantum signatures in the material systems under study are required. This work reviews the fascinating light emission and confinement in wide and ultra&#8208;wide bandgap semiconducting oxides of technological interest in nanostructured form, focusing on their luminescence and the key role they can play in future quantum photonic technologies, such as single photon sources and quantum sensing. Finally, an outlook on future avenues in research is&#160;outlined.

         <title>Liquid Metal Microrobots for Magnetically Guided Transvascular Navigation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metal&#8208;based microrobots combine magnetic steering, intrinsic X&#8208;ray visibility and softness, to navigate blood vessels even against flow. Under clinically relevant magnetic fields, liquid metal microrobots roll along vessel walls, cross endothelial barriers, and accumulate in target tissues. Their robust motion and imaging contrast highlight their potential for minimally invasive, image&#8208;guided biomedical interventions.








Abstract
Soft microrobots, compared with their rigid counterparts, offer superior adaptability in dynamic and confined biological environments. Here, magnetically&#8208;guided liquid metal microrobots composed of gallium&#8208;indium alloys embedded with Fe nanoparticles are introduced. The unique combination of magnetic maneuverability, high surface tension, intrinsic radiopacity, and deformability allows liquid metal&#8208;based microbots to overcome limitations of both hard microrobots and fragile droplet&#8208;based systems. Under magnetic actuation, liquid metal&#8208;based magnetic microrobots exhibit controllable rolling and upstream locomotion resembling neutrophil&#8208;like navigation, enabling precise maneuvering even against physiological flow. Bridging in vitro with in vivo experiments, quail egg chorioallantoic membrane models are used to demonstrate guided transport of these microrobots through blood vessels, accumulation at tumor xenografts, and migration within subcutaneous tissues. Moreover, their strong X&#8208;ray visibility enables real&#8208;time fluoroscopic tracking, validated in porcine heart vasculature. Importantly, liquid metal&#8208;based magnetic microbots can cross endothelial barriers in a vascular flow&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip platform, while maintaining endothelial biocompatibility. By integrating deformability, magnetic steerability, and imaging visibility, liquid metal&#8208;based microrobots establish a powerful platform for minimally invasive transvascular navigation. This work highlights the potential of liquid metal&#8208;based magnetic microrobots for targeted drug delivery, image&#8208;guided therapy, and intelligent biomedical interventions.

         <title>Dynamic Geminal&#8208;Atom Coordination for Highly Efficient Photo&#8208;Fenton Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu based geminal&#8208;atom catalyst leverages inert carbonate ions in seawater to dynamically reorganize active centers, enhancing photo&#8208;Fenton reactivity. In situ spectroscopy and theory reveal reversible Cu&#8208;CO32&#8722; coordination and accelerated charge transfer, achieving 17&#8208;fold higher &#183;OH yield, efficient pollutant and Chlorella degradation, and proven environmental and economic sustainability.








ABSTRACT
Understanding and leveraging non&#8208;reactive species in natural environments to modulate the active centers of geminal&#8208;atom catalysts (GACs) is crucial for enhancing their catalytic performance. Here, we develop a two&#8208;coordinated copper geminal&#8208;atom catalyst and reveal that the ubiquitous yet inert carbonate ions (CO32&#8722;) in seawater dynamically reorganize the coordination environment of active copper sites, thereby enhancing photo&#8208;Fenton reactivity. Control experiments, in situ spectroscopy and theoretical modeling demonstrate that CO32&#8722; induces reversible coordination transformations that modulate the electronic structure and facilitate interfacial charge transfer, resulting in a 17&#8208;fold increase in hydroxyl radical production. This effect enables efficient degradation of diverse marine pollutants, including effective Chlorella decomposition under natural sunlight. Life&#8208;cycle and technoeconomic assessments further demonstrate the environmental benefits and economic feasibility of this approach. Overall, this work establishes a generalizable strategy for active geminal&#8208;atom catalysts via environmentally abundant species, offering mechanistic insights and scalable pathways toward large&#8208;scale and sustainable aquatic pollution remediation.

         <title>Lattice Mismatched Platinum&#8208;Tellurium@Platinum&#8208;Ruthenium Core@Shell Nanorods Achieve Ultrahigh Alkaline Hydrogen Electrocatalysis for Dual Practical Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of LM&#8208;PtTe2@PtxRu NRs (x = 2, 4, 9, 12, 16) have been constructed for highly efficient alkaline HER and HOR catalysis, in which the optimized LM&#8208;PtTe2@Pt9Ru NRs with moderate lattice mismatch degree of 18.7% exhibit the best HER, HOR, and their MEA performances, demonstrating an unprecedented potential for dual AEMWE and AEMFC devices.








ABSTRACT
Lattice mismatch engineering is necessary yet challenging for core@shell structured platinum (Pt)&#8208;based catalysts in alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. Herein, a series of lattice mismatched Pt&#8208;tellurium@Pt&#8208;ruthenium core@shell nanorods (LM&#8208;PtTe2@PtxRu NRs, x = 2, 4, 9, 12, 16) are constructed for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The optimized LM&#8208;PtTe2@Pt9Ru/C exhibits much better HOR and HER performances versus commercial PtRu/C and Pt/C. More importantly, its ultrahigh membrane electrode assembly (MEA) power densities of 26.4/21.0&#160;W mgPt+Ru&#8722;1 in H2&#8208;O2/H2&#8208;air media for anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) and remarkable MEA performance of 1.55 V@0.5&#8201;A cm&#8722;2/2.0 V@5.8&#8201;A cm&#8722;2 for AEM water electrolysis (AEMWE) outperform the vast majority of PtRu&#8208;based catalysts reported to date, displaying an unprecedented potential in dual practical devices. The lattice mismatch degree of 18.7% between trigonal PtTe2 and cubic Pt9Ru induces numerous lattice dislocations and unusual lattice strain effect in LM&#8208;PtTe2@Pt9Ru/C, which simultaneously optimizes the surface electron distribution and the adsorption of intermediates, responsible for its high hydrogen catalysis performance. This work aims to achieve the high&#8208;performance MEA catalysis for AEMFC and AEMWE with lattice mismatch engineering induced by these well&#8208;organized PtRu&#8208;based core@shell nanocatalysts.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Artificial Photosynthetic Machinery for Carbon Dioxide Capture and Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biohybrid semi&#8208;artificial photosynthetic system that integrates carbonic anhydrase (CA) and a CuZn nanozyme photosensitizer with a dendritic polymer (PPA) is constructed for the sustainable transformation of CO2 into dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The PPA&#8208;wrapped CA/CuZn can capture CO2 to form active intermediates. Through photo&#8208;induced charge transfer under visible light illumination, the CA/CuZn@PPA system achieves 100% selectivity for DMC production at room temperature and low CO2 pressure.








ABSTRACT
Producing value&#8208;added chemicals directly from CO2 powered by sunlight offers a sustainable approach to addressing both environmental and economic challenges. However, the inherent chemical stability of CO2 poses a grand challenge in achieving highly active and selective CO2 conversion. Herein, we develop a biohybrid semi&#8208;artificial photosynthetic system that integrates carbonic anhydrase (CA) and a CuZn nanozyme photosensitizer with a dendritic polymer (PPA) for the sustainable transformation of CO2 into dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The PPA&#8208;wrapped CA/CuZn can capture CO2 to form active intermediates. Through photo&#8208;induced charge transfer under visible light illumination, the CA/CuZn@PPA system achieves 100% selectivity for DMC production at room temperature and low CO2 pressure.

         <title>Operationally Stable Perovskite Solar Modules Enabled by MA&#8208;Free Perovskite Crystallization and Passivation via Scalable Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable, air&#8208;processed blade&#8208;coating of Cs&#8211;FA perovskites is enabled by CsPbX3&#8211;NMP inks and optimized Br incorporation, yielding dense films with controlled crystallization. A newly designed CHCA passivator ensures homogeneous surface interactions. The integrated strategy delivers high module efficiency and exceptional operational stability, advancing perovskite photovoltaics toward practical commercialization.








ABSTRACT
Perovskite solar modules (PSMs) must deliver not only high&#8208;power conversion efficiency (PCE) but also long&#8208;term operational stability to approach commercialization. Yet efficiency and stability are both compromised when translating laboratory spin&#8208;coated perovskite solar cells (PSCs) into scalable PSMs, owing to mismatched crystallization dynamics, ineffective defect passivation, and compositional degradation. Here we resolve these challenges through a three&#8208;pronged strategy. First, we deconstruct the compositional origins of operational stability, identifying MA (methylammonium)&#8208;free Cs&#8211;FA (formamidinium) composition as intrinsically robust against continuous operation. Second, we tailor the phase&#8208;transition and crystallization pathways of air&#8208;processed scalable&#8208;coating by controlled Br incorporation in CsPbX3, which reconciles precursor solubility, nucleation kinetics, and &#945;&#8208;phase stability, yielding dense and defect&#8208;suppressed films. Finally, we analyze the root cause of scalable passivation inefficacy and developed cyclohexanecarboxamidinium (CHCA) as a blade&#8208;coating&#8208;compatible passivator enabling uniform and durable defect suppression. The optimized devices exhibited improved PCEs up to 26.1% (0.646 cm2) and 22.8% (20.8 cm2). Meanwhile, we documented exceptional operational stability with &#8764;3200&#160;h T96 for PSC and &#8764;2000&#160;h T84 for PSM. Our findings establish a mechanistic framework for achieving operationally stable perovskite solar modules under industrially relevant conditions.

         <title>Fundamentals, Status, and Prospects of Liquid Organic Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Focusing on organic liquid electrolytes toward commercialization, this review links solvent&#8211;salt&#8211;additive chemistry with electrode requirements, operational extremes, and manufacturability considerations. By aligning electrolyte formulation with emerging high&#8208;energy cathodes, high&#8208;capacity anodes, and real&#8208;world deployment scenarios, it provides a practical framework for advancing competitive, scalable high&#8208;energy sodium&#8208;ion battery technologies.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as one of the most promising candidates among post&#8208;Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to abundance and low cost of sodium resources. However, the commercialization of SIBs is hindered by their limited cell performance. Although great efforts have been made, it is still challenging to balance the trade&#8208;off between energy density and cycle life while simultaneously meeting the requirements for practical applications, which are largely governed by the stability of the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Therefore, it is crucial to design new electrolyte components or formulations to stabilize the interphases and thus the cycling stability for high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;capacity cathodes/anodes. In this review, based on a comprehensive comparison of the fundamental mechanisms between SIBs and LIBs, the challenges and governing principles for electrolyte design in SIBs are first introduced. The progress in electrolyte designs for various high&#8208;energy cathodes is summarized according to their ion&#8208;transport characteristics and the interphase formation. Electrolyte design strategies, particularly for the high&#8208;capacity anodes, are also surveyed, together with effective electrolyte design strategies to fulfill the requirements under practical operating conditions. Finally, future perspectives on electrolyte development from the viewpoints of full cell&#8208;level performance, cost, and feasibility are highlighted. This review aims to provide a roadmap for advancing electrolyte design toward practical&#160;SIBs competitive with LIBs.

         <title>Photoswitchable Dual&#8208;Color Fluorescence With Large Stokes Shift From Dye&#8208;Encapsulated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Dynamic Cellular Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photoswitchable dual&#8208;emitting MOF&#8208;based material is constructed by integrating spiropyran as a cascade ET mediator with two fluorescent dyes coumarin 153 (C153) and methylene blue (MB) into rho&#8208;ZMOF. The system exhibits dynamically switchable green/red fluorescence with a large Stokes shift, showing great promise for high&#8208;resolution, depth&#8208;resolved bioimaging applications.








ABSTRACT
Photoswitchable dual&#8208;color fluorescent materials are highly valuable for applications in cellular imaging and super&#8208;resolution microscopy. However, realizing these materials, especially broadening their Stokes shift remains a critical challenge. Herein, a novel strategy for achieving photoswitchable dual&#8208;emission fluorescence with a large Stokes shift is proposed via a cascade energy transfer (ET) process in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). By incorporating the photoisomerizable molecule spiropyran as an ET intermediate, and two fluorescent dyes coumarin 153 (Cou153) and methylene blue (MB) within a MOF, rho&#8208;ZMOF, the dual&#8208;color dynamic luminescent material rho&#8208;ZMOF&#8835;Cou153&amp;SP&amp;MB is achieved. When excited at 400&#160;nm, rho&#8208;ZMOF&#8835;Cou153&amp;SP&amp;MB exhibits coumarin&#8208;centered green emission at 516&#160;nm and methylene blue&#8208;centered red fluorescence at 700&#160;nm, with a maximum Stokes shift of 300&#160;nm. More importantly, these dual&#8208;color emissions can be reversibly switched on or off upon altering UV&#8208; and visible&#8208;light irradiation because of the photoswitchable cascade energy transfer from coumarin 153 to methylene blue based on the photochromic transformation of spiropyran. As an example, the potential use of rho&#8208;ZMOF&#8835;Cou153&amp;SP&amp;MB in high&#8208;resolution and depth&#8208;resolved bioimaging is demonstrated.

     alt="Photoswitchable Dual-Color Fluorescence With Large Stokes Shift From Dye-Encapsulated Metal-Organic Framework for Dynamic Cellular Imaging"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel photoswitchable dual-emitting MOF-based material is constructed by integrating spiropyran as a cascade ET mediator with two fluorescent dyes coumarin 153 (C153) and methylene blue (MB) into rho-ZMOF. The system exhibits dynamically switchable green/red fluorescence with a large Stokes shift, showing great promise for high-resolution, depth-resolved bioimaging applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoswitchable dual-color fluorescent materials are highly valuable for applications in cellular imaging and super-resolution microscopy. However, realizing these materials, especially broadening their Stokes shift remains a critical challenge. Herein, a novel strategy for achieving photoswitchable dual-emission fluorescence with a large Stokes shift is proposed via a cascade energy transfer (ET) process in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). By incorporating the photoisomerizable molecule spiropyran as an ET intermediate, and two fluorescent dyes coumarin 153 (Cou153) and methylene blue (MB) within a MOF, rho-ZMOF, the dual-color dynamic luminescent material rho-ZMOF&#8835;Cou153&amp;amp;SP&amp;amp;MB is achieved. When excited at 400&#160;nm, rho-ZMOF&#8835;Cou153&amp;amp;SP&amp;amp;MB exhibits coumarin-centered green emission at 516&#160;nm and methylene blue-centered red fluorescence at 700&#160;nm, with a maximum Stokes shift of 300&#160;nm. More importantly, these dual-color emissions can be reversibly switched on or off upon altering UV- and visible-light irradiation because of the photoswitchable cascade energy transfer from coumarin 153 to methylene blue based on the photochromic transformation of spiropyran. As an example, the potential use of rho-ZMOF&#8835;Cou153&amp;amp;SP&amp;amp;MB in high-resolution and depth-resolved bioimaging is demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance NIR&#8208;II Sn&#8208;Based Perovskite LEDs Enabled by the Functionalization of Sulfaguanidine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we demonstrate that the incorporation of sulfaguanidine (SG) molecules effectively passivates Sn2+&#8208;related defects in CsSnI3 perovskite. Moreover, SG molecules promote the growth of crystals with improved morphological uniformity and facilitate balanced carrier injection. As a result, CsSnI3&#8208;SG light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with an emission peak at 948 nm achieved a record EQE of 8.1%.








ABSTRACT
Eco&#8208;friendly CsSnI3&#8208;based perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with the emission peak extending to the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) region hold tremendous potential for applications in biological monitoring, night vision, and optical communications. However, the various defects caused by the instability of Sn2+ within the CsSnI3 film, and the non&#8208;equilibrium carrier injection rate in the devices are the two major factors that limit the device performance. Here, we report high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II CsSnI3&#8208;based PeLEDs achieved by employing functional sulfaguanidine (SG) molecules. Due to the strong S&#9552;O&#9472;Sn coordination bonds, NH2&#183;&#183;&#183;I&#8722; hydrogen bonds could be formed between CsSnI3 and SG, which effectively eliminated various Sn(II)&#8208;related defects in the CsSnI3 film. Moreover, the SG molecules significantly improved the morphological uniformity and regulated the carrier injection balance, resulting in more balanced carrier injection that enhanced the effective radiation recombination rate. Consequently, the optimized CsSnI3&#8208;SG PeLEDs achieved a breakthrough external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.1%, which is the highest efficiency reported for CsSnI3&#8208;based PeLEDs to date.

         <title>Reconfigurable Multi&#8208;Stimuli Responsive Smart Phosphorescent Polymer Composites with Time&#8208;Dependent and Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Phosphorescence Color Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New reconfigurable smart phosphorescent polymer composites with time&#8208;dependent phosphorescent color variation modulated by multiple stimuli are prepared, which promotes the development of smart security technologies with multi&#8208;dimensional and multi&#8208;level encryption capabilities.








ABSTRACT
Developing smart systems based on phosphorescent materials that can control the time&#8208;dependent phosphorescent color (TDPC) in response to external stimuli holds promise for advancing information encryption, but significant challenges remain. Herein, a facile strategy is proposed to construct smart phosphorescent polymer composites through immobilizing dual&#8208;emission centers with distinct stimuli sensitivities within a soft&#8208;rigid coupled hybrid matrix. The smart phosphorescent polymer composites show switchable phosphorescence between static phosphorescence and wavelength&#8208;dependent dynamic TDPC, induced by multi&#8208;stimuli (light, humidity, heat). The photoactivated phosphorescent composites transform from initial static monochromatic emission to dynamic multicolor TDPC through the synergistic effect of triplet oxygen depletion&#8208;induced selective activation of the emission centers and the distinct decay rates of the dual&#8208;emission centers. The evolution paths of TDPC also exhibit excitation&#8208;dependence. Moreover, the photoactivated composites enable reversible switching between dynamic TDPC and monochromatic phosphorescence through water and thermal stimuli, due to the combined effects of water&#8208;induced dissociation of the rigid hydrogen&#8208;bonding network and differential quenching of the dual&#8208;emission centers. The composites also exhibit recyclability and self&#8208;healing capability. The processable smart phosphorescent polymer composites with good stability demonstrate outstanding potential in multi&#8208;dimensional information encryption, opening up a new perspective for upgrading security technologies.

         <title>Solar Energy Storage in Polyoxometalate for On&#8208;Demand Hydrogen Transportation and Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under sunlight irradiation, the semiconductor can transfer photogenerated electrons to polyoxometalates, enabling a unique system that achieves spatiotemporal separation of light absorption, electron storage, and on&#8208;demand hydrogen production.








ABSTRACT
Widespread application of solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production is hindered by critical limitations: the inherent safety risks of high&#8208;pressure H2 storage/transport, and the intermittent nature of solar energy. To address these challenges, we develop a solar energy storage and on&#8208;demand hydrogen production system by synergistically integrating commercial polyoxometalate (NH4)6H2W12O40 (W12) with graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4). This system demonstrates remarkable efficiency in storing solar energy as electrons within W12 during illumination. These stored electrons can be released on demand in the dark through Pt/C activation to produce H2, achieving a highly efficient hydrogen evolution rate of 3220&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under dark photocatalytic conditions. Notably, the system maintains robust performance under real&#8208;world conditions, delivering an outdoor hydrogen evolution rate of 954&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under natural sunlight irradiation. Detailed analysis reveals an optimized electron storage&#8208;release pathway, facilitated by the favorable alignment between the reduction potential of W12 and the band structure of g&#8208;C3N4, as well as the electrostatic self&#8208;assembly driven by oppositely charged g&#8208;C3N4 and W12. In this system, solar energy is facilely stored as stabilized electrons within the POM&#8208;semiconductor suspension, which can then be efficiently transported to light&#8208;deficient environments and controllably released for on&#8208;demand hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Mediated Gradient Oxygenophilic Architecture on High&#8208;Entropy Alloy for Dynamic Spillover and Bifunctional Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise control of competitive adsorption behavior of H* and OH* intermediates represents a fundamental challenge in hydrogen electrocatalysis. By engineering gradient oxyphilic sites within high&#8208;entropy alloys, we create continuous energy landscapes that enable low&#8208;barrier spillover pathways, break conventional scaling relations, and overcome kinetic limitations&#8212;transcending the static Sabatier principle through dynamic surface regulation.








ABSTRACT
Breaking scaling relations and overcoming kinetic limitations in multistep hydrogen electrocatalysis remains a fundamental challenge. In this work, we designed and synthesized a high&#8208;entropy alloy catalyst comprising Ir, Ru, Mo, W, and Cu supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon spheres. This unique structure creates active sites with a quasi&#8208;continuous distribution of binding energies for H* and OH* intermediates. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the random spatial arrangement of sites enables low&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier spillover pathways for H* and OH* (&#967;H*max = 0.27&#160;eV; &#967;OH*max = 0.61&#160;eV), while continuous d&#8208;orbital coupling facilitates efficient electron transfer. This design enables each elementary step of hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions (HOR/HER) to be directed to a site with favorable energetics. As a result, it exhibits exceptional bifunctional performance with a HOR mass activity of 8.83 A mg&#8722;1 and an HER overpotential of only 11&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/Ccom and previously reported catalysts. Operando spectroscopy and DFT analyses reveal that the gradient energy landscape promotes dynamic intermediate spillover, preventing site blocking and enhancing reaction kinetics. This work establishes a universal design strategy develop high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts that transcend conventional Sabatier principle limitations.

Operando spectroscopy and DFT analyses reveal that the gradient energy landscape promotes dynamic intermediate spillover, preventing site blocking and enhancing reaction kinetics. This work establishes a universal design strategy develop high-performance electrocatalysts that transcend conventional Sabatier principle limitations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programmable Multicolor Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Hydrogels via the Synergy of Freeze&#8208;Soaking and Salting&#8208;Out</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal freeze&#8208;soaking and salting&#8208;out strategy enables multicolor room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) hydrogels. By embedding phosphors within polymer microcrystalline domains, this method yields long&#8208;lived afterglow (&gt;10 s) in highly hydrated and flexible gels. Emission color and lifetime can be finely tuned through salt type, concentration, or dye incorporation, highlighting a broadly adaptable platform for phosphorescent soft materials.








Abstract
Room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is rarely achieved in hydrogel systems, as water severely quenches their emission. Achieving multicolor RTP in hydrogels is even more challenging, despite its high potential in cutting&#8208;edge applications such as advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting and camouflaging skins. Here, a universal strategy is presented to fabricate multicolor RTP hydrogels through the cascading freeze&#8208;soaking and salting&#8208;out process (F&#8208;S method). This method induces in situ polymer assembly around the phosphors, providing effective confinement and protection against quenching. As a result, RTP hydrogel (RTPgel) with strong phosphorescence (lifetime &gt; 200&#160;ms and afterglow &gt;10 s), high water content (71 %), and excellent flexibility (stretchability &gt; 3000%) is achieved in a modal system composed of polycyclic aromatic boronic acids (PABAs)&#8208;grafted polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Since chain aggregation strongly correlates with the kosmotropic nature of the salt solution, the phosphorescence properties, including lifetime and intensity, are feasibly tunable by re&#8208;soaking the hydrogels in solution with different types of salts or concentrations, enabling programmable spatiotemporal emission patterns. Such a method is universal, adaptable for various luminophores and polymer matrices, allowing customizable emission colors across a wide spectrum. Moreover, it is compatible with scalable, high&#8208;precision fabrication techniques such as fiber spinning, direct ink writing (DIW), and digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing.

         <title>An Injectable and Modular NO&#8208;Adaptive Delivery System for Modulating Regenerative Microenvironment in Long&#8208;Segment Nerve Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroactive nerve conduit integrating ROS&#8208;responsive NO&#8208;releasing nanoparticles and microgel&#8208;based hydrogels was developed for long&#8208;segment nerve repair. Adaptive NO release modulates inflammation, oxidative stress, angiogenesis, and mitochondrial function, while interconnected macroporous microgels support cell infiltration and axonal growth. Magnetically induced electrical stimulation further enhances neurotrophic factor secretion and directional nerve regeneration.








Abstract
Repairing long&#8208;segment peripheral nerve injuries remains a significant clinical challenge, hindered by oxidative stress, inflammation, insufficient revascularization, and limited axonal regeneration speeds. This study addresses these barriers by reconstructing the nerve regeneration microenvironment, enhancing cell migration, and accelerating axonal growth. An integrated regenerative microenvironment combining chemical signals, micro/nano structures, and electrical stimulation is developed. Specifically, nitric oxide (NO), a versatile signaling molecule, is dynamically released using sustained and responsive&#8208;release strategies to regulate oxidative stress and inflammation effectively. Furthermore, a gelatin&#8211;lipoic acid&#8211;seleno&#8208;lipoic acid (Gel&#8208;LA&#8208;SA) microgel&#8208;based hydrogel is designed, forming interconnected macroporous scaffolds that significantly enhance cell infiltration and growth compared to traditional hydrogels. Additionally, a non&#8208;invasive electroactive conduit is constructed to provide external electrical stimulation, promoting nerve cell migration and nerve growth factor secretion. Together, these elements guide axonal regeneration, support rapid revascularization, and enhance nutrient supply. By integrating NO signaling, advanced hydrogel scaffolds, and electrical stimulation, this multifunctional conduit effectively addresses the critical barriers to regenerating nerves across extensive defect sites, offering a promising approach for repairing long&#8208;segment peripheral nerve injuries and providing insights into broader applications for neurological disease treatment and tissue regeneration.

         <title>Bulk Fabrication of Space&#8208;Confined CsPbI3 Nanocrystal Films Toward Efficient and Bright Deep&#8208;Red LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk fabricated CsPbI3 nanocrystal films of &#8764;700&#160;nm emission are demonstrated with strong space confinement and minimized trap density. Modulated grain nucleation and growth, together with Lewis base coordination, enable the crystallization of high quality CsPbI3 nanocrystals. The resultant deep&#8208;red PeLEDs achieve a record EQE of 23.4% and an ultrahigh luminance of 10152&#160;cd m&#8722;2.








ABSTRACT
Deep&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with 690&#8722;710&#160;nm emission show high significance in optical, agricultural, and biomedical applications. As primary candidates for deep&#8208;red emitters, all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 films suffer from fused large grains with abundant trap states, leading to inferior performance of deep&#8208;red perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs). Here we report CsPbI3 nanocrystal films with strong space confinement and notable performance at &#8764;700&#160;nm of deep&#8208;red emission via bulk fabrication. The dual roles of diaza&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 dihydriodide additive as crystallization regulator and Lewis base ligand trigger more nucleation sites, retarded grain growth and passivated trap states, ensuring the crystallization of high&#8208;quality space&#8208;confined CsPbI3 nanocrystal films. This approach establishes a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.4% for deep&#8208;red PeLEDs, and achieves a maximum luminance of 10152&#160;cd m&#8722;2. Low roll&#8208;off is also demonstrated that EQE maintain over 20% under a high current density of 900&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, which is superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art deep&#8208;red organic and quantum&#8208;dot LEDs. The T50 operating lifetime is estimated to be 234 h at an initial radiance of 6.3&#160;W sr&#8722;1 m&#8722;2. This work provides an effectual strategy to accelerate radiative recombination and enhance the performance of CsPbI3&#8208;based deep&#8208;red PeLEDs.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Adaptive Artificial Synapses with High Linearity for Intelligent Computing in Extreme Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pressure&#8208;adaptive artificial synapse (PAAS) is developed based on VO2 nanoparticles, capable of neuromorphic computing under extreme high pressures up to &#8776;15 GPa.








Abstract
The ongoing exploration of the physical world has intensified the demand for intelligent computing in extreme environments. However, intelligent devices operating under extreme high&#8208;pressure conditions are limited by the pressure tolerance of the materials used for intelligent computing. A pressure&#8208;adaptive artificial synapse (PAAS) using VO2 (M1) nanoparticles is developed, leveraging the increased lattice rigidity during the M1&#8208;to&#8208;M1&#8217; phase transition (1 atm to 15.1&#160;GPa), which causes the photoinduced insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition to be Mott dominated. The PAAS demonstrated a stable operating current, a superior biomimetic plasticity (maximum paired&#8208;pulse facilitation index from 109.6% to 155.4%), and an improved postsynaptic current linearity (Pearson's r from 0.64 to 0.97) from 1 atm to 15.1&#160;GPa. Furthermore, an artificial neural network mapped by PAAS under high pressure achieved a validation accuracy of 95%&#8211;97% in handwritten digit recognition. The PAAS is also applied to a convolutional autoencoder for denoising reconstruction of color images.

         <title>Ferroelectric Transistors: from Materials Innovation to Intelligent Electronic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review surveys ferroelectric materials systems and polarization mechanisms, elucidates the device physics and engineering of three&#8208;terminal ferroelectric transistors, compares dielectric and semiconductor&#8208;based operation principles, and summarizes performance challenges and optimization strategies. It further reviews Ferroelectric transistor applications in nonvolatile memory, neuromorphic, and AI hardware, and outlines prospects for scalable, low&#8208;power, multifunctional electronics.








Abstract
The explosive growth of artificial intelligence, big data, and the Internet of Things is driving an unprecedented demand for computing power and energy efficiency. However, conventional von Neumann architectures are increasingly constrained by the physical and economic limits of transistor scaling in the post&#8208;Moore era. Ferroelectric transistors (FeFETs) are far more than a novel memory technology and instead represent a revolutionary platform that seamlessly integrates nonvolatile storage, in&#8208;memory computation, and multi&#8208;modal sensing into a single, energy&#8208;efficient device, overcoming&#160;the bottlenecks of traditional computing architectures. This review provides a comprehensive overview of ferroelectric materials, including perovskite oxides, hafnium&#8208;based compounds, organics, and emerging 2D systems, emphasizing their polarization original mechanisms and structureproperty relationships. This study focuses on the device physics and engineering of three terminal FeFETs, with particular attention to the current issues, optimization strategies, and contrasting operation principles of ferroelectric dielectric and semiconductor&#8208;based designs. Finally, the expanding applications of FeFETs in nonvolatile memory, neuromorphic computing, and artificial intelligence hardware from device to system integration is discussed, and an outlook toward scalable, low&#8208;power, and multifunctional electronics driven by ferroelectric innovation is presented.

         <title>Designing Synergistic Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Pairs in Compressed Bismuth&#8208;Copper Oxide for Selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Formate Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compressive lattice strain strengthens synergistic Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs (Bi&#8211;VO&#8211;Cu) in a bimetallic oxide catalyst via metal&#8208;oxygen bond contraction, optimizing the electronic structure for selective CO2 reduction. The strain&#8208;engineered catalyst achieves stable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion with &gt;95% Faradaic efficiency across industrial current densities and outstanding operational stability over 120 h, offering a general design principle for atomic&#8208;scale catalytic systems.








ABSTRACT
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) to formate represents a sustainable pathway for carbon utilization, yet its industrial deployment remains hindered by insufficient current density and stability of the electrocatalysts. While lattice strain engineering can modulate catalytic performance by altering electronic structures, a major challenge is the lack of a clear mechanistic understanding connecting the induced strain to the activity enhancement. Herein, by precisely engineering lattice strain in an atomically integrated catalytic system, we establish a definitive intrinsic structure&#8208;activity relationship, moving beyond conventional correlations with apparent properties. Combined experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that compressive strain effectively modulates the electronic structure of the Cu d&#8208;orbital and the local electronic states of oxygen vacancies, thereby enhancing the cooperation within the Lewis acid&#8211;base pairs. This mechanism facilitates CO2 adsorption and activation, stabilizes the key *HCOO intermediate, and significantly lowers the reaction energy barrier. Consequently, the catalyst exhibits high formate Faradaic efficiency (&gt;95%) over a broad current density range (&#8722;100 to &#8722;700 mA cm&#8722;2), achieving 96.1% at &#8722;576.8 mA cm&#8722;2. This research not only elucidates the synergistic Lewis acid&#8208;base catalytic mechanism at the molecular level but also provides universal design principles for the sustainable electro&#8208;synthesis of value&#8208;added formate.

         <title>Control of Covalent Bond Enables Efficient Magnetic Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant and reversible magnetocaloric effect (MCE) is achieved by tuning covalency through sub&#8208;unit&#8208;cell chemical engineering, establishing a novel design principle for effective hysteresis control in magnetocaloric materials.








Abstract
Magnetic cooling, harnessing the temperature change in matter when exposed to a magnetic field, presents an energy&#8208;efficient and climate&#8208;friendly alternative to traditional vapor&#8208;compression refrigeration systems, with a significantly lower global warming potential. The advancement of this technology would be accelerated if irreversible losses arising from hysteresis in magnetocaloric materials are minimized. Despite extensive efforts to manipulate crystal lattice constants at the unit&#8208;cell level, mitigating hysteresis often compromises cooling performance. Herein, we address this persistent challenge by forming Sn(Ge)3&#8722;Sn(Ge)3 bonds within the unit cell of the Gd5Ge4 compound. This approach enables an energetically favorable phase transition, leading to the elimination of thermal hysteresis. Consequently, we achieve a synergistic improvement of two key magnetocaloric figures of merit: a larger magnetic entropy change and a twofold increase in the reversible adiabatic temperature change (from 3.8 to 8 K) in the Gd5Sn2Ge2 compound. Such synergies can be extended over a wide temperature range of 40&#8211;160 K. This study demonstrates a paradigm shift in mastering hysteresis toward simultaneously achieving exceptional magnetocaloric metrics and opens up promising avenues for gas liquefaction applications in the longstanding pursuit of sustainable energy solutions.

De&#8208;Saturation of Single&#8208;Atom Copper Catalysts
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202509221), Jiong Lu, Yafei Zhao, Shibo Xi, and co&#8208;workers introduce a de&#8208;saturation strategy that efficiently converts the CuN4 into CuN3 under a KOH&#8208;mediated Joule thermal shock. The resulting de&#8208;saturated CuN3 catalysts promote copper&#8211;alkyny formation and significantly enhance catalytic performance. Symbolically, the CuN4&#8212;with a molecular weight of exactly 120&#8212;celebrates the 120th anniversary of NUS.

         <title>Advances in In Vitro Modeling of Cancer&#8208;Stromal Interactions: From Fundamental Insights to Translational Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate in vitro recreation of the tumor microenvironment, particularly the complex cancer&#8211;stromal interactions, is essential for deciphering cancer biology and advancing therapies. This review summarizes fundamental design principles for developing physiologically faithful tumor models, surveys recent technological and translational developments, and provides guidance for selecting modeling approaches based on specific&#160;research questions. Outstanding&#160;challenges and future directions are also discussed.








Abstract
Accurate in vitro modeling of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is essential for advancing our understanding of cancer biology and for developing effective anti&#8208;cancer therapeutics. Context&#8208;dependent and patient&#8208;specific, the dynamic interactions between cancer cells and stromal elements significantly affect tumor progression and treatment response. Recent advances in biomaterials, microdevices, and molecular analysis techniques have facilitated the development of in vitro tumor models that better replicate these cancer&#8208;stromal interactions. In turn, these models have deepened the understanding of cancer biology, leading to the discovery of new prognostic markers and establishing preclinical platforms that more reliably predict clinical outcomes. However, challenges persist in fully capturing the immense complexity of the TME and translating these models for real clinical impact. In this review, key design principles for creating physiologically relevant tumor models are first described, then the latest advances in tumor modeling that have contributed to new biological insights and progress in drug development are discussed.

         <title>From Pollution to Value: Electrochemical Systems for Transforming Flue Gas into Chemicals and Fuels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a comprehensive overview of the strategies whereby low&#8208;concentration CO2 in flue gas can be directly valorized to value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels. It covers recent progress in integrated CO2 capture and conversion, including amine and bi(carbonate) reduction&#8208;based systems. This study also focuses on how the presence of impurities such as oxygen, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides can be overcome.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) can enable the production of fuels and chemicals from CO2 emissions. Direct flue gas conversion can address the emissions from hard&#8208;to&#8208;abate sectors, including cement, steel, and power generation industries. Such integration with SCO2RR can also decarbonize the petrochemical industry and eliminate separation and purification steps. Here, recent progress and emerging opportunities for transformative flue&#8208;gas&#8208;tolerant systems for producing fuels and chemicals are reviewed. The review begins by analyzing recent progress in direct flue gas conversion and highlighting emerging micro&#8208;reaction environment features. Next, performance degradation mechanisms associated with flue gas conversion in CO2RR systems are discussed. Following this, the bicarbonate reduction reaction (BRR) and CO2RR from amine&#8208;based capture as emerging strategies for high&#8208;rate, selective, and stable electrosynthesis of chemicals from feeds containing low CO2 concentrations are highlighted. Finally, the mitigation of flue gas impurities such as oxygen, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides, is discussed,&#160;and perspectives for emerging opportunities are shared.

Such integration with SCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR can also decarbonize the petrochemical industry and eliminate separation and purification steps. Here, recent progress and emerging opportunities for transformative flue-gas-tolerant systems for producing fuels and chemicals are reviewed. The review begins by analyzing recent progress in direct flue gas conversion and highlighting emerging micro-reaction environment features. Next, performance degradation mechanisms associated with flue gas conversion in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR systems are discussed. Following this, the bicarbonate reduction reaction (BRR) and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR from amine-based capture as emerging strategies for high-rate, selective, and stable electrosynthesis of chemicals from feeds containing low CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations are highlighted. Finally, the mitigation of flue gas impurities such as oxygen, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides, is discussed,&#160;and perspectives for emerging opportunities are shared.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

It underscores the critical roles of porosity and framework design in facilitating adsorption and membrane&#8208;based separations, as well as in developing semiconductors with electronic properties vital for energy storage and conversion applications.








Abstract
2D open framework materials (2D OFMs), including metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), have emerged as a versatile class of materials that combine atomic precision, intrinsic porosity, and tunable chemical functionality. By bridging the structural features of inorganic layered materials with the chemical diversity of organic polymers, 2D OFMs provide unique opportunities in molecular separations, semiconductors, and related technologies. Their in&#8208;plane periodicity and layered architectures enable precise control over pore environment, stacking mode, and electronic coupling, thereby unlocking structure&#8211;property relationships not accessible in conventional porous materials. This review highlights recent advances in the topological design of 2D OFMs, incorporating functional skeletons and programmable pore architectures, as well as emerging characterization techniques capable of resolving structural details or providing high&#8208;resolution imaging at the atomic scale. Particular attention is given to the roles of porosity and the framework skeleton in enabling adsorptive and membrane&#8208;based separations, as well as to semiconductors with electronic properties that underpin energy storage and conversion applications. By providing a comprehensive overview of current progress and future directions, this review underscores the technological promise of 2D OFMs. The advances summarized here establish a foundation for further innovation and practical deployment across diverse scientific and engineering domains.

         <title>Design Strategies and Roles of Hydrogels for Sustainable Energy Conversion and Harvesting from Natural and Biological Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines hydrogel&#8208;based technologies driven by environmental stimuli and emphasizes their unique contributions to energy conversion. It provides insights into design strategies and recent advancements in functional hydrogels, highlighting opportunities and challenges in this field. As hydrogel&#8208;based energy harvesting evolves, innovative design, deeper mechanistic understanding, and interdisciplinary integration are needed to unlock its potential.








Abstract
The growing demand for sustainable energy has spurred interest in harvesting ambient sources, such as solar radiation, mechanical vibrations, water flow, and temperature gradients, and biological activities, such as motion and respiration. In this context, hydrogels have emerged as promising materials bridging natural and physiological energy environments. Known for their polymer networks and biocompatibility, hydrogels are widely used across bioengineering, biomedicine, and agriculture. Beyond these applications, hydrogels are also gaining attention in environmental and energy&#8208;related technologies, including solar&#8208;driven desalination, catalysis, and energy generation and storage. Their appeal lies in unique physicochemical properties, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, tunable interfacial chemistry, environmental benignity, and efficient mass and heat transfer while maintaining mechanical compatibility with hybrid or soft&#8211;hard systems. Despite these promising attributes, few reviews focus on the role of hydrogels in energy harvesting. This review addresses that gap by examining hydrogel&#8208;based technologies driven by environmental stimuli and emphasizing their unique contributions to energy conversion. It offers insights into design strategies and recent advancements in functional hydrogels, highlighting opportunities and challenges in this field. As hydrogel&#8208;based energy harvesting evolves, innovative design, deeper mechanistic understanding, and interdisciplinary integration are needed to unlock its potential.

         <title>Advances in Intelligent Nano&#8208;Micro&#8208;Scale Sensors and Actuators: Moving toward Self&#8208;Sustained Edge AI Microsystems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a system&#8208;level synthesis of advances enabling next&#8208;generation Edge&#8208;AI microsystems: transduction materials and mechanisms, hybrid photonic&#8211;MEMS platforms, rigid and stretchable devices, in/near&#8208;sensor computing, and tribo/piezo energy harvesting. Integrating photonics&#8208;enabled sensing and AI across edge and cloud will yield autonomous, human&#8208;centric systems and energy&#8208;aware AIoT, including digital&#8208;human twins and city sensing commons across healthcare, industry, and smart cities.








Abstract
Over recent decades, nano&#8208;micro&#8208;scale sensors and actuators have evolved from discrete microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) components. As demand for maintenance&#8208;free systems grew, developments emphasized integrating energy harvesting into sensing platforms and deploying self&#8208;powered sensors that utilize piezoelectric and triboelectric transducers. Such co&#8208;localization enabled self&#8208;sustained Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things (IoT) deployments, supporting continuous operation without external power and improving network autonomy and scalability. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) at the sensor edge has further transformed these platforms into intelligent AI&#8208;of&#8208;Things (AIoT) systems, enabling multimodal analytics, adaptive decision&#8208;making, and immersive human&#8211;machine interaction. Concurrently, advances in photonics&#8212;including mid&#8208;infrared, terahertz, and near&#8208;infrared technologies&#8212;have produced sensitive molecular and chemical sensors with improved selectivity and spectral resolution. These advances have also yielded photonic integrated circuits capable of ultrafast in&#8208;sensor computation and real&#8208;time Bayesian photonic neural inference, delivering sophisticated edge&#8208;AI processing with low latency and power consumption. Hybrid systems that combine flexible wearable electronics with integrated photonic platforms have emerged, allowing direct transduction and interpretation of mechanical and physiological signals from flexible sensors via photonic chips. Progress in materials, packaging, and system co&#8208;design underpins reliability and operation in harsh environments. Together, these advances foreshadow highly integrated, self&#8208;sustained edge&#8208;AI microsystems that embody perpetual, real&#8208;time intelligence and seamless user&#8211;environment interaction.

         <title>Targeted ROS Scavenging for Disease Therapies Using Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging nanomaterials, their mechanisms, classifications, and targeting strategies for disease treatment. It discusses progress, challenges, and perspectives for future clinical applications of ROS&#8208;related nanomedicines.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential by&#8208;products of cellular metabolism and serve as key mediators in cell signaling and homeostasis. Excessive ROS production is associated with cellular damage and various diseases. Therefore, targeted ROS scavenging may enhance therapeutic efficacy and minimize side effects. With significant progress in nanotechnology, various nanomaterials with targeted ROS&#8208;scavenging properties have been developed to modulate ROS levels in biological microenvironments. In this review, the mechanisms underlying ROS generation and elimination in humans and in ROS&#8208;related diseases are first outlined. The latest advancements in ROS&#8208;scavenging nanomaterials, particularly their mechanisms and composition&#8208;based classifications, are then focused on. Strategies for improving the targeting ability of ROS&#8208;scavenging nanomaterials and their application in the therapeutics of ROS&#8208;induced diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, acute kidney injury, diabetic wounds, and cancer are highlighted. Finally, the challenges faced by ROS&#8208;targeted nanotherapeutics are discussed, and possible alternatives to accelerate their clinical translation are proposed.

Their origins, mechanisms, and potential applications are discussed for RTP systems while underscoring the importance of purity analysis to avoid misinterpretations and ensure an accurate understanding of RTP mechanisms.








Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with large Stokes shifts and prolonged afterglows are gaining increasing attention in a variety of applications, including displays, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensing, and bioimaging. However, achieving high&#8208;performance organic RTP remains challenging due to weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling, rapid non&#8208;radiative decay, and unstable triplet excitons. Early studies focused on crystal engineering, as ordered lattices restrict molecular motion and stabilize triplet excitons. Analyzing crystal structures and packing provides valuable insights into intermolecular interactions, while theoretical calculations have clarified electronic structures, laying the foundation for rational RTP material design. However, recent findings suggest RTP in many single&#8208;component systems may arise from trace impurities, significantly influencing RTP properties. This discovery has greatly advanced the understanding of impurity&#8208;induced phosphorescence. This review systematically examines the role of impurities in RTP, detailing their origins from starting materials, solvents, and side reactions. It also explores how these identified impurities can serve as essential building blocks for designing new RTP materials. Finally, essential methods for evaluating compound purity, emphasizing the critical importance of rigorous analysis and validation are presented. Material purity plays a pivotal role in RTP research, as impurities can distort experimental data, potentially leading to misinterpretations that can impede advancements in understanding the underlying mechanisms.

The tunability of band gap enables wide bandgap perovskites to serve as top subcells shared by various emerging tandem technologies. Based on the application of wide bandgap perovskites in perovskite/silicon, perovskite/perovskite, perovskite/organic, and perovskite/CIGS tandem solar cells, this review outlines the theory, progress, challenges, and future path of wide bandgap perovskites.








Abstract
The global demand for clean energy is driving the need for next&#8208;generation solar technologies with higher power conversion efficiencies. Multijunction solar cells, which stack absorbers with cascaded bandgaps, offer a compelling path forward by more efficiently utilizing the solar spectrum. Among these, metal halide perovskites stand out for their bandgap tunability, enabling efficient tandem solar cells (TSCs) when paired with a range of semiconductors&#8212;including perovskite/perovskite, perovskite/silicon, perovskite/organic, and perovskite/CIGS. Central to these architectures are wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites, which harvest high&#8208;energy, short&#8208;wavelength photons. This review highlights recent advances and challenges in perovskite&#8208;based TSCs, focusing on the photophysical properties and application of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites across different tandem configurations. Future research directions are outlined aimed at enhancing performance and long&#8208;term stability to accelerate industrial deployment.

         <title>Utilize Natural Forces in Water Treatment Through 3D&#8208;Printed Structures: From Purification to Clean Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review investigates recent advances in 3D&#8208;printed functional materials and devices that utilize natural forces for water treatment, including oil/water separation, photodegradation, desalination, and photovoltaic water splitting for clean energy, with a particular focus on the unique benefits conferred by structural design. Integrated design and modular manufacturing workflow are proposed, promoting standardized production and collaborative development to accelerate design iteration.








Abstract
The utilization of natural forces for water purification has long been a pursuit of scientific and technological interest, offering the potential to reduce both energy consumption and secondary pollution associated with conventional processes. Structural materials play a pivotal role in water treatment by harnessing natural forces, such as gravity, capillarity, and solar energy, to purify water or even to generate clean energy from water, enabling structure&#8208;determined properties beyond material functionality. With their advantages in design freedom and structural customization, 3D printing techniques offer significant potential for materializing these designs into functional devices. This review investigates recent advances in 3D&#8208;printed materials and devices that utilize natural forces for water purification, including gravity&#8208;driven oil/water separation, solar&#8208;powered photodegradation, solar evaporation desalination, and photovoltaic water splitting for clean energy, with a particular focus on the benefits conferred by structural design. Harnessing the holistic design freedom and modular manufacturing capabilities afforded by 3D printing, the approach proposes an integrated water treatment system where an oil/water separator and a photodegradation module are assembled with solar evaporators to generate purified water for photovoltaic water splitting. This design aims to establish a conceptual framework that enables rapid iteration, collaborative innovation, and digital model&#8208;based standardization across the field.

         <title>Dry Transfer of CVD Graphene Film Using Adhesion Switchable Ferroelectric Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic charge doping of graphene can tailor its adhesion to the copper surface, thus enabling etchant&#8208;free dry delamination. A switchable ferroelectric P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) film first acts as a graphene transfer support layer, where polarization controls adhesion to peel graphene from copper, and subsequently releases graphene onto SiO2 substrates upon depolarization. This method yields clean graphene with low crack density and is extendable to other 2D materials.








Abstract
Although chemical vapor deposition (CVD) produces meter&#8208;scale, high&#8208;quality graphene (Gr) on copper (Cu) foils, its practical integration is hampered by challenges in the transfer process. Conventional wet transfers are slow, produce chemical waste, and lack scalability, whereas existing dry transfer methods struggle with mechanical damage and residues due to strong Gr&#8208;Cu adhesion and the difficulty in precisely tuning interfacial forces. Here, a fully dry, industrially compatible transfer platform utilizing a ferroelectric poly(vinylidene&#8208;fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) film with electrostatically switchable adhesion, serving as both a mechanical support and a transfer layer, is demonstrated. Negative Corona poling of P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) induces p&#8208;type doping in graphene. Density Functional Theory calculations confirm that this simultaneously reduces Gr&#8208;Cu adhesion while increasing P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)&#8208;Gr adhesion, enabling clean, large&#8208;scale graphene delamination from Cu foils with &gt;99% coverage. Subsequent thermal annealing above P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)&#8217;s Curie temperature (&#8776;135&#160;&#176;C) depolarizes the film, neutralizing the interfacial charge for a clean release. The versatility of this method is shown for other two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, including molybdenum disulfide and hexagonal boron nitride. Crucially, the process has been validated on cm&#8208;scale samples using a fully automated system with a transfer time of &lt;5 min, highlighting a viable path toward industrial&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;quality 2D material films.

         <title>Spatially Programmable Electroadhesive Enables In Situ Site&#8208;Selective Functional Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;activated, in situ spatially programmable bioadhesive (STICH) enables microscale, site&#8208;selective integration of bioelectronic devices with wet tissue. It achieves robust mechanical bonding and low&#8208;impedance electrical coupling, enabling reconfigurable neuromodulation and directional electromechanical sensing in vivo and ex vivo.








Abstract
Precise intraoperative integration of bioelectronic devices with wet tissue surfaces remains a challenge due to the limited spatial control of adhesion sites. Here, an in situ spatially programmable electrical bioadhesive (termed &#8220;STICH&#8221;)&#160;is reported that enables site&#8208;selective adhesion and functional coupling via light&#8208;activated bonding with wet biological tissue. Upon irradiation with patterned green light, Rose Bengal in a chitosan/silver nanowire hydrogel matrix generates singlet oxygen, which oxidizes amino acid residues into carbonyl groups on the tissue surface. The covalent bonding is then formed between the newly formed reactive carbonyl group and amine groups on chitosan. The spatially programmable adhesive allows robust tissue bonding with a lap&#8208;shear strength of 160&#160;kPa and precise adhesion regions at &#8776;2 &#181;m resolution. The light&#8208;patternable adhesive enables spatially resolved mechanical coupling for directional electromechanical sensing on ex vivo cardiac tissue. The low impedance adhesive interface also provides spatially programmed electrical coupling for in vivo neuromuscular stimulation on intraoperatively selected muscle groups. This platform advances microscale device&#8208;tissue integration and paves the way for reconfigurable bioelectronic therapies.

         <title>Self&#8208;Spiking Linear Neuromorphic Soft Pressure Sensor for Underwater Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel design of a neuromorphic pressure sensor that can generate self&#8208;spiking symmetric signals with direct event&#8208;based encoding through the integration of magnetic spheres and alternating coil circuits. The key advantages of this work include high linearity up to 200&#160;kPa (R2&#160;=&#160;0.997), self&#8208;spiking behavior for simplified signal processing, and robust underwater stability.








Abstract
Many aquatic vertebrates rely on neuromasts in their lateral line system to detect water vibrations and pressure gradients. These neuromasts contain specialized hair cells that function as mechanoreceptors, converting mechanical stimuli into electric signals for brain processing. While neuromorphic sensors can emulate biologic sensory systems, they are facing significant challenges in underwater stability and complex data processing. Here, a bioinspired neuromorphic soft pressure sensor designed for stable underwater performance and simplified signal processing is proposed. This is achieved through a novel integration of micro&#8208;magnetic spheres, a microfluidic channel, and alternating coil connections. This sensor exhibits self&#8208;spiking behavior upon applied force with high linearity (R2&#160;=&#160;0.997) in response to pressure changes up to 200&#160;kPa. The proposed mechanism generates distinct magnetic action potentials via its alternating coil design, enabling efficient signal processing. This artificial neuromast achieves 92.19% accuracy in game control applications and 94.71% accuracy in underwater object recognition using machine learning. Additionally, the sensor was validated in both experimental ocean basins and open&#8208;sea environments, confirming its potential for underwater robotics, ocean environmental monitoring, and marine industrial applications.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Coordinated Trienzyme Nanogel Cascade Therapy for Accelerated Post&#8208;Pancreatectomy Cutaneous Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc&#8208;coordinated nanogel assembly is reported that co&#8208;delivers three enzymes to regulate glucose, oxidative stress, and oxygen levels. This system mimics natural enzyme cascades to reprogram the wound environment after pancreatectomy. In a post&#8208;pancreatectomy mouse model, it accelerates healing by reducing infection, promoting blood vessel growth, and supporting tissue regeneration. The design offers a modular strategy for post&#8208;surgical therapy.








Abstract
Orchestration of enzyme cascades in synthetic systems remains a major challenge for catalytic control in complex biological environments. Here, a zinc&#8208;coordinated tri&#8208;enzyme nanogel system (Zn@nGSC) is reported that mimics natural enzymatic assemblies by confining individual glucose oxidase (GOX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) within an imidazole&#8208;functionalized polymeric nanogel matrix. The nanogel is fabricated via mild in situ polymerization combined with Zn2&#8314;&#8208;imidazole coordination, yielding structurally stable multi&#8208;enzyme assemblies. The engineered assemblies demonstrate simultaneous preservation of enzymatic activity and enhanced cascade efficiency under thermal and proteolytic stress. Cascade reactions proceed as follows: i) glucose is depleted by GOX, ii) superoxide radicals are scavenged by SOD to alleviate oxidative stress, and iii) residual H2O2 is converted into oxygen by CAT in order to mitigate hypoxia. Functionally, Zn@nGSC restores redox balance and metabolic homeostasis, demonstrated in a murine model of post&#8208;pancreatectomy wound healing, with emphasis on treating hyperglycemia and improving regeneration. Another pronounced advantage of Zn@nGSC treatment is its antibacterial effect, which enhances angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and immune modulation. Overall, this modular nanoplatform provides a blueprint for designing robust, bioresponsive cascade systems with therapeutic potential in metabolically compromised microenvironments.

         <title>Reconfigurable Magnetotransport in MnBi2Te4 via Gate and Magnetic Field Tuning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gate&#8208;tunable magnetoresistance sign reversal under in&#8208;plane magnetic fields is observed in an ultrathin MnBi2Te4 device, arising from spin reorientation and distinct scattering mechanisms. Moreover, angular&#8208;dependent measurements reveal clear gate&#8208;controlled magnetotransport anisotropy, underscoring the strong coupling between gating, spin configuration, and transport behavior in MnBi2Te4.








Abstract
The intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 is a promising platform for exploring quantum phases with nontrivial band topology and for enabling electrical control over coupled magnetic and electronic phase transitions. In&#8208;plane magnetic fields, in particular, offer a distinct means of tuning these properties by strengthening quantized Hall effects, enhancing surface energy gaps, and driving spin reorientation transitions. However, a systematic understanding of how such fields affect magnetotransport is limited. Here, the magnetotransport behavior of few&#8208;layer MnBi2Te4 as a function of gate voltage, temperature, and magnetic field angle, with a primary focus on in&#8208;plane field effects, are investigated. A gate&#8208;tunable crossover in magnetoresistance is observed from positive to negative values under in&#8208;plane magnetic fields as the gate voltage is swept below the charge neutrality point at temperatures below the N&#233;el temperature. The in&#8208;plane field drives a transition from the antiferromagnetic ground state to a ferromagnetic configuration with spins aligned in&#8208;plane, while simultaneously altering the electronic structure, as revealed by gate&#8208;dependent transport features. The angle&#8208;dependent measurements reveal strongly gate&#8208;tunable magnetotransport anisotropy. These results establish in&#8208;plane magnetic fields as an effective tuning parameter for modulating spin and charge transport in MnBi2Te4, advancing prospects for reconfigurable spintronic and topological devices.

         <dc:description>
The unsatisfactory outdoor performance and potential contamination of recovered products limit the wider practical deployment of interfacial solar evaporators. In response, we develop a Rhus chinensis &#8208; inspired vertical hierarchical structure (RVHS) to achieve all &#8208; weather extraction of fresh water, clean salt, and authigenic electricity.








Abstract
The escalating challenges in water, energy, and environmental sustainability necessitate the efficient utilization of diverse water sources, such as seawater and wastewater. Herein, a Rhus chinensis &#8208;inspired vertical hierarchical structure (RVHS) is developed to achieve all &#8208; weather extraction of fresh water, clean salt, and authigenic electricity. The RVHS achieves high water production rates of 5.07&#160;kg m&#8722;2 during the day and 2.04&#160;kg m&#8722;2 at night, approximately 1.2 times and 1.8 times those of conventional ones, respectively, by strategically&#160;manipulating phase change material (PCM) and heat storage. Simultaneously, it enables an enhanced salt recovery of 2.24&#160;kg m&#8722;2, yielding purified salt free from detectable contaminants (such as microplastics and persistent organic pollutants), facilitated by a pollutant capture trap integrated into the RVHS, a feature rarely explored in prior research. Furthermore, during salt recovery, the optimized salt concentration gradient can be further utilized for energy harvesting with high power output through thermodynamic optimization, which is approximately 60% greater than traditional devices. Further performance improvements can be realized by optimizing thermodynamic structures or integrating higher &#8208; performance materials. In conclusion, this work offers a universal routine for solar &#8208; driven resource recovery from seawater.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photonic ReFET array with an engineered HZO&#8211;HSO superlattice enables monolithic integration of optical sensing, nonvolatile memory, and synaptic computation. It exhibits forming&#8208;free, &gt;8&#8208;bit analog states, &gt;1010 endurance cycles, and light&#8208;tunable conductance. Integrated into a 20&#160;&#215;&#160;20 array, it achieves 94.45% accuracy on Fashion&#8208;MNIST in an in&#8208;sensor vision transformer.








Abstract
Neuromorphic vision systems require artificial synapses that integrate sensing, memory, and computation with high precision and stability. Conventional memristors face limitations including forming requirements, few multilevel states, low endurance, and poor integration density, while ferroelectric and flash&#8208;based transistors suffer trade&#8208;offs among endurance, retention, and switching ratio, and generally lack intrinsic photonic sensitivity, constraining in&#8208;sensor computing. Here, a photonic resistive&#8208;gate field&#8208;effect transistor (ReFET) array is presented that combines optical sensing, forming&#8208;free multilevel memory, and analog computation in a single device. The ReFET employs a Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/Hf0.95Sr0.05O2 (HZO/HSO) superlattice gate and an amorphous InGaZnO (IGZO) channel, achieving 272 stable conductance states (&gt;8&#8208;bit) in a 20&#160;&#215;&#160;20 array, ON/OFF ratios &gt;10&#8310;, endurance &gt;1010 cycles, and retention &gt;10&#8310;&#160;s. The array functions as an in&#8208;sensor optical convolutional layer, performing multiply&#8211;accumulate (MAC) operations with 94.45% accuracy on Fashion&#8208;MNIST using 8&#8208;bit quantized weights, while delivering high energy efficiency. This platform enables scalable, high&#8208;precision, energy&#8208;efficient photonic neuromorphic computing, integrating sensing, memory, and computation in one architecture.

         <title>3D Photonic Metacrystals with Enhanced Collective Mie Resonances for Dual Structural Coloration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents high&#8208;quality 3D CdS metacrystals with long&#8208;range order that suppress radiation losses, yielding 13&#8208;fold enhanced magnetic Mie resonances (Q = 17) and dual nonfading structural coloration. &#160; Wafer&#8208;scale inkjet printing using metafluid inks of CdS and ZnS nanoparticles demonstrates stable coloration and angle&#8208;sensitive hues F.








Abstract
3D photonic crystals offer nonfading structural coloration and complex optical properties through coupled Mie resonances in high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index materials. Although strong magnetic resonances make them promising, they often suffer from optical losses in the visible spectrum. Enhancing Mie resonances and quality factors through collective coupling in lithographically ordered arrays has been demonstrated. However, large&#8208;area applications using self&#8208;assembled colloidal resonators in metafluid inks have been limited by&#160;inadequate monodispersity and insufficient surface charge, hindering effective ordering. Here, we report high&#8208;quality 3D Mie&#8208;resonant metacrystals formed by high&#8208;temperature self&#8208;assembly of CdS nanoparticles (refractive index 2.5). Their long&#8208;range ordering attenuates local density of states overlapping with Mie resonances, minimizing external radiation losses and yielding&#160;one order of magnitude enhancement in collective Mie behavior. A 13&#8208;fold enhancement in magnetic Mie resonances with quality factors reaching 17 is experimentally demonstrated. The structures produce Bragg peaks that coexist with enhanced collective Mie resonances, enabling angle&#8208;dependent, dual nonfading structural coloration across the visible and near&#8208;infrared spectrum. As a proof of concept, wafer&#8208;scale inkjet printing using metafluid inks of CdS and ZnS nanoparticles demonstrates stable coloration and angle&#8208;sensitive hues. This work opens new avenues in durable structural coloration and multifunctional optical platforms for applications such as ultrasensitive polarimetry and advanced optical sensing.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Resorbable Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;resorbable magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is presented that combine on&#8208;demand data erasure, transient functionality, and biocompatibility, making them suitable for secure, short&#8208;lived electronics. Through dissolution studies under physiological conditions, this is demonstrated that MTJ functionality can be removed within 10 h. Moreover, the bio&#8208;resorbable lifetime can be tuned by selecting appropriate materials and adjusting the layer thickness of individual layers.








Abstract
Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) play a crucial role in spintronic applications, particularly data storage and sensors. Especially as a non&#8208;volatile memory, MTJs has received substantial attention due to its CMOS compatibility, low power consumption, fast switching speed, and high endurance. In parallel, bio&#8208;resorbable electronics have emerged as a promising solution for systems requiring temporary operation and secure data disposal, especially in military, intelligence, and biomedical systems where devices must safely disintegrate under physiological conditions. In this study, the bio&#8208;resorbability of MTJ is investigated by analyzing the dissolution behavior of its nanometer&#8208;thick constituent layers in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline solution at pH 7.4, simulating physiological environments. The MTJ structures, composed of bio&#8208;resorbable materials, exhibit well&#8208;controlled degradation behaviors. Critically, as one of the ferromagnetic layers dissolves, binary information is irreversibly lost, within 10 h of immersion. These findings highlight the potential of MTJs not only as high&#8208;performance memory elements but also as secure, transient data storage platforms. The ability to modify the dissolution lifetime by materials and thickness selection offers unique advantages for short&#8208;lived implantable devices, paving the way for integrating spintronic functionality into next&#8208;generation bioresorbable electronics.

         <title>Ce Single Atom&#8208;Engineered Amorphous/Crystalline Nanosheets for Enhanced Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We leveraged Ce single&#8208;atom engineering to generate short&#8208;range ordered crystalline nanodomains in amorphous RuOx for creating amorphous/crystalline nanojunctions, in an effort to regulate the water dissociation kinetics for enhanced HER. Specifically, the Ce&#8208;doped crystalline nanodomains greatly reduce the energy barrier to water dissociation and possess optimal free energy for H* adsorption, which collectively contributes to the enhanced HER performance.








Abstract
Designing nanocatalysts with fast water dissociation kinetics is key to achieving the industrial current density of the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for green hydrogen production via water electrolysis, which remains a grand challenge. Here, leverage single&#8208;atom engineering,a Ce single&#8208;atom&#8208;doped amorphous RuOx nanosheet featuring abundant amorphous/crystalline nanojunctions, namely, ac&#8208;CeSARuOx is successfully developed. When employed as a catalyst for alkaline HER, the ac&#8208;CeSARuOx catalyst displays an overpotential of only 8.3 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope as low as 23.1&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, outperforming the Ru&#8208;based catalysts reported in recent studies. Anion exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) tests using ac&#8208;CeSARuOx as the cathode catalyst exhibit a low cell voltage of 1.71 V at 1000 mA cm&#8722;2, and the performance can be well maintained after 300 h. In situ spectroscopic analyses demonstrate the increased coverage of OH species on ac&#8208;CeSARuOx for enhanced water dissociation. Density function theory calculations suggest that the Ce&#8208;doped crystalline nanodomains in the amorphous/nanocrystalline nanojunction could effectively reduce the energy barrier to water dissociation, while the Ce&#8208;doped amorphous constituents regulate the H* adsorption, which collectively boost the HER performance. This work offers a new strategy to create amorphous/nanocrystalline nanojunctions in nanocatalysts for enhanced electrocatalysis.

The present study systematically identifies and develops an electron&#8208;acceptor aluminum chloride pre&#8208;intercalation graphite. The pre&#8208;intercalated graphite builds C&#9472;Cl&#9472;Al&#9472;C electron&#8208;acceptor bridges within the graphite interlayers, which facilitate charge transfer kinetics during lithium&#8208;ion diffusion and storage, thereby enabling fast&#8208;charging performance in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Sluggish solid&#8208;state diffusion kinetics of lithium ions is among the primary bottlenecks limiting the fast&#8208;charging performance of graphite anodes. Pre&#8208;intercalating molecules in graphite interlayers can tune the valence &#960;&#8208;electrons, but there are few systematic studies in designing such structures by electron coupling to optimize the charge transfer kinetics. Herein, deliberately guided by simulations, the present study identifies and develops a class of electron&#8208;acceptor aluminum chloride species for intercalation into graphite (AC&#8208;G), aiming to accelerate lithium ions charge transfer to the intercalated graphite through the formation of electron&#8208;acceptor bridges within the graphite interlayers. Consequently, the AC&#8208;G achieves a two&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement in lithium ions diffusion coefficient (5.85 &#215; 10&#8722;7 cm2 s&#8722;1) compared to that in pristine graphite. It delivers stable cycling over 2000 cycles with a high areal capacity retention of 3.84 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 1C and maintains 500&#8208;cycle stability at 5C. Furthermore, an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell assembled with AC&#8208;G and cathode achieves an energy density of 285&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 3C. The present work provides a new design strategy for graphite by introducing interlayer electron&#8208;bridging structures, offering valuable insights for next&#8208;generation fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries

         <title>De&#8208;Saturation of Single&#8208;Atom Copper Catalysts for Accelerating Propargylic Substitution Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
De&#8208;saturation of copper&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (De&#8208;sat SACs) are realized by a KOH&#8208;mediated Joule thermal shock strategy. Benefiting from the under&#8208;saturation coordination environment of single&#8208;atom Cu center, De&#8208;sat Cu SACs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity in propargylic substitution reactions, tolerating a broad range of nucleophiles (N&#8211;, C&#8211;, and O&#8211;), as well as diverse aryl, alkyl, tertiary, and cyclic propargylic carbonates.








Abstract
Rational design of proximal coordination microenvironments surrounding catalytic sites to achieve optimal reaction kinetics represents a paramount pursuit in single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), yet continues to pose substantial synthetic challenges. Developing innovative strategies that simultaneously stabilize low&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;metal species on solid supports, while ensuring atomic precision and high activity, remains imperative. Herein, a de&#8208;saturation strategy for SACs is demonstrated (denoted as De&#8208;sat SACs) using a top&#8208;down approach based on a KOH&#8208;mediated Joule thermal shock to obtain under&#8208;coordinated and asymmetric SACs for efficient organic synthesis. Using copper&#8208;based SACs as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the de&#8208;saturation strategy effectively converts the CuN4 to CuN3 configuration. The De&#8208;sat Cu SACs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity in propargylic substitution reactions, tolerating a broad range of nucleophiles (N&#8211;, C&#8211;, and O&#8211;), as well as diverse aryl, alkyl, tertiary, and cyclic propargylic carbonates. The coordination reduction in these De&#8208;sat SACs not only breaks the structural symmetry to enhance site accessibility but also elevates the energy of the dz2${d}_{{z}^{2}}$ orbital of Cu atom, thereby facilitating the formation of copper&#8211;alkynyl intermediates and boosting their catalytic performance. These findings establish a new platform for the rational design and synthesis of de&#8208;saturated yet stable SACs, facilitating challenging catalytic transformations toward sustainable chemical manufacturing.

         <title>Surface Energy&#8208;Confined Multi&#8208;Layer Inkjet Printing for Customizable Optical Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface energy&#8208;confined multi&#8208;layer inkjet printing strategy is developed for customizable fabrication of 3D optical microstructures. By combining interfacial energy confinement with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer processing, various 3D curved optical microstructures with tailorable morphology, material composition, and spatial configuration are precisely fabricated and integrated, offering great promise for applications in miniaturized optical systems, multi&#8208;dimensional imaging, and high&#8208;security encryption.








Abstract
Inkjet printing emerges as a versatile on&#8208;demand patterning technique for additive manufacturing of optical microstructures, yet its ability to regulate the ink droplet morphology is constrained by the intrinsic interplay between ink&#8208;substrate wetting conditions, thereby hindering the customizable fabrication of 3D microstructures. Here, a surface energy&#8208;confined multi&#8208;layer inkjet printing strategy is developed for precisely fabricating curved optical microstructures with tunable size, solid angle, and configuration. The strategy is implemented through custom&#8208;engineered layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer printing on a pre&#8208;patterned substrate with spatially defined interfacial energy barriers, enabling the precise construction and integration of distinct optical microdomes (characterized by substrate attachment and uniform curved profiles) at the microscale. Notably, the strategy facilitates the high&#8208;throughput printing of diverse topological microdomes, ranging from triangular to hexagonal architectures. The as&#8208;fabricated microdomes, featuring precisely engineered morphology and sub&#8208;nanometer surface roughness, exhibit integrated light&#8208;field manipulation capabilities and unique multifocal characteristics, highlighting their potential for miniaturized optical systems and intelligent imaging devices. Beyond UV&#8208;cured polymers, this methodology is extendable to nanomaterial&#8208;based micro&#8208;3D printing (e.g., colloidal photonic crystal microdomes), opening avenues for more sophisticated optical functionalities. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a non&#8208;imaging multidimensional encryption platform is printed leveraging 3D morphology&#8208;tailored optical readout.

The emerging galvanic&#8208;cell&#8208;based self&#8208;powered bioelectronics for biomedical applications with passive and active control strategies are summarized. In addition, the challenges and opportunities for galvanic devices are also discussed.








Abstract
Bioelectronic devices hold significant promise for advancing biomedical technologies, addressing critical healthcare challenges, and improving the quality of human life. Conventional bioelectronic devices are typically powered by external, bulky batteries connected by extended electrical wires, which limit the compactness and miniaturization of bioelectronics, restrict patient mobility, and increase the risk of complications such as infections and device&#8208;related failures. This perspective discusses the emerging concept of galvanic&#8208;cell&#8208;based self&#8208;powered bioelectronic devices, in which galvanic electrodes serve directly as the tissue&#8208;contacting interfaces. We provide an overview of the principles and working mechanisms of biocompatible galvanic cells in galvanic devices for diverse biomedical applications, including electrical modulation, chemical and biochemical modulation, and hybrid electrical/(bio)chemical modulation, along with their control strategies: passive control and active control. Furthermore, we envision that the advancement of galvanic devices will represent a promising direction for biomedical applications, despite the presence of inherent challenges.

         <title>Materials Design and Assessment of Redox&#8208;Mediated Flow Cell Systems for Enhanced Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;mediated flow cells, which operate on an electrochemical&#8208;chemical cycle, shift desired reactions from electrode compartments to dedicated reactors and enable diversified applications for high&#8208;density flow batteries, fuel cells, CO2 capture, electrosynthesis, waste recycling, etc. This perspective outlines the material selection criteria, evaluation methods, and targeted design strategies toward next&#8208;generation applications.








Abstract
The transition toward sustainable energy systems necessitates innovations that overcome the limitations of conventional electrochemical systems. Redox&#8208;mediated flow cell systems emerge as a transformative paradigm by decoupling energy storage, conversion, and chemical processes from traditional electrode&#8208;bound reactions. These systems employ soluble redox mediators to shuttle electrons between electrodes and spatially separated reactive phases (solid, liquid, or gas), thereby enabling unprecedented operational flexibility and scalability. This standpoint underscores the adaptability of redox&#8208;mediated electrified systems across a range of applications, encompassing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density redox targeting&#8208;based flow batteries, fuel cells, electrified CO2 capture, sustainable chemical synthesis, waste recycling, etc. The rational design of redox&#8208;active materials is central to their success, with precise alignment of redox potentials, enhanced electron&#8208;transfer kinetics, and robust stability underpinning performance. The challenges of new materials development, system durability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness can be addressed through advances in experimental measurement, computational modeling, operando characterization, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Moving forward, the integration of redox&#8208;mediated technologies with renewable energy systems and industrial processes is predicted to transform energy and chemical landscapes. The integration of laboratory innovations with real&#8208;world deployment facilitates a pathway to decarbonization, resource efficiency, and the circular economy. This perspective emphasizes the pivotal functions of redox&#8208;mediated architectures in fostering a robust, electrified future, where the convergence of energy storage, environmental stewardship, and sustainable chemical production is pivotal in addressing global challenges.

     alt="Materials Design and Assessment of Redox-Mediated Flow Cell Systems for Enhanced Energy Storage and Conversion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redox-mediated flow cells, which operate on an electrochemical-chemical cycle, shift desired reactions from electrode compartments to dedicated reactors and enable diversified applications for high-density flow batteries, fuel cells, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture, electrosynthesis, waste recycling, etc. This perspective outlines the material selection criteria, evaluation methods, and targeted design strategies toward next-generation applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition toward sustainable energy systems necessitates innovations that overcome the limitations of conventional electrochemical systems. Redox-mediated flow cell systems emerge as a transformative paradigm by decoupling energy storage, conversion, and chemical processes from traditional electrode-bound reactions. These systems employ soluble redox mediators to shuttle electrons between electrodes and spatially separated reactive phases (solid, liquid, or gas), thereby enabling unprecedented operational flexibility and scalability. This standpoint underscores the adaptability of redox-mediated electrified systems across a range of applications, encompassing high-energy-density redox targeting-based flow batteries, fuel cells, electrified CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture, sustainable chemical synthesis, waste recycling, etc. The rational design of redox-active materials is central to their success, with precise alignment of redox potentials, enhanced electron-transfer kinetics, and robust stability underpinning performance. The challenges of new materials development, system durability, and cost-effectiveness can be addressed through advances in experimental measurement, computational modeling, operando characterization, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Moving forward, the integration of redox-mediated technologies with renewable energy systems and industrial processes is predicted to transform energy and chemical landscapes. The integration of laboratory innovations with real-world deployment facilitates a pathway to decarbonization, resource efficiency, and the circular economy. This perspective emphasizes the pivotal functions of redox-mediated architectures in fostering a robust, electrified future, where the convergence of energy storage, environmental stewardship, and sustainable chemical production is pivotal in addressing global challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Surface Engineering of Metal Nanoclusters: Ligand Programming for Functionality Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand programming offers a precise strategy to tune metal nanocluster surfaces at the atomic level. By controlling metal&#8208;ligand coordination, intra/inter&#8208;ligand interactions, and interfacial chemistry, this approach enables customizable structures with enhanced catalytic, optical, and biomedical functions. This work highlights how precise surface engineering transforms metal nanoclusters into smart platforms for next&#8208;generation materials.








Abstract
Precise surface engineering of metal nanoclusters (MNCs) has emerged as a powerful strategy for tailoring their structural, electronic, and catalytic properties. On the basis of traditional surface chemistry, ligand programming enables atomic&#8208;level control over MNC functionality by modulating metal&#8208;ligand coordination, intra/inter&#8208;ligand interactions, and interfacial chemistry. These three layers within the &#8220;Engineering Zone&#8221; define structural flexibility, charge transfer pathways, molecular rigidity, and surface accessibility, key factors in optimizing catalytic activity, luminescence efficiency, and molecular recognition. This Perspective explores the chemistry governing ligand&#8208;directed MNC behavior in the three layers, highlighting its role in catalysis, photonics, and biomedicine. By integrating coordination chemistry, intra/inter&#8208;ligand design, and interfacial interactions, how ligand programming transforms MNCs is demonstrated into tunable platforms for next&#8208;generation functional materials. Insights from MNCs also provide a model for advancing surface engineering in broader nanomaterials, paving the way for innovative applications in materials science.

         <title>Engineering Glucose&#8208;Responsive Insulin Granules with High&#8208;Payload for Long&#8208;Acting Glycemic Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights the significant potential of high&#8208;payload, physiologically responsive delivery systems in diabetes management, which also offers a promising strategy for developing intelligent for protein&#8208;based therapeutics, advancing more precise, safe, and patient&#8208;compliant treatments.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;payload systems that dynamically respond to physiological fluctuations is crucial not only for improving the precision, safety, and efficacy of protein therapies but also for addressing biosafety concerns associated with carriers, reducing administration frequency, minimizing infection risks, and enhancing patient compliance. However, achieving precise control over protein release in the high&#8208;payload carriers remain a major challenge. In this study, a physiology&#8208;responsive, high&#8208;payload insulin (Ins) granule is engineered for long&#8208;term glucose management, using Ins as a model&#8212;an essential hormone that must be released in response to blood glucose changes for effective glycemic control in diabetic patients. The [(Ins&amp;GOx)@Zn]@[TA&amp;Fe] granules achieve an Ins loading capacity (LC%) exceeding 80%, significantly higher than the previously reported maximum of &#8776;40%. These granules extend the glucose&#8208;regulating effect of free Ins, typically limited to 3&#160;h, to 6&#160;days with a single injection, without any observed risk of hypoglycemia. Long&#8208;term administration (28&#160;days, 4 injection cycles, 7&#160;days&#160;injection&#8722;1) shows no significant physiological toxicity or immune response. This approach offers a promising strategy for developing intelligent, high&#8208;payload delivery systems for protein&#8208;based therapeutics, advancing more precise, safe, and patient&#8208;compliant treatments.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reviews the research progress of vacancies in electrocatalysis in recent years. It introduces the detection techniques and synthesis strategies of vacancies, discusses the catalytic functions of vacancies in typical electrocatalytic reactions and their internal regulatory mechanisms, elaborates on the structure&#8208;activity relationship between vacancies and catalytic performance, and provides theoretical support for the rational design of vacancy engineering.








Abstract
Driven by the &#8220;dual carbon&#8221; strategic goals, electrocatalytic reactions have increasingly become a research frontier in the fields of energy and materials science due to their crucial role in the conversion of clean energy and environmental governance. Vacancy engineering has great potential in enhancing catalytic activity and selectivity. Systematically and deeply revealing the mechanism of vacancies in the electrocatalytic process has important value for achieving precise structural regulation and performance optimization of electrocatalysts. This work systematically reviews the research progress of vacancy modification electrocatalysts in recent years. The detection technology of vacancies is introduced, the synthetic strategies for vacancy construction are summarized, the catalytic functions of vacancies in various typical electrocatalytic reactions and their internal regulatory mechanisms are mainly discussed, and the regulatory effect of vacancies on the adsorption behavior of intermediates is analyzed. The structure&#8211;function relationship laws of factors such as vacancy type, concentration, and spatial distribution on catalytic performance are further summarized, providing theoretical support for the rational design of vacancy engineering. Finally, the future development direction of vacancy engineering is prospected, with the expectation of providing a theoretical basis and research ideas for constructing new electrocatalytic materials that are efficient, stable, and applicable on a large scale.

         <title>Optical Tuning of Non&#8208;Equilibrium Surface Plasmon Resonances in a Narrow&#8208;Gap Semiconductor Nanocavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast all&#8208;optical tuning of non&#8208;equilibrium plasmonic Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot resonances is accomplished in single&#8208;crystalline InSb nanosheets. By exciting multi&#8208;valence band transitions, a high plasmon frequency ceiling of 1435&#160;cm&#8722;1 and sub&#8208;6 ps optical switching are achieved, enabling compact 2&#960; phase control. These findings highlight the potential of narrow&#8208;gap semiconductors for high&#8208;speed, programmable mid&#8208;infrared photonics.








Abstract
In photonics, the polaritonic nanocavity (PC) within the mid&#8208;infrared to terahertz region is pivotal in on&#8208;chip applications, spanning diverse domains such as bio&#8208;sensing and beyond&#8208;5G information processing. Nevertheless, the impediment posed by lattice vibrations' electrical neutrality restricts phononic PCs' active tuning through electro&#8208;optical methodologies. In response to this constraint, the potential of narrow&#8208;gap semiconductors is investigated, which is characterized by highly efficient optical carrier incubation capabilities to facilitate all&#8208;optical plasmonic PC tuning. Leveraging ultrafast nanoscopy, the temporal evolution of non&#8208;equilibrium plasmonic cavity modes is meticulously scrutinized in InSb nanosheets. These findings unveil that multi&#8208;valence band transitions engender substantial free carriers, culminating in optically tunable non&#8208;equilibrium plasmonic cavity modes with a rapid switching capability of less than 6&#160;ps, affording facile 2&#960; plasmonic phase control. This study substantiates the prospect that conventional III&#8211;V semiconductors offer a robust platform for tunable transient surface plasmon resonances, thereby paving the way for innovative integrated optical applications seamlessly adapting to established semiconductor technologies.

         <title>Reprogrammable Dual&#8208;Regulated Pollen Actuators for Geometric Encoding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging abundant natural pollen materials, a novel sustainable bilayer actuator demonstrating dual&#8208;layer modulation and complete re&#8208;programmability for controlled complex deformation is presented. The toner pattern defines deformation direction, while the pollen layer adjusts humidity responsiveness via pH. Along with complete reprogramming effectively encodes information through complex geometries as responsive smart devices.








Abstract
Bilayer actuators capable of autonomously responding to complex environmental stimuli have attracted increasing interest for their potential in intelligent and multifunctional systems. Yet, achieving simultaneous programming and reprogramming of shape transformations in both active and passive layers through scalable, sustainable methods remains a significant challenge. Here, a novel bilayer actuator derived from naturally abundant pollen is reported, offering unprecedented dual&#8208;layer re&#8208;programmability.

&lt;p&gt;Leveraging abundant natural pollen materials, a novel sustainable bilayer actuator demonstrating dual-layer modulation and complete re-programmability for controlled complex deformation is presented. The toner pattern defines deformation direction, while the pollen layer adjusts humidity responsiveness via pH. Along with complete reprogramming effectively encodes information through complex geometries as responsive smart devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bilayer actuators capable of autonomously responding to complex environmental stimuli have attracted increasing interest for their potential in intelligent and multifunctional systems. Yet, achieving simultaneous programming and reprogramming of shape transformations in both active and passive layers through scalable, sustainable methods remains a significant challenge. Here, a novel bilayer actuator derived from naturally abundant pollen is reported, offering unprecedented dual-layer re-programmability. The passive layer, composed of digitally patterned toner, dictates the deformation direction, with the folding angles ranging from 0&#176; to &#8776;152&#176;. Meanwhile, the active pollen layer exhibits tunable humidity responsiveness modulated by pH, controlling actuation curvature ranging from 0.036 to 0.28&#160;cm&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and response speed ranging from 1.04 to 0.15&#176;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Notably, the entire bilayer system can be fully disassembled via a mild, one-pot alkaline process, enabling more than 10 cycles of complete reprogramming without structural degradation. This dual-regulated architecture supports complex 3D geometric transformations and is demonstrated as a carrier of confidential information, encoding data through morphing analogs of encrypted binary code. By integrating programmable mechanics, renewable biomaterials, and energy-efficient reusability, this work establishes an eco-friendly and versatile platform for next-generation responsive materials and encrypted smart devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionotronics&#8208;Enabled Emerging Halide Perovskite Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskites, with outstanding optoelectronic properties and structural tunability, hold great promise for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic technologies. This review explores their ionotronic mechanisms, revealing how they enable high photosensitivity, tunable conductivity, and efficient luminescence. It also highlights advances in related optoelectronic devices and discusses prospects/challenges in the ionotronic&#8208;driven perovskite optoelectronics.








Abstract
With the rise of technologies such as artificial vision, smart wearables, and interactive displays, the demand for high&#8208;performance, intelligent, and portable optoelectronic devices has increased significantly. However, conventional silicon&#8208;based optoelectronic devices face limitations in perceiving, processing, and feeding back optoelectrical information, making them unable to meet increasing demanding performance requirements. Conversely, halide perovskites, characterized by excellent optoelectronic properties and high structural tunability, show great potential for advanced next&#8208;generation optoelectronic applications. Recent studies have revealed diverse ionic and electronic behaviors that are crucial for achieving essential physical properties in the design of emerging optoelectronic devices. This review discusses the ionotronic mechanisms of halide perovskites and elucidates how these mechanisms enable high photosensitivity, tunable conductivity, and efficient luminescence. Recent developments in emerging photodetectors, neuromorphic processors, and full&#8208;color displays are discussed for intelligent applications. Additionally, the prospects and challenges of ionotronics&#8208;driven halide perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices are evaluated.

         <title>Scalable Solar Evaporator Based on Bandgap Engineered CuMnCrO4 Spinel Oxide with Salt&#8208;Resistant Property for Contaminated Seawater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating multiple cations (Cu2&#8314; and Cr3&#8314;) into the Mn3O4 spinel lattice strategically tunes the electronic structure, narrowing the bandgap from 2.3 to 1.49&#160;eV. This enhances visible&#8211;NIR light absorption and photothermal conversion, enabling a high water evaporation rate of 4.1&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 under 1 sun. Beyond optical benefits, the multi&#8208;cation framework stabilizes the crystal structure, improves chemical resilience, and promotes uniform heat generation, enabling high, sustained solar evaporation rates over three weeks.








Abstract
Freshwater scarcity demands innovative solutions that combine efficiency, durability, and scalability. Here, CuMnCrO4 (CMCO), is presented as a ternary spinel oxide photothermal absorber introduced for the first time in solar desalination, synthesized via co&#8208;substitution of Mn3O4 with Cu and Cr. This multi&#8208;cation design narrows the bandgap from 2.3 to&#160;1.49 eV, markedly enhancing solar absorption across the visible and near&#8208;infrared spectrum and enabling efficient light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion. Unlike conventional carbon or single&#8208;oxide&#8208;based systems, CMCO demonstrates&#160;record&#8208;high evaporation performance of 4.1 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under 1&#8208;sun, positioning it among the most efficient oxide&#8208;based ISSG materials reported to date. Equally novel is the&#160;integration of CMCO with a cotton fabric substrate and hydrophobic polyester strips in an inverted U&#8208;shaped configuration, which ensures continuous water wicking, localized salt separation, and mechanical robustness. This architecture delivers&#160;stable operation over three weeks without salt accumulation, overcoming a long&#8208;standing challenge in ISSG. Furthermore, the system retains high efficiency under strongly acidic/alkaline conditions and in oil&#8208; or dye&#8208;contaminated water, demonstrating unique resilience rarely reported in solar desalination systems. Finally, the modular design enables straightforward scalability from laboratory&#8208;scale strips to large&#8208;area panels. Together, these advances establish CMCO&#8208;based systems as a&#160;new materials platform for practical, durable, and scalable solar desalination, offering a sustainable pathway toward addressing global water scarcity.

         <title>Biomimetic Mineralized Hydrogels for Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic mineralized hydrogels, engineered to recapitulate the structural and compositional cues of native bone, have emerged as a leading candidate for bone regeneration. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in their design, focusing on innovative homogeneous and heterogeneous mineralization mechanisms. Moreover, their therapeutic applications are examined, and the discussion concludes with prevailing challenges and future directions for clinical translation.








Abstract
Bone mineralization is a tightly regulated process involving the deposition of hydroxyapatite and other calcium salt crystals within the collagen&#8208;rich extracellular matrix of bone tissue, which confers hierarchical architecture and exceptional biomechanical properties to bone through this organized biocrystal arrangement. Inspired by this natural process, biomimetic mineralized hydrogels, engineered to mimic the chemical composition, structural organization, mechanical strength, and osteoinductive capabilities of bone tissue, have garnered considerable attention as promising candidates for bone regeneration. This review systematically summarizes recent progress in the design and application of biomimetic mineralized hydrogels for bone regeneration. Following an overview of natural biomineralization principles, innovative strategies for constructing&#160;heterogeneous and homogeneous biomimetic mineralized hydrogels are first highlighted, emphasizing their structural and functional mimicry. Subsequently, their therapeutic applications are critically examined, including bone defect repair, osteochondral regeneration, osteoporotic bone repair, and other bone&#8208;related diseases (e.g., osteosarcoma, tendon&#8208;bone interface injury). Finally, persistent challenges are identified, and future research directions are proposed to advance these hydrogel systems toward clinical translation in bone tissue engineering.

         <title>Phase Engineering of Nanogold: Non&#8208;Close Packed Square Planes in A&#8242;B&#8242; Stacking with a 0.5 &#197; Channel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold is well known to adopt the face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) structure. This work presents an unusual non&#8208;close&#8208;packed phase attained in a 40&#8208;atom gold nanocluster, which is in contrast with the close&#8208;packed fcc quasi&#8208;isomer. The non&#8208;compact structure exhibits exclusive square planes in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking, hence, possessing a unique 0.5 &#197; channel. Its photoexcited state lifetime is nearly two orders of magnitude shorter than that of the fcc isomer.








Abstract
Crystal phase engineering of inorganic materials is one of the most important strategies for achieving new material properties and functionality. Gold is well known to adopt the face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) structure, and it remains challenging to create new phases, but recent research on nanogold has provided exciting opportunities by achieving 2H (note: H denotes hexagonal), 4H, and body&#8208;centered&#8208;tetragonal (bct) phases. In the current work, an unusual non&#8208;compact phase in 40&#8208;atom gold nanoclusters is reported, which is in contrast to the close&#8208;packed isomer of fcc structure. The non&#8208;compact isomer exhibits exclusive square planes in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking, hence giving rise to a unique 0.5 &#197; channel, whereas the fcc isomer is composed of close&#8208;packed planes with a closed structure (i.e., no 1D channel). The two Au40 isomers lead to a nearly two orders of magnitude difference in electronic excited&#8208;state lifetime. The attainment of the new non&#8208;compact phase in nanogold presents potential opportunities in terahertz emission owing to the strong electron&#8208;vibration coupling, ion channeling and ion selection, artificial photosynthesis, and biocatalysis.

         <title>3D Chiral Perovskitoid&#8208;to&#8208;Perovskite Reconstructive Phase Transition Designed Molecular Ferroelectric Thin&#8208;Film with out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Polarization</title>

         <dc:description>
3D chiral R/S&#8208;AQCsI3 (AQ = 3&#8208;aminoquinolinium) ferroelectric thin films with preferred (00l) orientation can undergo an unprecedented reconstructive phase transition from hybrid 3D perovskitoid to perovskite structure while maintaining the (00l) preferential orientation. This rearrangement triggers chiral AQ2+ cation reorientation within the lattice, successfully switching polarization direction of the thin&#8208;film from pure in&#8208;plane to pure out&#8208;of&#8208;plane.








Abstract
The realization of pure out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization in ferroelectric thin films is crucial for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance microelectronics and miniaturized devices. Molecular ferroelectrics, which allow facile and large&#8208;area thin&#8208;film fabrication via solution processing, have gained tremendous attention in recent years. However, to date, molecular ferroelectric thin films with pure out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization have never been reported due to the inconsistency of their random orientation with the polarization direction. Herein, 3D chiral alkali metal halide ferroelectrics R/S&#8208;AQCsI3 (AQ = 3&#8208;aminoquinolinium) are designed, of which thin films exhibit a highly preferred (00l) orientation. Notably, R/S&#8208;AQCsI3 can undergo an unprecedented reconstructive phase transition from hybrid 3D perovskitoid to perovskite structure while maintaining the thin films with the (00l) preferential orientation. More importantly, such a topological rearrangement of the 3D inorganic [CsI3]n2&#8722; framework triggers chiral AQ2+ cation reorientation in the lattice, which changes the polarization direction from b&#8208;axis in the polar perovskitoid phase to c&#8208;axis in the perovskite phase, enabling the variation from pure in&#8208;plane to pure out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization in the thin&#8208;film. To the knowledge, this is the first report of molecular ferroelectric thin films with pure out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization. This work opens up an avenue for achieving pure out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization in molecular ferroelectric thin films.

         <title>Molecular Surface Engineering of Sulfide Electrolytes with Enhanced Humidity Tolerance for Robust Lithium Metal All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that the electrochemical, interfacial, and humidity stability of halide&#8208;doped sulfide electrolytes (LPSClBr) is significantly enhanced by an organic surface coating using octadecyl phosphonic acid (OPA) and its lithiated form (Li&#8208;OPA). This single&#8208;step strategy enables robust interfacial protection, supports lithium metal anodes, and improves long&#8208;term performance in high&#8208;voltage all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, including anode&#8208;free configurations.









Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) enable next&#8208;generation batteries due to their intrinsic safety and compatibility with lithium (Li) metal anodes. However, many SSEs, particularly sulfide&#8208;based systems, suffer from limited electrochemical stability and high moisture sensitivity. Here, the molecular surface engineering of Li argyrodite SSE, Li6PS5Cl0.5Br0.5 (LPSClBr), is reported using octadecyl phosphonic acid (OPA) and its lithiated form (Li&#8208;OPA) in a single&#8208;step coating strategy to stabilize both anode and cathode interfaces. The Li&#8208;OPA&#8208;coated electrolyte maintains high ionic conductivity (&gt;2.5&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1) and retains &gt;92% of its initial conductivity after 24&#160;h dry room exposure (dew point &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C). At 2&#160;wt.% loading, Li&#8208;OPA&#8208;coated LPSClBr achieves a critical current density of 2.4&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;1 and supports stable Li plating/stripping for over 400&#160;h at 1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2. In NCM811 cathode&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state cells, it delivers 160&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.3&#160;C with &gt;99.7% Coulombic efficiency and 85% capacity retention after 100 cycles. In anode&#8208;free cell configurations, Li&#8208;OPA&#8208;modified electrolytes enhance interfacial stability and cycling performance. These results demonstrate Li&#8208;OPA as a scalable, high&#8208;performance interfacial modifier for sulfide&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Phase Regulation via a Volatile Morphology Director Enables Trap&#8208;Suppressed Organic Solar Cells with 20.6% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is introduced 1,3&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5&#8208;iodobenzene (DBI) as a volatile solid additive with multiple noncovalent interactions to concurrently optimize both donor and acceptor phases. As validated by PM6:L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;F ternary system, adding an optimal amount of DBI achieves a champion power conversion efficiency of 20.6% with a boosted operational stability (T80:769&#160;h) under continuous light&#8208;soaking condition.








Abstract
Immense trap densities arising from faint donor self&#8208;assembly and excessive acceptor aggregation severely restrain power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in organic solar cells. Yet, most studies focus solely on acceptor regulation, and synergistic co&#8208;modulation of donor and acceptor phases for trap suppression has rarely been achieved. Here, 1,3&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5&#8208;iodobenzene (DBI) as a volatile solid additive with multiple noncovalent interactions to concurrently optimize both phases is introduced. Using PM6:Y6 as representative, from systemic coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamic simulation, in&#8208;situ synchronic and spectroscopy and transient optoelectronic characterizations, it is demonstrated that DBI can selectively bind with the fluorinated benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene segments in PM6 backbone, which strengthens interchain interactions, enhances interchain packing density, and triggers the pre&#8208;aggregation of PM6 in solution state. Moreover, this preferentially precipitation of PM6 matrix sterically mitigates the oversized Y6 aggregation, which yields well&#8208;defined phase separation with appropriate domain sizes, which markedly substitute energetic disorder and trap density. As a result, the DBI treated devices yielded an elevated performance of 18.4% compared to 17.0% for reference devices. The generality of such strategy is also validated by PM6:L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;F ternary system, where adding an optimal amount of DBI achieves a champion PCE of 20.6% with a boosted operational stability (T80:769&#160;h) under continuous light&#8208;soaking condition.

         <title>LEAD: Literature Enhanced Ab Initio Discovery of Nitride Dusting Layers for Enhanced Tunnel Magnetoresistance and Lower Resistance Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) using MgO tunnel barriers face challenges of high resistance&#8208;area product and low tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR). To discover alternative materials, Literature Enhanced Ab initio Discovery (LEAD) is developed. The LEAD&#8208;predicted materials are theoretically evaluated, showing that MTJs with dusting of ScN or TiN on either side of MgO have lower resistance values and higher TMR than MgO junctions.








Abstract
Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) using magnesium oxide (MgO) tunnel barriers face challenges of high resistance&#8208;area product (RA) and low tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR). To discover alternative materials, Literature Enhanced Ab initio Discovery (LEAD) is developed as a framework that combines language models with first&#8208;principles screening. A domain&#8208;specific Word2Vec model is used to extract correlations from materials science literature, identifying promising candidates such as hybrid nitride&#8208;based barriers. Additionally, a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers based masked language model is trained on the same corpus to capture deeper contextual relationships, identifying tantalum nitride (TaN), vanadium nitride (VN), and titanium nitride (TiN) as candidate barrier materials. These predictions are subsequently evaluated using density functional theory (DFT) simulations in QuantumATK, benchmarking the predicted materials' TMR and RA against MgO and scandium nitride (ScN). Results show that MTJs featuring a monolayer dusting of ScN, or monolayer or bilayer dusting of TiN, on either side of MgO have similar or lower RA while achieving higher TMR than pure MgO junctions. LEAD offers a scalable method for discovering tunnel barriers and highlights nitride dusting layers as promising for next&#8208;generation MTJ&#160;performance.

         <title>Moth&#8208;Wing&#8208;Inspired Multifunctional Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a moth&#8208;wing&#8208;inspired heterogeneous metamaterial that achieves synergistic broadband sound absorption, mechanical energy dissipation, and thermal insulation within a lightweight architected framework. Combining bioinspired gradient design, genetic&#8208;algorithm optimization, and additive manufacturing, the bionic heterogeneous acoustic metamaterial demonstrates superior multifunctional integration and applicability in advanced noise&#8208;control systems such as protective helmets.








Abstract
To evade ultrasonic predation by bats, moths have evolved wing scale architectures capable of absorbing and scattering high&#8208;frequency acoustic signals. Drawing inspiration from this natural defense strategy, a bioinspired multifunctional metamaterial is presented that integrates broadband sound absorption, thermal insulation, and mechanical energy dissipation within a unified structural framework. Inspired by the graded pore architecture of moth scales, acoustic performance is first optimized via genetic algorithm&#8211;driven pore design and the structures using 3D printing. The resulting metamaterial exhibits broadband acoustic absorption with an average coefficient of 0.742 across the 1000&#8211;6000&#160;Hz frequency range. When implemented in helmet&#8208;based noise reduction systems, the proposed metamaterial outperforms conventional commercial foams in suppressing environmental noise. In addition, the metamaterial retains a negative Poisson's ratio under large deformation, which enhances its mechanical energy dissipation and impact resilience. Furthermore, the alternating architecture of polymer layers and internal air cavities reduces the effective thermal conductivity to 30.2 mW&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, ensuring excellent thermal insulation. This work demonstrates that leveraging biological architectures enables the simultaneous integration of acoustic, mechanical, and thermal functionalities in lightweight metamaterials, offering a new paradigm for multifunctional design.

         <title>Metabolic Osteoimmune Biodegradable Zn&#8211;Mn Alloys: High Strength&#8208;Ductility and In Situ Vascular&#8208;Osteogenic Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;strengthening&#8208;efficiency (high&#8208;SE) design strategy is proposed to develop novel Zn&#8208;0.8Mn&#8208;0.1Mg and Zn&#8208;0.8Mn&#8208;0.1Li alloys, which achieve the highest SE among Zn alloys with yield strength &gt;350 MPa and elongation &gt;30%. This work unveils their strengthening&#8208;ductilization mechanism and an immunomodulatory&#8208;anti&#8208;inflammatory&#8208;metabolic osteogenic coupling cascade, providing a new paradigm for next&#8208;generation orthopedic implants.








Abstract
Driven by the demand for sustainable, safe, and cost&#8208;effective medical materials, design of biodegradable metals increasingly aims to achieve higher strength and biofunctionality with less alloying. This study proposes a high strengthening&#8208;efficiency (high&#8208;SE) design strategy and develops novel Zn&#8208;0.8Mn&#8208;0.1Mg and Zn&#8208;0.8Mn&#8208;0.1Li alloys. With total alloying additions below 1 wt.%, these alloys achieve yield strength of 369&#8211;397 MPa, elongation of 42&#8211;57%, and remarkable strengthening efficiency (SE) of 6.4&#8211;6.8. These SE values represent the highest level among high strength&#8208;ductile Zn alloys (YS &gt; 300 MPa, EL &gt; 40%). Benefiting from the synergistic release of Zn2+, Mn2+, and Li+/Mg2+ ions, both the alloys exhibit superior antibacterial activity, cytocompatibility, controlled degradation rates, and in vivo osteogenesis, demonstrating excellent degradation&#8208;osteogenesis coupling effect. Notably, Zn&#8208;0.8Mn&#8208;0.1Mg further enhances osteogenesis by activating the PI3K/Akt/HIF&#8208;1&#945; signaling axis, which coordinates cascades of immunomodulation (e.g., IGF2, P2rx5), anti&#8208;inflammation (e.g., Nfkbia inhibition), and cellular energy metabolism (e.g., Ndufaf3), resulting in a more pronounced osteogenic effect. This work establishes a new paradigm for high&#8208;efficiency alloy design, achieving simultaneous breakthroughs in mechanical and biofunctionality, offering a promising framework for next&#8208;generation Zn&#8208;based orthopedic implants.

         <title>Synergistic Modulation of HOMO Energy Level and Electronic Structure in Phthalates Anodes Active Materials Enables High&#8208;Performance of Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CuPA and ZnPA carbonyl group facilitates lithium storage by a reversible enolization reaction, while the activated benzene ring exhibits redox activity for reversible lithiation/delithiation, with Cu2+ irreversibly reducing to Cu&#8314;, while Zn2+ remains stable. CaPA enables efficient lithium storage by the reversible intercalation and deintercalation of lithium ions on its (100) crystallographic plane.








Abstract
This study employs molecular engineering to modulate HOMO levels and electronic structures, designing high&#8208;performance phthalate&#8208;based anodes (ZnPA, CaPA, CuPA) to address challenges like limited capacity and poor cycling in organic lithium&#8208;ion batteries. CuPA delivers 749 mAh g&#8722;1after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1and retains 200 mAh g&#8722;1after 2500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. ZnPA achieves 650 mAh g&#8722;1at 0.1 A g&#8722;1and maintains 200 mAh g&#8722;1after 1500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. CaPA shows increased capacity at higher current (197 mAh g&#8722;1at 1 A g&#8722;1) due to (100) plane expansion. Redox mechanisms differ: CuPA and ZnPA carbonyl group facilitates lithium storage by a reversible enolization reaction, while the activated benzene ring exhibits redox activity for reversible lithiation/delithiation, with Cu2+ irreversibly reducing to Cu&#8314;, while Zn2+ remains stable. CaPA enables efficient lithium storage by the reversible intercalation and deintercalation of lithium ions on its (100) crystallographic plane. Full cells with LiFePO4 exhibit excellent performance: CuPA||LFP and ZnPA||LFP retain over 50% capacity after 1000 cycles; CaPA||LFP shows outstanding rate capability (103 mAh g&#8722;1at 4C). This work demonstrates that molecular structural engineering is an effective strategy for enhancing organic electrode materials.

         <title>Radiation&#8208;Resistant Aluminum Alloy for Space Missions in the Extreme Environment of the Solar System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ultrafine&#8208;grained aluminum crossover alloy exhibits unprecedented radiation resistance and mechanical stability under extreme irradiation doses up to 100 dpa. The exceptional resilience arises from thermodynamically stable T&#8208;phase precipitates, enabling lightweight structural materials for next&#8208;generation spacecraft and extraterrestrial applications where conventional Al alloys may fail under radiation exposure.








Abstract
Future human exploration of the solar system demands advanced materials capable of withstanding extreme environments, particularly exposure to solar energetic particle radiation. Current material selection criteria for space applications prioritize a high strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio, high corrosion resistance and manufacturability, favoring age&#8208;hardenable Al&#8208;based alloys. However, conventional precipitation&#8208;hardened Al alloys suffer from irradiation&#8208;assisted dissolution of strengthening phases at doses as low as 0.2 displacements&#8208;per&#8208;atom (dpa), undermining their performance. Furthermore, these alloys develop radiation&#8208;induced defects, such as dislocation loops and voids, even at low doses. This study presents a novel ultrafine&#8208;grained (UFG) Al&#8208;based alloy, designed using the crossover alloying concept and strengthened by T&#8208;phase precipitates, featuring a chemically&#8208;complex structure with 162 atoms in its unit cell composed of Mg32(Zn,Al)49. It is showed that T&#8208;phase precipitates have exceptional radiation tolerance up to 24 dpa. Owing to the nanoscale UFG structure, dislocation loops are suppressed, and voids are only observed beyond 75 dpa. Microtensile tests up to 20 dpa confirm the preservation of mechanical performance under irradiation. The results underline the potential of this alloy as a radiation&#8208;resistant, lightweight material for future space applications. Three key strategies enable this performance: (i) stabilization of a UFG microstructure, (ii) T&#8208;phase precipitation featuring a highly negative Gibbs free energy and chemically&#8208;complex giant unit cell, and (iii) precise process control to prevent grain growth during heat treatment and&#160;irradiation.

It is showed that T-phase precipitates have exceptional radiation tolerance up to 24 dpa. Owing to the nanoscale UFG structure, dislocation loops are suppressed, and voids are only observed beyond 75 dpa. Microtensile tests up to 20 dpa confirm the preservation of mechanical performance under irradiation. The results underline the potential of this alloy as a radiation-resistant, lightweight material for future space applications. Three key strategies enable this performance: (i) stabilization of a UFG microstructure, (ii) T-phase precipitation featuring a highly negative Gibbs free energy and chemically-complex giant unit cell, and (iii) precise process control to prevent grain growth during heat treatment and&#160;irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sub&#8208;Melt Consolidation of Aerospace&#8208;Grade Thermoplastic Composites for High&#8208;Rate Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating amorphous PEI sheaths with semicrystalline PEEK, selectively thinned by picosecond laser ablation to form PEI&#8211;PEEK blending regions, creates a Goldilocks consolidation window that preserves crystallinity, minimizes resin&#8208;rich interlayers, and enables vacuum&#8208;bag&#8208;only processing at 300&#160;&#176;C&#8212;achieving fivefold faster consolidation and reducing energy use by 75% relative to conventional processing methods for aerospace&#8208;grade thermoplastic composites.








Abstract
The processing of thermoplastic composites is often limited by high energy demands and slow cycle times. Out&#8208;of&#8208;autoclave amorphous/crystalline thermoplastic materials for energy&#8208;efficient aerospace&#8208;grade laminates (OATMEAL) addresses these challenges through a unique prepreg architecture. OATMEAL consists of slow&#8208;cooled carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced semicrystalline polyetheretherketone (PEEK) tape sheathed in thin amorphous polyetherimide (PEI) layers. The PEI sheaths are miscible with PEEK and enable interfacial healing below the melting point of PEEK&#8212;preserving pre&#8208;existing crystallinity and reducing processing temperatures by 80&#160;&#176;C. The sheaths are thinned via high&#8208;frequency laser ablation down to the PEEK&#8211;PEI blending regions, thereby reducing residual stresses and promoting chemical resistance. Fast&#8208;cooled vacuum&#8208;bag&#8208;only oven processing of OATMEAL laminates yields aerospace&#8208;quality parts while enabling processing speeds more than five times faster and reducing energy use by roughly 75% compared with conventional methods. These results represent a significant advancement and a step toward truly high&#8208;rate, large&#8208;scale aerostructure manufacturing.

         <title>Inhibition of Interregional Charge Transfer Transition in Asymmetrical Heteroatomic Framework Enables BT.2020 Deep&#8208;Blue Electroluminescence with EQE Exceeding 40%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two triple&#8208;borylated isomers TBNO&#8208;1 and TBNO&#8208;2 are designed via &#960;&#8208;extensions and heteroatom regulations. Distinct interregional charge transfer contributions are identified in their excited states, resulting in different spectral behaviors across various environments. Consequently, while both emitters can afford impressive external quantum efficiency exceeding 40%, only TBNO&#8208;2 can afford electroluminescence satisfying the BT.2020 standard with CIE&#8208;y coordinate of 0.044.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;boron/nitrogen/oxygen (B/N/O)&#8208;embedded polyaromatics featuring the multiple resonance (MR) effect are popular photoluminescent emitters that meet the BT.2020 blue standard, while they often fail to achieve this in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) because the uneven electron&#8208;donating properties of N/O atoms make them sensitive to their surrounding environments. Herein, taking such an emitter as the prototype and developing two triple&#8208;borylated isomers (TBNO&#8208;1 and TBNO&#8208;2) via &#960;&#8208;extensions and heteroatom regulations. Both emitters display highly efficient thermally activated delay fluorescence properties and nearly identical narrowband emission with CIE&#8208;y coordinates far exceeding the BT.2020 standard in toluene as the prototype does due to their similar core patterns. On the other hand, their emission spectra differ in other environments due to their different interregional charge transfer (IRCT) characters. Importantly, due to the strategically opposed oxygen atoms, TBNO&#8208;2 demonstrates uniformly delocalized wavefunctions and a much&#8208;suppressed IRCT contribution than TBNO&#8208;1, and thus exhibits minimal spectral variations across diverse environments. In OLEDs, while both emitters can afford impressive external quantum efficiency exceeding 40%, only TBNO&#8208;2 can afford electroluminescence satisfying the BT.2020 standard with CIE&#8208;y coordinate of 0.044. This work offers valuable insights for finely modulating the photophysical properties of MR emitters to realize BT.2020 blue electroluminescence.

         <title>Supramolecular Multivalent Synergy Enabling Harsh&#8208;Condition Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional organic phosphorescent materials (OPMs) typically suffer from severe performance deterioration under harsh conditions, limiting their practical applicability. In contrast, harsh&#8208;condition phosphorescence (HCP) materials exhibit remarkable phosphorescence stability even in extreme environments, greatly expanding their potential applications. This review highlights recent progress in HCP materials, encompassing design strategies, photophysical characteristics, and underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, emerging applications of HCP materials in afterglow displays, information encryption, sensing, and bioimaging are discussed.








Abstract
Organic phosphorescence, which arises from the radiative decay of triplet excitons, has garnered significant interest owing to its exceptional photophysical properties and diverse application potential. However, the intrinsically vulnerable triplet excitons are highly susceptible to environmental factors such as heat, oxygen, and solvents, which significantly compromise the operational stability and durability of organic phosphorescent materials (OPMs). The triplet excitons undergo rapid deactivation via thermal dissipation, oxygen&#8208;mediated energy transfer, and solvent&#8208;induced collapse of rigid microenvironments, leading to severe phosphorescence quenching. Supramolecular multivalent synergy offers an effective strategy for stabilizing triplet excitons, thereby extending beyond ambient stability to sustained phosphorescence under harsh conditions, resulting in robust organic harsh&#8208;condition phosphorescence (HCP) materials. This review provides a timely and systematic introduction to recent advances in HCP materials, including design and construction strategies, unique optoelectronic properties, underlying stabilization mechanisms, and promising applications. In addition, the summary section highlights pivotal challenges and emerging perspectives within this field to suggest feasible pathways for future research endeavors. This review not only establishes design principles for HCP materials by decoding supramolecular multivalent synergy in triplet exciton stabilization but also paves new avenues toward practical applications.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Polar Order Engineering Enables Near&#8208;Ideal Efficiency in Lead&#8208;Free Energy Storage Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free NaNbO3&#8208;based relaxor ferroelectrics achieve a record 95% efficiency and high dielectric energy density via multi&#8208;polar order engineering. Sub&#8208;angstrom electron polarization, atomic displacement enhancement, nanodomain design, and electrical microstructure unification enable ultrafast discharge and superior thermal stability, offering a sustainable alternative to toxic lead&#8208;based dielectrics for high voltage capacitor applications.








Abstract
Toxic lead&#8208;based dielectrics dominate high&#8208;performance capacitors, creating urgent environmental and supply&#8208;chain challenges. Multi&#8208;polar order engineering is deployed to create an industrially scalable lead&#8208;free perovskite achieving simultaneous record efficiency (&#951; &#8776; 95%) and energy density (12 J cm&#8722;3). Phase&#8208;field simulations are also used to guide micro&#8208;to&#8208;nano domain design to construct switchable polar nano region that delay polarization saturation. Crucially, sub&#8208;angstrom electronic state optimization &#8211; previously unexplored in energy storage dielectrics &#8211; is revealed as pivotal: synchrotron XAS quantifies Nb&#8208;O dipole ionicity enhancement via electronic polarization, while atomic&#8208;resolution electron microscopy statistically confirms bond&#8208;length homogenization and distortion reduction that structurally anchor this effect. This hierarchical atomic&#8208;to&#8208;electronic control reshapes the electrical microstructure, enabling unified charge dynamics (validated by DRT analysis) that deliver ultrafast field response (&lt;32&#160;ns discharge) and exceptional thermal resilience (&lt; &#177;4% current fluctuation, 25&#8211;150&#160;&#176;C). Fabricated from commodity precursors, the material eliminates the reliance on rare&#8208;earth precursors that are common in PLZT production, significantly lowering costs while mitigating environmental impacts. Overall, this work establishes a sustainable pathway for grid&#8208;scale power electronics.

Glass, historically valued for its purity and durability, has long inspired artists and societies. This article introduces the concept of &#8220;Archeo&#8208;Inspiration&#8221;, drawing on cultural and historical contexts of glass to guide future material innovations. By revisiting ancient craftsmanship, modern science can find imaginative pathways for developing advanced glass technologies and material systems.








Abstract
Since its earliest developments, glass has held a unique place in cultural history. Remarkably, many surviving glass artefacts from premodern times still surpass some of today's standard processing techniques, with effects and qualities that feel strikingly contemporary. Valued for its optical purity, chemical and thermal resistance, hardness, and fragile beauty, glass has long captivated both artists and craftsmen. This paper proposes examining glasses within their cultural contexts as a source of inspiration for modern materials science. Throughout history, glass has held societal and symbolic significance, with diverse cultural accounts detailing its properties and uses. While not all historical records describe glass with scientific accuracy, many offer imaginative perspectives that can inform new developments. Just as fields like bionics and biomimetics look to nature for innovation, a culturally reflective scientific approach is suggested to glass material science, a concept &#8220;Archeo&#8208;Inspiration&#8221; is termed. This concept draws from the material knowledge and creative uses of past societies to inspire future advancements in glass technology and material systems. The aim is to move beyond purely technical evaluation by reconnecting with the rich heritage of glassmaking within its cultural and historical framework. In doing so, the hope is to offer both a retrospective appreciation and a forward&#8208;looking vision for material systems in the 21st century, grounded in the enduring legacy of one of humanity's most versatile and symbolically charged materials.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Complex Acceptor Modulating Dielectric Constant and Exciton&#8208;Vibration Coupling for High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Suppressed Energy Loss</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platinum&#8208;complex&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (PtHD) is developed, featuring enhanced planarity and rigidity that suppress exciton&#8211;vibration coupling. Pt coordination increases the dipole moment and polarizability, boosting the dielectric constant. The resulting D18/L8&#8208;BO:PtHD ternary device achieves reduced energy loss (Eloss) and efficient exciton dissociation, delivering a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.52%.








Abstract
Excessive energy loss (Eloss) remains a primary bottleneck limiting further efficiency improvements in organic solar cells (OSCs). Mitigating energy losses is therefore a key prerequisite for advancing organic photovoltaic technologies. Rational acceptor molecular design that modulates the dielectric constant and exciton&#8208;vibration coupling of the active layer has emerged as a particularly promising route to achieving this goal. Herein, a platinum&#8208;complex&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (PtHD) is designed and synthesized. The molecule features high planarity and backbone rigidity, which effectively suppresses exciton&#8208;vibration coupling. Integrating the Pt coordination unit amplifies the molecular dipole moment and polarizability, consequently enhancing the dielectric constant of the active layer. A binary device based on D18/PtHD achieves a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.938&#160;V with a reduced Eloss of 0.525&#160;eV. Building on this achievement, by introducing PtHD as a guest component into the D18/L8&#8208;BO system and employing a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition strategy to control the vertical distribution, the ternary device demonstrates an minimized Eloss and superior exciton separation, culminating in a remarkably high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.52%. This work highlights the crucial role of metal&#8208;complex acceptors in managing energy loss and charge dynamics, thus providing a molecular design paradigm to develop highly efficient organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Collagen&#8208;Derived Nanoconfined Catalytic Membranes for Highly Efficient Water Remediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable nanoconfined catalytic membrane is fabricated from collagen fiber networks via mechanical nanofibrillation and tannic acid&#8211;driven Fe3O4 mineralization. The hierarchical nanostructure enhances water permeation and reactive oxygen species utilization, achieving 98.2% tetracycline removal with ultrahigh permeance, providing a scalable, eco&#8208;friendly platform for wastewater treatment.








Abstract
Nanoconfined catalytic membranes (NCMs) are promising for advanced water treatment but often face trade&#8208;offs between permeability, stability, and catalytic efficiency. Here, the hierarchical architecture of collagen fiber networks (CFNs) is exploited to develop robust, efficient, and sustainable collagen&#8208;derived NCMs. Mechanical nanofibrillation and tannic acid (TA) functionalization generate highly dispersed fibrils and interconnected nanochannels that enhance water transport and active&#8208;site accessibility. TA further directs mineralization of Fe3O4 nanocatalysts and accelerates H2O2 activation, while the hierarchical porous structure promotes efficient utilization of reactive oxygen species. The resulting TA/Fe@CFN membranes exhibit high water permeance (2274.8 LMH bar&#8722;1) and achieve 98.2% tetracycline removal under flow&#8208;through conditions, along with efficient removal of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria and genes in real medical wastewater. Mechanistic studies reveal that nanoconfinement is vital to the accelerated catalytic kinetics and enhanced Fenton activity. Life cycle and economic analyses further demonstrate that TA/Fe@CFN is a green and cost&#8208;effective alternative to conventional polymeric membranes. This work establishes a high&#8208;performance, environmentally compatible platform for wastewater purification and highlights the broad potential of upcycling animal byproducts into multifunctional materials for circular water technologies.

         <title>Lattice Distortion in High&#8208;Entropy Transition Metal Diselenide for Augmented Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the lattice distortion effect, this study for the first time realize a unique distortion of the trigonal prismatic motif in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). This distorted lattice generates electron accumulation regions that serve as highly active sites, significantly enhancing the basal plane activity of TMDs for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
The high&#8208;entropy strategy offers a viable pathway to activate the inert basal plane of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) for electrocatalysis. This work demonstrates that the &#8220;lattice distortion effect&#8221;, one of the core effects of high&#8208;entropy materials, plays a crucial role in activating the basal plane of TMDs. A high&#8208;entropy diselenide (ReNbTaMoW)Se2 (denoted as HESe2) is synthesized via solid&#8208;state reaction. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal a unique fivefold&#8208;modulated structure in HESe2, which unexpectedly distorts the rigid trigonal prismatic motif. HESe2 exhibits exceptional activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), showing a low overpotential of 31&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art precious metal catalysts. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates that the distorted structure of HESe2 remains stable during the HER process. A proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser assembled with HESe2 cathodic catalyst shows competitive performance and durability with negligible degradation over 400 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal the electron accumulation regions induced by lattice distortion as high&#8208;activity sites, thereby driving the augmented HER performance of HESe2. This work presents a universal strategy for boosting the basal plane activity of layered materials through unique lattice distortion effect.

         <title>Synergistic Strategy of Targeted Capture and Potential Responsive Release for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study innovatively proposes a synergistic strategy of &#8220;targeted capture and potential responsive release&#8221;. By utilizing Bi2O3 to selectively capture I&#8722; and form BiOI, followed by their release at lower potentials, the strategy effectively suppresses shuttle behavior through the delayed release of I&#8722;, thereby enhancing the battery's cycling stability and capacity. 








Abstract
The shuttle effect, arising from the dissolution and migration of polyiodide species, severely hinders the practical application of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#9472;I2) batteries. Conventional carbon&#8208;based cathode materials, relying on weak physical adsorption, fail to effectively confine iodine species. To address this issue, a synergistic strategy is proposed that combines the targeted capture of I&#8722; to form BiOI with the potential responsive release of I&#8722; from BiOI during the reduction of Bi3+ to Bi. This approach enables a dynamic and directional capture&#8208;release process at a potential lower than that required for the reduction of I2. This methodology is validated through ex situ spectroscopic analysis and Density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This decoupled mechanism suppresses polyiodide formation and ensures efficient cathode reversibility. The incorporation of Bi2O3 also introduces an additional redox couple, contributing extra capacity to the battery. The battery not only efficiently suppresses the inherent side reaction issues of zinc&#8208;iodine batteries, but also achieves a considerably high capacity level in the field of iodine single&#8208;electron conversion. This work provides a universal design principle for manipulating iodine electrochemistry, paving the way for high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;lifespan halogen&#8208;based batteries.

This approach enables a dynamic and directional capture-release process at a potential lower than that required for the reduction of I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This methodology is validated through ex situ spectroscopic analysis and Density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This decoupled mechanism suppresses polyiodide formation and ensures efficient cathode reversibility. The incorporation of Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; also introduces an additional redox couple, contributing extra capacity to the battery. The battery not only efficiently suppresses the inherent side reaction issues of zinc-iodine batteries, but also achieves a considerably high capacity level in the field of iodine single-electron conversion. This work provides a universal design principle for manipulating iodine electrochemistry, paving the way for high-energy, long-lifespan halogen-based batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergizing Donor&#8211;Acceptor Ni&#8208;MOF with Lignin Proton Relay for Efficient and Selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Photoreduction</title>

This work constructs a hybrid catalyst through incorporating carboxylated lignin (C&#8208;HL) and a single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;MOF), which achieves efficient and selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoreduction.








Abstract
Amidst the urgent global push for carbon neutrality, CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoreduction has emerged as a critical technology for closing the carbon cycle and converting renewable energy. In this work, a hybrid catalyst, denoted as C&#8208;HL&#8208;20%/Ni(TTA)bpe (TTA = 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;;&#8208;tricarboxy&#8208;triphenylamine, bpe = 4,4&#8242;&#8208;ethylenedipyridine), is constructed through the rational design of a composite system incorporating carboxylated lignin (C&#8208;HL) and a single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;MOF). The catalyst demonstrates impressive photocatalytic performance, achieving a CO production rate of 6516.4 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 98.3% selectivity, which has reached the top level of the reported MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Under outdoor conditions, it also demonstrates a stable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion rate of 4282.5 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that this high activity originates from donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) artificial structure of the single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;MOF and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process. Modification with C&#8208;HL introduces enriched &#9472;COOH groups, which form hydrogen bonds with the Ni(TTA)bpe framework. This not only consolidates the structure but also shortens the electron migration pathway, thereby achieving efficient and selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photo&#8208;conversion. This study establishes a rational catalyst design strategy for sustainable CO2 photoreduction, demonstrating a feasible pathway toward manageable carbon resource utilization.

         <title>Advancing Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting with Z&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions by Interfacial Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the interfacial manipulation in Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions for photocatalytic overall water splitting (POWS), focusing on the charge separation, extraction, and injection at the semiconductor&#8208;semiconductor and semiconductor&#8208;water interfaces to enhance POWS performance. Effective strategies for interfacial manipulation and advanced characterization techniques are summarized, and current challenges and future research directions for efficient Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions are also presented.








Abstract
Photocatalytic overall water splitting (POWS), as a promising technology for large&#8208;scale solar hydrogen production, has propelled the development of advanced photocatalysts. Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions are believed to be ideal candidates for efficient POWS due to the reconcilable benefits of broad solar spectrum absorption and sufficient redox potentials. POWS by Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions involves multiple&#8208;step charge transfer processes happening at the interfaces, thereby making interfacial manipulation crucial to improving the photocatalytic performance. This review delves into the intricate details of interfacial manipulation in Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions with an emphasis on the semiconductor&#8208;semiconductor interfaces and the semiconductor&#8208;water interfaces. First, the basic charge transfer processes are explored at the interfaces, and then summarize and explore the effective manipulation strategies to promote the interfacial charge transfer processes for enhanced POWS performance. Further, the advanced characterization techniques are introduced for understanding these interfacial processes. Finally, the current challenges and future directions are provided for the development of efficient Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions for POWS.

         <title>Multimaterials by Patterning Microphase Separation of a Single Copolymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single copolymer is programmed into multimaterials by arresting microphase separation at different stages. This strategy enables seamless integration of regions resembling tough plastics or tough rubbers, providing a general platform for rigid&#8211;soft integrated devices.








Abstract
Living systems achieve robustness by integrating soft and rigid components into seamless architectures, yet synthetic emulation of this strategy remains limited. Here, we present a strategy to generate multimaterials from a single copolymer by patterning phase separation. Specifically, we design a block copolymer of metastable nanostructure, and then spatially program photocrosslinking to locally arrest phase separation at different levels during annealing, thereby producing patterns that span moduli from regimes of rubbers to plastics. The resulting multimaterial exhibits spatially distinct mechanical properties, but is chemically identical, and is seamlessly integrated through a shared polymer network topology. This approach inherently eliminates interfacial incompatibility of dissimilar materials, enhances structural integrity of the multimaterial, and establishes a versatile platform for programmable, multiscale rigid&#8208;soft integrated devices.

         <title>&#8220;Tear&#8208;And&#8208;Stack&#8221; Twisted SrTiO3 Moir&#233; Superlattices for Precise Interfacial Reconstruction and Polar Topology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tear&#8208;and&#8208;stack method enables the creation of twisted SrTiO3 bilayers with accurate twist&#8208;angle control, which yield atomically sharp oxide moir&#233; superlattices with emergent exotic topological polar vortices, thereby opening a new pathway for twistronics based on 2D&#8208;like non&#8208;van der Waals oxides.








Abstract
Oxide&#8208;based moir&#233; superlattice is an emerging field for its exotic properties and abundant design freedom. However, due to the dangling bond and much stronger interlayer adhesion with the supporting substrate, fabricating twisted complex oxide is challenging, and an oxide moir&#233; lattice with a clean interface remains elusive. Here, square moir&#233; superlattices in twisted SrTiO3 (STO) bilayer are constructed using a 2D like &#8220;tear&#8208;and&#8208;stack&#8221; method, achieving unprecedent control resolution and superior interface quality. Through depth&#8208;dependent atomic&#8208;scale analysis and electronic reconstruction, the upper and lower STO layers are found near the twisted interface exhibit opposite shear strain, evidencing a strong coupling confined within 2 unit cells (&#177;0.8&#160;nm) from the interface. The strain gradient of twisted bilayer STO gives rise to alternating clockwise and counter&#8208;clockwise polarization originating from the flexoelectric effect, leading to a large&#8208;scale array of polar vortex. This motivates to fabricate twisted STO bilayers with a freestanding parent layer as thin as 0.8&#160;nm, in which a polar vortex is also confirmed. The &#8220;tear&#8208;and&#8208;stack&#8221; method is generic to create twisted moir&#233; superlattices in a wide range of oxide material systems, and it demonstrates the feasibility of &#8220;2D&#8208;like&#8221; oxide twistronics.

         <title>Utilization of Diamagnetic Force Introduced by External Magnetic Fields for Printing Scalable Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational control of photoactive film morphology is crucial for scalable organic solar cells. This study introduces a magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;assisted printing strategy to enhance the intermolecular interactions and guide molecular stacking. This method improves film homogeneity, minimizes defects, and reduces performance loss, offering a universal approach for printing high&#8208;quality photoactive films and multi&#8208;parameter optimization in organic electronics.









Abstract
The photovoltaic performance and stability of scalable organic solar cells (OSCs) are significantly governed by the micromorphology, molecular interactions, and stacking behavior of the active layer. As the device area increases, these effects are amplified, making long&#8208;range morphological control of small&#8208;molecule acceptors challenging and frequently leading to performance degradation. Herein, a non&#8208;contact and size&#8208;insensitive magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;assisted printing strategy is developed, which modulates the chemical environment of molecular end groups during film formation and enhances intermolecular interactions, thereby regulating the molecular stacking behavior.

&lt;p&gt;Rational control of photoactive film morphology is crucial for scalable organic solar cells. This study introduces a magnetic-field-assisted printing strategy to enhance the intermolecular interactions and guide molecular stacking. This method improves film homogeneity, minimizes defects, and reduces performance loss, offering a universal approach for printing high-quality photoactive films and multi-parameter optimization in organic electronics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photovoltaic performance and stability of scalable organic solar cells (OSCs) are significantly governed by the micromorphology, molecular interactions, and stacking behavior of the active layer. As the device area increases, these effects are amplified, making long-range morphological control of small-molecule acceptors challenging and frequently leading to performance degradation. Herein, a non-contact and size-insensitive magnetic-field-assisted printing strategy is developed, which modulates the chemical environment of molecular end groups during film formation and enhances intermolecular interactions, thereby regulating the molecular stacking behavior. These collectively improve the film homogeneity, reduce the defect density, and minimize the performance loss in large-area devices. Finally, the optimal pseudo-planar heterojunction OSCs, fabricated via air atmosphere printing, achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.23%. Furthermore, large-area binary modules with an aperture area of 25.00 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; retain an optimized PCE of 16.70%, underscoring their strong potential for scalable production. Overall, this work proposes a universal approach for printing high-quality photoactive films and provides a valuable framework for the collaborative optimization of organic electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Antagonistic Iron Competition Induced by Iron Chelators Heightens Cuproptosis in Both Tumors and Intratumoral Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the ancient fable &#8220;The Snipe and the Clam Grapple While the Fisherman Profits&#8221;, this study develops a nano&#8208;chelator copper&#8208;deferiprone (Cu&#8208;DFP) that not only depletes iron ions in the tumor microenvironment to turn tumor cells against bacteria, but also releases Cu2+ to induce cuproptosis in both, thereby achieving dual suppression of tumors and their resident bacteria.








Abstract
Both tumors and intratumoral bacteria exhibit iron addiction, a shared metabolic dependency that drives their proliferation. Here, inspired by the ancient Chinese fable&#160;&#8220;The Snipe and the Clam Grapple While the Fisherman Profits&#8221;, a nano&#8208;chelator,&#160;copper&#8208;deferiprone (Cu&#8208;DFP), is designed and synthesized to deplete iron ions by metal chelation therapy in the tumor microenvironment, thereby&#160;&#8220;sowing discord&#8221;&#160;between tumors and intratumoral bacteria and subsequently inducing&#160;cuproptosis&#160;in both. Specifically, capitalizing on the high iron stores in both tumor cells and intratumoral bacteria, coupled with the superior iron&#8208;chelating capability of DFP, Cu&#8208;DFP effectively hijacks iron ions from these cellular reservoirs while concurrently liberating substantial amounts of copper ions (Cu2+). Iron depletion not only&#160;exacerbates the antagonistic rivalry&#160;between tumors and bacteria but also&#160;disrupts their defense mechanisms&#160;against external stressors. Moreover, the released Cu2+ leads to&#160;excessive intracellular copper accumulation, triggering&#160;cuproptosis&#160;in both. The dying tumor cells and bacteria then release damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen&#8208;associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), respectively, promoting dendritic cells (DCs) maturation and activating&#160;antitumor immune responses. By harnessing the iron&#8208;mediated metabolic competition to potentiate cuproptosis, this therapeutic strategy presents an innovative method for addressing intratumoral microbiota in oncology.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Thermoelectric Fabric of PEDOT:PSS/SWCNT@PU Composite Fibers for Body&#8208;Temperature Monitoring and Fever Alarming</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using polyurethane&#8208;encapsulated PEDOT:PSS/SWCNT fibers, the assembled thermoelectric fabric demonstrates high and stable output performance under various mechanical deformations. A fabric&#8208;integrated intelligent fever&#8208;monitoring system enables highly sensitive and real&#8208;time body&#8208;temperature tracking.








Abstract
Integrated flexible thermoelectric (TE) fabric demonstrates great potential for wearable energy harvesting and intelligent temperature sensing. However, existing TE fibers often struggle to simultaneously satisfy requirements&#160;for high and stable TE performance, favorable weavability, sweat resistance, and good biocompatibility. Herein, continuous PEDOT:PSS/SWCNT composite fibers with these desirable features are obtained via a convenient freeze&#8208;thaw&#8208;induced gelation process assisted wet&#8208;spinning process, exhibiting a high electrical conductivity of 1960 S cm&#8722;1, a large power factor of 59.6 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, and a high tensile strength of 103 MPa. Polyurethane&#8208;encapsulated composite fibers further provide superior mechanical flexibility, desirable weavability, remarkable washability, low&#8208;temperature tolerance, and stable TE performance over 1000 bending/twisting cycles.&#160;A resulting TE fabric comprising 32 p&#8208;type legs achieves a power density of 60.1 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 at temperature difference of 50 K, surpassing most reported PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based fiber devices, and retains over 95% performance after various mechanical deformations. The developed fabric&#8208;integrated intelligent fever monitoring system (forehead/wrist/armpit) exhibits high sensitivity (alarm response &lt; 5&#160;s) and good repeatability (3&#8211;4.3 s response over 50 cycles) for low/high fever monitoring. Such composite TE fibers are anticipated to advance practical applications of wearable TE fabrics in body energy harvesting, personalized healthcare, and intelligent fitness monitoring.

         <title>Gradient&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Doping Breaks the Piezoelectric Trade&#8208;Off in Lead&#8208;Free (K, Na)NbO3 Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient&#8208;acceptor&#8208;doping strategy is proposed to fundamentally break the long&#8208;standing compromise between piezoelectric coefficient (d33) and mechanical quality factor (Qm) in (K, Na)NbO3 ferroelectric ceramics. By creating a controlled compositional gradient of Cu2+ ions in soft (K, Na)NbO3 ceramics via solid&#8208;state diffusion sintering, a record&#8208;breaking combination of d33 = 350 pC/N and Qm = 340 is obtained, promising for high&#8208;power piezoelectric applications.








Abstract
Achieving a high piezoelectric coefficient (d33) and a high mechanical quality factor (Qm) simultaneously in ferroelectric ceramics has been a persistent challenge, as conventional doping strategies, i.e., donor doping and acceptor doping, inevitably sacrifice one for the other. Here, the inherent trade&#8208;off is breaking through a new gradient&#8208;acceptor&#8208;doping strategy. By judiciously introducing gradient Cu2+&#8208;acceptor ions in &#8220;soft&#8221; (K, Na)NbO3 (KNN) ceramics, a record combination of properties is achieved &#8212; a d33 of 350 pC/N and a Qm of 340,&#8212;the first co&#8208;elevation of both parameters exceeding 300 in KNN&#8208;based systems. This represents a fourfold improvement in Qm with only a 10% reduction in d33. Multi&#8208;scale structural analysis reveals that the gradient doping retains a &#8220;soft&#8221; interior for high d33, and creates a &#8220;hardened&#8221; surface layer that effectively restrains domain switching, accounting for the enhanced Qm. This work offers a new paradigm for designing high&#8208;power ferroelectric ceramics by spatially tailoring functional properties.

         <title>Thermally Switchable Photoactivity in Azobenzene&#8208;Functionalized DNA Condensates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA condensates formed by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of linear DNA nanomachines exhibit selective photo&#8208;responsive deformations according to temperature. At higher temperatures, the DNA condensates are in a liquid&#8208;like state and elongate under visible light, while at lower temperatures, the DNA condensates become more gel&#8208;like and elongate under UV light.








Abstract
Soft materials capable of responding to diverse environmental stimuli are fundamental to advancing soft robotics and intelligent biomedical devices, enabling adaptive, life&#8208;like functions. Here, multimodal photothermal adaptability is reported in azobenzene&#8208;conjugated DNA condensates assembled via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). These coacervates exhibit a striking temperature&#8208;dependent inversion of their photo&#8208;response: at elevated temperatures, the liquid&#8208;like droplets deform under visible light and dissolve under ultraviolet (UV) light, whereas at lower temperatures, the gel&#8208;like condensates are reshaped by UV light while remaining inert to visible light. This unique bidirectional control is attributed to the synergy of confined azobenzene photochemistry within DNA duplexes and a pronounced isomer&#8208;dependent shift in the system's glass transition and melting temperatures. This platform of multi&#8208;responsive photofluids opens new avenues for applications demanding exquisite spatiotemporal control.

This unique bidirectional control is attributed to the synergy of confined azobenzene photochemistry within DNA duplexes and a pronounced isomer-dependent shift in the system's glass transition and melting temperatures. This platform of multi-responsive photofluids opens new avenues for applications demanding exquisite spatiotemporal control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Covalent Adaptable Network Enables Sustainable Polyethylene for Next&#8208;Generation Cable Insulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyethylene is post&#8208;functionalized through a copper&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H amination, and dynamic covalent chemistry is subsequently employed to construct a new dynamic cross&#8208;linked polyethylene insulation. The material maintains cable&#8208;level electrical and mechanical properties, enables thermal self&#8208;healing after electrical and mechanical damage, and shows good recyclability, making it suitable for sustainable power cable insulation applications.








Abstract
Cross&#8208;linked polyethylene (XLPE) with favorable electrical and mechanical properties is a key component of high voltage power transmission. However, damages caused by strong electrical and high mechanical stresses tend to initiate structural degradation of insulating materials, which in severe cases can lead to catastrophic failure of equipment. The irreversible curing property of XLPE presents significant challenges in self&#8208;healing after damage and recycling after decommissioning. Herein, an innovative strategy is developed that utilizes Cu&#8208;catalyzed amination to synthesize functionalized polyethylene, combined with dynamic covalent chemistry to prepare tailorable covalent adaptable networks (CANs). Due to the exchange of dual dynamic covalent bonds, the prepared CANs exhibit excellent self&#8208;healing and recycling properties, with performance recovery efficiency close to 100% after mechanical and electrical damage. Furthermore, the ingeniously designed structure of CANs, which combines &#8220;strong&#8221; permanent cross&#8208;linking with &#8220;weak&#8221; dynamic cross&#8208;linking, achieves a higher toughness of 102.0&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 and excellent electrical insulation properties (electric field distortion rate of only 7% at 70&#160;&#176;C) than XLPE. This work promotes the environmental friendliness and long life of XLPE, paving the way for a new generation of sustainable cable insulation.

         <title>3D Bioprinted Human Synovium&#8208;Cartilage Models Mimic Rheumatoid Arthritis Microenvironment and Recapitulate In Vivo Therapeutic Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents human in vitro rheumatoid arthritis models using chondrocytes recellularized type II collagen scaffold and 3D&#8208;bioprinted Gelatin&#8208;Matrigel hydrogels with fibroblast&#8208;like synoviocytes, pro&#8208;inflammatory macrophages, and protective barrier macrophages, closely recapitulating key rheumatoid arthritis pathological features. This model is validated by anti&#8208;arthritis drugs, and its transcriptomic and proteomic profiles are aligned with in vivo pathology, offering reliable platforms for preclinical drug screening.








Abstract
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) models play crucial roles in therapeutic discovery and fundamental research. However, current models have limited success at accurately simulating in vivo microenvironment and lacking intricate cellular cross&#8208;talk. Here, this work presents a human in vitro RA model that faithfully captures functional and compositional properties of cartilage and synovial lining in vivo, established with chondrocytes recellularized type II collagen scaffold and 3D&#8208;bioprinted bi&#8208;layered Gelatin&#8208;Matrigel hydrogel incorporating fibroblast&#8208;like synoviocytes (FLS) and proinflammatory macrophages in the top layer and protective barrier macrophages in the bottom layer. This synovium&#8208;cartilage system recapitulates key inflammatory processes akin to RA, including enhanced production of proinflammatory mediators and degradative enzymes, as well as reactive oxygen species generation, invasion of FLS into cartilage, phenotypic alterations of macrophages and the depletion of cartilaginous extracellular matrix components. The established model enables effective screening of anti&#8208;arthritis drugs, which is validated by leveraging celecoxib and tofacitinib. Furthermore, the transcriptomic and proteomic landscape of this model demonstrates accuracy in replicating in vivo pathological conditions. Notably, this in vitro model reflects the response of the disease to the drug compared to the rat model of RA. Overall, this study provides reliable in vitro human synovium&#8208;cartilage models for screening preclinical drugs in RA therapeutics.

         <title>Unfolding and Degradation of Micellar Immunodrug Carriers Derived From End Group Modified Aliphatic Poly(Carbonate)s with Acid&#8208;Responsive Ketal Side Groups</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;responsive polymeric micelle system based of aliphatic poly(carbonate)s with benzyl ketal side chains is designed for targeted immunodrug delivery. It can disassemble in endosomal environments, enabling site&#8208;specific immunoactivation and enhanced biodegradability. Covalent end group conjugation of a TLR7/8 agonist regulates immune cell activation and cytokine regulation, offering a promising platform for safer, more effective immunotherapeutics.








Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule immunodrugs hold significant promise for immunotherapeutic applications including vaccination and cancer therapy. However, their clinical use is limited by severe side effects resulting from systemic distribution. To address this challenge, a biodegradable, acid&#8208;responsive nanocarrier system designed for controlled immunodrug delivery in vivo is presented. It is based on polymeric micelles that disassemble in response to acidic environments, enabling site&#8208;specific particle unfolding following endocytosis by antigen&#8208;presenting cells. Its core structure features a hydrolysable aliphatic poly(carbonate) backbone, promoting both biocompatibility and biodegradability. The high precision of the applied ring&#8208;opening polymerization allows for polymer end group functionalization, including the integration of fluorophores for F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)&#8208;based monitoring of particle integrity and unfolding. The observations reveal a pH&#8208;dependent disassembly profile both in vitro and in vivo. Comparative studies with non&#8208;responsive poly(carbonate)s demonstrate the superior performance of the acid&#8208;responsive design in selectively disassembling under acidic conditions and enhancing polymer backbone degradation. Furthermore, covalent conjugation of a small molecule Toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 agonist promotes its controlled delivery in vitro and in vivo, resulting in improved immune cell uptake and regulated cytokine production. The findings underscore the potential of this biodegradable, acid&#8208;responsive micellar nanocarrier system as precision delivery platform for safer and effective immunotherapeutics.

         <title>Sulfone Molecular Switch Enables Direct Two&#8208;Electron Uranium Photoreduction in Programmed Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pioneers a &#8220;sulfone switch&#8221; in COFs that shifts the uranium photoreduction from an indirect to a direct two&#8208;electron pathway. This molecular&#8208;level strategy promotes exciton dissociation and charge separation, stabilizes key *UO2 intermediates, as well as suppressed &#8226;O2&#8722; generation, establishing a new paradigm for controlling photocatalytic reactions.








Abstract
Photocatalytic uranium extraction from seawater is indispensable for sustainable nuclear energy, yet its efficiency is fundamentally limited by the prevailing indirect superoxide&#8208;mediated reduction pathway, which suffers from sluggish kinetics, oxygen dependency, and poor selectivity. Herein, it is demonstrated that a molecular&#8208;level &#8220;sulfone switch&#8221;, integrated into a covalent organic framework via edge&#8208;hanging engineering, orchestrates a decisive shift from the indirect to a direct two&#8208;electron transfer pathway for uranium photoreduction. The optimized Py&#8208;DaSO&#8208;COF achieves a remarkable uranium extraction capacity of 21.25&#160;mg g&#8722;1 in natural seawater, which is coupled with rapid kinetics and high selectivity against vanadium ions, surpassing most reported photocatalytic systems. Notably, combined experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the electron&#8208;deficient thiophene sulfone group promotes exciton dissociation, stabilizes key *UO2 intermediates, and suppresses &#8226;O2&#8722; generation by diverting electrons directly to adsorbed uranium species. This work establishes a versatile molecular engineering strategy for controlling photocatalytic pathways, highlighting its universal significance for solar&#8208;driven resource recovery and beyond.

         <title>Supramolecular Coupling Effect Enhanced Highly Transparent, Conductive Ionic Skin for Underwater Sensory and Interactive Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Underwater ionogel&#8208;based electronics face a typical trade&#8208;off among conductivity, transparency and sensitivity. Herein, a hydrophobic fluorinated ionogel engineered is reported with tert&#8208;butyl groups, which exhibits high transparency (96.38%) and ion conductivity (1.74 mS cm&#8722;1) benefited by supramolecular interactions. By integrating into a suspended 3D morphing structure, the obtained ionogel can achieve an ultra&#8208;high pressure sensitivity of &#8776;2.9 Pa, enabling flow field perception and autonomous obstacle avoidance in underwater robots.








Abstract
Soft electronics based on polymeric gels with unique optical, mechanical and electrical properties are of crucial importance in marine resource exploration. Hydrophobic fluorinated ionogel that combines with optical transparency, flexibility and conductivity is considered a promising potential. However, current soft ionogels struggle to meet the requirements of high electrical conductivity, transparency and perception sensitivity in the aquatic environment.

&lt;p&gt;Underwater ionogel-based electronics face a typical trade-off among conductivity, transparency and sensitivity. Herein, a hydrophobic fluorinated ionogel engineered is reported with tert-butyl groups, which exhibits high transparency (96.38%) and ion conductivity (1.74 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) benefited by supramolecular interactions. By integrating into a suspended 3D morphing structure, the obtained ionogel can achieve an ultra-high pressure sensitivity of &#8776;2.9 Pa, enabling flow field perception and autonomous obstacle avoidance in underwater robots.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft electronics based on polymeric gels with unique optical, mechanical and electrical properties are of crucial importance in marine resource exploration. Hydrophobic fluorinated ionogel that combines with optical transparency, flexibility and conductivity is considered a promising potential. However, current soft ionogels struggle to meet the requirements of high electrical conductivity, transparency and perception sensitivity in the aquatic environment. Herein, a novel fluorinated polymeric ionogel is developed incorporated with tert-butyl groups and hydrophobic ionic liquid. Benefiting from the strong supramolecular dipole interaction of fluorine atoms and the hydrogen bond of tert-butyl ester, this designed polymeric ionogel exhibits both high transparency (96.38%) and enhanced ion mobility (1.74 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). To further achieve high sensitivity, a suspended 3D morphing mechanism is proposed to construct an underwater camouflage skin with ultra-high underwater sensitivity (&#8776;2.9&#160;Pa), which enables capturing flow field gradients, tracking biological motion, and precisely localizing disturbance sources. As a demo, the ionogel-based suspended underwater electronic device is integrated into a dolphin-inspired untethered robot and further showed the closed-loop control capability of danger perception, decision and autonomous avoidance, demonstrating significant promise in underwater bionic electronics and intelligent robotics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Color&#8208;Changing Hydrogels
Mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing materials capable of reversible and durable optical responses to stress are highly desirable for diverse modern technologies in optics, sensors, and robots. Researchers at Michigan State University report a fatigue&#8208;resistant mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing hydrogel that exhibits reversible, resilient, and predictable color changes under mechanical stress, enabling enhanced tactile sensing of robots for gentle handling of soft and fragile objects. More details can be found in the Research Article by Shaoting Lin and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202407925).

         <title>Designing Physical Unclonable Functions From Optically Active Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assigning unforgeable &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; to manufactured goods is a key strategy to fight global counterfeiting. Optical physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are chemically generated random patterns of optically active materials serving as unique authenticators. Here, recent advances in optical PUF devices are presented for anticounterfeiting via an overview of available optical taggants and compatible fabrication techniques.








Abstract
Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are artificial &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; provided by physical devices to authenticate manufactured goods. Their inherent unclonable nature positions them as one of the most promising tools to tackle global counterfeiting challenges. Leveraging the large parameter space in solution chemistry, chemically generated PUFs can achieve excellent device performance. Particularly, optically active materials have become valuable security inks thanks to their versatile, non&#8208;invasive, and non&#8208;destructive readouts, and PUF devices generated from stochastic nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;patterns of optical inks hold great potential. This review highlights recent advances in the design of optical PUF devices. A range of resonant and non&#8208;resonant optical materials used as security taggants are presented and their incorporation in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PUF devices is examined using non&#8208;deterministic fabrication techniques. By outlining design criteria, challenges, and opportunities, a roadmap is provided for developing next&#8208;generation PUFs using established and emerging optical probes and help advance security and reliability in anticounterfeiting technologies.

Abstract
The field of nanophotonics has seen remarkable advances, with gold&#8208;based materials standing out. By precisely fine&#8208;tuning the size and shape of metal nanoparticles (NPs), such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), it has been possible to gain control over light interaction, modulating localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), a phenomenon that involves the collective oscillation of free conduction electrons. This has opened the path toward more powerful biomedical applications, including surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and photothermal therapy (PTT). When AuNPs dimensions fall below 2 nm, they become gold nanoclusters (AuNCs), losing the LSPR but acquitting fluorescence due to their molecule&#8208;like behavior. This unique feature makes them ideal for high&#8208;resolution imaging, biomarker detection, and advanced therapies. Beyond traditional uses, the recent inclusion of AuNPs into nanomotors (NMs) enhances precise in vivo tracking and targeted drug delivery. This review highlights the different applications of plasmonic nanomaterials with particular emphasis on AuNPs and AuNCs as a function of their shapes, sizes, and stabilization ligands. Moreover, it dives into the biosensing applications of plasmonic materials by addressing their so&#8208;called far&#8208;field and near&#8208;field optical properties, giving a detailed overview of different high&#8208;sensitivity immunoassays and biosensing. A comprehensive outlook on the evolution of plasmonic&#8208;based materials for the next therapies is provided.

         <title>Unperceivable Designs of Wearable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unperceivable wearable technologies seamlessly integrate into everyone's daily life, for healthcare and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things applications. By remaining completely unnoticed both visually and tactilely, by the user and others, they ensure medical privacy and allow natural social interactions. Herein are introduced recent strategies employed at material, design, and integration levels to reach unperceivable technologies, whether through transparent materials or strategically hidden devices.








Abstract
Wearable smart electronics are taking an increasing part of the consumer electronics market, with applications in advanced healthcare systems, entertainment, and Internet of Things. The advanced development of flexible, stretchable, and breathable electronic materials has paved the way to comfortable and long&#8208;term wearables. However, these devices can affect the wearer's appearance and draw attention during use, which may impact the wearer's confidence and social interactions, making them difficult to wear on a daily basis. Apart from comfort, one key condition for user acceptance is that these new technologies seamlessly integrate into our daily lives, remaining unperceivable to others. In this review, strategies to minimize the visual impact of wearable devices and make them more suitable for daily use are discussed. These new devices focus on being unperceivable when worn and comfortable enough that users almost forget their presence, reducing psychological discomfort while maintaining accuracy in signal collection. Materials selection is crucial for developing long&#8208;term and unperceivable wearable devices. Recent developments in these unperceivable electronic devices are also covered, including sensors, transistors, and displays, and mechanisms to achieve unperceivability are discussed. Finally, the potential applications are summarized and the remaining challenges and prospects are discussed.

         <title>Selective Lipolysis by Photoactivation of Chaperone&#8208;Mediated Autophagy Using Adipocyte Membrane&#8208;Coated Nanoparticle in Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adipocyte membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles loaded with rosiglitazone in hydrogel offer an alternative approach to conventional obesity treatments. This system selectively targets adipocytes, inducing lipolysis by activating chaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy through mild photothermal stimulation. Demonstrating significant weight loss in animal models, this nanomaterial&#8208;based strategy holds promise for obesity management and other autophagy&#8208;related disorders.








Abstract
Despite the clinical importance of obesity, treatments have been confined to surgery or drugs, both of which carry adverse effects. Herein a nanomaterial consisting of adipocyte membrane&#8208;coated and rosiglitazone&#8208;loaded polydopamine nanoparticles embedded in hydrogel (ARNP&#8208;H) is designed aiming to induce selective lipolysis in adipocyte through activation of chaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy (CMA) by mild photothermal heat stress. Adipocyte membrane&#8208;coated and rosiglitazone&#8208;loaded polydopamine nanoparticles (ARNP) are taken up by adipocyte to a significantly greater extent than other cell membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles. Adipocyte interactions with ARNP are significantly higher than those with other cells such as macrophages and T cells. ARNP&#8208;H enabled selective activation of CMA in adipocytes, increasing levels of heat shock cognate protein 70, a key component of CMA. Colocalization of heat shock cognate protein 70 and breakdown of CMA substrate perilipin 2, led to enhancement of adipose triglyceride lipase access to lipid droplets, initiating lipolysis. In high&#8208;fat diet&#8208;fed mice, ARNP&#8208;H retention at the local injection site is greater than in other groups, maintaining photothermal responsiveness for over 3 days. ARNP&#8208;H treatment significantly enhanced adipocyte lipolysis and led to substantial weight loss. While this study focuses on obesity model, ARNP&#8208;H for CMA photoactivation holds potential for treating other diseases associated with autophagy dysregulation.

         <title>Wideband Tuning and Deep&#8208;Tissue Spectral Detection of Indium Phosphide Nano&#8208;Laser Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces indium phosphide (InP) nanolaser particles operating in the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;I (NIR&#8208;I) spectrum, with ultrawide tunability (740&#8211;970&#160;nm) and nanometer&#8208;scale linewidths. Optimized for deep&#8208;tissue imaging and multiplexed barcoding, these particles offer excellent stability, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios in scattering media, and biocompatibility, making them highly promising for advanced biomedical research and applications.








Abstract
Laser particles (LPs) emitting narrowband spectra across wide spectral ranges are highly promising for high&#8208;multiplex optical barcoding of biological cells. Here, LPs based on indium phosphide (InP) nanodisks are presented, operating in the near&#8208;infrared wavelength range of 740&#8211;970&#160;nm. Utilizing low&#8208;order whispering gallery resonance modes in size&#8208;tuned nanodisks, an ultrawide color palette with 25% spectral utilization and nanometer&#8208;scale linewidth is achieved. A simple theoretical model accurately predicts spectral ranges based on particle size. The minimum laser size is 430&#160;nm in air and 560&#160;nm within cells, operating at mode orders of 4 or 5. The high brightness and narrow linewidths of polymer&#8208;silica&#8208;protected InP LPs, combined with a silicon&#8208;detector spectrometer, enable spectral detection of laser peaks with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios in highly&#8208;scattering media, including 1&#8208;cm&#8208;thick chicken breast tissue and blood vessels in live mice.

         <title>Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Mechanoresponsive Color&#8208;Changing Hydrogels for Vision&#8208;Based Tactile Robots</title>

         <dc:description>
Mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing materials that can reversibly and resiliently change color in response to stress are highly desirable for diverse technologies in optics, sensors, and robots; however, such materials are rarely achieved. This work reports a fatigue&#8208;resistant mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing hydrogel that exhibits reversible, resilient, and predictable color changes under mechanical stress, for tactile robots by translating tactile sensations into visual images.









Abstract
Mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing materials that can&#160;reversibly&#160;and resiliently change color in response to mechanical deformation are highly desirable for diverse modern technologies in optics, sensors, and robots; however, such materials are rarely achieved. Here, a fatigue&#8208;resistant mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing hydrogel (FMCH) is reported that exhibits reversible, resilient, and predictable color changes under mechanical stress. At its undeformed state, the FMCH remains dark under a circular polariscope; upon uniaxial stretching of up to six times its initial length, it gradually shifts its color from black, to gray, yellow, and purple. Unlike traditional mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing materials, FMCH maintains its performance across various strain rates for up to 10 000 cycles. Moreover, FMCH demonstrates superior mechanical properties with fracture toughness of 3000 J m&#8722;2, stretchability of 6, and fatigue threshold up to 400 J m&#8722;2. These exceptional mechanical and optical features are attributed to FMCH's substantial molecular entanglements and desirable hygroscopic salts, which synergistically enhance its mechanical toughness while preserving its color&#8208;changing performance. One application of this FMCH as a tactile sensoris then demonstrated for vision&#8208;based tactile robots, enabling them to discern material stiffness, object shape, spatial location, and applied pressure by translating stress distribution on the contact surface into discernible images.

         <title>Multifunctional Neural Probes Enable Bidirectional Electrical, Optical, and Chemical Recording and Stimulation In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Convergence drawing is used to create flexible, microscale, multifunctional fiber&#8208;based neural probes. Optimized materials selection enables individual devices to perform neural recording, electrical stimulation, optogenetics, fiber photometry, fluid delivery, and voltammetric neurotransmitter detection in rodents. These bidirectional tools may permit multimodal interrogation of neural signaling across multiple brain regions in mechanistic and translational studies.








Abstract
Recording and modulation of neuronal activity enables the study of brain function in health and disease. While translational neuroscience relies on electrical recording and modulation techniques, mechanistic studies in rodent models leverage genetic precision of optical methods, such as optogenetics and fluorescent indicator imaging. In addition to electrical signal transduction, neurons produce and receive diverse chemical signals which motivate tools to probe and modulate neurochemistry. Although the past decade has delivered a wealth of technologies for electrophysiology, optogenetics, chemical sensing, and optical recording, combining these modalities within a single platform remains challenging. This work leverages materials selection and convergence fiber drawing to permit neural recording, electrical stimulation, optogenetics, fiber photometry, drug and gene delivery, and voltammetric recording of neurotransmitters within individual fibers. Composed of polymers and non&#8208;magnetic carbon&#8208;based conductors, these fibers are compatible with magnetic resonance imaging, enabling concurrent stimulation and whole&#8208;brain monitoring. Their utility is demonstrated in studies of the mesolimbic reward pathway by interfacing with the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens in mice and characterizing the neurophysiological effects of a stimulant drug. This study highlights the potential of these fibers to probe electrical, optical, and chemical signaling across multiple brain regions in both mechanistic and translational studies.

         <title>Deeply Implantable, Shape&#8208;Morphing, 3D MicroLEDs for Pancreatic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work is deeply implantable, shape&#8208;morphing 3D microLEDs (SMLED) for mPDT, tailored to solid pancreatic tumor models with irregular and dynamically changing sizes. The device, based on a shape morphing, enables tumor&#8208;specific and continuous light irradiation. This approach results in significant PDAC volume reduction and modifications within the tumor microenvironment without adverse effects on surrounding tissues. This work represents a promising advancement in anticancer phototherapy, offering a safe, adaptable, and targeted approach for mPDT that can adjust to tumor volume changes.








Abstract
Controlled photooxidation&#8208;mediated disruption of collagens in the tumor microenvironment can reduce desmoplasia and enhance immune responsiveness. However, achieving effective light delivery to solid tumors, particularly those with dynamic volumetric changes like pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), remains challenging and limits the repeated and sustained photoactivation of drugs. Here, 3D, shape&#8208;morphing, implantable photonic devices (IPDs) are introduced that enable tumor&#8208;specific and continuous light irradiation for effective metronomic photodynamic therapy (mPDT). This IPD adheres seamlessly to the surface of orthotopic PDAC tumors, mitigating issues related to mechanical mismatch, delamination, and internal lesions. In freely moving mouse models, mPDT using the IPD with close adhesion significantly reduces desmoplastic tumor volume without causing cytotoxic effects in healthy tissues. These promising in vivo results underscore the potential of an adaptable and unidirectional IPD design in precisely targeting cancerous organs, suggesting a meaningful advance in light&#8208;based therapeutic technologies.

         <title>Robust Full&#8208;Surface Bonding of Substrate and Electrode for Ultra&#8208;Flexible Sensor Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct hybrid bonding method that enables both gold and parylene bonding without adhesives is developed. This technique achieves full&#8208;surface direct bonding of electrodes and substrates in flexible electronic connections. The method offers high flexibility, stable mechanical durability, and high&#8208;resolution interconnections, accommodating varying electrode shapes and sizes in flexible electronic applications.








Abstract
The integration of multiple flexible electronics is crucial for the development of ultra&#8208;flexible wearable and implantable devices. To fabricate an integrated system, robust and flexible bonding throughout the connection area, irrespective of the electrode or substrate, is needed. Conventional methods for flexible direct bonding have primarily been confined to metal electrodes or substrate&#8208;only bonding due to varying material properties. Consequently, the mechanical and electrical properties of the connections deteriorate based on their shape and size. This study introduces a bonding technique for wearable electronics, achieving strong, flexible connections between materials like gold and parylene at a low temperature (85&#160;&#176;C). This hybrid direct bonding method ensures strong bonding across both the Au electrode and parylene substrate within electronic interconnections. Additionally, a 3D&#8208;stacked flexible structure that maintains robustness and high flexibility without an adhesive layer is successfully developed. An ultrathin photoplethysmography sensor developed by stacking an ultrathin organic photodetector atop an organic light&#8208;emitting diode is demonstrated. Unlike traditional methods requiring adhesives or high pressure, this approach maintains flexibility essential for deformation, withstanding bending at a radius of 0.5&#160;mm. The technique's robustness suggests promising applications in durable, ultra&#8208;flexible electronics integration.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration of multiple flexible electronics is crucial for the development of ultra-flexible wearable and implantable devices. To fabricate an integrated system, robust and flexible bonding throughout the connection area, irrespective of the electrode or substrate, is needed. Conventional methods for flexible direct bonding have primarily been confined to metal electrodes or substrate-only bonding due to varying material properties. Consequently, the mechanical and electrical properties of the connections deteriorate based on their shape and size. This study introduces a bonding technique for wearable electronics, achieving strong, flexible connections between materials like gold and parylene at a low temperature (85&#160;&#176;C). This hybrid direct bonding method ensures strong bonding across both the Au electrode and parylene substrate within electronic interconnections. Additionally, a 3D-stacked flexible structure that maintains robustness and high flexibility without an adhesive layer is successfully developed. An ultrathin photoplethysmography sensor developed by stacking an ultrathin organic photodetector atop an organic light-emitting diode is demonstrated. Unlike traditional methods requiring adhesives or high pressure, this approach maintains flexibility essential for deformation, withstanding bending at a radius of 0.5&#160;mm. The technique's robustness suggests promising applications in durable, ultra-flexible electronics integration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Upconversion Nanoparticle&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework Core&#8211;shell Particles as Therapeutic Microrobots Trackable With Optoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upconversion nanoparticle&#8208;covalent organic framework core&#8211;shell particles provide enhanced contrast for optoacoustic imaging by leveraging the optical absorption of upconversion luminescence within the covalent organic framework matrix. Beyond their role as contrast agents, these particles enable customizable therapeutic agent loading and release, as well as magnetic microrobotic steering within vascular environments.








Abstract
Despite the development of various medical imaging contrast agents, integrating contrast signal generation with therapeutic and microrobotic functions remains challenging without complicated fabrication processes. In this study, upconversion nanoparticle&#8208;covalent organic framework (UCNP&#8208;COF) core&#8211;shell sub&#8208;micron particles are developed that function as therapeutic microrobots trackable with multi&#8208;spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging and can be loaded with desired therapeutic molecular agents in a customizable manner. The mechanism of optoacoustic signal generation in UCNP&#8208;COF particles is attributed to the quenching of upconversion luminescence emitted by the UCNPs, which is absorbed by the encapsulating COF and subsequently converted into acoustic waves. Unlike other microparticulate agents previously imaged with MSOT, UCNP&#8208;COF particles do not pose concerns about their stability and biocompatibility. Simultaneously, the mesoporous texture of the COF provides a large surface area, allowing for the efficient loading of various drug molecules, which can be released at target sites. Furthermore, the magnetic UCNP&#8208;COF Janus particles can be magnetically navigated through in vivo vasculature while being visualized in real&#8208;time with volumetric MSOT. This study proposes an approach to design photonic materials with multifunctionality, enabling high&#8208;performance medical imaging, drug delivery, and microrobotic manipulation toward their future potential clinical use.

This Perspective covers photonic nanomaterials and devices currently used in photobiomodulation and optogenetics for digitally controlled neurostimulation, providing the potential for neuro&#8208;immune interactions.








Abstract
The nervous and immune systems are closely interconnected, and influence the onset and progress of various diseases. Accordingly, understanding the interaction of the neural system and the immune system becomes very important for the treatment of intractable diseases with the analysis of therapeutic mechanisms, such as autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and so on. The conventional immunomodulation treatments have been mainly carried out by drug administration, but they have suffered from systemic negative side&#8208;effects with only limited effects on the specific disease. In this Perspective, photonic nanomaterials and devices are reviewed and discussed for digitally controlled neurostimulating photomedicine via photobiomodulation and optogenetics from the unique viewpoint of neuro&#8208;immune cross&#8208;talks. The prospects and perspectives to integrate photonic nanomaterials with advanced wearable and implantable healthcare devices are also provided and highlighted to revolutionize the therapeutic strategies by the interaction of neural and immune systems, and optimize the treatment protocols for futuristic digital photomedicine. This approach will revolutionize the fields of neurostimulation and immune regulation for further clinical applications.

Alleviating Atherosclerosis via Sonocatalytic Therapy
A dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking and ultrasound&#8208;responsive Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG nanozyme efficiently eliminates ROS in the atherosclerotic microenvironment and performs anti&#8208;inflammatory capability under ultrasound irradiation. Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG&#8208;mediated sonocatalytic therapy (SCT) exerts an outstanding anti&#8208;atherosclerosis efficacy by regulating intraplaque redox homeostasis, contributing to lesional shrinkage and a more stable plaque phenotype in plaque&#8208;bearing mice. More details can be found in the Research Article by Jianhua Hao and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202420189).

         <title>Engineering Framework Materials in Water Systems for Targeted Ion Extraction and Spontaneous Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through comprehensive analysis of framework materials in ion extraction, osmotic energy conversion, and evaporative energy harvesting, this review establishes interdisciplinary connections centered on ion&#8208;selective transport mechanisms across these applications and identifies critical challenges and knowledge gaps in existing studies.








Abstract
Developing techniques that can extract required salt resources and harvest spontaneous energy from natural water environment is essential to promote the global decarbonization and electrification. Construction of advanced framework materials with intrinsic nanochannels has been considered the most promising solution to implement this technique owing to the specific fluid transport performances in such confined space. However, this design requires a deep understanding of the structural properties of framework material nanochannels in different scenarios, as well as the corresponding construction strategies. Consequently, it is an urgent necessity to elucidate the specific ion capture behavior and fluid transport mechanism in these framework materials to build targeted nanofluidic systems for guiding developments in water related resources and energy acquisition technologies. Herein, the recent advances in ion extraction and energy harvesting based on metal&#8208;organic framework and covalent&#8208;organic framework materials have been outlined, along with the discussion about the nanochannels specificity by combining ions and fluid properties and nanochannel structures. Finally, an outlook to trends, challenges and emerging opportunities is given to foresee the future developments in this important field.

It introduces fundamental components, discusses strategies for spatial and spatiotemporal modulation of magnetization in magnetic soft materials, and highlights representative applications in fluid manipulation, biomedical engineering, and wearable electronics. The outlook section emphasizes future opportunities for advanced magnetization modulation technologies in magnetic soft materials.








Abstract
Recent decades have witnessed significant advancements in the exploration of magnetic soft materials, driven by diverse fabrication techniques and the demands of various applications. This progress can mainly be attributed to the unique properties of magnetic soft materials, including their untethered and low&#8208;latency manipulation characteristics as well as mechanical compliance. Spatiotemporal magnetization modulation is fundamentally crucial in magnetic soft materials, as it governs the magnetic body forces and torques for self&#8208;actuation, as well as the generation of magnetic fields for external interaction. Despite remarkable progress in magnetic soft materials, a comprehensive review focusing on spatiotemporal magnetization modulation is lacking. This review begins by introducing fundamental components of magnetic soft materials and then explores various strategies for achieving spatial and spatiotemporal modulation of magnetization. Finally, an overview is provided of the typical applications in fluid manipulation, biomedical engineering, and wearable electronics based on magnetization&#8208;modulated magnetic soft materials, along with perspectives on future advancements.

         <title>Personal Moisture Management by Advanced Textiles and Intelligent Wearables</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores advancements in personal moisture management (PMM) through advanced textiles and intelligent wearables, evolving from traditional methods like wicking and evaporation to cutting&#8208;edge innovations such as directional water transport, stimuli&#8208;responsive textiles, and AI&#8208;driven wearables. It also highlights PMM&#8208;enabled applications in health monitoring, energy harvesting, and thermoregulation, while addressing challenges in durability, scalability, and adaptability with intelligent, sustainable solutions.








Abstract
As global climate change intensifies, personal moisture management (PMM) is increasingly crucial for regulating body temperature and near&#8208;skin humidity, sustaining comfort, health, and productivity. Advances in textile materials and wearable technologies are moving PMM beyond traditional wicking&#8208;drying and waterproof&#8208;breathable designs toward directional sweat transport, stimuli&#8208;responsive control, and integration with personal thermal management (PTM). Advanced textiles and intelligent wearables enable more efficient, adaptive PMM; meanwhile, effective PMM enhances sensing performance and long&#8208;term comfort of wearable systems, and supports sweat&#8208;based health monitoring and energy harvesting, forming closed&#8208;loop, intelligent comfort&#8208;health&#8208;performance ecosystems. This review critically discusses PMM mechanisms and designs from capillary wicking and evaporation/diffusion to directional water transport and responsive moisture regulation, alongside manufacturing strategies spanning advanced fibers, nanoengineering, bioinspired architectures, smart polymers, and wearable electronics. PMM&#8208;enabled implementations in health monitoring and energy harvesting are introduced, and elucidate coupled moisture&#8208;heat transport to guide the co&#8208;optimization of PMM and PTM. Finally, key challenges are outlined, including sweat accumulation, reduced durability and washability, limited manufacturing scalability, and insufficient cross&#8209;scenario adaptability, and offer potential solutions, particularly AI&#8209;enabled pathways for intelligent, sustainable, next&#8209;generation PMM textiles and wearables.

This study reviews the latest advancements in broadband PDs utilizing heterostructures that combine 2D semimetals with materials of various dimensions and highlights their applications in optoelectronics.








Abstract
Hybrid heterostructures are pivotal in the advanced broadband detection technology. The emergence of 2D semimetals has expanded the range of materials in heterostructures beyond conventional narrow&#8208;gap materials for room&#8208;temperature broadband detection applications due to their extraordinary optical and electrical properties. This review outlines the cutting&#8208;edge and latest advancements in broadband photodetectors (PDs) engineered from heterostructures that synergistically combine 2D semimetals with several different dimensional materials. It begins with a fundamental investigation, offering an in&#8208;depth explanation of the essential material properties and a summary of synthesis methodologies. Then, the discussion advances to provide an analytical overview of the categorization, underlying photodetection mechanism, and figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit of these advanced PDs. Subsequently, the narrative shifts to a comprehensive analysis of heterogeneous integrated devices. The review further highlights the diverse optoelectronic applications of broadband PDs, spanning image sensing, optical communication, position&#8208;sensitive detection, integrated sensing and computing, spintronics, and computational spectroscopy are thoroughly highlighted. Finally, the review concludes by addressing the challenges and opportunities in advancing 2D semimetal materials for photodetection.

         <title>Advanced Air Electrodes for Reversible Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) face challenges from sluggish and unstable oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in the air electrode. This review discusses recent progress in triple&#8208;conducting air electrodes, emphasizing mechanisms, performance factors, and design strategies, offering guidance for creating efficient and stable air electrode materials for R&#8208;PCECs.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) have great potential for efficient and clean power generation, energy storage, and sustainable synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals. However, the sluggish and unstable kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the air electrode hinder the R&#8208;PCEC development. Durable H+/e&#8722;/O2&#8722; triple&#8208;conducting air electrode materials are promising for enhancing reaction kinetics and improving catalytical stability. This review synthesizes the recent progress in triple&#8208;conducting air electrodes, focusing on their working mechanisms, including electrode kinetics, lattice and its defect structure in oxides, and the generation and transport processes of H+, O2&#8722;, and e&#8722;. It also examines the required physicochemical properties and their influencing factors. By synthesizing and critically analyzing the latest theoretical frameworks, advanced materials, and regulation strategies, this review outlines the challenges and prospects shaping the future of R&#8208;PCEC technology and air electrode development. Based on these theories and multiple strategies about the bulk triple conducting properties and surface chemical states, this review provides practical guidance for the rational design and development of efficient and stable air electrode materials for R&#8208;PCECs and related electrocatalytic materials.

         <title>Recent Advances in Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ubiquitous defects predominately account for photo&#8208;instability and open&#8208;circuit voltage losses in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (WBG PSCs). This review comprehensively presents the underlying impact mechanisms, summarizes the advanced optimization strategies across various functional layers and their interfaces to develop efficient and stable WBG PSCs, and evaluates their performance in semitransparent solar cells, tandem solar cells, and indoor photovoltaic applications.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered considerable attention of late for their potential as semitransparent photovoltaics for building integration, top&#8208;cells in tandem configurations, and indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, recent investigations have unveiled that underlying defect&#8208;mediated phase segregation, ion migration, lattice strain, and other factors can give rise to self&#8208;accelerated degradation reactions and the contraction of quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting (QFLS) within devices. Extensive efforts have been undertaken to reduce defect densities in bulks, at surfaces, and across interfaces with charge transport layers (CTLs). This review provides a timely and comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic defect ecosystem in WBG perovskites, and mechanistically elucidates their impacts on device stability and open circuit voltage losses. Subsequently, recent advances in defect passivation strategies are cross&#8208;sectionally overviewed, covering various components of devices. The applications of WBG PSCs in semitransparent devices, tandem applications, and IPVs are discussed. Finally, prospects and challenges are proposed, providing insights for future research and technological advancements.

         <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Upconversion Nanoparticles for Emerging NIR Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The special photo&#8208;responsiveness of upconversion nanoparticles has opened up a new path for the advancement of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;responsive optoelectronics. However, challenges such as low energy&#8208;conversion efficiency and high nonradiative losses still persist. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between materials properties and device performance, offering both theoretical and empirical guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance NIR optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), incorporating lanthanide (Ln) dopants, can convert low&#8208;energy near&#8208;infrared photons into higher&#8208;energy visible or ultraviolet light through nonlinear energy transfer processes. This distinctive feature has attracted considerable attention in both fundamental research and advanced optoelectronics. Challenges such as low energy&#8208;conversion efficiency and nonradiative losses limit the performance of UCNP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. Recent advancements including optimized core&#8211;shell structures, tailed Ln&#8208;doping concentration, and surface modifications show significant promise for improving the efficiency and stability. In addition, combining UCNPs with functional materials can broaden their applications and improve device performance, paving the way for the innovation of next&#8208;generation optoelectronics. This paper first categorizes and elaborates on various upconversion mechanisms in UCNPs, focusing on strategies to boost energy transfer efficiency and prolong luminescence. Subsequently, an in&#8208;depth discussion of the various materials that can enhance the efficiency of UCNPs and expand their functionality is provided. Furthermore, a wide range of UCNP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices is explored, and multiple emerging applications in UCNP&#8208;based neuromorphic computing are highlighted. Finally, the existing challenges and potential solutions involved in developing practical UCNPs optoelectronic devices are considered, as well as an outlook on the future of UCNPs in advanced technologies is provided.

         <title>Advancements in Carbon&#8208;Based Piezoelectric Materials: Mechanism, Classification, and Applications in Energy Science</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials are systematically categorized based on their structural and functional properties. The mechanisms of stress&#8208;induced charge transfer are elucidated, and their applications are explored across three key domains: piezoelectric catalysis for energy conversion and environmental remediation, piezoelectric biomedical treatments for tissue regeneration and antitumor therapies, and piezoelectric generators and sensors for energy harvesting and advanced sensing technologies.








Abstract
The piezoelectric phenomenon has garnered considerable interest due to its distinctive physical properties associated with the materials involved. Piezoelectric materials, which are inherently non&#8208;centrosymmetric, can generate an internal electric field under mechanical stress, enhancing carrier separation and transfer due to electric dipole moments. While inorganic piezoelectric materials are often investigated for their high piezoelectric coefficients, they come with potential drawbacks such as toxicity and high production cost, which hinder their practical applications. Consequently, carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials have emerged as an alternative to inorganic materials, boasting advantages such as a large specific surface area, high conductivity, flexibility, and eco&#8208;friendliness. Research into the applications of carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials spans environmental remediation, energy conversion, and biomedical treatments, indicating a promising future. This review marks the first comprehensive attempt to discuss and summarize the various types of carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials. It delves into the underlying mechanisms by which piezoelectricity influences catalysis, biomedical applications, nanogenerators, and sensors. Additionally, various potential techniques are presented to enhance the piezoelectric performance. The design principles of representative fabrication strategies for carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials are analyzed, emphasizing their current limitations and potential improvements for future development. It is believed that recent advances in carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials will make a significant impact.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategies achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are summarized and analyzed from both their separate advancements and the integrated effectiveness in this review. Then, perspectives are given for valuable guidance for further development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are emerging as a promising energy storage technique supplementary to Li&#8208;ion batteries, attracting much research attention owing to their intrinsic safety, cost economy, and environmental friendliness. However, energy densities for AZIBs still do not fulfill practical requirements because of the low specific and areal capacity, limited working potential, and excessive negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive electrode capacity (N/P) ratio. In this review, a comprehensive overview of basic requirements and major challenges for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density AZIBs is provided. Following that, recent progress in the optimization of each component and the overall configuration is summarized, and crucial design principles are discussed. Apart from conventional emphasis on each part, especially cathode materials, separately, the comprehensive discussion about the synergistic interactions among all components is conducted. Finally, the outlook and research direction are given to provide valuable guidance for the further holistic development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Harnessing Synergistic Cooperation of Neighboring Active Motifs in Heterogeneous Catalysts for Enhanced Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the critical role of neighboring active motifs in heterogeneous catalysts, emphasizing how their synergistic cooperativity can be rationally designed to modulate catalytic properties. The discussion centers on the modulation of electronic and geometric structures, categorizing the catalytic systems into metal&#8208;acid (Br&#248;nsted/Lewis) pairs, metal&#8208;base pairs, and metal&#8208;metal pairs. The goal is to provide a systematic overview that offers insights into the design and characterization of next&#8208;generation multifunctional catalysts.








Abstract
Understanding the intricate interplay between catalytically active motifs in heterogeneous catalysts has long posed a significant challenge in the design of highly active and selective reactions. Drawing inspiration from biological enzymes and homogeneous catalysts, the synergistic cooperation between neighboring active motifs has emerged as a crucial factor in achieving effective catalysis. This synergistic control is often observed in natural enzymes and homogeneous systems through ligand coordination. The synergistic interaction is especially vital in reactions involving tandem or cascade steps, where distinct active motifs provide different functionalities to enable the co&#8208;activation of the reaction substrate(s). Situated within a 3D spatial domain, these catalytically active motifs can shape favorable catalytic landscapes by modulating electronic and geometric characteristics, thereby stabilizing specific intermediate or transition state species in a specific catalytic reaction. In this review, we aim to explore a diverse array of the latest heterogeneous catalytic systems that capitalize on the synergistic cooperativity between neighboring active motifs. We will delve into how such synergistic interactions can be utilized to engineer more favorable catalytic landscapes, ultimately resulting in the modulation of catalytic reactivities.

Nature offers numerous examples of unique characteristics developed over thousands of years, providing inspiration for the next generation of textile design. This paper provides a comprehensive review of some advanced bionic textile materials, including structural color textiles, superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic textiles, thermal and moisture management textiles, wearable electronic textiles, and environmental&#8208;remediation textiles. The bionic principles are emphasized, the novelty of bionic design is highlighted, and the results of different bionic designs are also compared. Finally, the challenges, perspectives, and sustainability in these fields are also discussed. This review aims to facilitate a systematic and in&#8208;depth understanding of the bionic approach toward textiles.

         <title>Bioinspired Design of Heterogenous Single&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Site Catalysts for Electrocatalysis and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review gives a summary on the representative bioinspired single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SACs) and their applications in heterogeneous electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. The fundamentals of bioinspired design strategies are systematically discussed in the context of the first shell coordination, the second/long&#8208;range coordination, and the outer microenvironment. The applications of SACs in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis as inspired by natural enzymes are discussed.








Abstract
The emergence of single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SACs) provides a specific model to bridge the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. An interesting aspect in SACs is how to apply the bioinspired strategies in homogeneous biocatalysis to the design of heterogeneous SACs. The effectiveness of this approach relies on systematic insights in structural characteristics and catalytic mechanisms of both the biocatalysts and the heterogeneous SACs. This review will give a summary on the representative bioinspired single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts and their applications in heterogeneous electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. The fundamentals of bioinspired design strategies will be systematically discussed in the first shell coordination (quasi&#8208;homogeneous metal centers and coordination numbers/species) and the second/long&#8208;range coordination (heteroatoms doping, dual&#8208;metallic sites, nano&#8208;single&#8208;atom&#8208;site, and metal&#8208;support interaction). Also, the unique non&#8208;covalent interactions and oriented mass/proton/electron transfer channels in heterogenous SACs are highlighted as inspired by the outer microenvironment of biological systems. The practical electrocatalytic and photocatalytic applications of bioinspired SACs are further discussed by drawing inspiration from hydrogenase, nitrogenase, oxidase, and dehydrogenase to produce hydrogen&#8208;, carbon&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, and oxygen&#8208;based value&#8208;added chemicals. The current challenges and future opportunities for the development of bioinspired heterogenous SACs will also be discussed.

         <dc:description>
Recent advances in ionic conductive textiles for wearable technology are summarized, with a focus on soft ionic conductors that exhibit skin&#8208;like flexibility and tissue&#8208;like ion dynamics. Their structures, key characteristics, manufacturing methods, and diverse applications are reviewed. Future challenges in sustainability, wearability, fabrication, and electronic integration are discussed, highlighting their potential in healthcare and interactive clothing.








Abstract
Soft ionic conductors, characterized by their inherent flexibility and tissue&#8208;like ion dynamics, are ideal for intimate applications such as wearable electronics for sensing, energy harvesting, signal transmission, and bioelectronics applications. Shaping ionic conductors into fiber and textile formats (i.e., ionic conductive textiles) to replace the focus on rigid electron&#8208;based conductors heralds a transformative technology in wearable electronics and smart textiles, offering advantages that align with human&#8208;device compatibility, wearability, and sustainability demands. In this review, the category of ionic conductors, the essential characteristics of ionic conductors, the methodologies for the fabrication and integration of ionic conductive textiles, and the diverse applications of these textile&#8208;based soft ionic conductors are summarized. By providing perspectives and raising potential challenges on the future design and development of ionic conductive textiles in terms of sustainability, wearability, fabrication strategies, and integration with electrical systems, this review aims to highlight the potential of ionic conductors as key components for the next generation of wearable technologies and electronic textiles.

         <dc:description>
Protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) are a promising intermediate&#8208;temperature hydrogen production technology, leveraging high proton conductivity in electrolytes yet constrained by insufficient catalytic activity and interfacial instability in fuel/air electrodes. This review systematically categorizes advanced electrode materials and critically evaluates optimization strategies, including doping, interface engineering, and microstructure control, to enhance their catalytic activity and durability.








Abstract
Protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) exhibit superior proton conductivity under intermediate&#8208;temperature operation (300&#8211;600&#160;&#176;C), emerging as a promising water electrolysis technology compared to traditional low&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;conducting polymer electrolysis and high&#8208;temperature oxygen ion&#8208;conducting oxide electrolysis. However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and electrode instability in PCECs hinder their large&#8208;scale development. This review highlights recent advancements in PCEC technology, emphasizing its thermodynamic and kinetic advantages, the categorization of advanced electrode materials, and material regulation strategies, including chemical doping, microstructural engineering, and multiphase design to improve their catalytic performance and stability. Additionally, the current challenges are discussed and future research directions are outlined for advanced PCEC electrode materials. By summarizing recent advancements in electrode materials and their optimization strategies, this review provides valuable insights into the rational design of efficient and stable electrode materials, advancing PCEC technology for green hydrogen production.

In addition, future perspectives are discussed to guide the advancement of OPVs toward higher efficiency and enhanced stability.








Abstract
Solar energy is the most promising and ultimate renewable energy resource, and silicon photovoltaic technology has gone through exciting growth globally. Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) provide solar energy solutions for application scenarios different from existing PV technologies. The organic PV technology, with the synergetic progress in the past decades, has now reached 20% power conversion efficiency (PCE), which has the potential to empower serious new applications using the unique features of OPV&#8212;light weight, colorful, semitransparent, flexibility, etc. The concise review focuses on recent device engineering progress in OPV technologies. The background of OPV devices and materials, especially recent nonfullerene acceptors, will first be presented; then, in the recent device engineering progress, the focus will be on active layer engineering to control the morphology of OPV, leading to recent 19%&#8211;20% efficiency. The parallel progress in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) and sequential layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer approaches will be summarized. The transparent OPV (TOPV) devices are of great interest with unique features and provide the broadest design space among all solar technologies. This work reviews the TOPV progress covering the active layer and transparent optical structure designs. The future research directions in OPV are discussed with perspective.

         <title>Progress and Prospect for Conducting Polymer Fibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, conducting polymer fibers (CPFs) are examined along five lines: classification based on raw materials, dispersion behaviors, fabrication methods, multilevel structure&#8208;performance correlations, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications as flexible and wearable electronics. A deep discussion on the dependence of overall performance on the multilevel structure is presented. Finally, existing challenges, possible solutions, and potential applications of CPFs are discussed.








Abstract
The integration of plastic&#8208;like mechanical flexibility and metal&#8208;level electrical conductivity makes conducting polymer fibers (CPFs) find extensive uses, covering from lightweight conductors to wearable devices. Preceding conventional conductors, the additional combination of unique electrochemical activity and biocompatibility guides CPF to promise a new era of fibrous and textile electronics. Intriguing performance of CPFs roots in the intrinsic properties of conducting polymers, but is also highly related to the multilevel structures of chain aggregates. This fundamental structure&#8208;performance relationship deserves a deep discussion to understand the dramatically increasing achievements in both research and products. Herein, the latest research on CPFs is reviewed to introduce their classification, fabrication methods, and performance. Then, the structure&#8208;performance correlations of reported CPFs are presented to understand the dependence of overall properties on multilevel structures. Further, recent developments regarding the microstructural control and performance optimization of CPFs are discussed as well as their frontier applications in wearable systems, energy converters, and biological probes. Finally, existing challenges, possible solutions, and potential applications of CPFs are prospected. This review can provide helpful guidance for manufacturing ideally structured high&#8208;performance CPFs for advanced flexible electronics.

         <title>Plaque&#8208;Targeted Delivery of Fluoride&#8208;Free MXene Nanozyme for Alleviating Atherosclerosis via Sonocatalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work has developed a dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking and ultrasound&#8208;responsive Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG nanozyme. ROS&#8208;eliminating and anti&#173;inflammatory capability of Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG under US irradiation are demonstrated on macrophages and endothelial cells in vitro. Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG&#8208;mediated sonocatalytic therapy exerts an outstanding anti&#8208;atherosclerosis efficacy by regulating intraplaque redox homeostasis, contributing to lesional shrinkage and a more stable plaque phenotype in plaque&#8208;bearing mice.








Abstract
Atherosclerosis is an oxidative stress&#8208;induced chronic inflammatory condition underpinning the progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), ultimately resulting in leading mortality rate globally. Ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered catalysis offers localized treatment for deep&#8208;seated plaques effectively and safely, with demand for targeted delivery and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties of sonosensitizers. 2D MXene&#8208;based nanomedicine is garnering attention because of their intriguing catalytic properties of scavenging excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), yet MXene&#8208;assisted sonocatalytic therapy (SCT) for treating CVDs remains scarce. Here, this study reports a dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking and US&#8208;responsive MXene termed Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG for alleviating atherosclerosis. US irradiation enhances the capability of Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG nanozymes in eliminating broad&#8208;spectrum ROS and resolving vascular inflammation. Besides, actively targeting lesional macrophages improves their systemic delivery to plaque and further boosts anti&#8208;atherosclerotic efficacy, contributing to &#8776;30% plaque size reduction and a more stabilized plaque phenotype. Notably, etching without hydrofluoric acid renders this nanozyme highly biocompatible. In long&#8208;term biosafety studies, Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG is pronouncedly cleared from major organs and no severe changes of liver and kidney functions are observed. Consequently, this work demonstrates that Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG&#8208;mediated SCT effectively ameliorates advanced atherosclerosis without inducing severe cytotoxicity, offering promising translational potential of MXene&#8208;based nanomedicine. Besides, it broadens application prospects of MXenes to the biomedical field of treating CVDs.

Besides, actively targeting lesional macrophages improves their systemic delivery to plaque and further boosts anti-atherosclerotic efficacy, contributing to &#8776;30% plaque size reduction and a more stabilized plaque phenotype. Notably, etching without hydrofluoric acid renders this nanozyme highly biocompatible. In long-term biosafety studies, Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C-Pt@HA-PEG is pronouncedly cleared from major organs and no severe changes of liver and kidney functions are observed. Consequently, this work demonstrates that Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C-Pt@HA-PEG-mediated SCT effectively ameliorates advanced atherosclerosis without inducing severe cytotoxicity, offering promising translational potential of MXene-based nanomedicine. Besides, it broadens application prospects of MXenes to the biomedical field of treating CVDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Active Fabric Origami Enabled by Digital Embroidery of Magnetic Yarns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a scalable textile manufacturing process that fabricates active origami fabrics (AFO) via digital embroidery of magnetic yarns. The programmable AFO exhibits reversible 2D and 3D transformations under magnetic fields, enabling functionalities such as altering surface roughness and linear actuation. These reversible deformation fabrics show promising potential for diverse applications in smart textiles and wearable devices.








Abstract
Active fabrics can perform deformations such as contraction, expansion, and bending when exposed to external stimuli. Origami, the ancient art of paper folding, transforms a 2D sheet into a complex 3D structure. However, integrating origami&#8208;inspired designs into active fabrics presents significant challenges, including the large&#8208;scale production of stimuli&#8208;responsive yarns that can be processed using standard textile techniques to achieve intricate origami patterns with high precision and versatility. In this work, the large&#8208;scale fabrication of magnetic yarns featuring high magnetic susceptibility, mechanical strength, and flexibility is reported, which is enabled by processing magnetic polymer composites with a series of textile engineering processes. Utilizing digital embroidery, these magnetic yarns are programmed into origami patterns with predefined yarn alignments on flexible fabrics to create various active fabric origami structures that are mechanical durable and functional consistent. These structures can reversibly transform among shapes in response to specific magnetic fields, enabling a range of functionalities such as altering surface roughness, delivering linear actuation, mimicking flower blooming, and providing switchable thermal insulation. The novel active fabric origami provides promising smart platforms across areas as diverse as smart textiles, soft robotics, wearable devices, and fashion.

         <title>Ultrastable Calcium Metal Anodes Enabled by a Strongly Coordinated Electrolyte Derived Bilayer Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring reliable electrolytes and constructing favorable SEI structure are pivotal for advancing calcium metal batteries. A strongly solvated and alkaxyborate anion mediated electrolyte demonstrates ultra&#8208;stable Ca metal anodes for over 1450&#160;h. This electrolyte derives an organic (outer)&#8208;inorganic (inner) bi&#8208;layered SEI that facilitates Ca ion migration for Ca metal plating/stripping reactions.








Abstract
Calcium (Ca) metal battery is a promising alternative to current lithium battery chemistry due to the high crustal abundance of Ca element and potentially dendrite&#8208;free cycling of high&#8208;capacity Ca metal anodes. However, reversible Ca metal stripping and plating have been hindered by the lack of effective electrolytes and the formation of obstructive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. Here a strongly coordinated electrolyte system by incorporating LiB(hfip)4 into Ca[B(hfip)4]2/glyme solutions is introduced. The highly coordinated glyme molecules and B(hfip)4&#8722; anions are ready to decompose into organic rich compounds and CaH2, CaB2O4 nanocrystals in the SEI layers on Ca metal surface. Transmission electron microscopy observations reveal that these ionically conductive inorganic particles are embedded beneath the organic&#8208;rich outer layer, thus forming a bilayer SEI configuration. This unique structure facilitates efficient Ca&#8208;ion transfer while preventing further electrolyte decomposition. Effectiveness of this electrolyte is evidenced by the ultrastable Ca//Ca symmetrical cells (over 1450&#160;h with low potentials of &lt;0.5&#160;V vs. Ca/Ca2+ at a high current density of 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and the high&#8208;energy Ca//polyaniline full cells (energy densities of above 200&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 over 200 cycles), which set new benchmarks in the field of room&#8208;temperature Ca metal batteries.

         <title>Upper Layer&#8208;Modulated Pseudo Planar Heterojunction with Metal Complex Acceptor for Efficient and Stable Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal complex acceptor (MCA), PtAC&#8208;Cl, is synthesized and incorporated into the upper host acceptor layer of PM6/Y6 to regulate morphology and fill trap states. A high PCE of 18.16% in PM6/Y6:PtAC&#8208;Cl devices is achieved with a T80 lifetime of &#8776;401 h under continuous illumination at MPP tracking and 1265 h under continuous heating at 70&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Modulating self&#8208;aggregation and charge transport in the upper acceptor layer of the pseudo planar heterojunction (PPHJ) is crucial for enhancing dielectric constant and suppressing trap density, leading to efficient and stable organic photovoltaics (OPVs). In this work, a metal complex acceptor (MCA), PtAC&#8208;Cl, is selectively incorporated into the upper host Y6 layer of PPHJ to regulate morphology and fill trap states. There exists a strong chemical interaction between PtAC&#8208;Cl and Y6, which can promote electron transfer. PtAC&#8208;Cl can regulate the self&#8208;aggregation and extend the exciton diffusion length of Y6, resulting in enhanced charge transport and reduced energetic disorder. Consequently, upper layer&#8208;modulated PPHJ devices with PtAC&#8208;Cl achieved a significant power conversion efficiency of 18.16%. The universality of PtAC&#8208;Cl is also demonstrated in PM6/eC9 and PM6/L8&#8208;BO systems, achieving the highest PCEs of 18.79 and 19.30%, respectively. All the improved PCEs are mainly attributed to the enhanced fill factor (FF) and short circuit current (Jsc) compared with the controls. Additionally, PtAC&#8208;Cl significantly improves the thermal stability and photostability of the devices, with a T80 lifetime of &#8776; 401 h under continuous illumination with simulated 1&#8208;Sun light and 1265 h under continuous heating at 70&#160;&#176;C. Overall, this work introduces the concept of MCA and proposes a practical and efficient method to enhance the efficiency and stability of OPVs through selective upper&#8208;layer modulation in PPHJ with MCA.

         <title>Cottonseed&#8208;Derived Reusable Bio&#8208;Carbon Gel Ink for DIW Printing Soft Electronic Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reusable carbon&#8208;gel ink, incorporating cottonseed peptone as a natural mediator, enables cross&#8208;linked ionic polymer networks for advanced conductivity, stability, and biocompatibility. Compatible with direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing, it facilitates flexible electronics on polymeric and textile substrates for multifunctional applications, including motion sensing, energy harvesting, and self&#8208;powered pressure detection. Integrated smart e&#8208;textile systems have demonstrated human&#8208;machine interaction for signal translation and robotic manipulation.








Abstract
Soft electronics textiles have garnered global attention for their wearability and promising applications in healthcare, energy devices, and artificial intelligence. Recently, direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing (DIW) technology has shown a growing trend because of its controllability, ease of fabrication, and efficiency. However, the design novelty of printable ink for soft electronic textiles is severely hampered by the intrinsic challenges of integrating printability, conductivity, stretchability, biocompatibility, and durability. Herein, a reusable DIW bio&#8208;carbon gel ink is proposed for printing soft electronic textiles where cottonseed peptone&#8208;functionalized multi&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (CPCNTs) exhibit high dispersibility and reactive surface groups, enabling stable cross&#8208;linking with phytic acid (PA) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to form a strong ionic polymer composite. Encouragingly, the gel ink can be directly exploited to design complex circuits and versatile electronics via DIW printing on both polymeric and textile substrates. The viscoelasticity, mechanical recovery, electric properties, robustness, and stretchable architectures enable it to function as flexible circuits, smart sensors, and renewable generators. As demonstrations, multifunctional applications are presented by real&#8208;time healthcare monitoring, LED lighting, and power generation. Furthermore, this printable gel ink is effectively assembled into an integrated wearable unit for robot manipulation and real&#8208;time gesture recognition, suggesting a significant printing strategy for next&#8208;generation wearable electronics.

         <title>Efficient Low&#8208;temperature Ammonia Cracking Enabled by Strained Heterostructure Interfaces on Ru&#8208;free Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the strong metal&#8208;support interaction effect, heterostructured interfaces in a Co&#8208;based catalyst are designed to enable low&#8208;temperature ammonia (NH3) decomposition. The induced tensile lattice strain within the core&#8208;shell structure modulates d&#8208;band center of Co, enhancing NH3 adsorption and facilitating N&#9472;H bond dissociation. Furthermore, the dynamic lattice strain release and restoration mechanism promotes NH3 dehydrogenation and by&#8208;product desorption, effectively optimizing the reaction pathway and ensuring sustained catalytic activity.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) has emerged as a promising liquid carrier for hydrogen (H2) storage. However, its widespread adoption in H2 technology is impeded by the reliance on costly Ru catalysts for low&#8208;temperature NH3 cracking reaction. Here, a strained heterostructure Co@BaAl2O4&#8722;x core@shell catalyst is reported that demonstrates catalytic performance at low reaction temperatures comparable to most Ru&#8208;based catalysts. This catalyst exhibits exceptional activity across a range of space velocity conditions, maintaining high conversion rates at 475 to 575&#160;&#176;C and achieving an impressive H2 production rate of 64.6&#160;mmol H2 gcat&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, and kinetic studies are carried out to elucidate the dynamic changes of the strained heterostructure interface of Co&#8208;core and BaAl2O4&#8722;x&#8208;overlayer under catalytic working conditions. The performance enhancement mechanisms are attributed to the tensile strained Co surface encapsulated in the defective BaAl2O4&#8722;x, which enhances NH3 adsorption and facilitates the rate&#8208;determining N&#9472;H dissociation. Furthermore, the strain release and restoration during NH3 dehydrogenation enable efficient nitrogen desorption, preventing active site poisoning. This work highlights the effectiveness of lattice strain engineering and the development of synergistic strong metal&#8208;support interfaces between active metal nanoparticles and oxide support to boost low&#8208;temperature NH3 cracking.

         <title>Interface Reinforced Tailoring of Quantum Dots Regulates Reaction Trajectory of CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interface&#8208;reinforced regulation strategy is proposed to tailor the activation mode of CO2 in water. The facilitation of directional electron transfer and the interface&#8208;reinforced charge difference of the catalytic site at the CdSe/S/InS QD interface greatly promotes the shift of reaction trajectory of CO2 photoreduction, i.e., the main HCOO&#8722; product for CdSe is transformed into CO for CdSe/S/InS QDs.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis using semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) is one of the most promising pathways toward converting CO2 into valuable chemicals. However, the multistep process of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion endows the regulation of reaction trajectory from CO2 to specific products very challenging in aqueous solution. Here, it is first disclosed that the anisotropic growth of CdSe&#8722;S&#8722;InS interface in ultrafine heterojunction QDs alters the trajectory of CO2 photoreduction in water, i.e., CdSe/S/InS QDs mainly produce CO while CdSe QDs generate HCOO&#8722;. Under optimal conditions, the CO turnover number of CdSe/S/InS QDs is &#8776;1000 (12 h; vs QDs) with a selectivity of &gt;96% in C&#8208;based products or &#8776;57.6% when considering H2. The formation of anisotropic CdSe/S/InS ultrafine heterojunction facilitates charge migration at the interface, which is confirmed by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transient absorption spectroscopy. Further DFT simulations and in situ experiments demonstrate that the interfacial lattice expansion reinforces the charge difference at the interface, thus contributing to the product shift from HCOOH to CO, which clarifies the mechanism of interface&#8208;reinforced tailoring of CO2 reaction trajectories. This work can not only provide guidance for interfacial CO2 activation mode in water but also inspire the design of novel artificial photocatalysts with new functions.

         <title>Green, Safe, Durable, Printed Fabric Hygroelectric Generators for Wearable Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work achieves a green hygroelectric generator with enhanced electric outputs. All chemicals and materials used in the hygroelectric generators are safe for human and environmentally friendly. The device achieves an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.2 V and a short&#8208;circuit current of 1.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 at room humidity of 55% through the synergistic effect of ion migration and water absorption.








Abstract
Hygroelectric generators, converting energy from moisture into electricity, have attracted great interest due to sustainable and ubiquitous moisture in the environment. However, it is absolutely necessary to replace the fragile and noxious materials reported previously in the hygroelectric generators before real applications for wearables. Herein, a green hygroelectric generator with a high current density is designed for the first time by printing functional materials that are abundant, safe to humans and environments. By engineering printable hydrogel through the synergistic effect of water absorption and ion migration on the fabric, the wearable fabric hygroelectric generators deliver a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.2&#160;V with a remarkable short&#8208;circuit current density of 1.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2, more than 7 times that of most reported hygroelectric generators. The devices show no performance declination after long&#8208;term storage and bending tests due to the design of stable hydrogel and robust electrode/hydrogel interfaces. Moreover, the devices with cross&#8208;finger structures achieve a facile scalable integration for enhanced electric outputs. Exemplifying applications illustrate the great potential of the printed fabric hygroelectric generators as a direct current power supply for wearable applications. This work sheds light on a novel avenue to design safe and environmentally friendly energy harvesting devices for practical applications.

         <title>Janus Cellular Design Drives Solar&#8208;Powered Spatial Lithium Extraction and Water Co&#8208;Generation from Salt&#8208;Lake Brines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D&#8208;printed Janus cellular solar platform integrates photothermal evaporation, ion&#8208;diffusion&#8208;guided lithium enrichment, and flipping&#8208;induced salt removal. The asymmetric lattice, fabricated via high&#8208;resolution printing and functionalized with porous adsorbents, enables simultaneous water harvesting and selective lithium extraction from hypersaline brines, offering a scalable and energy&#8208;efficient route for sustainable resource recovery.








Abstract
Lithium plays a vital role in energy storage technologies, with global demand rapidly increasing. Current adsorption&#8208;based direct lithium extraction from salt&#8208;lake brines holds promise but suffers from low ion extraction efficiency due to sluggish intercalation kinetics and poor selectivity, necessitating repeated cycles that increase water and energy consumption. Here, a Janus cellular&#8208;structured solar&#8208;powered platform (JCSP) is developed for energy&#8208;efficient lithium extraction and sustainable water harvesting. The cellular platform features a symmetrical, multi&#8208;branched cantilever geometry with distinct upper and lower lattice architectures, where the lower lattice is functionalized with titanium&#8208;based porous adsorbents. This rational lattice design and functionalized adsorption interfaces enhance light absorption, sustain evaporative flow, and create an ion diffusion gradient for selective lithium extraction. Its cantilever configuration enables a self&#8208;flipping mechanism, preventing salt crystallization and ensuring long&#8208;term stability in high&#8208;salinity environments. This design boosts water evaporation efficiency to 3.85&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, increases lithium adsorption capacity to 43.5&#160;mg g&#8722;1, and enhances Li+/Na+ and Li+/Mg2+ selectivity to 112 and 268, respectively, when treating multi&#8208;ionic hypersaline environment (20 wt% total dissolved salt). The JCSP system demonstrates stable long&#8208;term performance in water evaporation and lithium recovery under extreme conditions, providing a sustainable solution to global water scarcity and rising lithium demand.

         <title>Advancing Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules Toward Interface&#8208;Optimized Perovskite Solar Cells: from One to Two</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the past few years, self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) have ushered in a new era of interface engineering for perovskite solar cells. Herein, the recent progresses of co&#8208;SAM, namely two SAMs with synergy, are comprehensively summarized and analyzed, focusing on topics including deposition methods and design principles, while further challenges about mechanisms, materials, and applications are also outlined.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly gained prominence as a leading candidate in the realm of solution&#8208;processable third&#8208;generation photovoltaic (PV) technologies. In the high&#8208;efficiency inverted PSCs, self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) are often used as hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs) due to&#160;the advantages of high transmittance, energy level matching, low non&#8208;radiative recombination loss, and tunable surface properties. However, SAMs have been recognized to suffer from some shortcomings, such as incomplete coverage, weak bonding with substrate or perovskite, instability, and so on. The combination of different SAMs or so&#8208;called co&#8208;SAM is an effective strategy to overcome this challenge. In this Perspective, the latest achievements in molecule design, deposition method, working principle, and application of the co&#8208;SAM are discussed. This comprehensive overview of milestones in this rapidly advancing research field, coupled with an in&#8208;depth analysis of the improved interface properties using the co&#8208;SAM approach, aims to offer valuable insights into the key design principles. Furthermore, the lessons learned will guide the future development of SAM&#8208;based HSLs in perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.
