         <title>Spatial Separation of Cocatalysts on Z&#8208;scheme Organic/Inorganic Heterostructure Hollow Spheres for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2 Evolution and in&#8208;depth Analysis of the Charge Transfer Mechanism</title>

Abstract
Herein, a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction with spatially separated cocatalysts is proposed for overcoming fundamental issues in photocatalytic water splitting, such as inefficient light absorption, charge recombination, and sluggish reaction kinetics. For efficient light absorption and interfacial charge separation, Z&#8208;scheme organic/inorganic heterojunction photocatalysts are synthesized by firmly immobilizing ultrathin g&#8208;C3N4 on the surface of TiO2 hollow spheres via electrostatic interactions. Additionally, two cocatalysts, Pt and IrOx, are spatially separated along the Z&#8208;scheme charge transfer pathway to enhance surface charge separation and reaction kinetics. The as&#8208;prepared Pt/g&#8208;C3N4/TiO2/IrOx (PCTI) hollow sphere photocatalyst exhibits an exceptional H2 evolution rate of 8.15&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 and a remarkable apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 24.3% at 330&#160;nm in the presence of 0.5 wt% Pt and 1.2 wt% IrOx cocatalysts on g&#8208;C3N4 and TiO2, respectively. Photo&#8208;assisted Kelvin probe force microscopy is used to systematically analyze the Z&#8208;scheme charge transfer mechanism within PCTI. Furthermore, the benefits of spatially separating cocatalysts in the PCTI system are methodically investigated in comparison to randomly depositing them. This work adequately demonstrates that the combination of a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction and spatially separated cocatalysts can be a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalytic platforms for solar fuel production.

         <title>Stable and Solution Processable Cumulenic sp&#8208;Carbon Wires: A New Paradigm for Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed, large&#8208;area, and flexible electronics largely relies on the excellent electronic properties of sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon molecules, either in the form of &#960;&#8208;conjugated small molecules and polymers or graphene and carbon nanotubes. Carbon with sp&#8208;hybridization, the foundation of the elusive allotrope carbyne, offers vast opportunities for functionalized molecules in the form of linear carbon atomic wires (CAWs), with intriguing and even superior predicted electronic properties. While CAWs represent a vibrant field of research, to date they have only been applied sparingly to molecular devices. The recent observation of the field&#8208;effect in microcrystalline cumulenes suggests their potential applications in solution&#8208;processed thin film transistors but concerns surrounding the stability and electronic performance have precluded developments in this direction. In the present study, we demonstrate ideal field&#8208;effect characteristics for solution&#8208;processed thin films of tetraphenyl[3]cumulene, the shortest semiconducting CAW. Films are deposited through a scalable, large&#8208;area, meniscus&#8208;coating technique, providing transistors with hole mobilities in excess of 0.1&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, as well as promising operational stability under dark conditions. These results offer a solid foundation for the exploitation of a vast class of molecular semiconductors for organic electronics based on sp&#8208;hybridized carbon systems and create a previously unexplored paradigm.

         <title>Wearable All&#8208;Gel Multimodal Cutaneous Sensor Enabling Simultaneous Single&#8208;Site Monitoring of Cardiac&#8208;Related Biophysical Signals</title>

Abstract
Human cutaneous sensory organ is a highly evolved biosensor that is efficient, sensitive, selective, and adaptable. Recently, with the developing various materials and structures inspired by sensory organs, artificial cutaneous sensors have been widely studied. In this study, we demonstrated the acquisition of biophysical signals at one point on the body using a wearable all&#8208;gel&#8208;integrated multimodal sensor composed of four element sensors, inspired by the slow/rapid adapting functions of the skin sensory receptors. The gel&#8208;type sensors ensure flexibility, compactness, portability, adherence, and integrity. The wearable all&#8208;gel multimodal sensor was easily attached to the wrist and simultaneously gathered blood pressure (BP), electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyogram (EMG), and mechanomyogram (MMG) signals related to cardiac and muscle health. Human activity causes muscle contraction, which affects blood flow; therefore, the relationship between the muscle and heart is crucial for screening and predicting heart health. We monitored cardiac health by obtaining the two types of phase time differences (i.e., &#916;tbe: BP and ECG, &#916;tem: ECG and MMG) generated during muscle movement. The suggested multimodal sensor has potential applicability in monitoring biophysical conditions and diagnosing cardiac&#8208;related health problems.

         <title>The development of chiral nanoparticles to target NK cells and CD8+ T cells for cancer immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The chirality of nanomaterials (NPs) can influence their interaction with cells and biological systems. However, how chirality can exert impact on the immune response has yet to be investigated. In this paper, we investigated the immunological effect of chiral nanomaterials as therapeutic and preventive options against tumors. Compared with achiral nanoparticles, chiral NPs with a g&#8208;factor of 0.44 were shown to enhance both innate and acquired immunity against tumor growth. We also found that chiral NPs enhanced the activation of CD8+ T and nature killer cells (CD69+ NK cells) by stimulating dendritic cells (DCs). Importantly, L&#8208;type NPs induced a 1.65&#8208;fold higher proportion of CD8+ T and CD69+ NK cells than D&#8208;type NPs. Next, we investigated the therapeutic and preventative effects of chiral NPs against tumors in a EG7.OVA tumor model. We found that L&#8208;type NPs had a significant greater ability to induce apoptosis in tumor cells and prolong the survival time of model mice than D&#8208;type NPs. Mice treated with L&#8208;type NPs induced the activation of 84.98&#160;&#177; 6.63% CD8+ T cells and 33.62&#160;&#177; 3.41% of NK cells in tumor tissues; this was 1.62&#8208;fold and 1.39&#8208;fold higher than seen in the mice treated with D&#8208;type NPs. Mechanistic studies revealed that chiral NPs exerted mechanical force on bone&#8208;marrow&#8208;derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and stimulated the expression of cytokines to induce cytotoxic activity in NK cells. Synergistically, the CD8 T cells were stimulated to eliminate tumor cells via antigen&#8208;cross presentation. The force of interaction between L&#8208;type NPs and cells was higher than that for D&#8208;NPs, thus further promoting the activation of NK cells and CD8+ T cells and their infiltration into tumor tissue. Our findings open up a new avenue for chiral nanomaterials to act as immunoadjuvants for the prevention and treatment of cancer.

         <title>Engineered Protein&#8208;Au Bioplaster for Efficient Skin Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Melanoma is the most lethal malignancy in skin cancer and may occur at any site and express melanocytes. Due to malignant melanoma's invasion and migration nature, conventional therapies make it challenging to remove the whole tumor tissue while undertaking the high risks of tumor recurrence. Regarding the emerging targeted therapies and immunotherapy, drug resistance and low immunotherapeutic activity remain significant challenges. It is thus becoming urgently important to develop alternative strategies for melanoma therapy. Herein, we develop a novel bifunctional protein&#8208;based photo&#8208;thermal bioplaster (PPTB) for non&#8208;invasive tumor therapy and skin tissue regeneration. The complexation of adhesive protein and gold nanorods (GNRs) endow the obtained PPTB with good biocompatibility, controllable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;mediated adhesion performance, and high photo&#8208;thermal performance. Therefore, the PPTB bioagent facilitates skin adhesion and effectively transfers heat from skin to tumor. This behavior endows PPTB capability to eradicate skin tumors conveniently. Thus, our assembly strategy enables this hybrid bioplaster to hold great potential for skin&#8208;related tumor treatment.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanoma is the most lethal malignancy in skin cancer and may occur at any site and express melanocytes. Due to malignant melanoma's invasion and migration nature, conventional therapies make it challenging to remove the whole tumor tissue while undertaking the high risks of tumor recurrence. Regarding the emerging targeted therapies and immunotherapy, drug resistance and low immunotherapeutic activity remain significant challenges. It is thus becoming urgently important to develop alternative strategies for melanoma therapy. Herein, we develop a novel bifunctional protein-based photo-thermal bioplaster (PPTB) for non-invasive tumor therapy and skin tissue regeneration. The complexation of adhesive protein and gold nanorods (GNRs) endow the obtained PPTB with good biocompatibility, controllable near-infrared (NIR) light-mediated adhesion performance, and high photo-thermal performance. Therefore, the PPTB bioagent facilitates skin adhesion and effectively transfers heat from skin to tumor. This behavior endows PPTB capability to eradicate skin tumors conveniently. Thus, our assembly strategy enables this hybrid bioplaster to hold great potential for skin-related tumor treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Biomimetic Nanoerythrosome&#8208;Coated Aptamer&#8211;DNA Tetrahedron/Maytansine Conjugates: pH&#8208;Responsive and Targeted Cytotoxicity for HER2&#8208;Positive Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PEOz&#8208;erythrosome vesicle loaded with HER2 aptamer&#8208;DNA tetrahedron/maytansine conjugates (HApt&#8208;tFNA@DM1, HTD) is developed for targeted delivery of the HApDCs to HER2&#8208;positive cancer. The PEOz&#8208;erythrosome@HTD prolongs the blood circulation of HTD, protects it from the early blood clearance, and then delivers and releases it into the tumor microenvironment, further improving the antitumor activity of HApDC.








Abstract
DNA materials have emerged as potential nanocarriers for targeted cancer therapy to precisely deliver cargos with specific purposes. The short half&#8208;life and low bioavailability of DNA materials due to their interception by the reticuloendothelial system and blood clearance further limit their clinical translation. This study employs an HER2&#8208;targeted DNA&#8208;aptamer&#8208;modified DNA tetrahedron (HApt&#8208;tFNA) as a drug delivery system, and combines maytansine (DM1) to develop the HApt&#8208;DNA tetrahedron/DM1 conjugate (HApt&#8208;tFNA@DM1, HTD, HApDC) for targeted therapy of HER2&#8208;positive cancer. To optimize the pharmacokinetics and tumor&#8208;aggregation of HTD, a biomimetic camouflage is applied to embed HTD. The biomimetic camouflage is constructed by merging the erythrocyte membrane with pH&#8208;responsive functionalized synthetic liposomes, thus with excellent performance of drug delivery and tumor&#8208;stimulated drug release. The hybrid erythrosome&#8208;based nanoparticles show better inhibition of HER2&#8208;positive cancer than other drug formulations and exhibit superior biosafety. With the strengths of precise delivery, increased drug loading, sensitive tumor probing, and prolonged circulation time, the HApDC represents a promising nanomedicine to treat HER2&#8208;positive tumors. Notably, this study developsa dual&#8208;targeting nanoparticle by combining pH&#8208;sensitive camouflage and HApDC, initiating an important step toward the development and application of DNA&#8208;based medicine and biomimetic cell membrane materials in cancer treatment and other potential biological applications.

         <title>Recent Advances in Oxidation Stable Chemistry of 2D MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review briefly introduces preparation methods, oxidation mechanisms, a comprehensive summarization of factors affecting oxidation and a detailed account of strategies to mitigate MXenes degeneration. It furthermore offers an overview of in situ synthesis MXene derivatives with enhanced performance, and presents perspectives for the challenges and opportunities for the protection and application of MXenes and their derivatives.








Abstract
As an emerging star of 2D nanomaterials, 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides, named MXenes, present a large potential in various research areas owing to their intrinsic multilayer structure and intriguing physico&#8208;chemical properties. However, the fabrication and application of functional MXene&#8208;based devices still remain challenging as they are prone to oxidative degradation under ambient environment. Within this review, the preparation methods of MXenes focusing on the recent investigations on their thermal structure&#8211;stability relationships in inert, oxidizing, and aqueous environments are systematically introduced. Moreover, the key factors that affect the oxidation of MXenes, such as, atmosphere, temperature, composition, microstructure, and aqueous environment, are reviewed. Based on different scenarios, strategies for avoiding or delaying the oxidation of MXenes are proposed to encourage the utilization of MXenes in complicated environments, especially at high temperature. Furthermore, the chemistry of MXene&#8208;derived oxides is analyzed, which can offer perspectives on the further design and fabrication of novel 2D composites with the unique structures of MXenes being preserved.

         <title>In Situ Carbon Corrosion and Cu Leaching as a Strategy for Boosting Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Multimetal Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ carbon corrosion and Cu leaching during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in multimetal electrocatalysts can effectively boost catalytic activity with a low overpotential. More importantly, by placing a single particle on a nanoelectrode, structural changes during electrocatalysis can be directly evaluated, providing in&#8208;depth understanding for the catalyst's excellent OER performance.








Abstract
The number of active sites and their intrinsic activity are key factors in designing high&#8208;performance catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The synthesis, properties, and in&#8208;depth characterization of a homogeneous CoNiFeCu catalyst are reported, demonstrating that multimetal synergistic effects improve the OER kinetics and the intrinsic activity. In situ carbon corrosion and Cu leaching during the OER lead to an enhanced electrochemically active surface area, providing favorable conditions for improved electronic interaction between the constituent metals. After activation, the catalyst exhibits excellent activity with a low overpotential of 291.5&#160;&#177; 0.5&#160;mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 43.9 mV dec&#8722;1. It shows superior stability compared to RuO2 in 1 m KOH, which is even preserved for 120 h at 500 mA cm&#8722;2 in 7 m KOH at 50&#160;&#176;C. Single particles of this CoNiFeCu after their placement on nanoelectrodes combined with identical location transmission electron microscopy before and after applying cyclic voltammetry are investigated. The improved catalytic performance is due to surface carbon corrosion and Cu leaching. The proposed catalyst design strategy combined with the unique single&#8208;nanoparticle technique contributes to the development and characterization of high&#8208;performance catalysts for electrochemical energy conversion.

         <title>A Fully Flexible Intelligent Thermal Touch Panel Based on Intrinsically Plastic Ag2S Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully flexible intelligent thermal touch panel based on the intrinsically plastic Ag2S semiconductor can well perceive finger touch signals in real&#8208;time and displays intelligent feed back of Chinese characters and letters on an app.








Abstract
Wearable touch panels, a typical flexible electronic device, can recognize and feed back the information of finger touch and movement. Excellent wearable touch panels are required to accurately and quickly monitor the signals of finger movement as well as the capacity of bearing various types of deformation. High&#8208;performance thermistor materials are one of the key functional components, but to date, a long&#8208;standing bottleneck is that inorganic semiconductors are typically brittle while the electrical properties of organic semiconductors are quite low. Herein, a high&#8208;performance flexible temperature sensor is reported by using plastic Ag2S with ultrahigh temperature coefficient of resistance of &#8722;4.7% K&#8722;1 and resolution of 0.05 K, and rapid response/recovery time of 0.11/0.11 s. Moreover, the temperature sensor shows excellent durability without performance damage or loss during force stimuli tests. In addition, a fully flexible intelligent touch panel composed of a 16 &#215; 10 Ag2S&#8208;film&#8208;based temperature sensor array, as well as a flexible printed circuit board and a deep&#8208;learning algorithm is designed for perceiving finger touch signals in real&#8208;time, and intelligent feedback of Chinese characters and letters on an app. These results strongly show that high&#8208;performance flexible inorganic semiconductors can be widely used in flexible electronics.

         <title>A &#8220;Pre&#8208;Constrained Metal Twins&#8221; Strategy to Prepare Efficient Dual&#8208;Metal&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Cooperative Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
A &#8220;pre&#8208;constrained metal twin&#8221; strategy is presented for the first time to prepare dual&#8208;metal&#8208;atom&#8208;center catalysts (FeCo&#8208;DACs/NC) with continuous FeN4 and CoN4. The FeCo&#8208;DACs/NC delivers excellent catalytic activity in oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, and Zn&#8211;air batteries. The synergistic effect between the two metals optimizes the free energy of the oxygen intermediate state, resulting in improved performance.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;metal&#8208;atom&#8208;center catalysts (DACs) are a novel frontier in oxygen electrocatalysis, boasting functional and electronic synergies between contiguous metal centers and higher catalytic activities than single&#8208;atom&#8208;center catalysts. However, the definition and catalytic mechanism of DACs configurations remain unclear. Here, a &#8220;pre&#8208;constrained metal twins&#8221; strategy is proposed to prepare contiguous FeN4 and CoN4 DACs with homogeneous conformations embedded in a N&#8208;doped graphitic carbon (FeCo&#8208;DACs/NC). A programmable phthalocyanines dimer is used as a structural moiety to anchor the bimetallic sites (containing Co and Fe) in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) to achieve delocalized dispersion before pyrolysis. The resultant FeCo&#8208;DACs/NC exhibits excellent electrochemical performance in oxygen electrocatalysis and rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the synergetic interaction of adjacent metals optimizes the d&#8208;band center position of metal centers and balances the free energy of the *O intermediate, thereby improving the oxygen electrocatalytic activity. This work opens up an avenue for the rational design of DACs with tailored electronic structures and uniform geometric configurations.

         <title>Elastic Plasmonic&#8208;Enhanced Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot Cavities with Ultrasensitive Stretching Tunability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel plasmon&#8208;enhanced stretchable Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) cavities obtained by a catalytic self&#8208;embedding process of Au&#8208;nanodomes into elastomeric materials are demonstrated. The resulting FP resonances are amplified by the broad plasmonic resonances of the Au nanostructures and modulated by the scattering from the wrinkled surface. The optical response is highly mechanically tunable in both FP resonances intensity and spectral position.








Abstract
The emerging stretchable photonics field faces challenges, like the robust integration of optical elements into elastic matrices or the generation of large optomechanical effects. Here, the first stretchable plasmonic&#8208;enhanced and wrinkled Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) cavities are demonstrated, which are composed of self&#8208;embedded arrays of Au nanostructures at controlled depths into elastomer films. The novel self&#8208;embedding process is triggered by the Au nanostructures&#8217; catalytic activity, which locally increases the polymer curing rate, thereby inducing a mechanical stress that simultaneously pulls the Au nanostructures into the polymer and forms a wrinkled skin layer. This geometry yields unprecedented optomechanical effects produced by the coupling of the broad plasmonic modes of the Au nanostructures and the FP modes, which are modulated by the wrinkled optical cavity. As a result, film stretching induces drastic changes in both the spectral position and intensity of the plasmonic&#8208;enhanced FP resonances due to the simultaneous cavity thickness reduction and cavity wrinkle flattening, thus increasing the cavity finesse. These optomechanical effects are exploited to demonstrate new strain&#8208;sensing approaches, achieving a strain detection limit of 0.006%, i.e., 16&#8208;fold lower than current optical strain&#8208;detection schemes.

         <title>An Asymmetry Field&#8208;Effect Phototransistor for Solving Large Exciton Binding Energy of 2D TMDCs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric split&#8208;gate phototransistor configuration, called the &#8220;asymmetry field&#8208;effect phototransistor&#8221; (AFEPT) is demonstrated. The structure allows for an effective modulation of the electric&#8208;field profile throughout the channel, as well as enhanced photocarrier transport, thereby providing a new platform for improving optoelectronic properties and probing photocarrier dynamics in intrinsic 2D material layers.








Abstract
The probing of fundamental photophysics is a key prerequisite for the construction of diverse optoelectronic devices and circuits. To date, though, photocarrier dynamics in 2D materials remains unclear, plagued primarily by two issues: a large exciton binding energy, and the lack of a suitable system that enables the manipulation of excitons. Here, a WSe2&#8208;based phototransistor with an asymmetric split&#8208;gate configuration is demonstrated, which is named the &#8220;asymmetry field&#8208;effect phototransistor&#8221; (AFEPT). This structure allows for the effective modulation of the electric&#8208;field profile across the channel, thereby providing a standard device platform for exploring the photocarrier dynamics of the intrinsic WSe2 layer. By controlling the electric field, this work the spatial evolution of the photocurrent is observed, notably with a strong signal over the entire WSe2 channel. Using photocurrent and optical spectroscopy measurements, the physical origin of the novel photocurrent behavior is clarified and a room&#8208;temperature exciton binding energy of 210 meV is determined with the device. In the phototransistor geometry, lateral p&#8211;n junctions serve as a simultaneous pathway for both photogenerated electrons and holes, reducing their recombination rate and thus enhancing photodetection. The study establishes a new device platform for both fundamental studies and technological applications.

         <title>Electrolyte Modulators toward Polarization&#8208;Mitigated Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries for Sustainable Electric Transportation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D metal&#8211;organic framework is employed as an electrolyte modulator (MEM) for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIB). Such an MEM can afford electrolytes with high lithium&#8208;ion transference number and high ionic conductivity, as well as low&#8208;resistivity interface with electrodes and ability to suppress polarizations. The LIB operated under strenuous conditions demonstrates that the MEM dramatically improves the energy output, energy efficiency, and cycle lifespan.








Abstract
Electric vehicles (EVs) are being adopted to replace combustion engine vehicles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change; developing batteries with high energy efficiency and long lifespan, in the context of carbon footprint and cost, are essential to ensure the successful transition. Herein, an electrolyte modulator that can effectively mitigate the polarization of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, leading to dramatically improved energy efficiency and lifespan, is reported. Under a dynamic stress test that mimics the operations of EVs, commercial pouch cells with a low concentration of electrolyte modulator (0.2 wt% of the electrolyte) exhibit enhanced energy efficiency (87.5% vs 80.4% for the first 500 testing cycles) and prolonged lifespan (fourfold improvement based on 70% energy&#8208;output retention). This work provides a simple yet effective strategy toward sustainable electrification of vehicles.

         <title>POM Anolyte for All&#8208;Anion Redox Flow Batteries with High Capacity Retention and Coulombic Efficiency at Mild pH</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the multi&#8208;electron redox ability, structure stability, and high redox kinetics of {BW12} polyoxometalate (POM) anion anolyte at mild pH, all&#8208;anion aqueous redox flow batteries coupled with different catholyte anion exhibit very high capacity retention. An in&#8208;operando aqueous flowing Raman spectroscopy technique is also first constructed to investigate the structural revolution and stability of POMs anion during battery operation.








Abstract
A highly soluble Li5BW12O40 cluster delivers 2 e&#8722; redox reaction with fast electron transfer rates (2.5 &#215; 10&#8722;2&#160;cm s&#8722;1) and high diffusion coefficients (&#8776;2.08 &#215; 10&#8722;6 cm2 s&#8722;1) at mild pH ranging from 3 to 8. In&#8208;operando aqueous&#8208;flowing Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that Raman shift changing of {BW12} clusters is due to the bond length changing between W&#8208;Ob&#8208;W and W&#8208;Oc&#8208;W at different redox states. The structure changing and redox chemistry of Li5BW12O40 are highly reversible, which makes the Li5BW12O40 cluster versatile to construct all&#8208;anion aqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs). The cation&#8208;exchange Nafion membrane will also repel the cross permeability of the anion redox couples. Consequently, by coupling with Li3K[Fe(CN)6] catholyte, the aqueous RFB can be operated at pH 8 with a capacity retention up to 95% and an average Coulombic efficiency more than 99.79% over 300 cycles within 0 to 1.2&#160;V. Meanwhile, Li5BW12O40 cluster can also be paired with LiI catholyte to form aqueous RFBs at pH 7 and pH 3, the capacity retention of 94% and 90% can be realized over 300 cycles within 0 to 1.3&#160;V.

     alt="POM Anolyte for All-Anion Redox Flow Batteries with High Capacity Retention and Coulombic Efficiency at Mild pH"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the multi-electron redox ability, structure stability, and high redox kinetics of {BW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;} polyoxometalate (POM) anion anolyte at mild pH, all-anion aqueous redox flow batteries coupled with different catholyte anion exhibit very high capacity retention. An in-operando aqueous flowing Raman spectroscopy technique is also first constructed to investigate the structural revolution and stability of POMs anion during battery operation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly soluble Li&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;BW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; cluster delivers 2 e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; redox reaction with fast electron transfer rates (2.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and high diffusion coefficients (&#8776;2.08 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at mild pH ranging from 3 to 8. In-operando aqueous-flowing Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that Raman shift changing of {BW12} clusters is due to the bond length changing between W-O&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;-W and W-O&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;-W at different redox states. The structure changing and redox chemistry of Li&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;BW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; are highly reversible, which makes the Li&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;BW&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; cluster versatile to construct all-anion aqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs). The cation-exchange Nafion membrane will also repel the cross permeability of the anion redox couples. Consequently, by coupling with Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;K[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] catholyte, the aqueous RFB can be operated at pH 8 with a capacity retention up to 95% and an average Coulombic efficiency more than 99.79% over 300 cycles within 0 to 1.2&#160;V.

         <title>Conductivity Mechanism in Ionic 2D Carbon Nitrides: From Hydrated Ion Motion to Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dark and photoinduced charge transport in the metal (M)&#8208;intercalated 2D carbon nitride poly(heptazine imide) (M&#8208;PHI) is investigated, revealing predominantly ionic, humidity&#8208;assisted conductivity. A correlation between ionic conductivity and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity is revealed, which suggests efficient screening of photogenerated charges by mobile ions, leading to prolonged charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes.








Abstract
Carbon nitrides are among the most studied materials for photocatalysis; however, limitations arise from inefficient charge separation and transport within the material. Here, this aspect is addressed in the 2D carbon nitride poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) by investigating the influence of various counterions, such as M = Li+, Na+, K+, Cs+, Ba2+, NH4+, and tetramethyl ammonium, on the material's conductivity and photocatalytic activity. These ions in the PHI pores affect the stacking of the 2D layers, which further influences the predominantly ionic conductivity in M&#8208;PHI. Na&#8208;containing PHI outperforms the other M&#8208;PHIs in various relative humidity (RH) environments (0&#8211;42%RH) in terms of conductivity, likely due to pore&#8208;channel geometry and size of the (hydrated) ion. With increasing RH, the ionic conductivity increases by 4&#8211;5 orders of magnitude (for Na&#8208;PHI up to 10&#8208;5 S cm&#8208;1 at 42%RH). At the same time, the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate is observed for Na&#8208;PHI, which is mirrored by increased photogenerated charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes, pointing to efficient charge&#8208;carrier stabilization by, e.g., mobile ions. These results indicate that also ionic conductivity is an important parameter that can influence the photocatalytic activity. Besides, RH&#8208;dependent ionic conductivity is of high interest for separators, membranes, or sensors.

         <title>Acoustophoretic Liquefaction for 3D Printing Ultrahigh&#8208;Viscosity Nanoparticle Suspensions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acoustophoretic&#8208;liquefaction Digital Light Processing (AL&#8208;DLP) permits manipulation of resin rheology during 3D printing. Acoustic transduction reduces the viscosity of nanopartice suspensions by up to three orders of magnitude to promote resin recirculation and reduce viscous adhesion. Consequently, AL&#8208;DLP improves resolution (&gt;25%), increases printable area (&#8776;50 &#215; ), and reduces build times (&gt;3 &#215; faster) when compared to conventional methods for printing composite.








Abstract
An acoustic liquefaction approach to enhance the flow of yield stress fluids during Digital Light Processing (DLP)&#8208;based 3D printing is reported. This enhanced flow enables processing of ultrahigh&#8208;viscosity resins (&#956;app&#160;&gt; 3700 Pa s at shear rates &#947;&#729;&#160;= 0.01 s&#8211;1) based on silica particles in a silicone photopolymer. Numerical simulations of the acousto&#8211;mechanical coupling in the DLP resin feed system at different agitation frequencies predict local resin flow velocities exceeding 100 mm s&#8211;1 at acoustic transduction frequencies of 110 s&#8211;1. Under these conditions, highly loaded particle suspensions (weight fractions, &#981;&#160;= 0.23) can be printed successfully in complex geometries. Such mechanically reinforced composites possess a tensile toughness 2000% greater than the neat photopolymer. Beyond an increase in processible viscosities, acoustophoretic liquefaction DLP (AL&#8208;DLP) creates a transient reduction in apparent viscosity that promotes resin recirculation and decreases viscous adhesion. As a result, acoustophoretic liquefaction Digital Light Processing (AL&#8208;DLP) improves the printed feature resolution by more than 25%, increases printable object sizes by over 50 times, and can build parts &gt;3 &#215; faster when compared to conventional methodologies.

         <title>A Predictive Theory for Domain Walls in Oxide Ferroelectrics Based on Interatomic Interactions and its Implications for Collective Material Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A discrete microscopic Landau&#8211;Ginzburg&#8211;Devonshire (dmLGD) approach with A&#8208; and B&#8208;site cation displacements serving as order parameters is developed. Using dmLGD decomposition of the total energy of the system into the contributions of the individual cations, various properties are predicted for a wide range of ferroelectric perovskites based on the results obtained for BaTiO3, KNbO3, and PbTiO3 only.








Abstract
Domain walls separating regions of ferroelectric material with polarization oriented in different directions are crucial for applications of ferroelectrics. Rational design of ferroelectric materials requires the development of a theory describing how compositional and environmental changes affect domain walls. To model domain wall systems, a discrete microscopic Landau&#8211;Ginzburg&#8211;Devonshire (dmLGD) approach with A&#8208; and B&#8208;site cation displacements serving as order parameters is developed. Application of dmLGD to the classic BaTiO3, KNbO3, and PbTiO3 ferroelectrics shows that A&#8211;B cation repulsion is the key interaction that couples the polarization in neighboring unit cells of the material. dmLGD decomposition of the total energy of the system into the contributions of the individual cations and their interactions enables the prediction of different properties for a wide range of ferroelectric perovskites based on the results obtained for BaTiO3, KNbO3, and PbTiO3 only. It is found that the information necessary to estimate the structure and energy of domain&#8208;wall &#8220;defects&#8221; can be extracted from single&#8208;domain 5&#8208;atom first&#8208;principles calculations, and that &#8220;defect&#8208;like&#8221; domain walls offer a simple model system that sheds light on the relative stabilities of the ferroelectric, antiferroelectric, and paraelectric bulk phases. The dmLGD approach provides a general theoretical framework for understanding and designing ferroelectric perovskite oxides.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly swollen, low&#8208;crosslinking&#8208;density polymer hydrogel reinforced with hyperbranched silica nanoparticles is absent of temporary entanglement and effectively avoids hysteresis during extensive cyclic tensile tests. This work provides a universal design principle for hysteresis&#8208;free hydrogels, leading to better antifatigue performances.








Abstract
The elastic storage and release of mechanical energy has been key to many developments throughout the history of mankind. Resilience, absent hysteresis, has been an elusive goal to achieve, particularly at large deformations. Using a low&#8208;crosslink&#8208;density polyacrylamide hydrogel at 96% water content having hyperbranched silica nanoparticles (HBSPs) as the major junction points, a hysteresis&#8208;free material is realized. The fatigue&#8208;free characteristic of these composite hydrogels is evidenced by the invariance of the stress&#8211;strain curves at strain ratios of 4, even after 5000 cycles. At a strain ratio of 7, only a 1.3% hysteresis is observed. A markedly increased strain&#8208;ratio&#8208;at&#8208;break of 11.5 is observed. The unique attributes of these resilient hydrogels are manifested in the high&#8208;fidelity detection of dynamic deformations under cyclic loading over a broad range of frequencies, difficult to achieve with other materials.

         <title>Microfluidic Screening&#8208;Assisted Machine Learning to Investigate Vertical Phase Separation of Small Molecule:Polymer Blend</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic channel embedded solution shearing is developed, which enables time&#8208; and resource&#8208;efficient generation and screening of thin&#8208;films of varying experimental conditions. Gaussian Process Regression algorithm tuned by Bayesian optimization is utilized to predict the transistor performance, optimize the experimental conditions, and investigate the vertical phase separation during solvent evaporation.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;based thin&#8208;film processing is a widely utilized technique for the fabrication of various devices. In particular, the tunability of the ink composition and coating condition allows precise control of thin&#8208;film properties and device performance. Despite the advantage of having such tunability, the sheer number of possible combinations of experimental parameters render it infeasible to efficiently optimize device performance and analyze the correlation between experimental parameters and device performance. In this work, a microfluidic screening&#8208;embedded thin&#8208;film processing technique is developed, through which thin&#8208;films of varying ratios of small molecule semiconductor:polymer blend are simultaneously generated and screened in a time&#8208; and resource&#8208;efficient manner. Moreover, utilizing the thin&#8208;films of varying combinations of experimental parameters, machine learning models are trained to predict the transistor performance. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) algorithms tuned by Bayesian optimization shows the best predictive accuracy amongst the trained models, which enables narrowing down of the combinations of experimental parameters and investigation of the degree of vertical phase separation under the predicted parameter space. The technique can serve as a guideline for elucidating the underlying complex parameter&#8208;property&#8208;performance correlations in solution&#8208;based thin&#8208;film processing, thereby accelerating the optimization of various thin&#8208;film devices in the future.

         <title>High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Organic Electrochemical Diodes Enabled by Asymmetric Active Layer Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric design of the organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor layer allows for the rectification of input signals with a high current density of over 30 kA cm&#8722;2 in an aqueous electrolyte. The operation mechanism is elucidated with the help of numerical analysis and in operando electrochemical potential mapping methods, and analog/digital circuits are demonstrated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of these novel device architectures.








Abstract
Owing to their outstanding electrical/electrochemical performance, operational stability, mechanical flexibility, and decent biocompatibility, organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors have shown great potential as implantable electrodes for neural recording/stimulation and as active channels for signal switching/amplifying transistors. Nonetheless, no studies exist on a general design rule for high&#8208;performance electrochemical diodes, which are essential for highly functional circuit architectures. In this work, generalizable electrochemical diodes with a very high current density over 30 kA cm&#8722;2 are designed by introducing an asymmetric active layer based on organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors. The underlying mechanism on polarity&#8208;sensitive balanced ionic doping/dedoping is elucidated by numerical device analysis and in operando spectroelectrochemical potential mapping, while the general material requirements for electrochemical diode operation are deduced using various types of conjugated polymers. In parallel, analog signal rectification and digital logic processing circuits are successfully demonstrated to show the broad impact of circuits incorporating organic electrochemical diodes. It is expected that organic electrochemical diodes will play vital roles in realizing multifunctional soft bioelectronic circuitry in combination with organic electrochemical transistors.

         <title>Dielectric&#8208;Modulated Biosensing with Ultrahigh&#8208;Frequency&#8208;Operated Graphene Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>

         <dc:description>
Electrolyte&#8208;gated graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (Gr&#8208;FETs) are configured in reflectometry mode at ultrahigh frequencies (UHF), where the conductivity of high&#8208;salt solutions, and thus the ionic screening is fully cancelled. By simultaneous characterization using field effect and UHF reflectometry, dielectric&#8208;modulated Gr&#8208;FET biosensors with high sensitivities are achieved.








Abstract
Owing to their excellent electrical properties and chemical stability, graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (Gr&#8208;FET) are extensively studied for biosensing applications. However, hinging on surface interactions of charged biomolecules, the sensitivity of Gr&#8208;FET is hampered by ionic screening under physiological conditions with high salt concentrations up to frequencies as high as MHz. Here, an electrolyte&#8208;gated Gr&#8208;FET in reflectometry mode at ultrahigh frequencies (UHF, around 2&#160;GHz), where the ionic screening is fully cancelled and the dielectric sensitivity of the device allows the Gr&#8208;FET to directly function in high&#8208;salt solutions, is configured. Strikingly, by simultaneous characterization using electrolyte gating and UHF reflectometry, the developed graphene biosensors offer unprecedented capability for real&#8208;time monitoring of dielectric&#8208;specified biomolecular/cell interactions/activities, with superior limit of detection compared to that of previously reported nanoscale high&#8208;frequency sensors. These achievements highlight the unique potential of ultrahigh&#8208;frequency operation for unblocking the true potential of graphene biosensors for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostic.

         <title>A Multilevel Analytical Theory for Prediction of Ferroelectric Perovskite Oxide Properties from Composition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multilevel model for the prediction of the technologically important properties of perovskite oxide ferroelectric solid solutions is developed, starting at the level of the electronic structure and chemical bonding of the constituent ions and ending at the level of collective macroscopic behavior. This approach is likely to be generally applicable to different classes of materials and functional properties.








Abstract
Prediction of properties from composition is a fundamental goal of materials science that is particularly relevant for ferroelectric perovskite oxide solid solutions where compositional variation is a primary tool for material design. Design of ferroelectric oxide solid solutions has been guided by heuristics and first&#8208;principles and Landau&#8211;Ginzburg&#8211;Devonshire theoretical methods that become increasingly difficult to apply in ternary, quaternary, and quintary solid solutions. To address this problem, a multilevel model is developed for the prediction of the ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric transition temperature (Tc), coercive field (Ec), and polarization (P) of PbTiO3&#8208;derived ferroelectric solid solutions from composition. The characteristics of the materials at different length scales, starting at the level of the electronic structure and chemical bonding of the constituent ions and ending at the level of collective behavior, are analytically related by using ferroelectric domain walls and cationic off&#8208;center displacements as the key links between the different levels of the model. The obtained composition&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationships provide a unified quantitatively predictive theory for understanding PbTiO3&#8208;derived solid solutions. Such a multilevel analytical modeling approach is likely to be generally applicable to different classes of ferroelectric perovskite oxides and to other functional properties, and to materials and properties beyond the field of ferroelectrics.

         <title>Self&#8208;Blockade of PD&#8208;L1 with Bacteria&#8208;Derived Outer&#8208;Membrane Vesicle for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An LyP1 polypeptide&#8208;modified outer&#8208;membrane vesicle loaded with a PD&#8208;1 plasmid is developed for inducing the self&#8208;expression of PD&#8208;1 by tumor cells and achieving self&#8208;blockade of the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 pathway. The outer&#8208;membrane protein component can recruit cytotoxic lymphocyte cells and natural killer cells to tumor microenvironment, further improving the antitumor activity of the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 self&#8208;blocking therapy.








Abstract
The checkpoint inhibitor therapy that blocks programmed death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1) and its major ligand PD&#8208;L1 has achieved encouraging clinical efficacy in certain cancers. However, the binding of checkpoint inhibitors with other immune cells that express PD&#8208;L1 often results in a low response rate to the blockade and severe adverse effects. Herein, an LyP1 polypeptide&#8208;modified outer&#8208;membrane vesicle (LOMV) loaded with a PD&#8208;1 plasmid is developed to achieve self&#8208;blockade of PD&#8208;L1 in tumor cells. The nanocarriers accumulate in the tumor tissue through OMV&#8208;targeting ability and are internalized into the tumor cells via the LyP1&#8208;mediated target, subsequently delivering PD&#8208;1 plasmid into the nucleus, leading to the expression of PD&#8208;1 by the tumor cells. In addition, a magnetic particle chemiluminescence kit is developed to quantitatively detect the binding rate of PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1. The self&#8208;expressed PD&#8208;1 bonded with the PD&#8208;L1 is expressed by both autologous and neighboring tumor cells, achieving self&#8208;blockade. Simultaneously, the outer&#8208;membrane protein of LOMV recruits cytotoxic lymphocyte cells and natural killer cells to tumor tissues and stimulates them to secrete IFN&#8208;&#947;&#8202;&#8202;, improving the antitumor activity of the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 self&#8208;blocking therapy.

         <title>Multifunctional Separator Allows Stable Cycling of Potassium Metal Anodes and of Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendrite&#8208;free potassium metal anode and potassium metal battery are achieved by a multifunctional separator of double&#8208;coated reactive AlF3 on polypropylene. It possesses improved electrolyte wetting and uptake, ion conductivity, and ion transference numbers, facilitating uniform K&#8208;ion flux, and plays as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), facilitating stable KF, Al2O3, and AlF3 SEI.








Abstract
This is the first report of a multifunctional separator for potassium&#8208;metal batteries (KMBs). Double&#8208;coated tape&#8208;cast microscale AlF3 on polypropylene (AlF3@PP) yields state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance: symmetric cells are stable after 1000 cycles (2000 h) at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2, with 0.042&#160;V overpotential. Stability is maintained at 5.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 600 cycles (240 h), with 0.138&#160;V overpotential. Postcycled plated surface is dendrite&#8208;free, while stripped surface contains smooth solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Conventional PP cells fail rapidly, with dendrites at plating, and &#8220;dead metal&#8221; and SEI clumps at stripping. Potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) cathode KMBs with AlF3@PP display enhanced capacity retention (91% at 100 cycles vs 58%). AlF3 partially reacts with K to form an artificial SEI containing KF, AlF3, and Al2O3 phases. The AlF3@PP promotes complete electrolyte wetting and enhances uptake, improves ion conductivity, and increases ion transference number. The higher of K+ transference number is ascribed to the strong interaction between AlF3 and FSI&#8722; anions, as revealed through 19F NMR. The enhancement in wetting and performance is general, being demonstrated with ester&#8208; and ether&#8208;based solvents, with K&#8208;, Na&#8208;, or Li&#8208; salts, and with different commercial separators. In full batteries, AlF3 prevents Fe crossover and cycling&#8208;induced cathode pulverization.

         <title>Revealing the Sulfur Redox Paths in a Li&#8211;S Battery by an In Situ Hyphenated Technique of Electrochemistry and Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactions of sulfur in a Li&#8211;S battery are very complicated and the evaluation of their mechanism is challenging. Many hidden information can be easily revealed by an in situ electrochemistry and mass spectrometry (EC&#8208;MS) and it shines a light for design novel catalyst and system for the Li&#8211;S battery.








Abstract
The lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is one of the most promising next generation energy storage systems due to its high theoretical specific energy. However, the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides formed during cell operation is a crucial reason for the low cyclability suffered by current Li&#8211;S batteries. As a result, an in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of the sulfur cathode redox reactions is urgently required for further advancement of Li&#8211;S batteries. Herein, the direct observation of polysulfides in a Li&#8208;S battery is reported by an in situ hyphenated technique of electrochemistry and mass spectrometry. Several short&#8208;lived lithium polysulfide intermediates during sulfur redox have been identified. Furthermore, this method is applied to a mechanistic study of an electrocatalyst that has been observed to promote the polysulfides conversion in a Li&#8211;S cell. Through the abundance distributions of various polysulfides before and after adding the electrocatalyst, compelling experimental evidences of catalytic selectivity of cobalt phthalocyanine to those long&#8208;chain polysulfide intermediates are obtained. This work can provide guidance for the design of novel cathode to overcome the shuttle effect and facilitate the sulfur redox kinetics.

         <title>Rational Design of Covalent Heptazine Frameworks with Spatially Separated Redox Centers for High&#8208;Efficiency Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent heptazine frameworks (CHFs) with spatially separated redox centers are rationally designed from the molecular level. The spatial separation feature is critical for enhancing surface charge separation and achieving efficient H2O2 production. This study establishes a new foundation for the future development of metal&#8208;free polymer photocatalysts toward various photocatalytic overall reactions.








Abstract
The redox reaction centers in natural organisms conducting oxygenic photosynthesis are well arranged in a physically separated manner to convert sunlight into chemical energy efficiently. Mimicking natural photosynthesis via precisely constructing oxidative and reductive reaction centers within photocatalysts is ideal for enhancing catalytic performances in artificial photosynthesis. In this study, new covalent heptazine frameworks (CHFs) with spatially separated redox centers are rationally designed for photocatalytic production of H2O2 from water and oxygen without using any sacrificial agents. Both experimental and computational investigations indicate that the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction occurs on the heptazine moiety, whereas the two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction occurs on the acetylene or diacetylene bond in the CHFs. This unique spatial separation feature is critical for enhancing charge separation and achieving efficient H2O2 production. Meanwhile, the measured exciton binding energy of the diacetylene&#8208;containing polymer is merely 24 meV. Under simulated solar irradiation, the rationally designed CHFs can achieve a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.78%, surpassing previously reported photocatalytic materials. This study establishes a molecular engineering approach to construct periodically arranged and spatially separated redox centers in single&#8208;component polymer photocatalysts, representing a hallmark to create more exciting polymer structures for photocatalysis moving forward.

         <title>Unraveling the Molar Mass Dependence of Shearing&#8208;Induced Aggregation Structure of a High&#8208;Mobility Polymer Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molar mass dependence on aggregation structure evolution and charge transport of TDPP&#8208;Se is thoroughly examined by neutron scattering and complementary techniques. The rod&#8208;like preaggregate with moderate length favors a highly aligned and ordered structure by bar coating. Hence, a reliable hole mobility up to &#8776;14 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 is recorded for thin&#8208;film transistors using diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymers.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;structure formation of conjugated polymers is a fundamental problem in the field of organic electronics and remains poorly understood. Herein, the molar mass dependence of the aggregation structure of a high&#8208;mobility conjugated copolymer (TDPP&#8208;Se) comprising thiophene&#8208;flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole and selenophene is thoroughly shown. Five batches of TDPP&#8208;Se are prepared with the number&#8208;average molecular weights (Mn) varied greatly from 21 to 135&#160;kg mol&#8722;1. Small&#8208;angle neutron scattering and transmission electron microscopy are combined to probe the solution structure of these polymers, consistently using a deuterated solvent. All the polymers adopt 1D rod&#8208;like aggregation structures and the radius of the 1D rods is not sensitive to the Mn, while the length increases monotonically with Mn. By utilizing the ordered packing of the aggregated structure in solution, a highly aligned and ordered film is prepared and, thereafter, a reliable hole mobility of 13.8 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 is realized in organic thin&#8208;film transistors with the moderate Mn batch via bar coating. The hole mobility is among the highest values reported for diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymers. This work paves the way to visualize the real aggregated structure of polymer semiconductors in solution and sheds light on the microstructure control of high&#8208;performance electronic devices.

         <title>Highly Efficient Photothermal Conversion and Water Transport during Solar Evaporation Enabled by Amorphous Hollow Multishelled Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous Ta2O5/C nanocomposite with a hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is prepared for the first time. This HoMS results in highly efficient energy conversion and rapid water transport, achieving superfast evaporation speed with long&#8208;term stability. A World Health Organization standard drinkable water can be achieved from seawater, water containing metallic ions, and extremely acidic/alkaline , radioactive, and virus&#8208;polluted water.








Abstract
Solar evaporation, which enables water purification without consuming fossil fuels, has been considered the most promising strategy to address global scarcity of drinkable water. However, the suboptimal structure and composition designs still result in a trade&#8208;off between photothermal conversion, water transport, and tolerance to harsh environments. Here, an ultrastable amorphous Ta2O5/C nanocomposite is designed with a hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) for solar evaporation. This HoMS results in highly efficient photoabsorption and photothermal conversion, as well as a decrease of the actual water evaporation enthalpy. A superfast evaporation speed of 4.02&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 is achieved. More importantly, a World Health Organization standard drinkable water can be achieved from seawater, heavy&#8208;metal&#8208; and bacteria&#8208;containing water, and even from extremely acidic/alkaline or radioactive water sources. Notably, the concentration of pseudovirus SC2&#8208;P can be decreased by 6 orders of magnitude after evaporation.

         <title>Reliable and Remote Monitoring of Absolute Temperature during Liver Inflammation via Luminescence&#8208;Lifetime&#8208;Based Nanothermometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lifetime&#8208;based infrared luminescent nanothermometers are shown to be minimally affected by the effects of biological tissues on the propagation of photons. Real&#8208;time and reliable thermal monitoring of the liver of a mouse subjected to lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced inflammation is achieved through the use of bright Ag2S nanoparticles. Remarkable thermal sensitivity (3% &#176;C&#8211;1 around 37 &#176;C) and thermal resolution (smaller than 0.3 &#176;C) are obtained.








Abstract
Temperature of tissues and organs is one of the first parameters affected by physiological and pathological processes, such as metabolic activity, acute trauma, or infection&#8208;induced inflammation. Therefore, the onset and development of these processes can be detected by monitoring deviations from basal temperature. To accomplish this, minimally invasive, reliable, and accurate measurement of the absolute temperature of internal organs is required. Luminescence nanothermometry is the ideal technology for meeting these requirements. Although this technique has lately undergone remarkable developments, its reliability is being questioned due to spectral distortions caused by biological tissues. In this work, how the use of bright Ag2S nanoparticles featuring temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence lifetime enables reliable and accurate measurement of the absolute temperature of the liver in mice subjected to lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced inflammation is demonstrated. Beyond the remarkable thermal sensitivity (&#8776; 3% &#176;C&#8211;1 around 37 &#176;C) and thermal resolution obtained (smaller than 0.3 &#176;C), the results included in this work set a blueprint for the development of new diagnostic procedures based on the use of intracorporeal temperature as a physiological indicator.

         <title>Honeycomb&#8208;Structure RuI3, A New Quantum Material Related to &#945;&#8208;RuCl3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Honeycomb&#8208;layer&#8208;structure RuI3 is synthesized at moderately high pressures. Preliminary characterization reveals metallic, paramagnetic behavior with no long&#8208;range magnetic order down to 0.35&#160;K, and an unusually large T&#8208;linear contribution to the heat capacity. This RuI3 phase with a layered honeycomb lattice and strong spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupling, may provide a new route for the characterization of quantum materials.








Abstract
The layered honeycomb lattice material &#945;&#8208;RuCl3 has emerged as a prime candidate for displaying the Kitaev quantum spin liquid state, and as such has attracted much research interest. Here a new layered honeycomb lattice polymorph of RuI3, a material that is strongly chemically and structurally related to &#945;&#8208;RuCl3 is described. The material is synthesized at moderately elevated pressures and is stable under ambient conditions. Preliminary characterization reveals that it is a metallic conductor, with the absence of long&#8208;range magnetic order down to 0.35 K and an unusually large T&#8208;linear contribution to the heat capacity. It is proposed that this phase, with a layered honeycomb lattice and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, provides a new route for the characterization of quantum materials.

         <title>Anisotropic Carrier Mobility from 2H WSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic carrier mobility is realized in 2H WSe2. The intrinsic screening layer responds to the electrical anisotropy, which is confirmed by theoretical calculations and experimental results, excluding phonon scattering, impurity ions scattering, and defect scattering. The electrical anisotropy provides a degree of freedom for adjusting the physical properties and is an essential step for exploring and integrating transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) transistors in multi&#8208;terminal artificial synaptic devices.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with 2H phase are expected to be building blocks in next&#8208;generation electronics; however, they suffer from electrical anisotropy, which is the basics for multi&#8208;terminal artificial synaptic devices, digital inverters, and anisotropic memtransistors, which are highly desired in neuromorphic computing.

&lt;p&gt;Anisotropic carrier mobility is realized in 2H WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The intrinsic screening layer responds to the electrical anisotropy, which is confirmed by theoretical calculations and experimental results, excluding phonon scattering, impurity ions scattering, and defect scattering. The electrical anisotropy provides a degree of freedom for adjusting the physical properties and is an essential step for exploring and integrating transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) transistors in multi-terminal artificial synaptic devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with 2H phase are expected to be building blocks in next-generation electronics; however, they suffer from electrical anisotropy, which is the basics for multi-terminal artificial synaptic devices, digital inverters, and anisotropic memtransistors, which are highly desired in neuromorphic computing. Herein, the anisotropic carrier mobility from 2H WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reported, where the anisotropic degree of carrier mobility spans from 0.16 to 0.95 for various WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; field-effect transistors under a gate voltage of &#8722;60&#160;V. Phonon scattering, impurity ions scattering, and defect scattering are excluded for anisotropic mobility. An intrinsic screening layer is proposed and confirmed by &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging to respond to the electrical anisotropy. Seven types of intrinsic screening layers are created and calculated by density functional theory to evaluate the modulated electronic structures, effective masses, and scattering intensities, resulting in anisotropic mobility. The discovery of anisotropic carrier mobility from 2H WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; provides a degree of freedom for adjusting the physical properties of 2H TMDCs and fertile ground for exploring and integrating TMDC electronic transistors with better performance along the direction of high mobility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8211;Phenolic&#8208;Network&#8208;Coated Dendrimer&#8211;Drug Conjugates for Tumor MR Imaging and Chemo/Chemodynamic Therapy via Amplification of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress</title>

         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;phenolic&#8208;network&#8208;coated dendrimer&#8211;drug conjugates are constructed as a novel theranostic nanoplatform based on endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) amplification. The generated nanocomplexes can responsively release the ERS drug toyocamycin in the tumor microenvironment, while the coated iron&#8211;tannic acid network can generate cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals, thus rendering ERS amplification for combined chemo/chemodynamic therapy of tumors under the guidance of magnetic resonance imaging.








Abstract
Amplification of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) to realize enhanced cancer therapy has been considered to be unique in current cancer nanomedicine design. Herein, the design of metal&#8211;phenolic&#8208;network&#8208;coated dendrimer&#8211;drug conjugates as a novel theranostic nanoplatform based on ERS amplification is reported. In the design, acetylated generation&#8208;5 poly(amidoamine) dendrimers are conjugated with an ERS drug, toyocamycin (Toy), through the attached phenylboronic acid moiety, and coated with an iron (Fe)&#8211;tannic acid (TF) network. The generated nanocomplexes with a size of 50.2&#160;nm are stable under the physiological environment, and can rapidly release Toy under the tumor microenvironment due to the pH&#8208; and reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species&#8208;responsive boronic ester bonds to effectively inhibit the ERS&#8208;mediated cancer cell adaptation. Meanwhile, the coated TF network enables the nanocomplexes to generate cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals through a Fenton reaction, amplifying the ERS for improved chemo/chemodynamic therapy of cancer cells in vitro and a xenografted breast tumor model in vivo. Moreover, the coating of TF also renders the complexes with an eminent r1 relaxivity for in vivo T1&#8208;weighted tumor magnetic resonance imaging. The created intelligent nanocomplexes may represent an advanced nanomedicine formulation uniquely integrated with a metal&#8211;phenolic network and dendrimer nanotechnology for imaging&#8208;guided cancer therapy through ERS amplification.

         <title>A Mechanically Interlocking Strategy Based on Conductive Microbridges for Stretchable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solderless stretchable interconnections (SLSIs) are developed to realize the assembly of individual soft devices toward multifunctional all&#8208;stretchable integrated platforms. This stretchable interconnection can effectively bridge interlayer conductivity with tight adhesion through regional functionality. SLSIs show promising stretchability up to a strain of 35% (R/R0&#160;&#8804; 5) and can be adopted to achieve an all&#8208;stretchable self&#8208;powered data acquisition platform.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics incorporating critical sensing, data transmission, display and powering functionalities, is crucial to emerging wearable healthcare applications. To date, methods to achieve stretchability of individual functional devices have been extensively investigated. However, integration strategies of these stretchable devices to achieve all&#8208;stretchable systems are still under exploration, in which the reliable stretchable interconnection is a key element. Here, solderless stretchable interconnections based on mechanically interlocking microbridges are developed to realize the assembly of individual stretchable devices onto soft patternable circuits toward multifunctional all&#8208;stretchable platforms. This stretchable interconnection can effectively bridge interlayer conductivity with tight adhesion through both conductive microbridges and selectively distributed adhesive polymer. Consequently, enhanced stretchability up to a strain of 35% (R/R0&#160;&#8804; 5) is shown, compared with conventional solder&#8208;assisted connections which lose electrical conduction at a strain of less than 5% (R/R0&#160;&#8776; 30). As a proof of concept, a self&#8208;powered all&#8208;stretchable data&#8208;acquisition platform is fabricated by surface mounting a stretchable strain sensor and a supercapacitor onto a soft circuit through solderless interconnections. This solderless interconnecting strategy for surface&#8208;mountable devices can be utilized as a valuable technology for the integration of stretchable devices to achieve all&#8208;soft multifunctional systems.

A low&#8208;voltage, long&#8208;endurance, and power&#8208;dense dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) based on novel multiple&#8208;layer fabrication methods and electrode&#8208;material optimization is presented. An insect&#8208;scale micro&#8208;aerial&#8208;vehicle (MAV) is designed with this DEA. The robot achieves the best&#8208;performing and longest hovering flight among sub&#8208;gram MAVs. This type of DEA shows promise in making next&#8208;generation agile soft robots.








Abstract
Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are a special class of artificial muscles that have been used to construct animal&#8208;like soft robotic systems. However, compared with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art rigid actuators such as piezoelectric bimorphs and electromagnetic motors, most DEAs require higher driving voltages, and their power density and lifetime remain substantially lower. These limitations pose significant challenges for developing agile and powered autonomous soft robots. Here, a low&#8208;voltage, high&#8208;endurance, and power&#8208;dense DEA based on novel multiple&#8208;layering techniques and electrode&#8208;material optimization, is reported. When operated at 400&#160;Hz, the 143&#160;mg DEA generates forces of 0.36 N and displacements of 1.15&#160;mm. This DEA is incorporated into an aerial robot to demonstrate high performance. The robot achieves a high lift&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio of 3.7, a low hovering voltage of 500&#160;V, and a long lifetime that exceeds 2 million actuation cycles. With 20 s of hovering time, and position and attitude error smaller than 2.5&#160;cm and 2&#176;, respectively, the robot demonstrates the longest and best&#8208;performing flight among existing sub&#8208;gram aerial robots. This important milestone demonstrates that soft robots can outperform their state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art rigid counterparts, and it provides an important step toward realizing power autonomy in soft robotic flights.

         <title>Simultaneous Large Optical and Piezoelectric Effects Induced by Domain Reconfiguration Related to Ferroelectric Phase Transitions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In domain&#8208;engineered relaxor ferroelectric crystals of Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)O3&#8211;Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3&#8211;PbTiO3, reversible and repeatable phase transitions from the as&#8208;poled polydomain rhombohedral state to a monodomain monoclinic state can be stimulated by electric field or stress. These transitions lead to bimodal functionality&#8212;variable optical transparency as well as a giant effective piezoelectric effect.








Abstract
Electrical switching of ferroelectric domains and subsequent domain wall motion promotes strong piezoelectric activity, however, light scatters at refractive index discontinuities such as those found at domain wall boundaries. Thus, simultaneously achieving large piezoelectric effect and high optical transmissivity is generally deemed infeasible. Here, it is demonstrated that the ferroelectric domains in perovskite Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)O3&#8211;Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3&#8211;PbTiO3 domain&#8208;engineered crystals can be manipulated by electrical field and mechanical stress to reversibly and repeatably, with small hysteresis, transform the opaque polydomain structure into a highly transparent monodomain state. This control of optical properties can be achieved at very low electric fields (less than 1.5&#160;kV cm&#8722;1) and is accompanied by a large (&gt;10&#160;000 pm V&#8722;1) piezoelectric coefficient that is superior to linear state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials by a factor of three or more.

&lt;p&gt;In domain-engineered relaxor ferroelectric crystals of Pb(In&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;Pb(Mg&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, reversible and repeatable phase transitions from the as-poled polydomain rhombohedral state to a monodomain monoclinic state can be stimulated by electric field or stress. These transitions lead to bimodal functionality&#8212;variable optical transparency as well as a giant effective piezoelectric effect.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrical switching of ferroelectric domains and subsequent domain wall motion promotes strong piezoelectric activity, however, light scatters at refractive index discontinuities such as those found at domain wall boundaries. Thus, simultaneously achieving large piezoelectric effect and high optical transmissivity is generally deemed infeasible. Here, it is demonstrated that the ferroelectric domains in perovskite Pb(In&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;Pb(Mg&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; domain-engineered crystals can be manipulated by electrical field and mechanical stress to reversibly and repeatably, with small hysteresis, transform the opaque polydomain structure into a highly transparent monodomain state. This control of optical properties can be achieved at very low electric fields (less than 1.5&#160;kV cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and is accompanied by a large (&amp;gt;10&#160;000 pm V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) piezoelectric coefficient that is superior to linear state-of-the-art materials by a factor of three or more. The coexistence of tunable optical transmissivity and high piezoelectricity paves the way for a new class of photonic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mixed Dimethylammonium/Methylammonium Lead Halide Perovskite Crystals for Improved Structural Stability and Enhanced Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A newly developed technique termed solvent acidolysis crystallization (SAC) allows the growth of mixed dimethylammonium/methylammonium lead tribromide crystals with the highest, as of yet, dimethylammonium incorporation of 44% while maintaining the perovskite cubic phase. This mixed cation composition not only suppresses the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition but also leads to improved photodetection capabilities both at room temperature and 200 K.








Abstract
The solvent acidolysis crystallization technique is utilized to grow mixed dimethylammonium/methylammonium lead tribromide (DMA/MAPbBr3) crystals reaching the highest dimethylammonium incorporation of 44% while maintaining the 3D cubic perovskite phase. These mixed perovskite crystals show suppression of the orthorhombic phase and a lower tetragonal&#8208;to&#8208;cubic phase&#8208;transition temperature compared to MAPbBr3. A distinct behavior is observed in the temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence properties of MAPbBr3 and mixed DMA/MAPbBr3 crystals due to the different organic cation dynamics governing the phase transition(s). Furthermore, lateral photodetectors based on these crystals show that, at room temperature, the mixed crystals possess higher detectivity compared to MAPbBr3 crystals caused by structural compression and reduced surface trap density. Remarkably, the mixed&#8208;crystal devices exhibit large enhancement in their detectivity below the phase&#8208;transition temperature (at 200 K), while for the MAPbBr3 devices only insignificant changes are observed. The high detectivity of the mixed crystals makes them attractive for visible&#8208;light communication and for space applications. The results highlight the importance of the synthetic technique for compositional engineering of halide perovskites that governs their structural and optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Tailoring Layer Number of 2D Porphyrin&#8208;Based MOFs Towards Photocoupled Electroreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Freestanding monolayer and bilayer 2D porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks can be easily synthesized via bottom&#8208;up growth. Interestingly, a difference in the atomic layer number results in a distinct catalytic pathway of photocoupled electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. The monolayer exhibits a high selectivity of C2 species, while the major products over the bilayer are C1 species. The photocoupled electrocatalytic mechanisms are further studied.








Abstract
Inspired by the success of graphene, a series of single&#8208; or few&#8208;layer 2D materials have been developed and applied in the past decade. Here, the successful preparation of monolayer and bilayer 2D porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by a facile solvothermal method is reported. The structure transition from monolayer to bilayer drives distinct electronic properties and restructuring behaviors, which finally results in distinct catalytic pathways towards CO2 electrocatalysis. The monolayer favors CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 pathway due to the restructuring of Cu&#63743;O4 sites, while CO and HCOO&#8722; are the major products over the bilayer. In photocoupled electrocatalysis, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of the C2 compounds shows a nearly fourfold increase on the monolayer than that under dark conditions (FEC2 increases from 11.9% to 41.1% at &#8722;1.4&#160;V). For comparison, the light field plays a negligible effect on the bilayer. The light&#8208;induced selectivity optimization is investigated by experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work opens up a novel possibility to tune the selectivity of carbon products just by tailoring the layer number of the 2D material.

         <title>Scalable Van der Waals Encapsulation by Inorganic Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an effective van der Waals passivation method for 2D materials with inorganic molecular crystal Sb2O3 as the encapsulation layer is developed. The scalable encapsulation method, carried out through a complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;compatible manufacturing process, opens unprecedented opportunities for 2D materials to be applied in optoelectronic devices toward chip&#8208;level development.








Abstract
Encapsulation is critical for devices to guarantee their stability and reliability. It becomes an even more essential requirement for devices based on 2D materials with atomic thinness and far inferior stability compared to their bulk counterparts. Here a general van der Waals (vdW) encapsulation method for 2D materials using Sb2O3 layer of inorganic molecular crystal fabricated via thermal evaporation deposition is reported. It is demonstrated that such a scalable encapsulation method not only maintains the intrinsic properties of typical air&#8208;susceptible 2D materials due to their vdW interactions but also remarkably improves their environmental stability. Specifically, the encapsulated black phosphorus (BP) exhibits greatly enhanced structural stability of over 80 days and more sustaining&#8208;electrical properties of 19 days, while the bare BP undergoes degradation within hours. Moreover, the encapsulation layer can be facilely removed by sublimation in vacuum without damaging the underlying materials. This scalable encapsulation method shows a promising pathway to effectively enhance the environmental stability of 2D materials, which may further boost their practical application in novel (opto)electronic devices.

         <title>Guiding Transition Metal&#8208;Doped Hollow Cerium Tandem Nanozymes with Elaborately Regulated Multi&#8208;Enzymatic Activities for Intensive Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hollow mesoporous Mn/Zr&#8208;co&#8208;doped CeO2 tandem nanozyme is developed, serving as an H2O2 homeostasis disruptor to promote H2O2 evolvement, restrain the off&#8208;target elimination of H2O2, and realize intensive nanozyme&#8208;initiated chemodynamic therapy of tumor. T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging and high&#8208;contrast X&#8208;ray computed tomography imaging are also achieved using the nanozyme for in vivo tracking of the therapeutic process.








Abstract
Clinical applications of nanozyme&#8208;initiated chemodynamic therapy (NCDT) have been severely limited by the poor catalytic efficiency of nanozymes, insufficient endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content, and its off&#8208;target consumption. Herein, the authors&#160;developed a hollow mesoporous Mn/Zr&#8208;co&#8208;doped CeO2 tandem nanozyme (PHMZCO&#8208;AT) with regulated multi&#8208;enzymatic activities, that is, the enhancement of superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;like and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activities and inhibition of catalase (CAT)&#8208;like activity. PHMZCO&#8208;AT as a H2O2 homeostasis disruptor promotes H2O2 evolution and restrains off&#8208;target elimination of H2O2 to achieve intensive NCDT. PHMZCO&#8208;AT with SOD&#8208;like activity catalyzes endogenous superoxide anion (O2&#8226;&#8722;) into H2O2 in the tumor region. The suppression of CAT activity and depletion of glutathione by PHMZCO&#8208;AT largely weaken the off&#8208;target decomposition of H2O2 to H2O. Elevated H2O2 is then catalyzed by the downstream POD&#8208;like activity of PHMZCO&#8208;AT to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals, further inducing tumor apoptosis and death. T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging and X&#8208;ray computed tomography imaging are also achieved using PHMZCO&#8208;AT due to the existence of paramagnetic Mn2+ and the high X&#8208;ray attenuation ability of elemental Zr, permitting in vivo tracking of the therapeutic process. This work presents a typical paradigm to achieve intensive NCDT efficacy by regulating multi&#8208;enzymatic activities of nanozymes to perturb the H2O2 homeostasis.

&lt;p&gt;A hollow mesoporous Mn/Zr-co-doped CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tandem nanozyme is developed, serving as an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; homeostasis disruptor to promote H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolvement, restrain the off-target elimination of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and realize intensive nanozyme-initiated chemodynamic therapy of tumor. &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and high-contrast X-ray computed tomography imaging are also achieved using the nanozyme for in vivo tracking of the therapeutic process.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical applications of nanozyme-initiated chemodynamic therapy (NCDT) have been severely limited by the poor catalytic efficiency of nanozymes, insufficient endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) content, and its off-target consumption. Herein, the authors&#160;developed a hollow mesoporous Mn/Zr-co-doped CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tandem nanozyme (PHMZCO-AT) with regulated multi-enzymatic activities, that is, the enhancement of superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like and peroxidase (POD)-like activities and inhibition of catalase (CAT)-like activity. PHMZCO-AT as a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; homeostasis disruptor promotes H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution and restrains off-target elimination of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to achieve intensive NCDT. PHMZCO-AT with SOD-like activity catalyzes endogenous superoxide anion (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the tumor region. The suppression of CAT activity and depletion of glutathione by PHMZCO-AT largely weaken the off-target decomposition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Elevated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is then catalyzed by the downstream POD-like activity of PHMZCO-AT to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals, further inducing tumor apoptosis and death. &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and X-ray computed tomography imaging are also achieved using PHMZCO-AT due to the existence of paramagnetic Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and the high X-ray attenuation ability of elemental Zr, permitting in vivo tracking of the therapeutic process. This work presents a typical paradigm to achieve intensive NCDT efficacy by regulating multi-enzymatic activities of nanozymes to perturb the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Efficient NIR&#8208;II Type&#8208;I Photosensitizers for Photodynamic/Photothermal Therapy upon Regulating Chalcogen Elements</title>

         <dc:description>
Second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window semiconducting polymers (SPs) for type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy (PDT) through generating O2&#8226;&#8722; for hypoxic oncotherapy have not previously been reported. Upon tuning of chalcogen elements, the first type&#8208;I PDT NIR&#8208;II SPs are achieved due to narrowed &#916;EST and enlarged spin&#8211;orbit coupling constant. The suitable lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy and &#916;G&#160;&lt;&#160;0 provides ideas for designing type&#8208;I photosensitizers.








Abstract
Second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window type&#8208;I photosensitizers have intrinsic advantages in photodynamic/photothermal therapy (PDT/PTT) of some malignant tumors with deep infiltration, large size, complicated location, and low possibility of surgery/radiotherapy. Herein, three chalcogen&#8208;element&#8208;based donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type semiconducting polymers (poly[2,2&#8243;&#8208;((E)&#8208;4,4&#8243;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)&#8208;[6,6&#8243;&#8208;bithieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrolylidene]&#8208;5,5&#8243;(4H,4&#8243;H)&#8208;dione)&#8208;alt&#8208;2,5&#8208;(thiophene)] (PTS), poly[2,2&#8243;&#8208;((E)&#8208;4,4&#8243;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)&#8208;[6,6&#8243;&#8208;bithieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrolylidene]&#8208;5,5&#8243;(4H,4&#8243;H)&#8208;dione)&#8208;alt&#8208;2,5&#8208;(selenophene)] (PTSe), and poly[2,2&#8243;&#8208;((E)&#8208;4,4&#8243;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)&#8208;[6,6&#8243;&#8208;bithieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrolylidene]&#8208;5,5&#8243;(4H,4&#8242;H)&#8208;dione)&#8208;alt&#8208;2,5&#8208;(tellurophene)] (PTTe)) are synthesized and fully characterized, demonstrating strong absorption in the NIR&#8208;II region. Upon adjusting the chalcogen elements, the intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer characteristics and the heavy&#8208;atom effect are tuned to enhance the intersystem crossing rate, improving the photodynamic effect. Moreover, the energy levels and Gibbs free energies are tuned to facilitate the type&#8208;I photodynamic process. As a result, PTTe nanoparticles (NPs) produce superoxide anion radicals (O2&#8226;&#8722;) more efficiently and demonstrate higher photothermal conversion efficiency than PTS and PTSe NPs upon NIR&#8208;II (1064&#160;nm) laser irradiation, exhibiting unprecedented NIR&#8208;II type&#8208;I PDT/PTT performance in vitro and in vivo. This work provides ideas for achieving high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II type&#8208;I PDT/PTT semiconducting polymers for hypoxic oncotherapy.

         <title>Capillary&#8208;Confinement Crystallization for Monolayer Molecular Crystal Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general solution procedure named the &#8220;soft&#8208;template&#8208;assisted&#8208;assembly method&#8221; is developed to prepare centimeter&#8208;scale monolayer molecular crystal (MMC) arrays with precise regulation over their size and location. The MMC&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistors show extraordinary uniformity with the lowest coefficient of variation on record (4.4%). The direct observation and fluent simulations of the formation of MMCs show that the crystallization process is confined via capillary.








Abstract
Organic single&#8208;crystalline semiconductors are highly desired for the fabrication of integrated electronic circuits, yet their uniform growth and efficient patterning is a huge challenge. Here, a general solution procedure named the &#8220;soft&#8208;template&#8208;assisted&#8208;assembly method&#8221; is developed to prepare centimeter&#8208;scale monolayer molecular crystal (MMC) arrays with precise regulation over their size and location via a capillary&#8208;confinement crystallization process. It is remarkable that the field&#8208;effect mobility of the array is highly uniform, with variation less than 4.4%, which demonstrates the most uniform organic single&#8208;crystal arrays ever reported so far. Simulations based on fluid dynamics are carried out to understand the function mechanism of this method. Thanks to the ultrasmooth crystalline orientation surface of MMCs, high&#8208;quality p&#8211;n heterojunction arrays can be prepared by weak epitaxy growth of n&#8208;type material atop the MMC. The p&#8211;n heterojunction field&#8208;effect transistors show ambipolar characteristics and the corresponding inverters constructed by these heterojunctions exhibit a competitive gain of 155. This work provides a general strategy to realize the preparation and application of logic complementary circuits based on patterned organic single crystals.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Selectivity and &#8220;Order&#8208;in&#8208;Disorder&#8221; Engineering in Carbon for Durable and Fast Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ defect&#8208;selectivity and &#8220;order&#8208;in&#8208;disorder&#8221; synergetic engineering in carbon materials via a self&#8208;template approach is developed to boost the K+&#8208;storage capacity, rate capability, and long&#8208;term cyclic stability simultaneously. In situ/ex situ characteristics and density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrate that carbon&#8208;vacancies possess higher reversibility and faster ion/electron migration kinetics than heteroatom&#8208;defects.








Abstract
Defect&#8208;rich carbon materials possess high gravimetric potassium storage capability due to the abundance of active sites, but their cyclic stability is limited because of the low reversibility of undesirable defects and the deteriorative conductivity. Herein, in situ defect&#8208;selectivity and order&#8208;in&#8208;disorder synergetic engineering in carbon via a self&#8208;template strategy is reported to boost the K+&#8208;storage capacity, rate capability and cyclic stability simultaneously. The defect&#8208;sites are selectively tuned to realize abundant reversible carbon&#8208;vacancies with the sacrifice of poorly reversible heteroatom&#8208;defects through the persistent gas release during pyrolysis. Meanwhile, nanobubbles generated during the pyrolysis serve as self&#8208;templates to induce the surface atom rearrangement, thus in situ embedding nanographitic networks in the defective domains without serious phase separation, which greatly enhances the intrinsic conductivity. The synergetic structure ensures high concentration of reversible carbon&#8208;vacancies and fast charge&#8208;transfer kinetics simultaneously, leading to high reversible capacity (425 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1), high&#8208;rate (237.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1), and superior cyclic stability (90.4% capacity retention from cycle 10 to 400 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1). This work provides a rational and facile strategy to realize the tradeoff between defect&#8208;sites and intrinsic conductivity, and gives deep insights into the mechanism of reversible potassium storage.

         <title>A ROS&#8208;Sensitive Nanozyme&#8208;Augmented Photoacoustic Nanoprobe for Early Diagnosis and Therapy of Acute Liver Failure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive nanozyme&#8208;augmented photoacoustic nanoprobe is developed for early diagnosis and therapy of acute liver failure (ALF). Deep&#8208;tissue detection of ROS in early ALF is achieved by the nanoprobe due to the synergy between nanocatalytic bubble generation and thermoelastic expansion. Meanwhile, nanozymes released from the nanoprobe can catalyze ROS into O2, allowing highly efficient therapy of ALF.








Abstract
Early diagnosis of acute liver failure (ALF) is critical for curable treatment of patients, because most existing ALF therapies have narrow therapeutic time windows after disease onset. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which lead to the sequential occurrences of hepatocyte necrosis and the leakage of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), represent early biomarkers of ALF. Photoacoustic imaging is emerging as a powerful tool for in vivo imaging of ROS. However, high&#8208;performance imaging probes that can boost the photoacoustic signals of the short&#8208;lived ROS of ALF are yet to be developed, and there remains a great challenge for ROS&#8208;based imaging of ALF. Herein, a ROS&#8208;sensitive nanozyme&#8208;augmented photoacoustic nanoprobe for successful in vivo imaging of ALF is presented. The deep&#8208;penetrating photoacoustic signals of the nanoprobe can be activated by the overexpressed ROS in ALF due to the synergy between nanocatalytic bubbles generation and thermoelastic expansion. Impressively, the nanozyme&#8208;augmented ROS imaging enables earlier diagnosis of ALF than the clinical ALT method, and the ROS&#8208;activated catalytic activity of nanoprobe permits timely nanocatalytic therapy of ALF.

         <title>Microstructurally Tailored Thin &#946;&#8208;Ag2Se Films toward Commercial Flexible Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag can be quickly and directly converted into &#946;&#8208;Ag2Se at room temperature in aqueous solution. The fabricated flexible thin films show power factor and figure of merit (zT) values as high as 2590&#160;&#177; 414 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 and 1.2&#160;&#177; 0.42, respectively. At &#8710;T&#160;= 30 K, a 4&#8208;leg flexible thermoelectric power generator shows high maximum output power density of 27.6&#160;&#177; 1.95 W m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Aiming to overcome both the structural and commercial limitations of flexible thermoelectric power generators, an efficient room&#8208;temperature aqueous selenization reaction that can be completed in air within less than 1&#160;min, to directly fabricate thin &#946;&#8208;Ag2Se films consisting of perfectly crystalline and large columnar grains with both in&#8208;plane randomness and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane [201] preferred orientation, is designed. A high power factor (PF) of 2590&#160;&#177; 414 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 and a figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (zT) of 1.2&#160;&#177; 0.42 are obtained from a sample with a thickness of &#8776;1&#160;&#181;m. The maximum output power density of the best 4&#8208;leg thermoelectric generator sample reach 27.6&#160;&#177; 1.95 and 124&#160;&#177; 8.78 W m&#8722;2 at room temperature with 30 and 60 K temperature differences, respectively, which may be useful in future flexible thermoelectric devices.

         <title>Kinetics Manipulation Enables High&#8208;Performance Thick Ternary Organic Solar Cells via R2R&#8208;Compatible Slot&#8208;Die Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient, thick ternary organic solar cells are fabricated by roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R)&#8208;compatible slot&#8208;die coating via kinetics manipulation. A highly crystalline molecule, BTR&#8208;Cl, is incorporated, and the phase&#8208;separation kinetics of the D18:Y6 film is regulated. The molecular crystallinity and vertical phase separation of the ternary blends is improved, which results in high power conversion efficiencies of 17.2% and 15.5% for photoactive films with thicknesses of 110 and 300 nm, respectively.








Abstract
Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has crossed the 18% mark for OSCs, which are largely fabricated by spin&#8208;coating, and the optimal photoactive thickness is limited to 100&#160;nm. To increase reproducibility of results with industrial roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) processing, slot&#8208;die coating coupled with a ternary strategy for optimal performance of large&#8208;area, thick OSCs is used. Based on miscibility differences, a highly crystalline molecule, BTR&#8208;Cl, is incorporated, and the phase&#8208;separation kinetics of the D18:Y6 film is regulated. BTR&#8208;Cl provides an early liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and early aggregation of Y6, which slightly improves the molecular crystallinity and vertical phase separation of the ternary blends, resulting in high PCEs of 17.2% and 15.5% for photoactive films with thicknesses of 110 and 300&#160;nm, respectively. The ternary design strategy for large&#8208;area and thick films is further used to fabricate high&#8208;efficiency flexible devices, which promises reproducibility of the lab results from slot&#8208;die coating to industrial R2R manufacturing.

         <title>Inorganic&#8208;Cation Pseudohalide 2D Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2 Perovskite Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2, an all&#8208;inorganic pseudo&#8208;halide 2D phase perovskite single crystal, is grown by an antisolvent vapor&#8208;assisted crystallization method at room temperature. It exhibits a reversible first&#8208;order phase transformation to CsPbBr3 at 450 K. Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2 has a low exciton binding energy (160 meV). The demonstrated photodetector produces respectable responsivity (8.46 mA W&#8722;1) and detectivity (1.2 &#215; 1010 Jones) at 0.5 V.








Abstract
Most of the reported 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) lead halide perovskites with the general formula of An+1BnX3n+1 (n&#160;= 1, 2, &#8230;) comprise layered perovskites separated by A&#8208;site&#8208;substituted organic spacers. To date, only a small number of X&#8208;site&#8208;substituted RP perovskites have been reported. Herein, the first inorganic&#8208;cation pseudohalide 2D phase perovskite single crystal, Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2, is reported. It is synthesized by the antisolvent vapor&#8208;assisted crystallization (AVC) method at room temperature. It exhibits a standard single&#8208;layer (n&#160;= 1) Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper structure described in space group of Pmmn (#59) and has a small separation (d&#160;= 1.69 &#197;) between the perovskite layers. The SCN&#8722; anions are found to bend the 2D Pb(SCN)2Br2 framework slightly into a kite&#8208;shaped octahedron, limiting the formation of a quasi&#8208;2D perovskite structure (n&#160;&gt; 1).&#160;This 2D single crystal exhibits a reversible first&#8208;order phase transformation to 3D CsPbBr3 (Pm3m #221) at 450 K. It has a low exciton binding energy of 160 meV&#8212;one of the lowest for 2D perovskites (n&#160;= 1). A Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2&#8208;single&#8208;crystal photodetector is demonstrated with respectable responsivity of 8.46&#160;mA W&#8722;1 and detectivity of &#8776;1.2 &#215; 1010 Jones at a low bias voltage of 0.5&#160;V.

It exhibits a standard single-layer (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;= 1) Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper structure described in space group of &lt;i&gt;Pmmn&lt;/i&gt; (#59) and has a small separation (&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&#160;= 1.69 &#197;) between the perovskite layers. The SCN&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions are found to bend the 2D Pb(SCN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; framework slightly into a kite-shaped octahedron, limiting the formation of a quasi-2D perovskite structure (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&amp;gt; 1).&#160;This 2D single crystal exhibits a reversible first-order phase transformation to 3D CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Pm&lt;/i&gt;3&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; #221) at 450 K. It has a low exciton binding energy of 160 meV&#8212;one of the lowest for 2D perovskites (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;= 1). A Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb(SCN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-single-crystal photodetector is demonstrated with respectable responsivity of 8.46&#160;mA W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and detectivity of &#8776;1.2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; Jones at a low bias voltage of 0.5&#160;V.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An NIR Discrete Metallacycle Constructed from Perylene Bisimide and Tetraphenylethylene Fluorophores for Imaging&#8208;Guided Cancer Radio&#8208;Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theranostic metallacycle (M) is developed for imaging&#8208;guided cancer radio&#8208;chemotherapy using perylene bisimide fluorophore (PPy) and tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based di&#8208;Pt(II) organometallic precursor (TPE&#8208;Pt) as building blocks. Guided by in vivo fluorescence imaging, radio&#8208;chemotherapy is precisely carried out, which facilitates boosting the therapeutic outcomes and minimizing undesired side effects.








Abstract
To promote the clinical theranostic performances of platinum&#8208;based anticancer drugs, imaging capability is urgently desired, and their chemotherapeutic efficacy needs to be upgraded. Herein, a theranostic metallacycle (M) is developed for imaging&#8208;guided cancer radio&#8208;chemotherapy using perylene bisimide fluorophore (PPy) and tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based di&#8208;Pt(II) organometallic precursor (TPE&#8208;Pt) as building blocks. The formation of this discrete supramolecular coordination complex facilitates the encapsulation of M by a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive amphiphilic block copolymer to prepare M&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (MNPs). TPE&#8208;Pt acts as a chemotherapeutic drug and also an excellent radiosensitizer, thus incorporating radiotherapy into the nanomedicine to accelerate the therapeutic efficacy and overcome drug resistance. The NIR&#8208;emission of PPy is employed to detect the intracellular delivery and tissue distribution of MNPs in real time. In vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate the excellent anticancer efficacy combining chemotherapy and radiotherapy; the administration of this nanomedicine effectively inhibits the tumor growth and greatly extends the survival rate of cisplatin&#8208;resistant A2780CIS&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Guided by in vivo fluorescence imaging, radio&#8208;chemotherapy is precisely carried out, which facilitates boosting of the therapeutic outcomes and minimizing undesired side effects. The success of this theranostic system brings new hope to supramolecular nanomedicines for their potential clinical translations.

Potassium&#8208;Metal Batteries
In article number 2105855, Pengcheng Liu, David Mitlin, and co&#8208;workers report a multifunctional separator for potassium&#8208;metal batteries. The cover depicts two foxes playfully hopping across an ancient arctic river while carrying glowing ions in their mouths. The potassiphilic aluminum fluoride crystals, which are the key functional aspect of the separator, are the crystallographic ice sheets regularly arranged on the surface. The frigid water beneath represents the electrolyte. In the background are frozen mountains, which are the potassium&#8208;metal dendrites that would form without the functional separator.

2D Perovskites
Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2, an inorganic&#8208;cation pseudo&#8208;halide 2D phase perovskite single crystal, is grown by a simple antisolvent vapor&#8208;assisted crystallization method, as reported by Chu&#8208;Chen Chueh, Anita W. Y. Ho&#8208;Baillie, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2104782. Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2 exhibits a reversible first&#8208;order phase transformation to CsPbBr2 at 450 K and has a low exciton binding energy amongst the 2D perovskites. Demonstration for photodetector application shows respectable responsivity and detectivity.

Graphene Biosensors
In article 2106666, Xiaoyan Zhang, Gr&#233;gory F. Schneider, Wangyang Fu, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate graphene biosensors operating at ultrahigh frequencies, where the conductivity of high&#8208;salt solutions and thus the ionic screening is fully cancelled. Dielectric&#8208;modulated detection of the binding of streptavidin molecules to biotin molecules that are noncovalently anchored on the graphene surface is demonstrated using the developed graphene biosensors.

Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries
Defect&#8208;rich carbon materials possess high gravimetric potassium storage capability, but their cyclic stability is limited because of the low reversibility of undesirable defects and their deteriorative conductivity. In article number 2108621, Zhicheng Ju, Shenglin Xiong, and co&#8208;workers propose an in situ defect&#8208;selectivity and order&#8208;in&#8208;disorder synergetic engineering in carbon materials via a self&#8208;template strategy to boost the K+&#8208;storage capacity, rate capability, and cyclic stability simultaneously.

2D Materials
Van der Waals (vdW) encapsulation is one of the most promising approaches to improve the stability and reliability of 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;based devices. So far, a scalable vdW encapsulation approach through complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;compatible processes still remains elusive. In article number 2106041, Kailang Liu, Tianyou Zhai, and co&#8208;workers present a scalable vdW encapsulation method based on inorganic molecular crystals, through which the ambient stability of a series of 2D materials is significantly improved by tens of times.

Water Purification
In article number 2107400, Suojiang Zhang, Dan Wang, and co&#8208;workers report an ultrastable amorphous Ta2O5/C nanocomposite with a hollow multishelled structure for solar evaporation, which results in highly efficient photoabsorption, photothermal conversion, and promoted water transport. Thus, a superfast evaporation speed of 4.02 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 is achieved. Importantly, the ion concentration meets the World Health Organization's drinking&#8208;water standard after purification, even under extreme conditions.

         <title>Tin&#8208;Based Anode Materials for Stable Sodium Storage: Progress and Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are now intensively studied to complement lithium&#8208;ion batteries in energy&#8208;storage markets. Recent advances in various high&#8208;capacity Sn&#8208;based anode materials for SIBs are summarized, with an emphasis on the reaction mechanisms, and the multiphase and multiscale structural optimizations for stable sodium storage. Cathode materials and electrolyte are also discussed from the perspective of full&#8208;cell construction.








Abstract
Because of concerns regarding shortages of lithium resources and the urgent need to develop low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency energy&#8208;storage systems, research and applications of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have re&#8208;emerged in recent years. Herein, recent advances in high&#8208;capacity Sn&#8208;based anode materials for stable SIBs are highlighted, including tin (Sn) alloys, Sn oxides, Sn sulfides, Sn selenides, Sn phosphides, and their composites. The reaction mechanisms between Sn&#8208;based materials and sodium are clarified. Multiphase and multiscale structural optimizations of Sn&#8208;based materials to achieve good sodium&#8208;storage performance are emphasized. Full&#8208;cell designs using Sn&#8208;based materials as anodes and further development of Sn&#8208;based materials are discussed from a commercialization perspective.

&lt;p&gt;Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) are now intensively studied to complement lithium-ion batteries in energy-storage markets. Recent advances in various high-capacity Sn-based anode materials for SIBs are summarized, with an emphasis on the reaction mechanisms, and the multiphase and multiscale structural optimizations for stable sodium storage. Cathode materials and electrolyte are also discussed from the perspective of full-cell construction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of concerns regarding shortages of lithium resources and the urgent need to develop low-cost and high-efficiency energy-storage systems, research and applications of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have re-emerged in recent years. Herein, recent advances in high-capacity Sn-based anode materials for stable SIBs are highlighted, including tin (Sn) alloys, Sn oxides, Sn sulfides, Sn selenides, Sn phosphides, and their composites. The reaction mechanisms between Sn-based materials and sodium are clarified. Multiphase and multiscale structural optimizations of Sn-based materials to achieve good sodium-storage performance are emphasized. Full-cell designs using Sn-based materials as anodes and further development of Sn-based materials are discussed from a commercialization perspective.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Carrier Transport in Quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A systematic understanding of 2D perovskite's carrier transport mechanism is critical for the development of high&#8208;performance 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The recent advances on the carrier behavior of 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper PSCs from the view of crystal structure, grain orientation, quantum&#8208;well width distribution, and device structure are summarized, and guidelines for successfully elevating carrier transports are provided.








Abstract
In recent years, 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (2DRP) perovskite materials have been explored as emerging semiconductor materials in solar cells owing to their excellent stability and structural diversity. Although 2DRP perovskites have achieved photovoltaic efficiencies exceeding 19%, their widespread use is hindered by their inferior charge&#8208;carrier transport properties in the presence of diverse organic spacer cations, compared to that of traditional 3D perovskites. Hence, a systematic understanding of the carrier transport mechanism in 2D perovskites is critical for the development of high&#8208;performance 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, the recent advances in the carrier behavior of 2DRP PSCs are summarized, and guidelines for successfully enhancing carrier transport are provided. First, the composition and crystal structure of 2DRP perovskite materials that affect carrier transport are discussed. Then, the features of 2DRP perovskite films (phase separation, grain orientation, crystallinity kinetics, etc.), which are closely related to carrier transport, are evaluated. Next, the principal direction of carrier transport guiding the selection of the transport layer is revealed. Finally, an outlook is proposed and strategies for enhancing carrier transport in high&#8208;performance PSCs are rationalized.

         <title>Material Evolution with Nanotechnology, Nanoarchitectonics, and Materials Informatics: What will be the Next Paradigm Shift in Nanoporous Materials?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of functional materials has several complicated aspects. To accelerate material discovery, three key concepts, nanotechnology as a game changer, nanoarchitectonics as an integrator, and materials informatics as a super&#8208;accelerator, are discussed, starting from conceptual viewpoints and summing up with exemplifying recent developments, as the best integrated strategy for the development of functional materials, with a particular emphasis on nanoporous materials.








Abstract
Materials science and chemistry have played a central and significant role in advancing society. With the shift toward sustainable living, it is anticipated that the development of functional materials will continue to be vital for sustaining life on our&#160;planet. In the recent decades, rapid progress has been made in materials science and chemistry owing to the advances in experimental, analytical, and computational methods, thereby producing several novel and useful materials. However, most problems in material development are highly complex. Here, the best strategy for the development of functional materials via the implementation of three key concepts is discussed: nanotechnology as a game changer, nanoarchitectonics as an integrator, and materials informatics as a super&#8208;accelerator. Discussions from conceptual viewpoints and example recent developments, chiefly focused on nanoporous materials, are presented. It is anticipated that coupling these three strategies together will open advanced routes for the swift design and exploratory search of functional materials truly useful for solving real&#8208;world problems. These novel strategies will result in the evolution of nanoporous functional materials.

The nanoparticle&#8208;based gene&#8208;delivery method is developed and advanced as the new gene&#8208;delivery system for plants, realizing transient/stable transformation, obtaining transgenic food, and resisting to plant abiotic/biotic stresses.








Abstract
Plant genetic engineering is essential for improving crop yield, quality, and resistance to abiotic/biotic stresses for sustainable agriculture. Agrobacterium&#8208;, biolistic bombardment&#8208;, electroporation&#8208;, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)&#8208;mediated genetic&#8208;transformation systems are extensively used in plant genetic engineering. However, these systems have limitations, including species dependency, destruction of plant tissues, low transformation efficiency, and high cost. Recently, nanotechnology&#8208;based gene&#8208;delivery methods have been developed for plant genetic transformation. This nanostrategy shows excellent transformation efficiency, good biocompatibility, adequate protection of exogenous nucleic acids, and the potential for plant regeneration. However, the nanomaterial&#8208;mediated gene&#8208;delivery system in plants is still in its infancy, and there are many challenges for its broad applications. Herein, the conventional genetic transformation techniques used in plants are briefly discussed. After that, the progress in the development of nanomaterial&#8208;based gene&#8208;delivery systems is considered. CRISPR&#8208;Cas&#8208;mediated genome editing and its combined applications with plant nanotechnology are also discussed. The conceptual innovations, methods, and practical applications of nanomaterial&#8208;mediated genetic transformation summarized herein will be beneficial for promoting plant genetic engineering in modern agriculture.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Bias Power&#8208;Detector Circuits based on MoS2 Field&#8208;Effect Transistors on Wafer&#8208;Scale Flexible Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Power&#8208;detector circuits are realized based on MoS2 channel transistors fabricated on flexible polyimide substrates. The work compares the DC and radio&#8208;frequency performance of multilayer and monolayer wafer&#8208;scale grown MoS2 for power detection and shows that both materials allow the fabrication of circuits that work at GHz frequencies with excellent dynamic range and responsivity.








Abstract
The design, fabrication, and characterization of wafer&#8208;scale, zero&#8208;bias power detectors based on 2D MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) are demonstrated. The MoS2 FETs are fabricated using a wafer&#8208;scale process on 8&#160;&#956;m&#8208;thick polyimide film, which, in principle, serves as a flexible substrate. The performances of two chemical vapor deposition MoS2 sheets, grown with different processes and showing different thicknesses, are analyzed and compared from the single device fabrication and characterization steps to the circuit level. The power&#8208;detector prototypes exploit the nonlinearity of the transistors above the cut&#8208;off frequency of the devices. The proposed detectors are designed employing a transistor model based on measurement results. The fabricated circuits operate in the Ku&#8208;band between 12 and 18&#160;GHz, with a demonstrated voltage responsivity of 45&#160;V W&#8722;1 at 18&#160;GHz in the case of monolayer MoS2 and 104&#160;V W&#8722;1 at 16&#160;GHz in the case of multilayer MoS2, both achieved without applied DC bias. They are the best&#8208;performing power detectors fabricated on flexible substrate reported to date. The measured dynamic range exceeds 30&#160;dB, outperforming other semiconductor technologies like silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor circuits and GaAs Schottky diodes.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Integration of Silicon Nanomembranes with 2D Materials for Bioresorbable, Wireless Neurochemical System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft, wireless, and bioresorbable neurochemical system designed to determine various concentrations of neurotransmitters as well as to monitor peripheral physiologies (temperature, pH, electrical activity) in a simultaneous manner is presented. An extensive range of studies covers modifications of nanoscale materials and system&#8208;level electronics, enabling the production of exceptional performance.








Abstract
Although neurotransmitters are key substances closely related to evaluating degenerative brain diseases as well as regulating essential functions in the body, many research efforts have not been focused on direct observation of such biochemical messengers, rather on monitoring relatively associated physical, mechanical, and electrophysiological parameters. Here, a bioresorbable silicon&#8208;based neurochemical analyzer incorporated with 2D transition metal dichalcogenides is introduced as a completely implantable brain&#8208;integrated system that can wirelessly monitor time&#8208;dynamic behaviors of dopamine and relevant parameters in a simultaneous mode. An extensive range of examinations of molybdenum/tungsten disulfide (MoS2/WS2) nanosheets and catalytic iron nanoparticles (Fe NPs) highlights the underlying mechanisms of strong chemical and target&#8208;specific responses to the neurotransmitters, along with theoretical modeling tools. Systematic characterizations demonstrate reversible, stable, and long&#8208;term operational performances of the degradable bioelectronics with excellent sensitivity and selectivity over those of non&#8208;dissolvable counterparts. A complete set of in vivo experiments with comparative analysis using carbon&#8208;fiber electrodes illustrates the capability for potential use as a clinically accessible tool to associated neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Jammed Micro&#8208;Flake Hydrogel for Four&#8208;Dimensional Living Cell Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

Single&#8208;component jammed micro&#8208;flake hydrogels (MFHs)&#160;are developed as cell&#8208;laden bioinks for 4D bioprinting. Cytocompatible&#160;MFH&#160;bioinks without the need of additional fillers are rheologically favorable for bioprinting via smooth direct ink writing. A controllable cross&#8208;linking gradient in the 3D printed bioconstructs is achieved, enabling predefined shape transformations. 4D tissue engineering is demonstrated in a 4D cartilage&#8208;like tissue regeneration study.








Abstract
4D bioprinting is promising to build cell&#8208;laden constructs (bioconstructs) with complex geometries and functions for tissue/organ regeneration applications. The development of hydrogel&#8208;based 4D bioinks, especially those allowing living cell printing, with easy preparation, defined composition, and controlled physical properties is critically important for 4D bioprinting. Here, a single&#8208;component jammed micro&#8208;flake hydrogel (MFH) system with heterogeneous size distribution, which differs from the conventional granular microgel, has been developed as a new cell&#8208;laden bioink for 4D&#160;bioprinting. This jammed cytocompatible MFH features scalable production and straightforward composition with shear&#8208;thinning, shear&#8208;yielding, and rapid self&#8208;healing properties. As such, it can be smoothly printed into stable 3D&#160;bioconstructs, which can be further cross&#8208;linked to form a gradient in cross&#8208;linking density when a photoinitiator and a UV absorber are incorporated. After being subject to shape morphing, a variety of complex bioconstructs with well&#8208;defined configurations and high cell viability are obtained. Based on this system, 4D&#160;cartilage&#8208;like tissue formation is demonstrated as a&#160;proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. The establishment of this versatile new 4D bioink system may open up a&#160;number of applications in tissue engineering.

         <title>An Energy&#8208;Storing DNA&#8208;Based Nanocomplex for Laser&#8208;Free Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA nanocomplex incorporating persistent&#8208;luminescence nanoparticles is prepared, which realizes tumor&#8208;site glutathione&#8208;activating photodynamic therapy (PDT) of breast cancer without exogenous laser excitation. Laser&#8208;free PDT is specifically initiated in the glutathione&#8208;overexpressed tumor cells and completes in a way of self&#8208;supplying O2 and self&#8208;irradiating.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a therapeutic strategy that is dependent on external light irradiation that faces a major challenge in cancer treatment due to the poor tissue&#8208;penetration depths of light irradiation. Herein, a DNA nanocomplex that integrates persistent&#8208;luminescence nanoparticles (PLNPs) is developed, which realizes tumor&#8208;site glutathione&#8208;activated PDT for breast cancer without exogenous laser excitation. The scaffold of the nanocomplex is AS1411&#8208;aptamer&#8208;encoded ultralong single&#8208;stranded DNA chain with two functions: i) providing sufficient intercalation sites for the photosensitizer, and ii) recognizing nucleolin that specifically overexpresses on the surface of cancer cells. The PLNPs in the nanocomplex are energy&#8208;charged to act as a self&#8208;illuminant and coated with a shell of MnO2 for blocking energy degradation. In response to the overexpressed glutathione in cancer cells, the MnO2 shell decomposes to provide Mn2+ to catalytically produce O2, which is essential to PDT. Meanwhile, PLNPs are released and act as a self&#8208;illuminant to activate the photosensitizer to convert O2 into cytotoxic 1O2. Significant tumor inhibition effects are demonstrated in breast tumor xenograft models without exogenous laser excitation. It is envisioned that a laser&#8208;excitation&#8208;free PDT strategy enabled by the PLNP&#8211;DNA nanocomplex promotes the development of PDT and provides a new local therapeutic approach.

         <title>Multilayer Reservoir Computing Based on Ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 for Hierarchical Information Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stackable reservoir is constructed based on ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 with voltage input and output, enabling interdevice cascading and multilayer reservoir computing. Fast Fourier transformation analysis shows high&#8208;harmonic generation and progressive low&#8208;pass filtering effect. Time&#8208;series prediction and waveform classification tasks are also demonstrated in the deep reservoir architecture, providing a promising pathway for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Dynamic physical systems such as reservoir computing (RC) architectures show a great prospect in temporal information processing, whereas hierarchical information processing capability is still lacking due to the absence of advanced multilayer reservoir elements. Here, a stackable reservoir system is constructed based on ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 devices with voltage input and output, which is realized by dynamic voltage division between a ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor and a planar device and therefore allows the reservoirs to cascade, enabling multilayer RC. Fast Fourier transformation analysis shows high&#8208;harmonic generation in the first layer as a result of inherent nonlinearity of the reservoir, and progressive low&#8208;pass filtering effect is realized where higher&#8208;frequency components are progressively filtered in deeper&#8208;layer RCs. Time&#8208;series prediction and waveform classification tasks are also demonstrated, serving as evidence for the memory capacity and computing capability of the deep reservoir architecture. This work can provide a promising pathway in exploiting emerging 2D materials and dynamics for advanced neuromorphic computing architectures.

         <title>A Facile &#8220;Double&#8208;Catalysts&#8221; Approach to Directionally Fabricate Pyridinic N&#63743;B&#8208;Pair&#8208;Doped Crystal Graphene Nanoribbons/Amorphous Carbon Hybrid Electrocatalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dominantly pyridinic N&#63743;B pair is rationally fabricated on hierarchically structure of crystal graphene nanoribbons/amorphous carbon by a &#8220;double&#8208;catalysts&#8221; strategy. As experiments and density functional theory demonstrated, the pyridinic N&#63743;B plays a key role for the highly catalytic performance (half&#8208;wave potential, 0.812 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, electron transfer number, &#8776;3.94), comparable to commercial Pt/C and superior to most of carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts. 








Abstract
Carbon material is a promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Doping of heteroatoms, the most widely used modulating strategy, has attracted many efforts in the past decade. Despite all this, the catalytic activity of heteroatoms&#8208;modulated carbon is hard to compare to that of metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Here, a &#8220;double&#8208;catalysts&#8221; (Fe salt, H3BO3) strategy is presented to directionally fabricate porous structure of crystal graphene nanoribbons (GNs)/amorphous carbon doped by pyridinic N&#63743;B pairs. The porous structure and GNs accelerate ion/mass and electron transport, respectively. The N percentage in pyridinic N&#63743;B pairs accounts for &#8776;80% of all N species. The pyridinic N&#63743;B pair drives the ORR via an almost 4e&#8722; transfer pathway with a half&#8208;wave potential (0.812 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and onset potential (0.876 V vs RHE) in the alkaline solution. The ORR catalytic performance of the as&#8208;prepared carbon catalysts approximates commercial Pt/C and outperforms most prior carbon&#8208;based catalysts. The assembled Zn&#8211;air battery exhibits a high peak power density of 94 mW cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory simulation reveals that the pyridinic N&#63743;B pair possesses the highest catalytic activity among all the potential configurations, due to the highest charge density at C active sites neighboring B, which enhances the interaction strength with the intermediates in the p&#8208;band center.

&lt;p&gt;The dominantly pyridinic N&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;B pair is rationally fabricated on hierarchically structure of crystal graphene nanoribbons/amorphous carbon by a &#8220;double-catalysts&#8221; strategy. As experiments and density functional theory demonstrated, the pyridinic N&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;B plays a key role for the highly catalytic performance (half-wave potential, 0.812 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, electron transfer number, &#8776;3.94), comparable to commercial Pt/C and superior to most of carbon-based electrocatalysts. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon material is a promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Doping of heteroatoms, the most widely used modulating strategy, has attracted many efforts in the past decade. Despite all this, the catalytic activity of heteroatoms-modulated carbon is hard to compare to that of metal-based electrocatalysts. Here, a &#8220;double-catalysts&#8221; (Fe salt, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) strategy is presented to directionally fabricate porous structure of crystal graphene nanoribbons (GNs)/amorphous carbon doped by pyridinic N&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;B pairs. The porous structure and GNs accelerate ion/mass and electron transport, respectively. The N percentage in pyridinic N&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;B pairs accounts for &#8776;80% of all N species. The pyridinic N&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;B pair drives the ORR via an almost 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; transfer pathway with a half-wave potential (0.812 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and onset potential (0.876 V vs RHE) in the alkaline solution. The ORR catalytic performance of the as-prepared carbon catalysts approximates commercial Pt/C and outperforms most prior carbon-based catalysts. The assembled Zn&#8211;air battery exhibits a high peak power density of 94 mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Density functional theory simulation reveals that the pyridinic N&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;B pair possesses the highest catalytic activity among all the potential configurations, due to the highest charge density at C active sites neighboring B, which enhances the interaction strength with the intermediates in the p-band center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Inspired by the structural&#8208;color change behavior of soap bubbles, a novel biomimetic 3D human lung&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip microsystem, which allows for visual sensing and real&#8208;time monitoring of cellular mechanics, is presented. This model enables modeling of human lung disease, assessment of the dynamic relationships between the color atlas and disease phenotypes, and screening of drugs for potential therapeutics.








Abstract
Lung&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip models hold great promise for disease modeling and drug screening. Herein, inspired by the iridescence phenomenon of soap bubbles, a novel biomimetic 3D microphysiological lung&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip system with breathing visualization is presented. The system, with an array of pulmonary alveoli at the physiological scale, is constructed and coated with structural color materials. Cyclic deformation is induced by regular airflow, resembling the expansion and contraction of the alveoli during rhythmic breathing. As the deformation is accompanied with corresponding synchronous shifts in the structural color, the constructed system offers self&#8208;reporting of the cell mechanics and enables real&#8208;time monitoring of the cultivation process. Using this system, the dynamic relationships between the color atlas and disease symptoms, showing the essential role of mechanical stretching in the phenotypes of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, are investigated. These features make this human lung system ideal in biological study, disease monitoring, and drug discovery.

         <title>Electrical Tuning of Plasmonic Conducting Polymer Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically tunable conducting poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene:sulfate) polymer nano&#8208;optical antennas are reported. In addition to repeated on/off switching of the polymeric nanoantennas, gradual electrical tuning of their nano&#8208;optical response is demonstrated. This work opens for electrically tunable metasurfaces and takes important steps toward applications ranging from tunable flat metalenses and holograms to adaptable smart windows.








Abstract
Nanostructures of conventional metals offer manipulation of light at the nanoscale but are largely limited to static behavior due to fixed material properties. To develop the next frontier of dynamic nano&#8208;optics and metasurfaces, this study utilizes the redox&#8208;tunable optical properties of conducting polymers, as recently shown to be capable of sustaining plasmons in their most conducting oxidized state. Electrically tunable conducting polymer nano&#8208;optical antennas are presented, using nanodisks of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene:sulfate) (PEDOT:Sulf) as a model system. In addition to repeated on/off switching of the polymeric nanoantennas, the concept enables gradual electrical tuning of the nano&#8208;optical response, which was&#160;found to be related to the modulation of both density and mobility of the mobile polaronic charge carriers in the polymer. The resonance position of the PEDOT:Sulf nanoantennas can be conveniently controlled by disk size, here reported down to a wavelength of around 1270 nm. The presented concept may be used for electrically tunable metasurfaces, with tunable farfield as well as nearfield. The work thereby opens for applications ranging from tunable flat meta&#8208;optics to adaptable smart windows.

         <title>Intracellular mechanical drugs induce cell cycle altering and cell death</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Current advances in materials science have demonstrated that extracellular mechanical cues can define cell function and cell fate. However, a fundamental understanding of the manner in which intracellular mechanical cues affect cell mechanics remain elusive. We here describe how intracellular mechanical hindrance, reinforcement and supports interfere with the cell cycle and promote cell death. Reproducible devices with highly controlled size, shape and with a broad range of stiffness were internalized in HeLa cells. Once inside, they induced characteristic cell cycle deviations and promoted cell death. Device shape and stiffness were the dominant determinants of mechanical impairment. Device structural support to the cell membrane and centring during mitosis maximized their effects, preventing spindle centring and correct chromosome alignment. Nanodevices reveal that the spindle generated forces larger than 114 nN which overcome intracellular confinement by relocating the device to a less damaging position. By using intracellular mechanical drugs, this work provides a foundation to defining the role of intracellular constrains on cell function and fate, with relevance to fundamental cell mechanics and nanomedicine.

         <title>Nanoengineered neutrophils as cellular sonosensitizer for visual sonodynamic therapy of malignant tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The rapid evolution of cell&#8208;based theranostics has attracted extensive attention due to their unique advantages in biomedical applications. However, only the inherent functions of cells cannot meet the needs of malignant tumor treatment. Thus endowing original cells with new characteristics to generate multifunctional living cells may hold a tremendous promise. Here, for the first time, we used the nanoengineering method to combine customized liposomes with neutrophils, generating oxygen&#8208;carrying sonosensitizer cells with acoustic functions, which we called Acouscyte/O2, for the visual diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Specifically, oxygen&#8208;carried perfluorocarbon and temoporfin were encapsulated into cRGD peptide modified multilayer liposomes (C&#8208;ML/HPT/O2), which were then loaded into live neutrophils to obtain Acouscyte/O2. Acouscyte/O2 could not only carry a large amount of oxygen but also exhibit the ability of long circulation, inflammation triggered recruitment and decomposition. Importantly, Acouscyte/O2 could be selectively accumulated in tumors, effectively enhanced tumor oxygen levels, and triggered anticancer sonodynamics in response to ultrasound stimulation, leading to completely obliterating tumors and efficiently extending survival time of tumor&#8208;bearing mice with minimal systemic adverse effects. Meanwhile, the tumors could be real&#8208;time monitored by temoporfin&#8208;mediated fluorescence imaging and PFC&#8208;microbubble enhanced ultrasound imaging. Therefore, the nanoengineered neutrophils, i.e., Acouscyte/O2, were a new type of multifunctional cellular drug, which provides a new platform for the diagnosis and sonodynamic therapy of solid malignant tumors.

Abstract
Synaptic plasticity is a fundamental process for neuronal communication and is involved in neurodegeneration. This process has been recently exploited to inspire the design of the next&#8208;generation bioelectronic platforms.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synaptic plasticity is a fundamental process for neuronal communication and is involved in neurodegeneration. This process has been recently exploited to inspire the design of the next-generation bioelectronic platforms. Here, neuromorphic devices have emerged as ideal candidates in mimicking brain functionalities, thanks to their ionic-to-electronic signal transduction, biocompatibility and their ability to display short and long-term memory as biological synapses. However, these devices still fail in bridging the gap between electronics and biological systems due to the lack of biomimetic features. Here, we implement a biomembrane-based OECT and investigate the SLB-mediated short-term depression of the device. After morphological and electrical characterization of the lipid bilayer, its ionic barrier behavior is exploited to enhance the neuromorphic operation of the OECT. Such biomimetic neuromorphic device paves the way towards the implementation of synapses-resembling in vitro platforms to investigate and characterize neurodegenerative processes involving synaptic plasticity loss.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Phase&#8208;change enabled, rapid, high&#8208;resolution direct ink writing of soft silicone</title>

Abstract
Soft silicone is an ideal flexible material for application, e.g., in soft robotics, flexible electronics, bionics, or implantable biomedical devices. However, gravity&#8208;driven sagging, filament stretching and deformation can cause inevitable defects during rapid manufacturing, making it hard to obtain complex, high&#8208;resolution 3D silicone structures with direct ink writing (DIW) technology. Here, we present rapid DIW of soft silicone enabled by a phase&#8208;change&#8208;induced, reversible change of the ink's hierarchical microstructure. During printing, the silicone&#8208;based ink containing silica nanoparticles and wax microparticles is extruded from a heated nozzle into a cold environment under controlled stress. The wax phase change (solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid) during printing rapidly destroys and rebuilds the particle networks, realizing fast control of ink flow behavior and printability. This high operating temperature&#8208;direct ink writing (HOT&#8208;DIW) method is fast (maximum speed &#8776;3100&#160;mm min&#8211;1) and extends the DIW scale range of soft silicone. Extruded filaments have small diameters (50&#160;&#177; 5&#160;&#956;m), allow for large spans (&#8776;13&#8208;fold filament diameter) and high aspect ratios (&#8776;1), setting a new benchmark in the DIW of soft silicone. Printed silicone structures exhibit excellent performance as flexible sensors, superhydrophobic surfaces, and shape memory bionic devices, illustrating the potential of the new 3D printing strategy.

         <title>Gradient Doping in Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskites by Barium Ions for Efficient Single&#8208;junction and Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Narrow bandgap tin&#8208;lead (NBG Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites generally have a high density of unintentional p&#8208;type self&#8208;doping, which reduces the charge carrier lifetimes, diffusion lengths and device efficiencies. Here, we demonstrate a p&#8208;n homojunction across the Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite resulted from a gradient doping by Ba2+. We report that 0.1 mol% Ba2+ can effectively compensate the p&#8208;doping of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites or even turns it to n&#8208;type without changing its bandgap. Ba2+ cations are found to stay at the interstitial sites and work as shallow electron donor. In addition, Ba2+ cations show a unique heterogeneous distribution in perovskite film. Most of the barium ions stay in the top 600 nanometer region of the perovskite films and turn it into weakly n&#8208;type, while the bottom portion of the film remains to be p&#8208;type. The gradient doping forms of a homojunction from top to bottom of the perovskite films with a built&#8208;in field that facilitates extraction of photogenerated carriers, resulting an increased carrier extraction length. This strategy enhanced the efficiency of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite single&#8208;junction solar cells to over 21.0% and boosted the efficiencies of monolithic perovskite&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells to 25.3% and 24.1%, for active areas of 5.9 mm2 and 0.94 cm2, respectively.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Microsized Si Anodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Insights into the Polymer Configuration Conversion Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Microsized silicon particles are desirable Si anodes because of their low price and abundant sources. However, it is challenging to achieve stable electrochemical performances using traditional microsized silicon (&#956;Si) anode due to poor conductivity, serious volume expansion, and unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, a composite microsized Si anode was designed and synthesized by constructing a unique polymer, i.e., poly(hexaazatrinaphthalene) (PHATN), on the Si/C surface (PCSi). The Li+ transport mechanism of the PCSi was elucidated by using in&#8208;situ characterization techniques and theoretical simulation. Notably, during the lithiation of the PCSi anode, &#8208;C = N&#8208; groups with high electron density in the PHATN first coordinate Li+ to form &#8208;C&#8208;N&#8208;Li bonds on both sides of the PHATN molecule plane. Consequently, the original benzene rings in the PHATN become active centers to accept lithium and form stable Li&#8208;rich PHATN coatings. PHATN molecules expand due to the change of molecular configuration during the consecutive lithiation process, which provides controllable space for the subsequent volume expansion of the Si particles. Therefore, the PCSi composite anode remained a specific capacity of 1129.6 mAh g&#8211;1 after 500 cycles at 1 A g&#8211;1, and also exhibited compelling rate performance, maintaining a specific capacity of 417.9 mAh g&#8211;1 at 16.5 A g&#8211;1. This work provides an effective strategy for the secondary utilization of silicon slag to design and synthesize high&#8208;performance and more desirable microsized silicon anodes for Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Soft Actuators Made of Discrete Grains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recent work has demonstrated the potential of actuators consisting of bulk elastomers with phase&#8208;changing inclusions for generating high forces and large volumetric expansions. Simultaneously, granular assemblies have been shown to enable tunable properties via different packings, dynamic moduli via jamming, and compatibility with various printing methods via suspension in carrier fluids. Herein, we introduce granular actuators, a new class of soft actuators made of discrete grains. The soft grains consist of a hyperelastic shell and multiple solvent cores. Upon heating, the encapsulated solvent cores undergo liquid&#8208;to&#8208;gas phase change, inducing rapid and strong volumetric expansion of the hyperelastic shell up to 700%. The grains can be used independently for micro&#8208;actuation, or in granular agglomerates for meso&#8208; and macro&#8208;scale actuation, demonstrating the scalability of granular actuators. Furthermore, the active grains can be suspended in a carrier resin or solvent to enable printable soft actuators via established granular material processing techniques. By combining the advantages of phase&#8208;change soft actuation and granularity, we present the opportunity to realize soft actuators with tunable bulk properties, compatibility with self&#8208;assembly techniques, and on&#8208;demand reconfigurability.

         <title>A Transformable Amphiphilic and Block Polymer&#8208;Dendron Conjugate for Enhanced Tumor Penetration and Retention with Cellular Homeostasis Perturbation via Membrane Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Efficient penetration and retention of therapeutic agents in tumor tissues can be realized through rational design of drug delivery systems. Herein, we present a polymer&#8208;dendron conjugate, POEGMA&#8208;b&#8208;p(GFLG&#8208;Dendron&#8208;Ppa) (GFLG&#8208;DP), which allows cathepsin B (CTSB)&#8208;triggered stealthy&#8208;to&#8208;sticky structural transformation. The compositions and ratios were optimized through dissipative particle dynamics simulations. GFLG&#8208;DP displayed tumor&#8208;specific transformation and consequently released dendron&#8208;Ppa was found to effectively accumulate on the tumor cell membrane. The interaction between dendron&#8208;Ppa and the tumor cell membrane resulted in intracellular and intercellular transport via membrane flow, thus achieving efficient deep penetration and prolonged retention of therapeutic agents in solid tumor tissues. Meanwhile, the interaction of dendron&#8208;Ppa with endoplasmic reticulum disrupted the cell homeostasis, making tumor cells more vulnerable and susceptible to the photodynamic therapy. This platform represents a versatile approach to augmenting the tumor therapeutic efficacy of a nanomedicine via manipulation of its interactions with tumor membrane systems.

Meanwhile, the interaction of dendron-Ppa with endoplasmic reticulum disrupted the cell homeostasis, making tumor cells more vulnerable and susceptible to the photodynamic therapy. This platform represents a versatile approach to augmenting the tumor therapeutic efficacy of a nanomedicine via manipulation of its interactions with tumor membrane systems.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Star&#8208;Polymer&#8211;DNA Gels Showing Highly Predictable and Tunable Mechanical Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA gels with predictable mechanical responses are developed using a star&#8208;polymer strategy and a pair of presimulated DNA sequences. The macroscopic stress&#8208;relaxation time of the DNA gel is connected directly to the microscopic lifetime of the DNA crosslinkers over an extended time range from 0.1&#8211;2000&#160;s. In addition, the DNA gels are spatially homogeneous, hysteresis&#8208;less, and self&#8208;healable.








Abstract
Dynamically crosslinked gels are appealing materials for applications that require time&#8208;dependent mechanical responses. DNA duplexes are ideal crosslinkers for building such gels because of their excellent sequence addressability and flexible tunability in bond energy. However, the mechanical responses of most DNA gels are complicated and unpredictable. Here, a DNA gel with a highly homogeneous gel network and well predictable mechanical behaviors is demonstrated by using a pair of star&#8208;polymer&#8211;DNA precursors with presimulated DNA sequences showing the two&#8208;state transition. The melting curve analysis of the DNA gels reveals the good correspondence between the thermodynamic potentials of the DNA crosslinkers and the presimulated values by DNA calculators. Stress&#8208;relaxation tests and dissociation kinetics measurements show that the macroscopic relaxation time of the DNA gels is approximately equal to the lifetime of the DNA crosslinkers over 4 orders of magnitude from 0.1&#8211;2000&#160;s. Furthermore, a series of durability tests find the DNA gels are hysteresis&#8208;less and self&#8208;healable after the applications of repeated temperature and mechanical stimuli. These results demonstrate the great potential of star&#8208;polymer&#8211;DNA precursors for building gels with predictable and tunable viscoelastic properties, suitable for applications such as stress&#8208;response extracellular matrices, injectable solids, and soft robotics.

         <title>Ultrafast sub&#8208;100 fs all&#8208;optical modulation and efficient third&#8208;harmonic generation in Weyl semimetal niobium phosphide thin films</title>

Abstract
Since their experimental discovery in 2015, Weyl semimetals generated a large amount of attention due their intriguing physical properties that arise from their linear electron dispersion relation and topological surface states. In particular in the field of nonlinear (NL) optics and light harvesting, Weyl semimetals have shown outstanding performances and achieved record NL conversion coefficients. In this context, we perform first steps towards Weyl semimetal nanophotonics by thoroughly characterizing the linear and NL optical behavior of epitaxially grown niobium phosphide (NbP) thin films, covering the visible to near&#8208;infrared regime of the electromagnetic spectrum. Despite the measured high linear absorption, third&#8208;harmonic generation studies demonstrate high conversion efficiencies up to 10&#8208;4%, that can be attributed to the topological electron states at the surface of the material. Furthermore, nondegenerate pump&#8208;probe measurements with sub&#8208;10 fs pulses reveal a maximum modulation depth of about 1%, completely decaying within 100 fs and therefore suggesting the possibility of developing devices based on NbP with all&#8208;optical switching bandwidths of up to 10 THz. Altogether, our work reveals promising NL optical properties of Weyl semimetal thin films that are outperforming bulk crystals of the same material, laying the grounds for nanoscale applications, enabled by top&#8208;down nanostructuring, such as light&#8208;harvesting, on&#8208;chip frequency conversion and all&#8208;optical processing.

         <title>Bistable and Multistable Actuators for Soft Robots: Structures, Materials, and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Snap&#8208;through bistability is often observed in nature (e.g., fast snapping to closure of Venus flytrap) and our life (e.g., bottle caps and hair clippers). Recently, harnessing bistability and multistability in different structures and soft materials has attracted growing interest for high&#8208;performance soft actuators and soft robots. They have demonstrated broad and unique applications in high&#8208;speed locomotion on land and under water, adaptive sensing and fast grasping, shape reconfiguration, electronics&#8208;free controls with a single input, and logic computation. Here, an overview of integrating bistable and multistable structures with soft actuating materials for diverse soft actuators and soft/flexible robots is given. The mechanics&#8208;guided structural design principles for five categories of basic bistable elements from 1D to 3D (i.e., constrained beams, curved plates, dome shells, compliant mechanisms of linkages with flexible hinges and deformable origami, and balloon structures) are first presented, alongside brief discussions of typical soft actuating materials (i.e., fluidic elastomers and stimuli&#8208;responsive materials such as electro&#8208;, photo&#8208;, thermo&#8208;, magnetic&#8208;, and hydro&#8208;responsive polymers). Following that, integrating these soft materials with each category of bistable elements for soft bistable and multistable actuators and their diverse robotic applications are discussed. To conclude, perspectives on the challenges and opportunities in this emerging field are considered.

         <title>Room&#8208;temperature Observation of Near&#8208;intrinsic Exciton Linewidth in Monolayer WS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The homogeneous exciton linewidth, which captures the coherent quantum dynamics of an excitonic state, is a vital parameter in exploring light&#8208;matter interactions in two&#8208;dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). An efficient control of the exciton linewidth is of great significance, and in particular of its intrinsic linewidth, which determines the minimum timescale for the coherent manipulation of excitons. However, such a control has rarely been achieved in TMDs at room temperature (RT). While the intrinsic A exciton linewidth is down to 7 meV in monolayer WS2, the reported RT linewidth was typically a few tens of meV due to inevitable homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening effects. Here, we show that a 7.18 meV near&#8208;intrinsic linewidth can be observed at RT when monolayer WS2 is coupled with a moderate&#8208;refractive&#8208;index hydrogenated silicon nanosphere in water. By boosting the dynamic competition between exciton and trion decay channels in WS2 through the nanosphere&#8208;supported Mie resonances, we have managed to tune the coherent linewidth from 35 down to 7.18 meV. Such modulation of exciton linewidth and its associated mechanism are robust even in presence of defects, easing the sample quality requirement and providing new opportunities for TMD&#8208;based nanophotonics and optoelectronics.

         <title>Highly Conducting and Stretchable Double Network Hydrogel for Soft Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conducting polymer hydrogels are promising materials in soft bioelectronics because of their tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties and the capability of electrical interaction with tissues. However, it is challenging to balance electrical conductivity and mechanical stretchability: pure conducting polymer hydrogels are highly conductive, but they are brittle; while incorporating the conducting network with a soft network to form a double network can improve the stretchability, its electrical conductivity significantly decreases. Here we address the problem by concentrating a poorly crosslinked precursor hydrogel with a high content ratio of the conducting polymer to achieve a densified double network hydrogel (5.5&#160;wt.% conducting polymer), exhibiting both high electrical conductivity (&#8764;10 S cm&#8211;1) and a large fracture strain (&#8764;150%), in addition to high biocompatibility, tissue&#8208;like softness, low swelling ratio, and desired electrochemical properties for bioelectronics. We further use a surface grafting method to form an adhesive layer on the conducting hydrogel, enabling robust and rapid bonding on the tissues. Furthermore, we apply the proposed hydrogel to show high quality physiological signal recording and reliable, low&#8208;voltage electrical stimulation based on an in vivo rat model. Our method provides an ideal strategy for rapid and reliable tissue&#8208;device integration with high&#8208;quality electrical communications.

         <title>Intelligent Gold Nanoparticles with Oncogenic MicroRNA&#8208;dependent Activities to Manipulate Tumorigenic Environments for Synergistic Tumor Therapy</title>

Abstract
Tumorigenic environments, especially aberrantly over&#8208;expressed oncogenic microRNAs, play critical role in various activities of tumor progression. However, developing strategies to effectively utilize and manipulate these oncogenic microRNAs for tumor therapy is still a challenge. To address this challenge, we have fabricated spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) consisting of gold nanoparticles in the core and antisense oligonucleotides as the shell. Hybridized to the oligonucleotide shell was a DNA sequence to which doxorubicin was conjugated (DNA&#8208;DOX). The oligonucleotides shell was designed to capture over&#8208;expressed miR&#8208;21/miR&#8208;155 and inhibit the expression of these oncogenic miRNAs in tumor cells after tumor accumulation to manipulate genetic environment for accurate gene therapy. This process would further induce the aggregation of these SNAs, which not only generated photothermal agents to achieve on&#8208;demand photothermal therapy in situ, but enlarged the size of SNAs to enhance the retention time in tumor for sustained therapy. The capturing of the relevant miRNAs simultaneously triggered the intracellular release of the DNA&#8208;DOX from the SNAs to deliver tumor&#8208;specific chemotherapy. Both in vivo and in vitro results indicated that this combination strategy has excellent tumor inhibition properties with high survival rate of tumor&#8208;bearing mice, which could be a promising candidate for effective tumor treatment.

         <title>Understanding Heterogeneities in Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Quantum materials are usually heterogeneous, with structural defects, impurities, surfaces, edges, interfaces, and disorder. These heterogeneities are sometimes viewed as liabilities within conventional systems; however, their electronic and magnetic structures often define and affect the quantum phenomena such as coherence, interaction, entanglement, and topological effects in the host system. Therefore, a critical need is to understand the roles of heterogeneities in order to endow materials with new quantum functions for energy and quantum information science applications. In this article, several representative examples are reviewed on the recent progress in connecting the heterogeneities to the quantum behaviors of real materials. Specifically, three intertwined topic areas are assessed: (i) Reveal the structural, electronic, magnetic, vibrational, and optical degrees of freedom of heterogeneities. (ii) Understand the effect of heterogeneities on the behaviors of quantum states in host material systems. (iii) Control heterogeneities for new quantum functions. This progress is achieved by establishing the atomistic&#8208;level structure&#8208;property relationships associated with heterogeneities in quantum materials. The understanding of the interactions between electronic, magnetic, photonic, and vibrational states of heterogeneities enables the design of new quantum materials, including topological matter and quantum light emitters based on heterogenous 2D materials.

         <title>Engineering Multienzyme&#8208;Mimicking Covalent Organic Frameworks as Pyroptosis Inducers for Boosting Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of multienzyme&#8208;mimicking covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is constructed by dispersing active sites into the COF backbone. In contrast to their corresponding bulk species, these enzyme&#8208;mimicking COFs can serve as H2O2 homeostasis disruptors to elevate intracellular H2O2 levels, thus exhibiting excellent chemodynamic therapy and pyroptosis efficacy, favorable for boosting cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
The engineering of a series of multienzyme&#8208;mimicking covalent organic frameworks (COFs), COF&#8208;909&#8208;Cu, COF&#8208;909&#8208;Fe, and COF&#8208;909&#8208;Ni, as pyroptosis inducers, remodeling the tumor microenvironment to boost cancer immunotherapy, is reported. Mechanistic studies reveal that these COFs can serve as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) homeostasis disruptors to elevate intracellular H2O2 levels, and they not only exhibit excellent superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;mimicking activity and convert superoxide radicals (O2&#8226;&#8722;) to H2O2 to facilitate H2O2 generation, but also possess outstanding glutathione peroxidase (GPx)&#8208;mimicking activity and deplete glutathione (GSH) to alleviate the scavenging of H2O2. Meanwhile, the outstanding photothermal therapy properties of these COFs can accelerate the Fenton&#8208;like ionization process to facilitate their chemodynamic therapy efficiency. One member, COF&#8208;909&#8208;Cu, can robustly induce gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;dependent pyroptosis and remodel the tumor microenvironment to trigger durable antitumor immunity, thus promoting the response rate of &#945;PD&#8208;1 checkpoint blockade and successfully restraining tumor metastasis and recurrence.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Field Simulations of Tunable Polar Topologies in Lead&#8208;Free Ferroelectric/Paraelectric Multilayers with Ultrahigh Energy&#8208;Storage Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free ferroelectric/paraelectric trilayers with tunable polar topologies are designed. Relaxor&#8208;ferroelectric&#8208;, antiferroelectric&#8208;, and paraelectric&#8208;like polarization behaviors are achievable by tailoring the topology with diverse dynamics. Ultrahigh energy&#8208;storage density above 170 J cm&#8211;1 and efficiency of 95% are exhibited in polar vortices. This strategy exemplifies a new paradigm to enhance energy storage via topology engineering.








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors are emerging energy&#8208;storage components that require both high energy&#8208;storage density and high efficiency. The conventional approach to energy&#8208;storage enhancement is polar nanodomain engineering via chemical modification. Here, a new approach of domain engineering is proposed by exploiting the tunable polar topologies that have been observed recently in ferroelectric/paraelectric multilayer films. Using phase&#8208;field simulations, it is demonstrated that vortex, spiral, and in&#8208;plane polar structures can be stabilized in BiFeO3/SrTiO3 (BFO/STO) multilayers by tailoring the strain state and layer thickness. Various switching dynamics are realized in these polar topologies, resulting in relaxor&#8208;ferroelectric&#8208;, antiferroelectric&#8208;, and paraelectric&#8208;like polarization behaviors, respectively. Ultrahigh energy&#8208;storage densities above 170 J cm&#8722;3 and efficiencies above 95% are achievable in STO/BFO/STO trilayers. This strategy should be generally implementable in other multilayer dielectrics and offers a new avenue to enhancing energy storage by tuning the polar topology and thus the polarization characteristics.

Abstract
Constructing composite structures is an essential approach for obtaining the multiple functionalities in single entity. A vailable synthesis methods of the composites need to be urgently exploited; especially in&#8208;situ construction. Here; we report a NiS/NiFe2O4 composite through a local coordination metal&#8208;S at the interface; derived from phase reconstruction in a highly defective matrix. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure confirmed that long&#8208;range order was broken via the local metal&#8208;S coordination; and by using the electron energy loss spectroscopy we identified the introduction of NiS/NiFe2O4 interfaces during the irradiation of plasma energy. Density functional theory calculations revealed that in&#8208;situ phase reconfiguration is crucial for synergistically reducing energetic barriers and accelerating reaction kinetics towards catalyzing the oxygen evolution. As a result; it leads to an overpotential of 230&#160;mV @10 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 for OER and half&#8208;wave potential of 0.81V&#160;for ORR; as well as an excellent Zinc&#8208;air batteries performance with a power density of 148.5 mW&#183;cm&#8211;2. Our work provides a new compositing strategy in terms of fast phase reconstruction of bifunctional catalyst.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Scale Auxetic Hierarchical Mechanical Metamaterials for Shape Morphing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Shape morphing and the possibility of having control over mechanical properties via designed deformations have attracted a lot of attention in the materials community and led to a variety of applications with an emphasis on the space industry. However, current materials normally do not allow to have a full control over the deformation pattern and often fail to replicate such behavior at low scales which is essential in flexible electronics. Thus, in this paper, we&#160;propose novel 2D and 3D microscopic hierarchical mechanical metamaterials using mutually&#8208;competing substructures within the system that are capable of exhibiting a broad range of the highly unusual auxetic behavior. Using experiments (3D microprinted polymers) supported by computer simulations, we&#160;show that such ability can be controlled through geometric design parameters. We&#160;finally demonstrate that the considered structure can form a composite capable of shape morphing allowing it to deform to a predefined shape.

         <title>All&#8208;van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals Barrier&#8208;Free Contacts for High&#8208;Mobility Transistors</title>

Abstract
Ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductor devices are considered with beyond&#8208;silicon potential but are severely troubled by high Schottky barriers of metal&#8208;semiconductor contacts, especially for p&#8208;type semiconductors. Since the severe Fermi&#8208;level pinning effect and the lack of conventional semimetals with high work functions, their Schottky hole barriers are hardly removed. Here, we firstly report an all&#8208;van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals barrier&#8208;free hole contact between p&#8208;type tellurene semiconductor and layered 1T&#8242;&#8208;WS2 semimetal which achieve a zero Schottky barrier height of 3&#177;9&#160;meV and the high field&#8208;effect mobility of &#8764;1304 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1. The formation of such contacts can be attributed to the higher work function of &#8764;4.95&#160;eV of the 1T&#8242;&#8208;WS2 semimetal, which is in sharp contrast with low work function (4.1&#8208;4.7&#160;eV) of conventional semimetals. Our study defines an available strategy for eliminating the Schottky barrier of metal&#8208;semiconductor contacts, facilitating 2D semiconductor&#8208;based electronics and optoelectronics to extend Moore's law.

&lt;p&gt;Ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor devices are considered with beyond-silicon potential but are severely troubled by high Schottky barriers of metal-semiconductor contacts, especially for p-type semiconductors. Since the severe Fermi-level pinning effect and the lack of conventional semimetals with high work functions, their Schottky hole barriers are hardly removed. Here, we firstly report an all-van-der-Waals barrier-free hole contact between p-type tellurene semiconductor and layered 1T&#8242;-WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; semimetal which achieve a zero Schottky barrier height of 3&#177;9&#160;meV and the high field-effect mobility of &#8764;1304 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Volumetric Bioprinting of Organoids and Optically Tuned Hydrogels to Build Liver&#8208;Like Metabolic Biofactories</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organ&#8208; and tissue&#8208;level biological functions are intimately linked to microscale cell&#8208;cell interactions and to the overarching tissue architecture. Together, biofabrication and organoid technologies offer the unique potential to engineer multi&#8208;scale living constructs, with cellular microenvironments formed by stem cell self&#8208;assembled structures embedded in customizable bioprinted geometries. This study introduces the volumetric bioprinting of complex organoid&#8208;laden constructs, which capture key functions of the human liver. Volumetric bioprinting via optical tomography shaped organoid&#8208;laden gelatin hydrogels into complex centimeter&#8208;scale 3D structures in under 20 seconds. Optically&#8208;tuned bioresins enabled refractive index matching of specific intracellular structures, countering the disruptive impact of cell&#8208;mediated light scattering on printing resolution. This layerless, nozzle&#8208;free technique poses no harmful mechanical stresses on organoids, resulting in superior viability and morphology preservation post&#8208;printing. Bioprinted organoids underwent hepatocytic differentiation showing albumin synthesis, liver&#8208;specific enzyme activity, and remarkably acquired native&#8208;like polarization. Organoids embedded within low stiffness gelatins (&lt;2&#160;kPa) were bioprinted into mathematically&#8208;defined lattices with varying degrees of pore network tortuosity, and cultured under perfusion. These structures acted as metabolic biofactories in which liver&#8208;specific ammonia detoxification could be enhanced by the architectural profile of the constructs. This technology opens up new possibilities for regenerative medicine and personalized drug testing.

         <title>Low Temperature Annealing Method for Alloy Nanostructures and Metasurfaces: Unlocking A Novel Degree of Freedom</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The material and exact shape of a nanostructure determine its optical response, which is especially strong for plasmonic metals. Unfortunately, only a few plasmonic metals are available, which limits the spectral range where these strong optical effects can be utilized. Alloying different plasmonic metals can overcome this limitation, at the expense of using a high temperature alloying process, which adversely destroys the nanostructure shape. Here, we develop a low temperature alloying process where the sample is heated at only 300&#176;C for 8 hours followed by 30&#160;min at 450&#176;C and fabricate Au&#8208;Ag nanostructures with a broad diversity of shapes, aspect ratios and stoichiometries. EDX and XPS analyses confirm the homogeneous alloying through the entire sample. Varying the alloy stoichiometry tunes the optical response and controls spectral features such as Fano resonances. Binary metasurfaces that combine nanostructures with different stoichiometries are fabricated using multiple&#8208;step electron beam lithography, and their optical function as hologram or Fresnel zone plate is demonstrated at the visible wavelength of &#955; = 532&#160;nm. This low temperature annealing technique provides a versatile and cost&#8208;effective way of fabricating complex Au&#8208;Ag nanostructures with arbitrary stoichiometry.

         <title>High&#8208;Strength and Injectable Supramolecular Hydrogel Self&#8208;Assembled by Monomeric Nucleoside for Tooth&#8208;Extraction Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneously achieving high strength and injectability in one hydrogel is challenging. A high strength and injectable supramolecular hydrogel is constructed by the self&#8208;assembly of a monomeric nucleoside molecular gelator (2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2&#8208;FA)). Notably, it exhibits excellent biocompatibility, fast biodegradation, antibacterial property, and osteoclast inhibition, making it a potential candidate biomaterial for tooth&#8208;extraction wound healing and tissue engineering.








Abstract
Hydrogels with high mechanical strength and injectability have attracted extensive attention in biomedical and tissue engineering. However, endowing a hydrogel with both properties is challenging because they are generally inversely related. In this work, by constructing a multi&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;bonding system, a high&#8208;strength and injectable supramolecular hydrogel is successfully fabricated. It is constructed by the self&#8208;assembly of a monomeric nucleoside molecular gelator (2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2&#8208;FA)) with distilled water/phosphate buffered saline as solvent. Its storage modulus reaches 1 MPa at a concentration of 5.0 wt%, which is the strongest supramolecular hydrogel comprising an ultralow&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (MW &lt; 300) gelator. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent shear&#8208;thinning injectability, and completes the sol&#8211;gel transition in seconds after injection at 37 &#176;C. The multi&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;bonding system is essentially based on the synergistic interactions between the double NH2 groups, water molecules, and 2&#8242;&#8208;F atoms. Furthermore, the 2&#8208;FA hydrogel exhibits excellent biocompatibility and antibacterial activity. When applied to rat molar extraction sockets, compared to natural healing and the commercial hemorrhage agent gelatin sponge, the 2&#8208;FA hydrogel exhibits faster degradation and induces less osteoclastic activity and inflammatory infiltration, resulting in more complete bone healing. In summary, this study provides ideas for proposing a multifunctional, high&#8208;strength, and injectable supramolecular hydrogel for various biomedical engineering applications.

         <title>Realizing 19.05% Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells by Progressively Improving Charge Extraction and Suppressing Charge Recombination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progressive improvement of charge extraction and suppression of charge recombination by side&#8208;chain engineering of Y&#8208;series nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), employing a ternary blend and introducing a volatilizable solid additive, fine&#8208;tunes the electronic properties of the NFAs and optimizes the morphology of the active layer and contributes to a record power conversion efficiency of 19.05% for single&#8208;junction polymer solar cells.








Abstract
Improving charge extraction and suppressing charge recombination are critically important to minimize the loss of absorbed photons and improve the device performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs). In this work, highly efficient PSCs are demonstrated by progressively improving the charge extraction and suppressing the charge recombination through the combination of side&#8208;chain engineering of new nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), adopting ternary blends, and introducing volatilizable solid additives. The 2D side chains on BTP&#8208;Th induce a certain steric hindrance for molecular packing and phase separation, which is mitigated by fluorination of side chains on BTP&#8208;FTh. Moreover, by introducing two highly crystalline molecules as the second acceptor and volatilizable solid additive, respectively, into the BTP&#8208;FTh&#8208;based host blend, the molecular crystallinity is significantly improved and the blend morphology is finely optimized. As expected, enhanced charge extraction and suppressed charge recombination are progressively realized, contributing to the largely improved fill factor (FF) of the resultant devices. Accompanied by the enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc), a record high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.05% is realized finally.

         <title>Asymmetric Chemical Functionalization of Top&#8208;Contact Electrodes: Tuning the Charge Injection for High&#8208;Performance MoS2 Field&#8208;Effect Transistors and Schottky Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically functionalized electrodes are integrated in top&#8208;contact field&#8208;effect MoS2 transistors by contact engineering through the dry transfer of self&#8208;assembled monolayers pre&#8208;modified electrodes. Charge injection is optimized by using ad hoc thiolated molecules with controlled dipole moments, thereby boosting the device performance. When asymmetrically functionalized electrodes are employed, Schottky diodes with a high rectification ratio could be realized.








Abstract
The fabrication of high&#8208;performance (opto&#8208;)electronic devices based on 2D channel materials requires the optimization of the charge injection at electrode&#8211;semiconductor interfaces. While chemical functionalization with chemisorbed self&#8208;assembled monolayers has been extensively exploited to adjust the work function of metallic electrodes in bottom&#8208;contact devices, such a strategy has not been demonstrated for the top&#8208;contact configuration, despite the latter being known to offer enhanced charge&#8208;injection characteristics. Here, a novel contact engineering method is developed to functionalize gold electrodes in top&#8208;contact field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) via the transfer of chemically pre&#8208;modified electrodes. The source and drain Au electrodes of the molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) FETs are functionalized with thiolated molecules possessing different dipole moments. While the modification of the electrodes with electron&#8208;donating molecules yields a marked improvement of device performance, the asymmetric functionalization of the source and drain electrodes with different molecules with opposed dipole moment enables the fabrication of a high&#8208;performance Schottky diode with a rectification ratio of &#8776;103. This unprecedented strategy to tune the charge injection in top&#8208;contact MoS2 FETs is of general applicability for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance (opto&#8208;)electronic devices, in which asymmetric charge injection is required, enabling tailoring of the device characteristics on demand.

         <title>Optical Rashba Effect in a Light&#8208;Emitting Perovskite Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optical Rashba effect in active halide perovskite metasurfaces with broken in&#8208;plane inversion symmetry, which allows generation, routing, and enhancement of chiral photoluminescence, is demonstrated. A degree of circular polarization of 60% at room temperature and a sixfold enhancement of photoluminescence intensity are experimentally achieved.








Abstract
The Rashba effect, i.e., the splitting of electronic spin&#8208;polarized bands in the momentum space of a crystal with broken inversion symmetry, has enabled the realization of spin&#8208;orbitronic devices, in which spins are manipulated by spin&#8211;orbit coupling. In optics, where the helicity of light polarization represents the spin degree of freedom for spin&#8211;momentum coupling, the optical Rashba effect is manifested by the splitting of optical states with opposite chirality in the momentum space. Previous realizations of the optical Rashba effect relied on passive devices determining the surface plasmon or light propagation inside nanostructures, or the directional emission of chiral luminescence when hybridized with light&#8208;emitting media. An active device underpinned by the optical Rashba effect is demonstrated here, in which a monolithic halide perovskite metasurface emits highly directional chiral photoluminescence. An all&#8208;dielectric metasurface design with broken in&#8208;plane inversion symmetry is directly embossed into the high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index, light&#8208;emitting perovskite film, yielding a degree of circular polarization of photoluminescence of 60% at room temperature.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Liquid Crystal Printheads for Spatial and Temporal Control of Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal printheads that are triggered by chemical/biochemical stimuli permit local control of the synthesis of a range of polymeric structures. The printheads use chemical/biochemical stimuli as inputs, perform on&#8208;board computations via interactions programmed by the liquid crystal, and then output spatially and temporally controlled polymerization processes.








Abstract
Polymerization reactions triggered by stimuli play a pivotal role in materials science, with applications ranging from lithography to biomedicine to adaptive materials. However, the development of chemically triggered, stimuli&#8208;responsive systems that can confer spatial and temporal control on polymerization remains a challenge. Herein, chemical&#8208;stimuli&#8208;induced polymerization based on a liquid crystal (LC) printhead is presented. The LC responds to a local chemical stimulus at its aqueous interface, resulting in the ejection of initiator into the solution to trigger polymerization. Various LC printhead geometries are designed, allowing programming of: i) bulk solution polymerization, ii) synthesis of a thin surface&#8208;confined polymeric coating, iii) polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers to form various nanostructures (sphere, worm&#8208;like, and vesicles), and iv) 3D polymeric structures printed according to local solution conditions. The approach is demonstrated using amphiphiles, multivalent ions, and biomolecules as stimuli.

Various LC printhead geometries are designed, allowing programming of: i) bulk solution polymerization, ii) synthesis of a thin surface-confined polymeric coating, iii) polymerization-induced self-assembly of block copolymers to form various nanostructures (sphere, worm-like, and vesicles), and iv) 3D polymeric structures printed according to local solution conditions. The approach is demonstrated using amphiphiles, multivalent ions, and biomolecules as stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Growth of Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Films via an Orientation Filter Funnel for High&#8208;Performance Transistors with Excellent Uniformity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conceptually new orientation filter funnel method is developed for scalable growth of organic single&#8208;crystal films (OSCFs) with singly orientated crystals. This approach can produce seed crystals with the same crystallographic axis and then maintain epitaxial growth of these crystals, enabling the formation of OSCFs. The obtained OSCFs show 4.5&#8208;fold enhanced mobility and excellent uniformity with mobility variable coefficient of 9.8%.








Abstract
Organic single&#8208;crystal films (OSCFs) provide an unprecedented opportunity for the development of new&#8208;generation organic single&#8208;crystal electronics. However, crystallization of organic films is normally governed by stochastic nucleation and incoherent growth, posing a formidable challenge to grow large&#8208;sized OSCFs. Here, an &#8220;orientation filter funnel&#8221; concept is presented for the scalable growth of OSCFs with well&#8208;aligned, singly orientated crystals. By rationally designing solvent wetting/dewetting patterns on the substrate, this approach can produce seed crystals with the same crystallographic orientation and then maintain epitaxial growth of these crystals, enabling the formation of large&#8208;area OSCFs. As a result, this unique concept for crystal growth not only enhances the average mobility of organic film by 4.5&#8208;fold but also improves its uniformity of electrical properties, with a low mobility variable coefficient of 9.8%, the new lowest record among organic devices. The method offers a general and scalable route to produce OSCFs toward real&#8208;word electronic applications.

         <title>Thermalization of Fluorescent Protein Exciton&#8208;Polaritons at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fluorescent proteins (FPs) have recently emerged as a serious contender for realizing ultra&#8208;low threshold room temperature exciton&#8208;polariton condensation and lasing. Our contribution investigates the thermalization of FP microcavity exciton&#8208;polaritons upon optical pumping under ambient conditions. We realize polariton cooling using a new FP molecule, called mScarlet, coupled strongly to the optical modes in a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity. Interestingly, at the threshold excitation energy (fluence) of &#8764;9 nJ/pulse (15.6 mJ/cm2), we observe an effective temperature, Teff &#8764;350 &#177; 35 K close to the lattice temperature indicative of strongly thermalized exciton&#8208;polaritons at equilibrium. This efficient thermalization results from the interplay of radiative pumping facilitated by the energetics of the lower polariton branch and the cavity Q&#8208;factor. Direct evidence for dramatic switching from an equilibrium state into a metastable state is observed for the organic cavity polariton device at room temperature via deviation from the Maxwell&#8208;Boltzmann statistics at k&#8214; = 0 above the threshold. Thermalized polariton gases in organic systems at equilibrium hold substantial promise for designing room temperature polaritonic circuits, switches, and lattices for analog simulation.

Abstract
The ability to rapidly assess and monitor patient immune responses is critical for clinical diagnostics; vaccine design; and fundamental investigations into the presence or generation of protective immunity against infectious diseases. Recently; findings on the limits of antibody&#8208;based protection provided by B&#8208;cells have highlighted the importance of engaging pathogen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cells for long&#8208;lasting and broad protection against viruses and their emergent variants such as in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. However; low&#8208;cost and point&#8208;of&#8208;care tools for detecting engagement of T&#8208;cell immunity in patients are conspicuously lacking in ongoing efforts to assess and control population&#8208;wide disease risk. Currently available tools for human T&#8208;cell analysis are time and resource&#8208;intensive. Utilizing multichannel silicon nanowire field effect transistors (Si&#8208;NW&#8208;FET) compatible with complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS); we developed a device designed for rapid and label&#8208;free detection of human T&#8208;cell immune responses. We demonstrate the generalizability of this approach by measuring T&#8208;cell responses against melanoma antigen MART1; common and seasonal viruses CMV; EBV; flu; as well as emergent pandemic coronavirus; SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Further; this device provides a modular and translational platform for optimizing vaccine formulations and combinations; offering quick and quantitative readouts for acquisition and persistence of T&#8208;cell immunity against variant&#8208;driven pathogens such as Flu and pandemic SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Chemical Potential Diagram&#8208;Guided Rational Tuning of Electrical Properties: A Case Study of CsPbBr3 for X&#8208;ray Detection</title>

Abstract
Controlling the carrier polarity and concentration underlies most electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, for the intensively studied lead halide perovskites, the doping tunability is inefficient. In this work, taking CsPbBr3 as an example, we reveal the coexistences of metallic Pb or CsBr3/Br2, rather than the precursor ratio, can provide Pb&#8208;rich/Br&#8208;poor or Br&#8208;rich/Pb&#8208;poor chemical conditions, enabling the tunability of electrical properties from weak n&#8208;type, intrinsic, to moderate p&#8208;type. Experimentally, under Br2&#8208;exposure treatment, we achieved Fermi level shift as large as 1.00 eV, which is the highest value among all kinds of doping methods. The X&#8208;ray detector based on the intrinsic CsPbBr3 exhibited excellent performance, with a negligible dark current drift of 7.1&#215;10&#8722;4 nA cm&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 V&#8722;1, a low detection limit of 103.6 nGyair s&#8722;1, and a high sensitivity of 9085 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. This work provides a critical understanding and guidance for tuning the electrical properties of lead halide perovskites, which establishes good foundations for achieving intrinsic perovskite semiconductors and also constructing potential homojunction devices.

         <title>Co&#8208;Delivery of Precisely Prescribed Multi&#8208;Prodrug Combination by an Engineered Nanocarrier enables Efficient Individualized Cancer Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymeric prodrug strategy ensures ratiometric loading and synchronized release of in vitro screened drug combinations under the premise of uniform nanoproperty. The scalable nanoparticles made from a pre&#8208;determined prodrug combination and cascade&#8208;responsive vehicle precisely deliver any drug combination into tumor tissue, facilitating the translational research of individualized combination therapy.








Abstract
The limited anticancer drug library and the frequent occurrence of drug resistance have driven monotherapy&#8208;based cancer therapy into a difficult situation. Considering the formidable process of new drug discovery, combination therapy using currently available drugs is a potential alternative. Nevertheless, the barrier between in vitro combination screening and precise in vivo delivery remains insurmountable in the current free&#8208;drug&#8208; or nanoparticle (NP)&#8208;based combination therapy, which substantially hinders the application of combination therapy. Herein, a novel, precise drug delivery strategy to realize efficient and individualized combination therapy is proposed. Nanomedicine (NM) is engineered using a microfluidics&#8208;based mixer by combining rationally designed polymeric prodrugs of three commercial chemotherapeutics and a cascade&#8208;responsive block copolymer; the NM possesses ratiometric drug loading and synchronized drug release. In addition to quantitative drug loading and precisely controlled drug combination, consistent nanoproperties of these NPs make their in vivo fate predictable. Consequently, tumor growth and metastasis can be effectively inhibited by precisely prescribed NPs derived from in vitro combination screening. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study clearly reveals the feasibility of overcoming the current drug&#8208;library limitations through precise delivery of any predetermined drug combination, facilitating translational research of individualized combination therapy.

Herein, a novel, precise drug delivery strategy to realize efficient and individualized combination therapy is proposed. Nanomedicine (NM) is engineered using a microfluidics-based mixer by combining rationally designed polymeric prodrugs of three commercial chemotherapeutics and a cascade-responsive block copolymer; the NM possesses ratiometric drug loading and synchronized drug release. In addition to quantitative drug loading and precisely controlled drug combination, consistent nanoproperties of these NPs make their in vivo fate predictable. Consequently, tumor growth and metastasis can be effectively inhibited by precisely prescribed NPs derived from in vitro combination screening. This proof-of-concept study clearly reveals the feasibility of overcoming the current drug-library limitations through precise delivery of any predetermined drug combination, facilitating translational research of individualized combination therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deep Learning Unlocks X&#8208;ray Microtomography Segmentation of Multiclass Microdamage in Heterogeneous Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep&#8208;learning machine is created to segment sparse, multiclass microdamage in advanced composite laminates that feature complex microstructures and failure behavior, with &#8776;99.99% binary accuracy using 65&#160;000 tomograms in 3D X&#8208;ray datasets. The deep&#8208;learning approach accelerates heterogeneous materials knowledge creation by two orders of magnitude in a generalizable way, breaking a longstanding bottleneck while additionally introducing objectivity.








Abstract
Four&#8208;dimensional quantitative characterization of heterogeneous materials using in situ synchrotron radiation computed tomography can reveal 3D sub&#8208;micrometer features, particularly damage, evolving under load, leading to improved materials. However, dataset size and complexity increasingly require time&#8208;intensive and subjective semi&#8208;automatic segmentations. Here, the first deep learning (DL) convolutional neural network (CNN) segmentation of multiclass microscale damage in heterogeneous bulk materials is presented, teaching on advanced aerospace&#8208;grade composite damage using &#8776;65&#160;000 (trained) human&#8208;segmented tomograms. The trained CNN machine segments complex and sparse (&lt;&lt;1% of volume) composite damage classes to &#8776;99.99% agreement, unlocking both objectivity and efficiency, with nearly 100% of the human time eliminated, which traditional rule&#8208;based algorithms do not approach. The trained machine is found to perform as well or better than the human due to &#8220;machine&#8208;discovered&#8221; human segmentation error, with machine improvements manifesting primarily as new damage discovery and segmentation augmentation/extension in artifact&#8208;rich tomograms. Interrogating a high&#8208;level network hyperparametric space on two material configurations, DL is found to be a disruptive approach to quantitative structure&#8211;property characterization, enabling high&#8208;throughput knowledge creation (accelerated by two orders of magnitude) via generalizable, ultrahigh&#8208;resolution feature segmentation.

The 3D nanocomposite structure of the plated lithium (LiMetal) and solid electrolyte interphases (SEI), including a polymer&#8208;rich surficial passivation layer (SEI exoskeleton) and inorganic SEI &#8220;fossils&#8221; buried inside LiMetal is resolved using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy.








Abstract
The 3D nanocomposite structure of plated lithium (LiMetal) and solid electrolyte interphases (SEI), including a polymer&#8208;rich surficial passivation layer (SEI exoskeleton) and inorganic SEI &#8220;fossils&#8221; buried inside amorphous Li matrix, is resolved using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. With ether&#8208;based DOLDME&#8208;LiTFSI electrolyte, LiF and Li2O nanocrystals are formed and embedded in a thin but tough amorphous polymer in the SEI exoskeleton. The fast Li&#8208;stripping directions are along [1&#175;10] or [121&#175;], which produces eight exposed {111} planes at halfway charging. Full Li stripping produces completely sagging, empty SEI husks that can sustain large bending and buckling, with the smallest bending radius of curvature observed approaching tens of nanometers without apparent damage. In the 2nd round of Li plating, a thin LiBCC sheet first nucleates at the current collector, extends to the top end of the deflated SEI husk, and then expands its thickness. The apparent zero wetting angle between LiBCC and the SEI interior means that the heterogeneous nucleation energy barrier is zero. Due to its complete&#8208;wetting property and chemo&#8208;mechanical stability, the SEI largely prevents further reactions between the Li metal and the electrolyte, which explains the superior performance of Li&#8208;metal batteries with ether&#8208;based electrolytes. However, uneven refilling of the SEI husks results in dendrite protrusions and some new SEI formation during the 2nd plating. A strategy to form bigger SEI capsules during the initial cycle with higher energy density than the following cycles enables further enhanced Coulombic efficiency to above 99%.

         <title>Harnessing the Quantum Behavior of Spins on Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating electron spin resonance capability in spin&#8208;polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, quantum states of individual spins on surfaces can be initialized, controlled, and read out. Individual spins and artificial spin structures built atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom provide new platforms for sensing magnetic interactions, performing quantum operations, and simulating spin Hamiltonians at the atomic scale.








Abstract
The desire to control and measure individual quantum systems such as atoms and ions in a vacuum has led to significant scientific and engineering developments in the past decades that form the basis of today's quantum information science. Single atoms and molecules on surfaces, on the other hand, are heavily investigated by physicists, chemists, and material scientists in search of novel electronic and magnetic functionalities. These two paths crossed in 2015 when it was&#160;first clearly demonstrated that individual spins on a surface can be coherently controlled and read out in an all&#8208;electrical fashion. The enabling technique is a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and electron spin resonance, which offers unprecedented coherent controllability at the Angstrom length scale. This review aims to illustrate the essential ingredients that allow the quantum operations of single spins on surfaces. Three domains of applications of surface spins, namely quantum sensing, quantum control, and quantum simulation, are discussed with physical principles explained and examples presented. Enabled by the atomically&#8208;precise fabrication capability of STM, single spins on surfaces might one day lead to the realization of quantum nanodevices and artificial quantum materials at the atomic&#160;scale.

         <title>Cascade&#8208;Targeting Poly(amino acid) Nanoparticles Eliminate Intracellular Bacteria via On&#8208;Site Antibiotic Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade&#8208;targeting drug delivery system (DDS) based on mannose&#8208;decorated poly(&#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;phenylalanine)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(&#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;d&#8208;aminoalanine) is proposed. The DDS targets macrophages and intracellular MRSA in a cascade manner, going through a procedure of macrophages&#8208;specific endocytosis, lysosome escape, intracellular methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus targeting, and on&#8208;site rifampicin release. The DDS shows a distinguished performance for eliminating intracellular MRSA regardless of their latent or dormant states.








Abstract
Intracellular bacteria in latent or dormant states tolerate high&#8208;dose antibiotics. Fighting against these opportunistic bacteria has been a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, the design of a cascade&#8208;targeting drug delivery system (DDS) that can sequentially target macrophages and intracellular bacteria, exhibiting on&#8208;site drug delivery, is reported. The DDS is fabricated by encapsulating rifampicin (Rif) into mannose&#8208;decorated poly(&#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;phenylalanine)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(&#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;d&#8208;aminoalanine) nanoparticles, denoted as Rif@FAM NPs. The mannose units on Rif@FAM NPs guide the initial macrophage&#8208;specific uptake and intracellular accumulation. After the uptake, the detachment of mannose in acidic phagolysosome via Schiff base cleavage exposes the d&#8208;aminoalanine moieties, which subsequently steer the NPs to escape from lysosomes and target intracellular bacteria through peptidoglycan&#8208;specific binding, as evidenced by the in situ/ex situ co&#8208;localization using confocal, flow cytometry, and transmission electron microscopy. Through the on&#8208;site Rif delivery, Rif@FAM NPs show superior in vitro and in vivo elimination efficiency than the control groups of free Rif or the DDSs lacking the macrophages&#8208; or bacteria&#8208;targeting moieties. Furthermore, Rif@FAM NPs remodel the innate immune response of the infected macrophages by upregulating M1/M2 polarization, resulting in a reinforced antibacterial capacity. Therefore, this biocompatible DDS enabling macrophages and bacteria targeting in a cascade manner provides a new outlook for the therapy of intracellular pathogen infection.

         <title>Epitaxial Growth of Ultrathin Highly Crystalline Pt&#8211;Ni Nanostructure on a Metal Carbide Template for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;carbide&#8208;assisted epitaxial growth strategy is demonstrated as an effective method for fabricating highly active Pt&#8208;based catalysts. Owing to the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)&#8208;favored facets and high active surface area, the derived ultrathin highly crystalline Pt3Ni nanocages display excellent ORR activity. This novel method offers a promising and economical routine for design excellent noble metal electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Structure engineering strategies such as core&#8211;shell and hollow nanostructures are effective pathways to improve the utilization of noble metals for catalysis. However, nowadays materials design based on these strategies still largely rely on precious metal templates. Herein, the epitaxial growth of highly crystalline Pt3Ni overlayer on earth&#8208;abundant nickel carbide is reported, forming Ni3C@Pt3Ni core&#8211;shell nanoparticles with a well&#8208;defined interface through a new lattice&#8208;match&#8208;directed synthetic strategy. Derived from such core&#8211;shell nanostructures, ultrathin highly crystalline Pt3Ni nanocages have an advantageous configuration of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)&#8208;favored facets and inherently high active surface area for the ORR, bringing high mass activity and specific activity as much as 4.71&#160;A&#160;mgPt&#8722;1 and 5.14&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, which are 26 and 20 times to that of commercial Pt/C, respectively. This novel epitaxial growth of platinum opens up new avenues to rationally design highly active and economical electrocatalysts.

         <title>The Road for 2D Semiconductors in the Silicon Age</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of fusing 2D materials with silicon technologies, including 2D logic and memory devices, enabling the mitigation of challenges related to silicon integrated circuits (ICs) and even the creation of technologies beyond silicon, is highlighted. The progress of 2D IC applications and the prospects for realizing wafer&#8208;scale heterogeneous integration compatible with silicon ICs are also summarized.








Abstract
Continued reduction in transistor size can improve the performance of silicon integrated circuits (ICs). However, as Moore's law approaches physical limits, high&#8208;performance growth in silicon ICs becomes unsustainable, due to challenges of scaling, energy efficiency, and memory limitations. The ultrathin layers, diverse band structures, unique electronic properties, and silicon&#8208;compatible processes of 2D materials create the potential to consistently drive advanced performance in ICs. Here, the potential of fusing 2D materials with silicon ICs to minimize the challenges in silicon ICs, and to create technologies beyond the von Neumann architecture, is presented, and the killer applications for 2D materials in logic and memory devices to ease scaling, energy efficiency bottlenecks, and memory dilemmas encountered in silicon ICs are discussed. The fusion of 2D materials allows the creation of all&#8208;in&#8208;one perception, memory, and computation technologies beyond the von Neumann architecture to enhance system efficiency and remove computing power bottlenecks. Progress on the 2D ICs demonstration is summarized, as well as the technical hurdles it faces in terms of wafer&#8208;scale heterostructure growth, transfer, and compatible integration with silicon ICs. Finally, the promising pathways and obstacles to the technological advances in ICs due to the integration of 2D materials with silicon are presented.

         <title>Bioinspired Electron Polarization of Nanozyme with Human Self&#8208;Generated Electric Field for Cancer Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
ROS production efficiencies of the nanocatalysts is highly desired for cancer therapy, but currently the ROS generation efficiency is still far from defecting the tumors. Therefore, improving their ROS generation ability is highly desirable for cancer therapy. Herein, inspired by the electrostatic preorganization effect during the catalysis of natural protein enzymes, we developed a human self&#8208;driven catalysis&#8208;promoting system, TENG&#8208;CatSystem, to improve catalytic cancer therapy. TENG&#8208;CatSystem is mainly composed of three main elements: a human self&#8208;driven triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) as the electric field stimulator to provide electric pulses with high biosafety, a nanozyme comprising a one&#8208;dimensional ferriporphyrin covalent organic framework coated on a carbon nanotube (COF&#8208;CNT) to generate ROS, and a COF&#8208;CNT&#8208;embedded conductive hydrogel that can be injected into the tumor tissues to increase local accumulation of COF&#8208;CNT and decrease the electrical impedances of tissues. Under the human self&#8208;generated electric field provided by the wearable TENG, the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of COF&#8208;CNT was four&#8208;fold higher than that without an electric field. Highly malignant 4T1 breast carcinoma in mice was significantly suppressed using TENG&#8208;CatSystem. The human self&#8208;driven TENG&#8208;CatSystem not only demonstrates high catalytic ROS generation efficiency for improved cancer therapy, but also offers a new therapeutic mode of self&#8208;driven at&#8208;home therapy.

         <title>Catalytic Kinetics Regulation for Enhanced Electrochemical Nitrogen Oxidation by Ru Nanoclusters&#8208;Coupled Mn3O4 Catalysts Decorated with Atomically Dispersed Ru Atoms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrochemical N2 oxidation reaction (NOR), using water and N2 in the atmosphere, represents a sustainable approach for nitric production to replace the conventional industrial synthesis with high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission. While, owing to chemical inertness of N2 and sluggish kinetics for 10&#8208;electron transfer, emerging electrocatalysts remain largely underexplored. Herein, Ru nanoclusters&#8208;coupled Mn3O4 catalysts decorated with atomically dispersed Ru atoms (Ru&#8208;Mn3O4) were designed and explored as an advanced electrocatalyst for ambient N2 oxidation, with an excellent Faraday efficiency (28.87%) and a remarkable NO3&#8722; yield (35.34&#160;&#956;g h&#8211;1 mg&#8211;1cat.), respectively. Experiments and DFT calculations revealed that the outstanding activity was ascribed to the co&#8208;existence of Ru cluster and single&#8208;atom&#8208;Ru. The synergistic effect between Ru cluster and Mn3O4 could effectively activate chemically inert N2, lower the kinetic barrier for the vital breakage of N&#2301;N. The intensive *OH supply and enhanced conductivity were used to regular the catalytic kinetics for optimized performance. This work provides fire&#8208;new ideas for the rational design of electrocatalysts in complicated electrocatalytic reactions with multiple dynamics&#8208;different steps.

         <title>Multivariate Analysis Identifying [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+ Design and Device Architecture Enables First&#8208;Class Blue and White Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivariate analysis sets relevant statistical correlation between the X&#8208;ray structure and electronic features of [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+ and their photo&#8208; and electroluminescent features in thin&#8208;films to elucidate the best complex design for the first blue and white light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells, outperforming the prior art.








Abstract
White light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) comprising only [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+ have not been reported yet, as all the attempts toward blue&#8208;emitting complexes failed. Multivariate analysis, based on prior&#8208;art [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+&#8208;based thin&#8208;film lighting (&gt;90&#160;papers) and refined with computational calculations, identifies the best blue&#8208;emitting [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+ design for LECs, that is, N^N: 2&#8208;(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)&#8208;6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine and P^P: 4,5&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene, to achieve predicted thin&#8208;film emission at 490&#160;nm and device performance of 3.8&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1@170&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. Validation comes from synthesis, X&#8208;ray structure, thin&#8208;film spectroscopic/microscopy/electrochemical characterization, and device optimization, realizing the first [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+&#8208;based blue&#8208;LEC with 3.6&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1@180&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. This represents a record performance compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art tricoordinate Cu(I)&#8208;complexes blue&#8208;LECs (0.17&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1@20&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2). Versatility is confirmed with the synthesis of the analogous complex with 2&#8208;(4&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)phenyl)&#8208;6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyrazine (N^N), showing a close prediction/experiment match: &#955;&#160;=&#160;590/580&#160;nm; efficiency&#160;=&#160;0.55/0.60&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1@30&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. Finally, experimental design is applied to fabricate the best white multicomponent host:guest LEC, reducing the number of trial&#8208;error attempts toward the first white all&#8208;[Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+&#8208;LECs with 0.6&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1@30&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2.

Hence, this work sets in the first multivariate approach to design emitters/active layers, accomplishing first&#8208;class [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]+&#8208;based blue/white LECs that were&#160;previously elusive.

&lt;p&gt;Multivariate analysis sets relevant statistical correlation between the X-ray structure and electronic features of [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and their photo- and electroluminescent features in thin-films to elucidate the best complex design for the first blue and white light-emitting electrochemical cells, outperforming the prior art.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) comprising only [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; have not been reported yet, as all the attempts toward blue-emitting complexes failed. Multivariate analysis, based on prior-art [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-based thin-film lighting (&amp;gt;90&#160;papers) and refined with computational calculations, identifies the best blue-emitting [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; design for LECs, that is, N^N: 2-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-6-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine and P^P: 4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethylxanthene, to achieve predicted thin-film emission at 490&#160;nm and device performance of 3.8&#160;cd&#160;A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;@170&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Validation comes from synthesis, X-ray structure, thin-film spectroscopic/microscopy/electrochemical characterization, and device optimization, realizing the first [Cu(N^N)(P^P)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-based blue-LEC with 3.6&#160;cd&#160;A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;@180&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This represents a record performance compared to the state-of-the-art tricoordinate Cu(I)-complexes blue-LECs (0.17&#160;cd&#160;A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;@20&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Versatility is confirmed with the synthesis of the analogous complex with 2-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-6-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyrazine (N^N), showing a close prediction/experiment match: &#955;&#160;=&#160;590/580&#160;nm; efficiency&#160;=&#160;0.55/0.60&#160;cd&#160;A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;@30&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Energy&#8208;saving Hydrogen Production by Seawater Electrolysis Coupling Sulfion Degradation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electrolysis of costless and infinite seawater is a promising way towards grid&#8208;scale hydrogen production without causing freshwater stress. Practical potential of this technology, however, is hindered by low energy efficiency and anode corrosion by detrimental chlorine chemistry in seawater in addition to unaffordable electricity expanse. Herein, we report energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production by chlorine&#8208;free seawater splitting coupling sulfion oxidation. It yields hydrogen at a low cell voltage of 0.97&#160;V, cutting the electricity consumption to 2.32&#160;kWh per m3 H2 at 300&#160;mA cm&#8211;2. Compared to alkaline water electrolysis, the energy expense is primarily saved by 60% with 50% lower energy equivalent input. Benefited from ultralow cell voltage, the hazardous chlorine chemistry is fully avoided without anode corrosion regardless Cl&#8211; crossover. Meanwhile, it also allows fast degradation of S2&#8211; pollutant from water body to value&#8208;added sulfur with 80% efficiency for further reducing hydrogen cost and protection of the ecosystem. Connecting such a hybrid seawater electrolyzer to the commercial solar cell can harvest the hydrogen from seawater with better sustainability. This work may offer new opportunities for low&#8208;cost hydrogen production from unlimited ocean resources and environmental protection.

         <title>Biodegradable Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Gated Organosilica for Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Unlocked Glutathione&#8208;Depletion&#8208;Enhanced Synergistic Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;unlocked nanoformula is judiciously designed by the smart use of a biodegradable metal&#8211;organic framework to gate the pores of sub&#8208;50&#160;nm hollow mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles. This method can not only realize acidic&#8208;TME&#8208;responsive cisplatin release, but also deplete glutathione and simultaneously catalyze the generation of &#8226;OH via Cu2+ for highly efficient tumor&#8208;specific synergistic chemotherapy/chemodynamic therapy against cancer with negligible biosafety concerns.








Abstract
The clinical employment of cisplatin (cis&#8208;diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP)) is largely constrained due to the non&#8208;specific delivery and resultant serious systemic toxicity. Small&#8208;sized biocompatible and biodegradable hollow mesoporous organosilica (HMOS) nanoparticles show superior advantages for targeted CDDP delivery but suffer from premature CDDP leakage. Herein, the smart use of a bimetallic Zn2+/Cu2+ co&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is made to block the pores of HMOS for preventing potential leakage of CDDP and remarkably increasing the loading capacity of HMOS. Once reaching the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME), the outer MOF can decompose quickly to release CDDP for chemotherapy against cancer. Besides, the concomitant release of dopant Cu2+ can deplete the intracellular glutathione (GSH) for increased toxicity of CDDP as well as catalyzing the decomposition of intratumoral H2O2 into highly toxic &#8226;OH for chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Moreover, the substantially reduced GSH can also protect the yielded &#8226;OH from scavenging and thus greatly improve the &#8226;OH&#8208;based CDT effect. In addition to providing a hybrid HMOS@MOF nanocarrier, this study is also expected to establish a new form of TME&#8208;unlocked nanoformula for highly efficient tumor&#8208;specific GSH&#8208;depletion&#8208;enhanced synergistic chemotherapy/chemodynamic therapy.

         <title>A Ferrotoroidic Candidate with Well&#8208;Separated Spin Chains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferrotoroidic order is one of the four primary ferroic order forms. Ba6Cr2S10 is reported to be a rare ferrotoroidic candidate with well&#8208;separated 1D spin chain, where the spins are dimerized and antiferromagnetic&#8208;like coupled and the toroidal moment is composed of only two antiparallel spins.








Abstract
The search of novel quasi&#8208;1D materials is one of the important aspects in the field of material science. Toroidal moment, the order parameter of ferrotoroidic order, can be generated by a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail configuration of magnetic moment. It has been theoretically proposed that 1D dimerized and antiferromagnetic (AFM)&#8208;like spin chain hosts ferrotoroidicity and has the toroidal moment composed of only two antiparallel spins. Here, the authors report a ferrotoroidic candidate of Ba6Cr2S10 with such a theoretical model of spin chain. The structure consists of unique dimerized face&#8208;sharing CrS6 octahedral chains along the c axis. An AFM&#8208;like ordering at &#8776;10 K breaks both space&#8208; and time&#8208;reversal symmetries and the magnetic point group of mm&#8242;2&#8242;allows three ferroic orders in Ba6Cr2S10: (anti)ferromagnetic, ferroelectric, and ferrotoroidic orders. Their investigation reveals that Ba6Cr2S10 is a rare ferrotoroid ic candidate with quasi 1D spin chain, which can be considered as a starting point for the further exploration of the physics and applications of ferrotoroidicity.

         <title>Cellular Nanosponges for Biological Neutralization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent development of cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles, namely cellular nanosponges, as host cell decoys for biological neutralization applications is reviewed, including their use to neutralize bacterial toxins, chemical toxicants, inflammatory cytokines, pathological antibodies, and viruses. For each area, the design of different cellular nanosponges and their corresponding neutralization functions are discussed.








Abstract
Biological neutralization represents a general strategy that deploys therapeutic agents to bind with harmful molecules or infectious pathogens, block their bioactivity, and thus prevent them from causing the diseases. Here, a comprehensive review of using cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles, namely &#8220;cellular nanosponges,&#8221; as host decoys for a wide range of biological neutralization applications is provided. Compared to traditional neutralization strategies, the cellular nanosponges stand out by mimicking susceptible host cells rather than accommodating the structures of the causative agents for the design of therapeutics. As all pathological agents must interact with host cells for bioactivity, nanosponges bypass the diversity of these agents and create function&#8208;driven and broad&#8208;spectrum neutralization solutions. The review focuses on the recent progress of using this new nanomedicine platform for neutralization against five primary pathological agents, including bacterial toxins, chemical toxicants, inflammatory cytokines, pathological antibodies, and viruses. Existing studies have established cellular nanosponges as versatile tools for biological neutralization. A thorough review of the cellular nanosponge technology is expected to inspire more refined cellular nanosponge designs and unique neutralization applications to address unsolved medical problems.

         <title>Ultrasensitive and Robust 120&#160;keV Hard X&#8208;Ray Imaging Detector based on Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskite CsPbBr3&#8722;nIn Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CsPbBr2.9I0.1 (I0.1) detector shows the no&#8208;drift dark current and a record sensitivity of 6.3 &#215; 104&#160;&#181;C Gy&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 120&#160;keV high&#8208;energy hard X&#8208;rays under a 5000&#160;V cm&#8722;1 electric field due to the suppressed ion migration. Moreover, clear X&#8208;ray imaging of the &#8220;pork rib&#8221; is realized using the I0.1 planar array detector under 120&#160;keV X&#8208;ray irradiation.








Abstract
The relatively low resistivity and severe ion migration in CsPbBr3 significantly degrade the performance of X&#8208;ray detectors due to their high detection limit and current drift. The electrical properties and X&#8208;ray detection performances of CsPbBr3&#8722;nIn single crystals are investigated by doping the iodine atoms into the melt&#8208;grown CsPbBr3. The resistivity of CsPbBr3&#8722;nIn single crystals increases from 3.6 &#215; 109 (CsPbBr3) to 2.2 &#215; 1011 (CsPbBr2I) &#937; cm, restraining the leak current and decreasing the detection limit of the detector. Additionally, CsPbBr3&#8722;nIn single crystals exhibit stable dark currents, arising from their high ion migration activation energy. A record sensitivity of 6.3 &#215; 104 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 (CsPbBr2.9I0.1) and a low detection limit of 54 nGy s&#8722;1 (CsPbBr2I) are achieved by CsPbBr3&#8722;nIn single crystals for the 120 keV hard X&#8208;ray detection under a 5000 V cm&#8722;1 electrical field. The CsPbBr2.9I0.1 detector shows a stable current response with a dark current density of 0.58 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 for 30 days and clear imaging for 120 keV Xrays at ambient conditions. The effective iodine atom doping strategy makes the CsPbBr3&#8722;nIn single crystals promising for reproducible high&#8208;energy hard X&#8208;ray imaging systems.

         <title>A Solution&#8208;Processed Inorganic Emitter with High Spectral Selectivity for Efficient Subambient Radiative Cooling in Hot Humid Climates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different emissive behaviors between a bulk film and particles in reststrahlen band are utilized and an emitter with excellent spectrum selectivity is achieved. This emitter successfully realizes good subambient cooling in hot and humid conditions, which is always a challenge for radiative cooling. The all&#8208;inorganic components and solution&#8208;based fabrication process render it durable and scalable simultaneously.








Abstract
Daytime radiative cooling provides an eco&#8208;friendly solution to space cooling with zero energy consumption. Despite significant advances, most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art radiative coolers show broadband infrared emission with low spectral selectivity, which limits their cooling temperatures, especially in hot humid regions. Here, an all&#8208;inorganic narrowband emitter comprising a solution&#8208;derived SiOxNy layer sandwiched between a reflective substrate and a self&#8208;assembly monolayer of SiO2 microspheres is reported. It shows a high and diffusive solar reflectance (96.4%) and strong infrared&#8208;selective emittance (94.6%) with superior spectral selectivity (1.46). Remarkable subambient cooling of up to 5&#160;&#176;C in autumn and 2.5&#160;&#176;C in summer are achieved under high humidity without any solar shading or convection cover at noontime in a subtropical coastal city, Hong Kong. Owing to the all&#8208;inorganic hydrophobic structure, the emitter shows outstanding resistance to ultraviolet and water in long&#8208;term durability tests. The scalable&#8208;solution&#8208;based fabrication renders this stable high&#8208;performance emitter promising for large&#8208;scale deployment in various climates.

         <title>Efficiency of Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes: A Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The various contributions to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are discussed. An important contribution to the EQE of a PLED orignates from triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA). Experimentally, it is obtained that TTA contributes to a singlet&#8208;exciton generation efficiency of &#8776;40% in a PPV&#8208;based PLED, giving rise to an EQE of &#8776;4% instead of the expected value of 2.5%.








Abstract
The various contributions to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are discussed. The EQE of an organic light&#8208;emitting diode is governed by a number of parameters, such as the electrical efficiency, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), the optical outcoupling efficiency and the spin statistics for singlet exciton generation. In the last decade, the electrical efficiency has been determined from a numerical PLED device model. More recently, an optical model to simulate the fraction of photons outcoupled to air for PLEDs with a broad recombination zone has been developed. Together with the directly measured PLQY, the EQE of a PLED can then be estimated. However, it has been observed that the measured EQEs of fluorescent PLEDs, including the model system super&#8208;yellow poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (SY&#8208;PPV) often exceed the expected values. To solve this discrepancy, it is demonstrate that the electrical PLED model has to be expanded by the inclusion of triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA), which is shown to be responsible for a substantial EQE enhancement. Experimentally, it is obtained that TTA contributes to a singlet&#8208;exciton generation efficiency of &#8776;40% in SY&#8208;PPV PLEDs, giving rise to an EQE of &#8776;4% instead of the expected value of 2.5%.

&lt;p&gt;The various contributions to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) are discussed. An important contribution to the EQE of a PLED orignates from triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA). Experimentally, it is obtained that TTA contributes to a singlet-exciton generation efficiency of &#8776;40% in a PPV-based PLED, giving rise to an EQE of &#8776;4% instead of the expected value of 2.5%.

         <title>Observation of 3D Biexcitons in Pristine&#8208;Quality CH3NH3PbBr3 Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, the existence of biexcitons in high&#8208;quality 3D perovskite single crystals is demonstrated based on the series of clear&#8208;cut spectroscopic evidences: i) exciton&#8211;biexciton population dynamics, ii) giant resonant two&#8208;photon excitation of biexcitons, iii) inverted Boltzmann&#8208;type spectral feature, and iv) zero degree of circular polarization in the biexciton photoluminescence.








Abstract
Halide perovskites (HPs) are fascinating materials whose optoelectronic properties are arguably excitonic. In the HP family, biexcitons are known to exist only in low dimensions where exciton&#8211;exciton binding is strongly enhanced by quantum and dielectric confinements. In this paper, however, it is shown that they indeed do exist in 3D bulk CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3) single crystals if the pristine crystal quality is ensured for subtle binding of two excitons. The existence of biexcitons is clearly evidenced below 30 K with a binding energy of &#8776;3.9 &#177; 0.3 meV according to i) exciton&#8211;biexciton population dynamics, ii) giant resonant two&#8208;photon excitation of biexcitons, iii) inverted Boltzmann&#8208;type spectral feature, and iv) zero degree of circular polarization in the biexciton photoluminescence. Because of the polariton effect, the two&#8208;photon resonance occurs at the excited biexciton state from which longitudinal&#8208;transverse splitting is calculated to be 3.7 meV. The discovery of the 3D biexcitons underscores the very quality of HP crystals for generating various many&#8208;body excitonic phases in MAPbBr3 and its analogues toward the improved understanding of their fundamental properties and highly efficient optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Inhaled mRNA nanoformulation with biogenic ribosomal protein reverses established pulmonary fibrosis in a bleomycin&#8208;induced murine model</title>

Abstract
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a lethal respiratory disease with few treatment options, occurs due to repetitive microinjuries to alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and progresses with an overwhelming deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), ultimately resulting in fibrotic scars and destroyed alveolar architecture. Here, an inhaled ribosomal protein&#8208;based mRNA nanoformulation is reported for clearing the intrapulmonary ECM and re&#8208;epithelializing the disrupted alveolar epithelium, thereby reversing established fibrotic foci in IPF. The nanoformulation is sequentially assembled by a ribosomal protein&#8208;condensed mRNA core, a bifunctional peptide&#8208;modified corona and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) with a PEGylated shielding shell. When inhaled via a nebulizer, the nanoformulations carried by microdrops are deposited in alveoli, and penetrate into fibrotic foci, where the outer KGFs are detached after matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) triggering. The RGD motif&#8208;grafted cores then expose and specifically target the integrin&#8208;elevated cells for the intracellular delivery of mRNA. Notably, repeated inhalation of the nanoformulations accelerates the clearance of locoregional collagen by boosting the intralesional expression of MMP13 and alveolar re&#8208;epithelialization mediated by KGFs, which synergistically ameliorates the lung function of a bleomycin&#8208;induced murine model. Therefore, our work provides an alternative mRNA&#8208;inhaled delivery strategy that shows great potential for the treatment of IPF.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Metaphosphate&#8208;like Terminals Enable High&#8208;Capacity MXene Anodes for Ultrafast Na&#8208;ion Storage</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and/or nitrides, so&#8208;called MXenes, have been noted as ideal fast&#8208;charging cation&#8208;intercalation electrode materials, which nevertheless suffer from limited specific capacities. Herein, we report that constructing redox&#8208;active phosphorus&#8208;oxygen terminals can be an attractive strategy for Nb4C3 MXenes to remarkably boost their specific capacities for ultrafast Na+ storage. As revealed, redox&#8208;active terminals with a stoichiometric formula of PO2&#8208; display a metaphosphate&#8208;like configuration with each P atom sustaining three P&#8208;O bonds and one P = O dangling bond. Compared with conventional O&#8208;terminals, metaphosphate&#8208;like terminals empower Nb4C3 (denoted PO2&#8208;Nb4C3) with considerably enriched carrier density (4&#8208;fold), improved conductivity (12.3&#8208;fold at 300 K), additional redox&#8208;active sites, boosted Nb redox depth, non&#8208;declined Na+ diffusion capability, and buffered internal stress during Na+ intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation. Consequently, compared with O&#8208;terminated Nb4C3, PO2&#8208;Nb4C3 exhibits a doubled Na+&#8208;storage capacity (221.0 mAh g&#8211;1), well&#8208;retained fast&#8208;charging capability (4.9&#160;min at 80% capacity retention), significantly promoted cycle life (non&#8208;degraded capacity over 2000 cycles), and justified feasibility for assembling energy&#8208;power balanced Na&#8208;ion capacitors. This study unveils that the molecular&#8208;level design of MXene terminals provides opportunities for developing simultaneously high&#8208;capacity and fast&#8208;charging electrodes, alleviating the energy&#8208;power tradeoff typical for energy storage devices.

Abstract
Driver's access to information about navigation and vehicle data through in&#8208;car displays and personal devices distract the driver from safe vehicle management. The discrepancy between road safety and infotainment must be addressed to develop safely&#8208;operated modern vehicles. Head&#8208;up Displays (HUDs) aim to introduce a seamless uptake of visual information for the driver while securely operating a vehicle. HUDs projected on the windshield provide the driver with visual navigation and vehicle data within the comfort of the driver's personal eye box through a customizable extended display space. Windshield HUDs does not require the driver to shift the gaze away from the road to attain road information. This article presents a review of technological advances and future perspectives in holographic HUDs by analyzing the optoelectronics devices and the user experience of the driver. The review elucidates holographic displays and full augmented reality (AR) in 3D with depth perception when projecting the visual information on the road within the driver's gaze. Design factors, functionality and the integration of personalized machine learning (ML) technologies into holographic HUDs are discussed. Application examples of the display technologies regarding road safety and security are presented. An outlook is provided to reflect on display trends and autonomous driving.

         <title>Constructing Structurally Ordered High&#8208;entropy Alloy Nanoparticles on Nitrogen&#8208;rich Mesoporous Carbon Nanosheets for High&#8208;performance Oxygen Reduction</title>

Abstract
Recent efforts have observed nanoscaled chemical short&#8208;range order in bulk high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs). Simultaneously inspired with the nanostructuring technology, the HEA nanoparticles (NPs) with complete chemical order might be achieved. Herein, we construct structurally ordered HEA NPs on a novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nitrogen rich mesoporous carbon sandwich framework (OHEA&#8208;mNC) by combining a ligand assisted interfacial assembly with NH3 annealing. Characterization results show that the resultant materials possess an ultrathin 2D nanosheet structure with large mesopores (&#8764;10&#160;nm), where structurally ordered HEA NPs with a L12 phase are homogenously dispersed. The atom&#8208;resolved chemical analyses explicitly determine the location of each atomic site. When being evaluated for the oxygen reduction reaction, the OHEA&#8208;mNC NPs affords a greatly enhanced catalytic performance, including a large half&#8208;wave potential (0.90&#160;eV) and a high durability (0.01&#160;V decay after 10,000 cycles) compared with the disordered HEA and commercial Pt/C catalysts. The excellent performance is attributed to the enhanced mass transfer rate, improved electron conductivity, and presence of stable chemically ordered HEA phase, as revealed by both the experimental results and theoretical calculation. This study suggests a highly feasible process to achieve structurally ordered HEA NPs with advanced mesoporous function in electrochemical field.

         <title>Machine Learning Guided Synthesis of Flash Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flash Joule heating is a process that synthesizes nanomaterials from low&#8208;value materials or waste. However, the parameters that drive this synthesis remain ambiguous. This work applies machine learning (ML) tools to study the crystallization of amorphous carbon into flash graphene by flash Joule heating. ML models show the ability to predict flash graphene crystallinity with an r2 score of 0.8051.








Abstract
Advances in nanoscience have enabled the synthesis of nanomaterials, such as graphene, from low&#8208;value or waste materials through flash Joule heating. Though this capability is promising, the complex and entangled variables that govern nanocrystal formation in the Joule heating process remain poorly understood. In this work, machine learning (ML) models are constructed to explore the factors that drive the transformation of amorphous carbon into graphene nanocrystals during flash Joule heating. An XGBoost regression model of crystallinity achieves an r2 score of 0.8051 &#177; 0.054. Feature importance assays and decision trees extracted from these models reveal key considerations in the selection of starting materials and the role of stochastic current fluctuations in flash Joule heating synthesis. Furthermore, partial dependence analyses demonstrate the importance of charge and current density as predictors of crystallinity, implying a progression from reaction&#8208;limited to diffusion&#8208;limited kinetics as flash Joule heating parameters change. Finally, a practical application of the ML models is shown by using Bayesian meta&#8208;learning algorithms to automatically improve bulk crystallinity over many Joule heating reactions. These results illustrate the power of ML as a tool to analyze complex nanomanufacturing processes and enable the synthesis of 2D crystals with desirable properties by flash Joule heating.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Electrical Conductivity in Filler&#8208;Free Polymeric Hydrogels Toward Thermoelectrics and Electromagnetic Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEDOT:PSS hydrogels exhibit high conductivities up to &#8776;305 S cm&#8722;1, which is &#8776;8 times higher than the record of polymeric hydrogels without conductive fillers. The high electrical conductivity results in enhanced areal thermoelectric output power for hydrogel&#8208;based thermoelectric devices, and high specific electromagnetic interference shielding efficiency (an order in magnitude higher than that of reported of state&#8208;of&#8208;the art conductive hydrogels).








Abstract
Conducting hydrogels have attracted much attention for the emerging field of hydrogel bioelectronics, especially poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) based hydrogels, because of their great biocompatibility and stability. However, the electrical conductivities of hydrogels are often lower than 1 S cm&#8722;1 which are not suitable for digital circuits or applications in bioelectronics. Introducing conductive inorganic fillers into the hydrogels can improve their electrical conductivities. However, it may lead to compromises in compliance, biocompatibility, deformability, biodegradability, etc. Herein, a series of highly conductive ionic liquid (IL) doped PEDOT:PSS hydrogels without any conductive fillers is reported. These hydrogels exhibit high conductivities up to &#8776;305 S cm&#8722;1, which is &#8776;8 times higher than the record of polymeric hydrogels without conductive fillers in literature. The high electrical conductivity results in enhanced areal thermoelectric output power for hydrogel&#8208;based thermoelectric devices, and high specific electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding efficiency which is about an order in magnitude higher than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art conductive hydrogels in literature. Furthermore, these stretchable (strain &gt;30%)&#160;hydrogels exhibit fast self&#8208;healing, and shape/size&#8208;tunable properties, which are desirable for hydrogel bioelectronics and wearable organic devices. The results indicate that these highly conductive hydrogels are promising in applications such as sensing, thermoelectrics, EMI shielding, etc.

         <title>Immuno&#8208;Engineered Nanodecoys for the Multi&#8208;Target Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Treatment of Autoimmune Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immuno&#8208;engineered nanodecoys (NDs) based on programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1)&#8208;expressing macrophage membrane (PRM) are developed for the multi&#8208;target management of autoimmune diseases. PRM NDs scavenge multiple pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines and meanwhile reconstruct the programmed death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)/PD&#8208;L1 inhibitory axis to inhibit CD4+ T cell activation and restore immune tolerance, which cooperatively reverses the immune&#8208;activation and interrupt the self&#8208;amplified inflammatory cascades.








Abstract
Overactivated T cells and overproduced pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines form a self&#8208;amplified signaling loop to continuously exacerbate the dysregulated inflammatory response and propel the progression of autoimmune diseases (AIDs). Herein, immuno&#8208;engineered nanodecoys (NDs) based on poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) nanoparticles coated with programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1)&#8208;expressing macrophage membrane (PRM) are developed to mediate multi&#8208;target interruption of the self&#8208;promoted inflammatory cascade in AIDs. The PRM collected from IFN&#8208;&#947;&#8208;treated RAW 264.7 cells possesses elevated surface levels of adhesion molecule receptors and pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine receptors, and, thus, systemically administered PRM NDs afford higher accumulation level in inflamed tissues and stronger scavenging efficiency toward multiple pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines. More importantly, IFN&#8208;&#947; treatment induces remarkable PD&#8208;L1 expression on PRM, thereby allowing PRM NDs to bind membrane&#8208;bound programmed death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1) on CD4+ T cell surfaces or neutralize free soluble PD&#8208;1, which reconstructs the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 inhibitory axis to suppress CD4+ T cell activation and restore immune tolerance. As such, PRM NDs provoke potent and cooperative anti&#8208;inflammatory and immune&#8208;suppressive efficacies to alleviate autoimmune damages in Zymosan A&#8208;induced arthritis mice and dextran sulfate sodium&#8208;induced ulcerative colitis mice. This study provides an enlightened example for the immuno&#8208;engineering of cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;based NDs, rendering promising implications into the treatment of AIDs via multi&#8208;target immune&#8208;modulation.

         <title>Spiral Growth of Adlayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growth of adlayer graphene spirals and onions with novel spiral arms by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is confirmed. These CVD&#8208;prepared graphene spirals and onions exhibit more than one arm (with two, three, four, and five arms) together with clockwise and anticlockwise direction of rotation of each arm, which can be reproduced by using the kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.








Abstract
The morphology of as&#8208;grown graphene in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) experiments is sensitive to the reaction environment. Understanding the mechanism of formation of different graphene morphologies is essential to achieve controlled graphene CVD growth. Here the growth and formation mechanism of adlayer graphene spirals are reported. An adlayer graphene spiral is formed by fast propagation of the tips of spiral arms along the edge of the first graphene layer. The driving force to form spirals is the limited availability of carbon diffusing from the Cu surface through the edge of the first graphene layer. In addition, it is found that graphene onions are formed by overlapping graphene spirals with clockwise and anticlockwise arms. Based on these features, a kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) method is demonstrated using which all the observed graphene spiral structures are successfully reproduced at the atomic level.

     alt="Spiral Growth of Adlayer Graphene"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth of adlayer graphene spirals and onions with novel spiral arms by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is confirmed. These CVD-prepared graphene spirals and onions exhibit more than one arm (with two, three, four, and five arms) together with clockwise and anticlockwise direction of rotation of each arm, which can be reproduced by using the kinetic Monte Carlo simulations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morphology of as-grown graphene in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) experiments is sensitive to the reaction environment. Understanding the mechanism of formation of different graphene morphologies is essential to achieve controlled graphene CVD growth. Here the growth and formation mechanism of adlayer graphene spirals are reported. An adlayer graphene spiral is formed by fast propagation of the tips of spiral arms along the edge of the first graphene layer. The driving force to form spirals is the limited availability of carbon diffusing from the Cu surface through the edge of the first graphene layer. In addition, it is found that graphene onions are formed by overlapping graphene spirals with clockwise and anticlockwise arms. Based on these features, a kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) method is demonstrated using which all the observed graphene spiral structures are successfully reproduced at the atomic level. This study thus unravels the hither-to unresolved mechanism of graphene onion growth and paves the way to the controllable growth of few-layer graphene by increasing the carbon supply at the edge of the first layer graphene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Patterned surfaces can enhance the sensitivity of laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry by segregating and concentrating analytes, but their fabrication can be challenging. A simple method to fabricate substrates patterned with micrometer&#8208;scale wells that yield more accurate and sensitive mass spectrometry measurements compared to a flat surface or cylindrical wells is presented. The wells can also concentrate and localize cells and beads for cell&#8208;based assays.

         <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Organic Logic Gates: A Promising Perspective on a Dual&#8208;Gate Antiambipolar Transistor</title>

Abstract
Electrically reconfigurable organic logic circuits are promising candidates for realizing new computation architectures, such as artificial intelligence and neuromorphic devices. In this study, we attained multiple logic gate operations based on a dual&#8208;gate organic antiambipolar transistor (DG&#8208;OAAT). The transistor exhibits a &#923;&#8208;shaped transfer curve, namely, a negative differential transconductance at room temperature. It is important to note that the peak voltage of the drain current is precisely tuned by three input signals: bottom&#8208;gate, top&#8208;gate, and drain voltages. This distinctive feature enables multiple logic gate operations with &#8220;only a single DG&#8208;OAAT,&#8221; which are not obtainable in conventional transistors. Five logic gate operations, which correspond to AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and XOR, are demonstrated by adjusting the bottom&#8208;gate and top&#8208;gate voltages. Moreover, varying the drain voltage makes it possible to reversibly switch two logic gates, e.g., NAND/NOR and OR/XOR. In addition, the DG&#8208;OAATs show a high degree of stability and reliability. The logic gate operations were observed even months later. The hysteresis in the transfer curves was also negligible. Thus, our device concept is promising for realizing multifunctional logic circuits with a simple transistor configuration. Hence, these findings are expected to surpass the current limitations in complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor devices.

In this study, we attained multiple logic gate operations based on a dual-gate organic antiambipolar transistor (DG-OAAT). The transistor exhibits a &#923;-shaped transfer curve, namely, a negative differential transconductance at room temperature. It is important to note that the peak voltage of the drain current is precisely tuned by three input signals: bottom-gate, top-gate, and drain voltages.

         <title>Nonlocality&#8208;Enabled Pulse Management in Epsilon&#8208;Near&#8208;Zero Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlocal epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero metamaterials are demonstrated to shape ultrashort optical pulses in sub&#8208;wavelength thick devices. The metamaterial operates over a wide bandwidth of tens of THz, and the switching between sub to superluminal and further to &#8216;backward&#8217; pulse propagation is realized by controlling the angle of illumination.








Abstract
Ultrashort optical pulses are integral to probing various physical, chemical, and biological phenomena and feature in a whole host of applications, not least in data communications. Super&#8208; and subluminal pulse propagation and dispersion management (DM) are two of the greatest challenges in producing or counteracting modifications of ultrashort optical pulses when precise control over pulse characteristics is required. Progress in modern photonics toward integrated solutions and applications has intensified this need for greater control of ultrafast pulses in nanoscale dimensions. Metamaterials, with their unique ability to provide designed optical properties, offer a new avenue for temporal pulse engineering. Here an epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero metamaterial is employed, exhibiting strong nonlocal (spatial dispersion) effects, to temporally shape optical pulses. The authors experimentally demonstrate, over a wide bandwidth of tens of THz, the ability to switch from sub to superluminal and further to &#8220;backward&#8221; pulse propagation (&#177;c/20) in the same metamaterial device by simply controlling the angle of illumination. Both the amplitude and phase of a 10&#160;ps pulse can be controlled through DM in this subwavelength device. Shaping ultrashort optical pulses with metamaterials promises to be advantageous in laser physics, optical communications, imaging, and spectroscopy applications using both integrated and free&#8208;standing devices.

         <title>Quadri&#8208;Dimensional Manipulable Laser with Intrinsic Chiral Photoswitch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dynamic and multi&#8208;dimensional manipulation of laser emission with light allows for optical coding, computing, and imaging photonic chips. However, the coupling balance between photonic resonance and transmission is a formidable challenge due to the uncontrollable chiral microcavity with photo&#8208;reversibility, which is limited to the multi&#8208;freedom of laser with sustainable and repeatable output beams. Herein, we develop a helical superstructure system with a unique intrinsic chiral photoswitch for resolving the always pendent problems on organized defects in microcavity. The unique intrinsic chirality based on photoswitchable system allows a laser emission with sharp and narrow band&#8208;width with both remarkable thermodynamic stability and robust fatigue&#8208;resistance. Quadri&#8208;dimensional manipulable laser, featuring wavelength&#8208;tunability, wavefront&#8208;shaping, spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM), is successfully established with assistance of the photoresponsive intrinsic chiral superstructure with photoreversibility. This technology marks an important milestone, and sketches a future framework for the realms of nanophotonic information encoding, security imprinting, and integrated photonics.

         <title>Mechanically Guided Hierarchical Assembly of 3D Mesostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of multiple layers of independently prestretched elastomeric substrates in mechanically guided 3D assembly provides access to complex hierarchical 3D architectures that were&#160;previously inaccessible, including vertically aligned helices and fully closed 3D cages. These hierarchical assembly concepts create possibilities for a broad range of fields from microrobotics and reconfigurable metamaterials to bio&#8208;integrated electronics.








Abstract
3D, hierarchical micro/nanostructures formed with advanced functional materials are of growing interest due to their broad potential utility in electronics, robotics, battery technology, and biomedical engineering. Among various strategies in 3D micro/nanofabrication, a set of methods based on compressive buckling offers wide&#8208;ranging material compatibility, fabrication scalability, and precise process control. Previously reports on this type of approach rely on a single, planar prestretched elastomeric platform to transform thin&#8208;film precursors with 2D layouts into 3D architectures. The simple planar configuration of bonding sites between these precursors and their assembly substrates prevents the realization of certain types of complex 3D geometries. In this paper, a set of hierarchical assembly concepts is reported that leverage multiple layers of prestretched elastomeric substrates to induce not only compressive buckling of 2D precursors bonded to them but also of themselves, thereby creating 3D mesostructures mounted at multiple levels of 3D frameworks with complex, elaborate configurations. Control over strains used in these processes provides reversible access to multiple different 3D layouts in a given structure. Examples to demonstrate these ideas through both experimental and computational results span vertically aligned helices to closed 3D cages, selected for their relevance to 3D conformal bio&#8208;interfaces and multifunctional microsystems.

         <title>Fast Self&#8208;Assembly of Scalable Photonic Cellulose Nanocrystals and Hybrid Films via Electrophoresis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast and scalable electrophoretic&#8208;deposition&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly technique of photonic cellulose nanocrystal films, that can circumvent the long process evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (EISA), is developed. Iridescent films with tunable color can be achieved in a few minutes by simple adjustment of the suspension properties. Co&#8208;assembly with plasmonic metal nanoparticles can be performed in one step with no addition of reducing agent.








Abstract
Nano&#8208;enabled, bio&#8208;based, functional materials are key for the transition to a sustainable society as they can be used, owing to both their performance and nontoxicity, to gradually replace existing nonrenewable engineering materials. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), produced by acid hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass, have been shown to possess distinct self&#8208;assembly, optical, and electromechanical properties, and are anticipated to play an important role in the fabrication of photonic, optoelectronic, and functional hybrid materials. To facilitate CNCs&#8217; technological viability, a method suitable for industrial exploitation is developed to produce photonic films possessing long&#8208;range chirality on conductive, rigid, or flexible, substrates within a few minutes. The approach is based on electrophoretic deposition (EPD)&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of CNCs, where photonic films of any size can be produced by controlling CNC surface properties and EPD parameters. CNC film coloration can be determined by the CNC aqueous suspension characteristics, while their reflected intensity can be tuned by changing the duration and number of electrodeposition cycles. EPD&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of CNCs is compatible with in situ reduction of gold precursors without the need to use additional reducing agents (some of which are considered toxic), thereby allowing the preparation of hybrid photonic films with tunable plasmonic response in a one&#8208;pot process.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Synthesis of Ultrathin, Flexible, and Transparent Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Thin Films via a Microfluidic&#8208;Based Solution Shearing Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microfluidic&#8208;assisted solution shearing combined with post&#8208;synthetic rapid crystallization (MASS&#8208;PRC) process is introduced, which enables the formation of high&#8208;quality conductive Ni3(HITP)2 thin&#8208;films with thickness controllability down to 10 nm in a rapid large&#8208;area scalable manner. This process can fabricate flexible and transparent Ni3(HITP)2 thin film for high&#8208;performance wearable gas sensors.








Abstract
Iminosemiquinone&#8208;linker&#8208;based conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) have attracted much attention as next&#8208;generation electronic materials due to their high electrical conductivity combined with high porosity. However, the utility of such c&#8208;MOFs in high&#8208;performance devices has been limited to date by the lack of high&#8208;quality MOF thin&#8208;film processing. Herein, a technique known as the microfluidic&#8208;assisted solution shearing combined with post&#8208;synthetic rapid crystallization (MASS&#8208;PRC) process is introduced to generate a high&#8208;quality, flexible, and transparent thin&#8208;film of Ni3(hexaiminotriphenylene)2 (Ni3(HITP)2) uniformly over a large&#8208;area in a high&#8208;throughput manner with thickness controllability down to tens of nanometers. The MASS&#8208;PRC process utilizes: 1) a micromixer&#8208;embedded blade to simultaneously mix and continuously supply the metal&#8211;ligand solution toward the drying front during solution shearing to generate an amorphous thin&#8208;film, followed by: 2) immersion in amine solution for rapid directional crystal growth. The as&#8208;synthesized c&#8208;MOF film has transparency of up to 88.8% and conductivity as high as 37.1 S cm&#8722;1. The high uniformity in conductivity is confirmed over a 3500 mm2 area with an arithmetic mean roughness (Ra) of 4.78&#160;nm. The flexible thin&#8208;film demonstrates the highest level of transparency for Ni3(HITP)2 and the highest hydrogen sulfide (H2S) sensing performance (2,085% at 5&#160;ppm) among c&#8208;MOFs&#8208;based H2S sensors, enabling wearable gas&#8208;sensing applications.

         <title>Retina&#8208;Inspired Color&#8208;Cognitive Learning via Chromatically Controllable Mixed Quantum Dot Synaptic Transistor Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial visual perception system that enables full&#8208;range visible color recognition by employing heterojunction photosynaptic transistors consisting of precisely designed size&#8208;mixed quantum dot photoabsorbers and amorphous In&#8211;Ga&#8211;Zn&#8211;O semiconducting channels is proposed. Moreover, this artificial photonic synapse shows chromatically controllable synaptic plasticity by gate field modulation, inducing multiple selective nonvolatile detection modes.








Abstract
Artificial photonic synapses are emerging as a promising implementation to emulate the human visual cognitive system by consolidating a series of processes for sensing and memorizing visual information into one system. In particular, mimicking retinal functions such as multispectral color perception and controllable nonvolatility is important for realizing artificial visual systems. However, many studies to date have focused on monochromatic&#8208;light&#8208;based photonic synapses, and thus, the emulation of color discrimination capability remains an important challenge for visual intelligence. Here, an artificial multispectral color recognition system by employing heterojunction photosynaptic transistors consisting of ratio&#8208;controllable mixed quantum dot (M&#8208;QD) photoabsorbers and metal&#8208;oxide semiconducting channels is proposed. The biological photoreceptor inspires M&#8208;QD photoabsorbers with a precisely designed red (R), green (G), and blue (B)&#8208;QD ratio, enabling full&#8208;range visible color recognition with high photo&#8208;to&#8208;electric conversion efficiency. In addition, adjustable synaptic plasticity by modulating gate bias allows multiple nonvolatile&#8208;to&#8208;volatile memory conversion, leading to chromatic control in the artificial photonic synapse. To ensure the viability of the developed proof of concept, a 7 &#215; 7 pixelated photonic synapse array capable of performing outstanding color image recognition based on adjustable wavelength&#8208;dependent volatility conversion is demonstrated.

         <title>Prussian blue nanozyme as a pyroptosis inhibitor alleviates neurodegeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Current pharmacological interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD) remain unsatisfactory in clinical settings. Inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis represents a potential therapeutic target for the alleviation of neurodegenerative diseases. The development of inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis agonists or antagonists may transform the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the identification of specific compounds that inhibit pyroptosis remains challenging. Herein, Prussian blue nanozyme (PBzyme) is revealed as a pyroptosis inhibitor to alleviate the neurodegeneration in a mouse model of PD. PBzyme inhibits the 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1, 2, 3, 6&#8208;tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)/ATP&#8208;induced activation of microglial NLRP3 inflammasomes, attenuates the damage of mitochondrial membrane potential, and rescues dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular injection of PBzyme reduces dopaminergic degeneration, and inhibits neuroinflammation, alleviates the motor deficits in the MPTP&#8208;induced PD mouse model. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that PBzyme reduces the activation of microglial NLRP3 inflammasomes and caspase&#8208;1 by scavenging reactive oxygen species, thereby downregulating GSDMD cleavage as well as inflammatory factor production, and eventually leading to the inhibition of microglia pyroptosis. Overall, our work highlights the neuroprotective effects of PBzyme as a pyroptosis inhibitor and provides valuable mechanistic insights and a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PD.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current pharmacological interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD) remain unsatisfactory in clinical settings. Inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis represents a potential therapeutic target for the alleviation of neurodegenerative diseases. The development of inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis agonists or antagonists may transform the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the identification of specific compounds that inhibit pyroptosis remains challenging. Herein, Prussian blue nanozyme (PBzyme) is revealed as a pyroptosis inhibitor to alleviate the neurodegeneration in a mouse model of PD. PBzyme inhibits the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)/ATP-induced activation of microglial NLRP3 inflammasomes, attenuates the damage of mitochondrial membrane potential, and rescues dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular injection of PBzyme reduces dopaminergic degeneration, and inhibits neuroinflammation, alleviates the motor deficits in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model. Both in vitro &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; in vivo results demonstrate that PBzyme reduces the activation of microglial NLRP3 inflammasomes and caspase-1 by scavenging reactive oxygen species, thereby downregulating GSDMD cleavage as well as inflammatory factor production, and eventually leading to the inhibition of microglia pyroptosis. Overall, our work highlights the neuroprotective effects of PBzyme as a pyroptosis inhibitor and provides valuable mechanistic insights and a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PD.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Antibody&#8208;based cancer therapy, one of the most significant therapeutic strategies, has achieved considerable success and progress over the past decades. Nevertheless, obstacles including limited tumor penetration, short circulation half&#8208;lives, undesired immunogencity, and off&#8208;target side effects remain to be overcome for the antibody&#8208;based cancer treatment. Owing to the rapid development of nanotechnology, antibody&#8208;containing nanomedicines that have been extensively explored to overcome these obstacles have already demonstrated to have enhanced anticancer efficacy and clinical translation potential. This review intends to offer an overview of the advancements of antibody&#8208;incorporated nanoparticulate systems in cancer treatment, together with the nontrivial challenges faced by these next&#8208;generation nanomedicines. Diverse strategies of antibody immobilization, formats of antibodies, types of cancer&#8208;associated antigens, and anticancer mechanisms of antibody&#8208;containing nanomedicines are provided and discussed in this review, with an emphasis on the latest applications. The current limitations and future research directions on antibody&#8208;containing nanomedicines are also discussed from different perspectives to provide new insights into the construction of anticancer nanomedicines.

         <title>Distinct Crystal&#8208;Facet&#8208;Dependent Behaviors for Single&#8208;Atom Palladium&#8208;on&#8208;Ceria Catalysts: Enhanced Stabilization and Catalytic Properties</title>

Abstract
High&#8208;performance, fully atomically dispersed single&#8208;atom catalysts are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation industrial catalysts. However, it remains as a great challenge to avoid the aggregation of isolated atoms into nanoparticles during the preparation and application of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Here, we investigate the evolution of Pd species on different crystal facets of CeO2, and surprisingly discovered vastly different behaviors on the single&#8208;atomic dispersion of surface Pd atoms. The in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in situ near&#8208;ambient&#8208;pressure&#8208;XPS (NAP&#8208;XPS), in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveal that in reducing atmosphere more oxygen vacancies are generated on the (100) facet of CeO2, and Pd atoms can be trapped and thus feature atomic dispersion; by contrast, on CeO2 (111) facet, Pd atoms would readily aggregate into clusters (Pdn). Furthermore, the Pd1/CeO2(100) gave a high selectivity of 90.3% for catalytic N&#8208;alkylation reaction, which is 2.8 times higher than that for Pdn/CeO2(111). These direct evidences demonstrate the crucial role of crystal facet effects in the preparation of metal&#8208;atom&#8208;on&#8208;metal&#8208;oxide SACs. This work thus opens an avenue for the rational design and targeted synthesis of ultra&#8208;stable and sinter&#8208;resistant SACs.

         <title>A High&#8208;Efficiency Mo2C Electrocatalyst Promoting the Polysulfide Redox Kinetics for Na&#8208;S Batteries</title>

Abstract
Room temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries, as the promising next&#8208;generation energy storage candidates, are drawing more and more attention due to the high energy density and abundant elements reserved in the earth. However, the native downsides of RT Na&#8208;S batteries (i.e., enormous volume changes, the polysulfides shuttle, and the insulation and low reactivity of S) impede their further application. To conquer these challenges, the hierarchical porous hollow carbon polyhedrons embedded with uniform Mo2C nanoparticles are designed deliberately as the host for S. The micro&#8208;and&#160;mesoporous hollow carbon indeed dramatically enhances the reactivity of the S cathodes and&#160;accommodates the volume changes. Meanwhile, the highly conductive dispersed Mo2C has a strong chemical adsorption to polysulfides and catalyzes the transform of polysulfides, which can effectively inhibit the dissolution of polysulfides and accelerate the reaction kinetics.&#160;Thus, the as&#8208;prepared S cathode can display a high reversible capacity (1098 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 after 120 cycles) and superior rate performance (483 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10.0 A g&#8722;1). This work provides a new method to boost the performance of RT Na&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Assembling Diverse Skyrmionic Phases in Fe3GeTe2 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic effective Hamiltonians with spin invariants, which are all the possible interaction forms allowed by symmetry, are built by a new and general developed method. Application of this method to 2D magnet Fe3GeTe2 leads to discovery of diverse skyrmionic phases, with their origins being determined to be multiple fourth order interactions with novel expressions.








Abstract
Skyrmionic magnetic states are promising in advanced spintronics. This topic is experiencing recent progress in 2D magnets, with, for example, a near 300 K Curie temperature observed in Fe3GeTe2. However, despite previous studies reporting skyrmions in Fe3GeTe2, such a system remains elusive, since it has been reported to host either N&#233;el&#8208;type or Bloch&#8208;type textures, while a net Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) cannot occur in this compound for symmetry reasons. It is thus desirable to develop an accurate model to deeply understand Fe3GeTe2. Here, a newly developed method adopting spin invariants is applied to build a first&#8208;principle&#8208;based Hamiltonian, which predicts colorful topological defects assembled from the unit of Bloch lines, and reveals the critical role of specific forms of fourth&#8208;order interactions in Fe3GeTe2. Rather than the DMI, it is the multiple fourth&#8208;order interactions, with symmetry and spin&#8211;orbit couplings considered, that stabilize both N&#233;el&#8208;type and Bloch&#8208;type skyrmions, as well as antiskyrmions, without any preference for clockwise versus counterclockwise spin rotation. This study also demonstrates that spin invariants can be used as a general approach to study complex magnetic interactions.

         <title>Ultrafast Shaped Laser Induced Synthesis of MXene Quantum Dots/Graphene for Transparent Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work offers an in situ, one&#8208;step strategy using temporally and spatially shapedlaser for simultaneous photochemically synthesizing of the transparent MXene quantum dot/laser reduced graphene oxide composite electrodes with ultrahigh transparency and energy storage. A new process for preparing transparent electrode is proposed, which also takes into account both high transparency and performance.








Abstract
Ultratransparent electrodes have attracted considerable attention in optoelectronics and energy technology. However, balancing energy storage capability and transparency remains challenging. Herein, an in situ strategy employing a temporally and spatially shaped femtosecond laser is reported for photochemically synthesizing of MXene quantum dots (MQDs) uniformly attached to laser reduced graphene oxide (LRGO) with exceptional electrochemical capacitance and ultrahigh transparency.

&lt;p&gt;This work offers an in situ, one-step strategy using temporally and spatially shapedlaser for simultaneous photochemically synthesizing of the transparent MXene quantum dot/laser reduced graphene oxide composite electrodes with ultrahigh transparency and energy storage. A new process for preparing transparent electrode is proposed, which also takes into account both high transparency and performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultratransparent electrodes have attracted considerable attention in optoelectronics and energy technology. However, balancing energy storage capability and transparency remains challenging. Herein, an in situ strategy employing a temporally and spatially shaped femtosecond laser is reported for photochemically synthesizing of MXene quantum dots (MQDs) uniformly attached to laser reduced graphene oxide (LRGO) with exceptional electrochemical capacitance and ultrahigh transparency. The mechanism and plasma dynamics of the synthesis process are analyzed and observed at the same time. The unique MQDs loaded on LRGO greatly improve the specific surface area of the electrode due to the nanoscale size and additional edge states. The MQD/LRGO supercapacitor has high flexibility and durability, ultrahigh energy density (2.04 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;mWh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), long cycle life (97.6% after 12&#160;000 cycles), and excellent capacitance (10.42&#160;mF cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) with both high transparency (transmittance over 90%) and high performance. Furthermore, this method provides a means of preparing nanostructured composite electrode materials and exploiting quantum capacitance effects for energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Targeted Lipid Nanotherapeutic Boost for Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phase III clinical trials of chemo&#8208;immunotherapy suggest nanotherapeutics as a boosting agent. Here, dual&#8208;targeted lipid nanotherapeutic boost (T&#8208;iLNTB) is developed for chemo&#8208;immunotherapy of cancer. T&#8208;iLNTB boosts chemotherapeutic effect in cancer cells, increases an immunogenic cell death and reprograms tumor myeloid cells, consequently, recruits T cells and boosts responsiveness to immunotherapeutics. T&#8208;iLNTB can become a novel therapeutic modality in cancer.








Abstract
Chemo&#8208;immunotherapy is a combination of &#8220;standard&#8208;of&#8208;care&#8221; chemotherapy with immunotherapy and it is considered the most advanced therapeutic modality for various types of cancers. However, many cancer patients still poorly respond to current regimen of chemo&#8208;immunotherapy and suggest nanotherapeutics as a boosting agent. Recently, heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO1) is shown to act as an immunotherapeutic molecule in tumor myeloid cells, in addition to general chemoresistance function in cancer cells suggesting that HO1&#8208;targeted therapeutics can become a novel, optimal strategy for boosting chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in the clinic. Currently the available HO1&#8208;inhibitors demonstrate serious adverse effects in clinical use. Herein, tumor myeloid cell&#8208; and cancer cell&#8208;dual targeted HO1&#8208;inhibiting lipid nanotherapeutic boost (T&#8208;iLNTB) is developed using RNAi&#8208;loaded lipid nanoparticles. T&#8208;iLNTB&#8208;mediated HO1&#8208;inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to &#8220;standard&#8208;of&#8208;care&#8221; chemotherapeutics by increasing immunogenic cell death, and directly reprograms tumor myeloid cells with distinguished phenotype. Furthermore, tumor myeloid cell reprogramming by T&#8208;iLNTB induces CD8+ cytotoxic T cell recruitment, which drives &#8220;Cold&#8208;to&#8208;Hot&#8221; transition and correlates with improved responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitor in combination therapy. Finally, ex vivo study proves that HO1&#8208;inhibition directly affects tumor macrophage differentiation. This study demonstrates the potential of T&#8208;iLNTB as a novel therapeutic modality for boosting chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Super Water&#8208;Extracting Gels for Solar&#8208;Powered Volatile Organic Compounds Management in the Hydrological Cycle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Super water&#8208;extracting gels (SWEGs) based on hypercrosslinked hydrophilic polymeric networks are developed for pure vapor generation powered by sunlight. SWEGs reject volatile solutes in water and their dynamic hydrogen bonding networks allow water transport for evaporation. SWEGs achieve a VOCs removal ratio up to 99.99% by solar distillation under 1 sun.








Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are widely spread in the natural hydrological cycle, contaminating potential water sources, and leading to unexpected ecological hazards. However, water&#8208;purification technologies toward VOCs are energy&#8208;intensive and present unsatisfactory purity of the obtained water. The fundamental challenge is to differentiate the motion of water and VOC molecules by separators. Here, the concept of a super water&#8208;extracting gel (SWEG) for VOC&#8208;management and water purification via direct solar distillation is proposed. The strong hydrogen bonding effect in the hypercrosslinked hydrophilic polymeric networks enables the SWEG to extract water from VOC&#8208;containing water, which rejects the VOC solutes while allowing water through for interfacial evaporation. The obtained SWEG achieves a VOCs removal ratio up to 99.99% by solar distillation under 1 sun. A solar water&#8208;purification system is also demonstrated to produce clean water, which surpasses other competitive technologies based on electricity.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoelectric conversion has been extensively studied in low&#8208;dimensional materials where quantum confinement and spin textures can largely modulate thermopower generation. In this review, the thermoelectric microscopy&#8208;based quantum sensing of thermopower from classical, spin&#8208;polarized electron transport, collective spin dynamics, and relativistic effect is summarized. Investigating the microscopic nature of thermopower in quantum materials provide insights for the future thermoelectric applications.








Abstract
Thermoelectric power, has been extensively studied in low&#8208;dimensional materials where quantum confinement and spin textures can largely modulate thermopower generation. In addition to classical and macroscopic values, thermopower also varies locally over a wide range of length scales, and is fundamentally linked to electron wave functions and phonon propagation. Various experimental methods for the quantum sensing of localized thermopower have been suggested, particularly based on scanning probe microscopy. Here, critical advances in the quantum sensing of thermopower are introduced, from the atomic to the several&#8208;hundred&#8208;nanometer scales, including the unique role of low&#8208;dimensionality, defects, spins, and relativistic effects for optimized power generation. Investigating the microscopic nature of thermopower in quantum materials can provide insights useful for the design of advanced materials for future thermoelectric applications. Quantum sensing techniques for thermopower can pave the way to practical and novel energy devices for a sustainable society.

         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in strain&#8208;tunable quantum phenomena and functionalities, focusing on low&#8208;dimensional quantum materials. Experimental strategies for strain engineering are discussed in terms of heterogeneity and elastic reconfigurability of strain distribution. The nontrivial quantum properties of several strain&#8208;quantum coupled platforms, including 2D van der Waals materials and heterostructures, topological insulators, superconducting oxides, and metal halide perovskites, are outlined.








Abstract
Recent discoveries of exotic physical phenomena, such as unconventional superconductivity in magic&#8208;angle twisted bilayer graphene, dissipationless Dirac fermions in topological insulators, and quantum spin liquids, have triggered tremendous interest in quantum materials. The macroscopic revelation of quantum mechanical effects in quantum materials is associated with strong electron&#8211;electron correlations in the lattice, particularly where materials have reduced dimensionality. Owing to the strong correlations and confined geometry, altering atomic spacing and crystal symmetry via strain has emerged as an effective and versatile pathway for perturbing the subtle equilibrium of quantum states. This review highlights recent advances in strain&#8208;tunable quantum phenomena and functionalities, with particular focus on low&#8208;dimensional quantum materials. Experimental strategies for strain engineering are first discussed in terms of heterogeneity and elastic reconfigurability of strain distribution. The nontrivial quantum properties of several strain&#8208;quantum coupled platforms, including 2D van der Waals materials and heterostructures, topological insulators, superconducting oxides, and metal halide perovskites, are next outlined, with current challenges and future opportunities in quantum straintronics followed. Overall, strain engineering of quantum phenomena and functionalities is a rich field for fundamental research of many&#8208;body interactions and holds substantial promise for next&#8208;generation electronics capable of ultrafast, dissipationless, and secure information processing and communications.

         <title>Commensurate Stacking Phase Transitions in an Intercalated Transition Metal Dichalcogenide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>

Two&#8208;step first&#8208;order structural phase transitions at around 230 K in Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2 are solely associated with the stacking degree of freedom, evolving from a high&#8208;temperature phase with ABC stacking and R3m symmetry to an intermediate phase with AB stacking and P3m1, and finally to a low temperature phase again with R3m symmetry, but with ACB stacking. Each step involves a rigid slide of building blocks by a vector [1/3, 2/3, 0].








Abstract
Intercalation and stacking&#8208;order modulation are two active ways in manipulating the interlayer interaction of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), which lead to a variety of emergent phases and allow for engineering material properties. Herein, the growth of Pb&#8208;intercalated TMDCs&#8211;Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2, the first 124&#8208;phase, is reported. Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2 exhibits a unique two&#8208;step first&#8208;order structural phase transition at around 230 K. The transitions are solely associated with the stacking degree of freedom, evolving from a high&#8208;temperature (high&#8208;T) phase with ABC stacking and R3m symmetry to an intermediate phase with AB stacking and P3m1, and finally to a low&#8208;temperature (low&#8208;T) phase again with R3msymmetry, but with ACB stacking. Each step involves a rigid slide of building blocks by a vector [1/3, 2/3, 0]. Intriguingly, gigantic lattice contractions occur at the transitions on warming. At low&#8208;T, bulk superconductivity with Tc&#160;&#8776; 1.8 K is observed. The underlying physics of the structural phase transitions are discussed from first&#8208;principle calculations. The symmetry analysis reveals topological nodal lines in the band structure. The results demonstrate the possibility of realizing higher&#8208;order metal&#8208;intercalated phases of TMDCs and advance the knowledge of polymorphic transitions, and may inspire stacking&#8208;order engineering in TMDCs and&#160;beyond.

         <title>Optimizing Atomic Hydrogen Desorption of Sulfur&#8208;Rich NiS1+x Cocatalyst for Boosting Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient coupling strategy of active&#8208;site&#8208;enriched regulation and electronic structure modification of active S sites is developed to simultaneously increase the active S number and weaken the strong S&#63743;Hads bonds. The designed core&#8211;shell Au@NiS1+x cocatalyst with electron&#8208;enriched S&#948;&#8722; active centers can realize the facile adsorption and desorption of atomic hydrogen, thus achieving signally boosted photocatalytic H2&#8208;evolution activity on TiO2.








Abstract
Low&#8208;cost transition&#8208;metal chalcogenides (MSx) are demonstrated to be potential candidate cocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 generation. However, their H2&#8208;generation performance is limited by insufficient quantities of exposed sulfur (S) sites and their strong bonding with adsorbed hydrogen atoms (S&#63743;Hads). To address these issues, an efficient coupling strategy of active&#8208;site&#8208;enriched regulation and electronic structure modification of active S sites is developed by rational design of core&#8211;shell Au@NiS1+x nanostructured cocatalyst. In this case, the Au@NiS1+x cocatalyst can be skillfully fabricated to synthesize the Au@NiS1+x modified TiO2 (denoted as TiO2/Au@NiS1+x) by a two&#8208;step route. Photocatalytic experiments exhibit that the resulting TiO2/Au@NiS1+x(1.7:1.3) displays a boosted H2&#8208;generation rate of 9616&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum efficiency of 46.0%&#160; at 365&#160;nm, which is 2.9 and 1.7 times the rate over TiO2/NiS1+x and TiO2/Au, respectively. In situ/ex situ XPS characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that the free&#8208;electrons of Au can transfer to sulfur&#8208;enriched NiS1+x to induce the generation of electron&#8208;enriched S&#948;&#8722; active centers, which boosts the desorption of Hads for rapid hydrogen formation via weakening the strong S&#63743;Hads bonds. Hence, an electron&#8208;enriched S&#948;&#8722;&#8208;mediated mechanism is proposed. This work delivers a universal strategy for simultaneously increasing the active site number and optimizing the binding strength between the active sites and hydrogen adsorbates.

         <title>A General Strategy to Immobilize Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>

Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are immobilized in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by a general strategy with SnO2 as a mediator onto metal&#8211;oxo clusters via a two&#8208;step microwave&#8208;assisted modification approach. Remarkably, the H2 production efficiency of Pt1/SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 under visible light surpasses that of Cu1/SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 and Ni1/SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, surpassing that of their corresponding metal nanoparticles (NPs) by far.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are witnessing rapid development due to their high activity and selectivity toward diverse reactions. However, it remains a grand challenge in the general synthesis of SACs, particularly featuring an identical chemical microenvironment and on the same support. Herein, a universal synthetic protocol is developed to immobilize SACs in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Significantly, by means of SnO2 as a mediator or adaptor, not only different single&#8208;atom metal sites, such as Pt, Cu, and Ni, etc., can be installed, but also the MOF supports can be changed (for example, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, PCN&#8208;222, and DUT&#8208;67) to afford M1/SnO2/MOF architecture. Taking UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 as a representative, the Pt1/SnO2/MOF exhibits approximately five times higher activity toward photocatalytic H2 production than the corresponding Pt nanoparticles (&#8776;2.5&#160;nm) stabilized by SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Remarkably, despite featuring identical parameters in the chemical microenvironment and support in M1/SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, the Pt1 catalyst possesses a hydrogen evolution rate of 2167 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1, superior to the Cu1 and Ni1 counterparts, which is attributed to the differentiated hydrogen binding free energies, as supported by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations. This is thought to be the first report on a universal approach toward the stabilization of SACs with identical chemical microenvironment on an identical support.

         <title>Mechanochemistry Advances High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical route to prepare stoichiometric&#8208;pure and air&#8208;stable &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 powders is developed, which can be stored for more than 10 months in ambient environment. Redissolving the &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 powders can generate a high concentration of large&#8208;sized polyiodide colloids, which can serve as nuclei to promote heterogeneous nucleation for perovskite films. As a result, a competitive solar cell efficiency of 24.22% is achieved.








Abstract
A prerequisite for commercializing perovskite photovoltaics is to develop a swift and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis route, which guarantees the mass production of halide perovskites in the industry. Herein, a green&#8208;solvent&#8208;assisted mechanochemical strategy is developed for fast synthesizing a stoichiometric &#948;&#8208;phase formamidinium lead iodide (&#948;&#8208;FAPbI3) powder, which serves as a high&#8208;purity precursor for perovskite film deposition with low defects. The presynthesized &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 precursor possesses high concentration of micrometer&#8208;sized colloids, which are in favor of preferable crystallization by spontaneous nucleation. The resultant perovskite films own preferred crystal orientations of cubic (100) plane, which is beneficial for superior carrier transport compared to that of the films with isotropic crystal orientations using &#8220;mixture of PbI2 and FAI&#8221; as precursors. As a result, high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 24.2% are obtained. Moreover, the &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 powder shows superior storage stability for more than 10 months in ambient environment (40&#160;&#177; 10% relative humidity), being conducive to a facile and practical storage for further commercialization.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Free Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membrane for Precise Ion/Solvent Separation toward Highly Stable Magnesium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase enabled by an intact metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membrane is constructed directly on Mg foils. Through precious solvent molecule/Mg ion sieve owing to the angstrom&#8208;sized aperture window, the MOF membrane suppresses the solvent reduction and enables a low migration barrier for Mg2+ transportation within this MOF&#8208;based solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase.








Abstract
Metallic magnesium batteries are promising candidates beyond lithium&#8208;ion batteries; however, a passive interfacial layer because of the electro&#8208;reduction of solvents on Mg surfaces usually leads to ultrahigh overpotential for the reversible Mg chemistry. Inspired by the excellent separation effect of permselective metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) at angstrom scale, a large&#8208;area and defect&#8208;free MOF membrane directly on Mg surfaces is here constructed. In this process, the electrochemical deprotonation of ligand can be facilitated to afford the self&#8208;correcting of intercrystalline voids until a seamless membrane formed, which can eliminate nonselective intercrystalline diffusion of electrolyte and realize selective Mg2+ transport but precisely separate the solvent molecules from the MOF channels. Compared with the continuous solvent reduction on bare Mg anode, the as&#8208;constructed MOF membrane is demonstrated to significantly stabilize the Mg electrode via suppressing the permeation of solvents, hence contributing to a low&#8208;overpotential plating/stripping in conventional electrolytes. The concept is demonstrated that membrane separation can serve as solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, which would be widely applicable to other energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Intrinsic Wettability in Pristine Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the assistance of environmental scanning electron microscope, the high hydrophilic nature of pristine graphene with an extremely low water contact angle of &#8776;30&#176; is confirmed, using the suspended, superclean graphene membrane to exclude the interference by substrates and contamination. This high hydrophilicity is revealed to originate from the charge transfer between graphene and water molecules through H&#8211;&#960; interaction.








Abstract
The wettability of graphene remains controversial owing to its high sensitivity to the surroundings, which is reflected by the wide range of reported water contact angle (WCA). Specifically, the surface contamination and underlying substrate would strongly alter the intrinsic wettability of graphene. Here, the intrinsic wettability of graphene is investigated by measuring WCA on suspended, superclean graphene membrane using environmental scanning electron microscope. An extremely low WCA with an average value &#8776;30&#176; is observed, confirming the hydrophilic nature of pristine graphene. This high hydrophilicity originates from the charge transfer between graphene and water molecules through H&#8211;&#960; interaction. The work provides a deep understanding of the water&#8211;graphene interaction and opens up a new way for measuring the surface properties of 2D materials.

         <title>Stretchable Soft Composites with Strain&#8208;Induced Architectured Color</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Color&#8208;changing composites are manufactured using magnetically aligned coated platelets dispersed in a stretchable polymer matrix. Stretching of such composites enables color change through the strain&#8208;induced rotation of the embedded reflecting platelets. By harnessing the concept of architectured color, the composites feature unique direction&#8208;selective coloration effects that can be exploited in low&#8208;energy optical displays, robotic actuators, and soft tactile sensors.








Abstract
Colors enable interaction and communication between living species in a myriad of biological and artificial environments. While living organisms feature low&#8208;power mechanisms to dynamically control color in soft tissues, man&#8208;made color&#8208;changing devices remain predominantly rigid and energy intensive. Here, architectured composites that display striking color changes when stretched in selective directions under ambient light with minimum power input are reported. The orientation&#8208;dependent color change results from the rotation of reflective coated platelets that are embedded in a soft polymer matrix and pre&#8208;aligned in a well&#8208;defined architecture. The light reflected by the platelets generates structural color defined by the oxide coating on the platelet surface. By magnetically programming the initial orientation and spatial distribution of selected platelets within the soft matrix, composites with strain&#8208;modulated color&#8208;changing effects that cannot be achieved using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies are created. The proposed concept of strain&#8208;induced architectured color can be harnessed to develop low&#8208;power smart stretchable displays, tactile synthetic skins, and autonomous soft robotic devices that undergo fast and reversible color changes through the mechano&#8208;optic coupling programmed within their soft composite architecture.

         <title>Paper without a Trail: Time&#8208;Dependent Encryption using Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Host&#8211;Guest Invisible Ink</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;erasing ink that can display information on time scales based on the incorporated photochromic spiropyran and host&#8211;guest crosslinkers is reported. Upon the addition of a competitive host or guest, disassembly of the crosslinks occurs. This reduces the extent of merocyanine aggregation and accelerates the decay periods that control the information displayed at various time points.








Abstract
A stimuli&#8208;responsive invisible ink for time&#8208;dependent encryption of information is reported. Consisting of a pillar[5]arene&#8208;based supramolecular network grafted with spiropyran moieties, these materials display time&#8208;dependent photochromic behavior with tailorable fading rates. Ultraviolet (UV) light results in isomerization of the colorless spiropyran to the corresponding colored merocyanine, while visible light or heat causes the reverse isomerization with a rate that is dependent on the density of host&#8211;guest crosslinks. The kinetics of discoloration are a function of merocyanine aggregation, which becomes more pronounced as the host&#8211;guest crosslink density is increased, leading to a reduced conversion rate and slower time&#8208;dependent fading. The degree of crosslinking, and hence the fading rate, may be modulated via the addition of unbound pillar[5]arene host or nitrile guest as competitors. Time&#8208;dependent information encryption is enabled by combining selective placement of host and guest competitors and UV patterning. UV patterning provides an initially &#8220;false&#8221; image that does not reveal the desired information, and it is only after a given time that the encrypted data appears. This work provides a unique approach to enhance the security of information storage associated with offline portable data encryption.

         <title>Resonance&#8208;Mediated Dynamic Modulation of Perovskite Crystallization for Efficient and Stable Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic strategy is proposed to fabricate high&#8208;quality perovskite films through resonance modulation, leading to a Voc of 1.16 V and high power conversion efficiencies approaching 22.0% and 19.5% for small&#8208;area (0.09&#160;cm2) and large&#8208;area (1.02&#160;cm2) inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), respectively. More importantly, the unencapsulated PSCs exhibit excellent long&#8208;term stability under various environmental conditions (moisture, light, and heat).








Abstract
Manipulating perovskite crystallization to prepare high&#8208;quality perovskite films is the key to achieving highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a dynamic strategy is proposed to modulate perovskite crystallization using a resonance hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM) capable of fast self&#8208;adaptive tautomerization between multiple electronic states with neutral and charged resonance forms for mediating perovskite crystal growth and defect passivation in situ. This approach, based on resonance variation with self&#8208;adaptive molecular interactions between the HTM and the perovskite, produces high&#8208;quality perovskite films with smooth surface, oriented crystallization, and low charge recombination, leading to high&#8208;performance inverted PSCs with power conversion efficiencies approaching 22% for small&#8208;area devices (0.09&#160;cm2) and up to 19.5% for large&#8208;area devices (1.02&#160;cm2). Also, remarkably high stability of the PSCs is observed, retaining over 90%, 88%, or 83% of the initial efficiencies in air with relative humidity of 40&#8211;50%, under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination, or at 75&#160;&#176;C&#160;annealing for 1000 h without encapsulation.

         <title>Reaching the Excitonic Limit in 2D Janus Monolayers by In Situ Deterministic Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deterministic conversion of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) to Janus quantum layers is achieved via a novel synthesis approach. Integrated in situ spectroscopy measurements enable detailed insights into classical TMDs to Janus layer conversion to reach excitonic&#8208;grade Janus layer.








Abstract
Named after the two&#8208;faced Roman god of transitions, transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) Janus monolayers have two different chalcogen surfaces, inherently breaking the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane mirror symmetry. The broken mirror symmetry and the resulting potential gradient lead to the emergence of quantum properties such as the Rashba effect and the formation of dipolar excitons. Experimental access to these quantum properties, however, hinges on the ability to produce high&#8208;quality 2D Janus monolayers. Here, these results introduce a holistic 2D Janus synthesis technique that allows real&#8208;time monitoring of the growth process. This prototype chamber integrates in situ spectroscopy, offering fundamental insights into the structural evolution and growth kinetics, that allow the evaluation and optimization of the quality of Janus monolayers. The versatility of this method is demonstrated by synthesizing and monitoring the conversion of SWSe, SNbSe, and SMoSe Janus monolayers. Deterministic conversion and real&#8208;time data collection further aid in conversion of exfoliated TMDs to Janus monolayers and unparalleled exciton linewidth values are reached, compared to the current best standard. The results offer an insight into the process kinetics and aid in the development of new Janus monolayers with high optical quality, which is much needed to access their exotic properties.

         <title>Reconfiguring Colors of Single Relief Structures by Directional Stretching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relief structures in an elastomer that exhibit reconfigurable colors from individual micro&#8208;/nanostructures are designed and experimentally demonstrated. Distinct from Bragg diffraction effects from periodic structures, individual trench segments can act as a single color pixel with high resolution. Multiple sets of colorful microprints are accessible from monolithic reliefs by directional strains and capillary effects.








Abstract
Color changes can be achieved by straining photonic crystals or gratings embedded in stretchable materials. However, the multiple repeat units and the need for a volumetric assembly of nanostructures limit the density of information content. Inspired by surface reliefs on oracle bones and music records as a means of information archival, here, surface&#8208;relief elastomers are endowed with multiple sets of information that are accessible by mechanical straining along in&#8208;plane axes. Distinct from Bragg diffraction effects from periodic structures, trenches that generate color due to variations in trench depth, enabling individual trench segments to support a single color, are reported. Using 3D printed cuboids, trenches of varying geometric parameters are replicated in elastomers. These parameters determine the initial color (or lack thereof), the response to capillary forces, and the appearance when strained along or across the trenches. Strain induces modulation in trench depth or the opening and closure of a trench, resulting in surface reliefs with up to six distinct states, and an initially featureless surface that reveals two distinct images when stretched along different axes. The highly reversible structural colors are promising in optical data archival, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and strain&#8208;sensing applications.

         <title>Anomalous Superconducting Proximity Effect in Bi2Se3/FeSe0.5Te0.5 Thin&#8208;Film Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anomalous superconducting proximity effect (SPE) is unveiled in topological insulator (TI)/superconductor Bi2Se3/FeSe0.5Te0.5 heterostructures. In contrast with the normal SPE that decays with thickness, such an effect occurs in momentum space regardless of the TI film thickness, as long as the topologically protected surface states are robust and form a continuous conduction loop.








Abstract
The superconducting proximity effect (SPE) induces a superconductivity transition in otherwise non&#8208;superconducting thin films in proximity with a superconductor. The SPE usually occurs in real space and decays exponentially with film thickness. Herein, an abnormal SPE in a topological insulator (TI)/superconductor heterostructure is unveiled, which is attributed to the topologically protected surface state. Surprisingly, such abnormal SPE occurs in momentum space regardless of the TI film thickness, as long as the topological surface states are robust and form a continuous conduction loop. Combining transport measurements and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy techniques, the SPE in Bi2Se3/FeSe0.5Te0.5 heterostructures is explored, where Bi2Se3 is an ideal 3D topological insulator and FeSe0.5Te0.5 a typical iron&#8208;based superconductor. As the thickness of the Bi2Se3 thin film exceeds 400 nm, there still exists SPE&#8208;induced superconductivity on the surface of Bi2Se3 thin film with a transition temperature Tc not less than 10 K. Such an extraordinary behavior is induced by the unique properties of topologically protected surface states of Bi2Se3. This research deepens the understanding of the important role of topologically protected surface states in the SPE.

         <title>Decoupling Complex Multi&#8208;Length&#8208;Scale Morphology in Non&#8208;Fullerene Photovoltaics with Nitrogen K&#8208;Edge Resonant Soft X&#8208;ray Scattering</title>

The multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale morphology in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is complex and difficult to analyze. An innovative approach is provided by nitrogen K&#8208;edge resonant soft X&#8208;ray scattering, utilizing the spatial and orientational contrast from the cyano groups in the acceptor materials, chemically determining the phase separation, which decouples the mesoscale complexity for understanding the structure&#8211;property relationship in high&#8208;efficiency OPVs.








Abstract
Complex morphology in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and other functional soft materials commonly dictates performance. Such complexity in OPVs originates from the mesoscale kinetically trapped non&#8208;equilibrium state, which governs device charge generation and transport. Resonant soft X&#8208;ray scattering (RSoXS) has been revolutionary in the exploration of OPV morphology in the past decade due to its chemical and orientation sensitivity. However, for non&#8208;fullerene OPVs, RSoXS analysis near the carbon K&#8208;edge is challenging, due to the chemical similarity of the materials used in active layers. An innovative approach is provided by nitrogen K&#8208;edge RSoXS (NK&#8208;RSoXS), utilizing the spatial and orientational contrasts from the cyano groups in the acceptor materials, which allows for determination of phase separation. NK&#8208;RSoXS clearly visualizes the combined feature sizes in PM6:Y6 blends from crystallization and liquid&#8211;liquid demixing, while PM6:Y6:Y6&#8208;BO ternary blends with reduced phase&#8208;separation size and enhanced material crystallization can lead to current amplification in devices. Nitrogen is common in organic semiconductors and other soft materials, and the strong and directional N 1s &#8594; &#960;* resonances make NK&#8208;RSoXS a powerful tool to uncover the mesoscale complexity and open opportunities to understand heterogeneous systems.

         <title>Smart Face Mask Based on an Ultrathin Pressure Sensor for Wireless Monitoring of Breath Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thinnest (totally compressed thickness of &#8776;5.5&#160;&#181;m) and lightest (total weight of &#8776;4.5&#160;mg) self&#8208;powered pressure sensor developed can output a peak open&#8208;circuit voltage up to &#8776;10&#160;V when stimulated by airflow. A portable/wearable smart face mask is obtained based on the sensor and is used for wireless monitoring and analysis of various breath conditions from multiple testers.








Abstract
A smart face mask that can conveniently monitor breath information is beneficial for maintaining personal health and preventing the spread of diseases. However, some challenges still need to be addressed before such devices can be of practical use. One key challenge is to develop a pressure sensor that is easily triggered by low pressure and has excellent stability as well as electrical and mechanical properties. In this study, a wireless smart face mask is designed by integrating an ultrathin self&#8208;powered pressure sensor and a compact readout circuit with a normal face mask. The pressure sensor is the thinnest (totally compressed thickness of &#8776;5.5&#160;&#181;m) and lightest (total weight of &#8776;4.5&#160;mg) electrostatic pressure sensor capable of achieving a peak open&#8208;circuit voltage of up to &#8776;10&#160;V when stimulated by airflow, which endows the sensor with the advantage of readout circuit miniaturization and makes the breath&#8208;monitoring system portable and wearable. To demonstrate the capabilities of the smart face mask, it is used to wirelessly measure and analyze the various breath conditions of multiple testers.

         <title>Stabilization of Exposed Metal Nanocrystals in High&#8208;Temperature Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A partial oxide coating strategy is developed for the stabilization of exposed metal nanocrystals to enhance their performance in thermal reverse water gas shift (RWGS) catalysis particularly at high temperatures. This study opens a new avenue for the exploration of high&#8208;quality colloidal metal nanocrystals in high&#8208;temperature heterogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
Colloidal metal nanocrystals with uniform sizes, shapes, compositions, and architectures are ideal building blocks for constructing heterogeneous catalysts with well&#8208;defined characteristics toward the investigation of accurate structure&#8211;property relationships and better understanding of catalytic mechanism. However, their applications in high&#8208;temperature heterogeneous catalysis are often restricted by the difficulty in maintaining the high metal dispersity and easy accessibility to active sites under harsh operating conditions. Here, a partial&#8208;oxide&#8208;coating strategy is proposed to stabilize metal nanocrystals against sintering and meanwhile enable an effective exposure of active sites. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, controlled partial silica coating of colloidally prepared Pd0.82Ni0.18 nanocrystals with the size of 8 nm is demonstrated. This partially coated catalyst exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and stability, outperforming its counterparts with fully coated and supported structures, in reverse water gas shift (RWGS) catalysis particularly at high operating temperatures. This study opens a new avenue for the exploration of colloidal metal nanocrystals in high&#8208;temperature heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Orbital Gating Driven by Giant Stark Effect in Tunneling Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orbital gating is introduced driven by giant Stark effect in tunneling phototransistors based on 2H&#8208;MoTe2 without using external gating bias or slow charge trapping dynamics in conventional photogating, which realizes low dark current, practical photoresponsivity, and fast switching time simultaneously.








Abstract
Conventional gating in transistors uses electric fields through external dielectrics that require complex fabrication processes. Various optoelectronic devices deploy photogating by electric fields from trapped charges in neighbor nanoparticles or dielectrics under light illumination. Orbital gating driven by giant Stark effect is demonstrated in tunneling phototransistors based on 2H&#8208;MoTe2 without using external gating bias or slow charge trapping dynamics in photogating. The original self&#8208;gating by light illumination modulates the interlayer potential gradient by switching on and off the giant Stark effect where the dz2&#8208;orbitals of molybdenum atoms play the dominant role. The orbital gating shifts the electronic bands of the top atomic layer of the MoTe2 by up to 100 meV, which is equivalent to modulation of a carrier density of 7.3 &#215; 1011 cm&#8211;2 by electrical gating. Suppressing conventional photoconductivity, the orbital gating in tunneling phototransistors achieves low dark current, practical photoresponsivity (3357 AW&#8211;1), and fast switching time (0.5&#160;ms) simultaneously.

         <title>Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Cathode with Dual Energy&#8208;Storage Mechanism for Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate and Ultralong&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual energy&#8208;storage mechanism is detected in an organic (ethylenediamine (EDA))&#8211;inorganic (vanadium oxide) hybrid cathode. Both the EDA ligand and the V&#8211;O layer can participate in Zn&#8208;ion storage synchronously. Benefiting from the advanced mechanism, this hybrid provides a high specific capacity, elevated voltage, and excellent long&#8208;term cycle stability.








Abstract
The exploitation of cathode materials with high capacity as well as high operating voltage is extremely important for the development of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Yet, the classical high&#8208;capacity materials (e.g., vanadium&#8208;based materials) provide a low discharge voltage, while organic cathodes with high operating voltage generally suffer from a low capacity. In this work, organic (ethylenediamine)&#8211;inorganic (vanadium oxide) hybrid cathodes, that is, EDA&#8208;VO, with a dual energy&#8208;storage mechanism, are designed for ultrahigh&#8208;rate and ultralong&#8208;life ZIBs. The embedded ethylenediamine (EDA) can not only increase the layer spacing of the vanadium oxide, with improved mobility of Zn ions in the V&#8211;O layered structure, but also act as a bidentate chelating ligand participating in the storage of Zn ions. This hybrid provides a high specific capacity (382.6&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1), elevated voltage (0.82&#160;V) and excellent long&#8208;term cycle stability (over 10&#160;000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1). Assistant density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate the cathode has remarkable electronic conductivity, with an ultralow diffusion barrier of 0.78&#160;eV for an optimal Zn&#8208;ion diffusion path in the EDA&#8208;VO. This interesting idea of building organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid cathode materials with a dual energy&#8208;storage mechanism opens a new research direction toward high&#8208;energy secondary batteries.

&lt;p&gt;The exploitation of cathode materials with high capacity as well as high operating voltage is extremely important for the development of aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs). Yet, the classical high-capacity materials (e.g., vanadium-based materials) provide a low discharge voltage, while organic cathodes with high operating voltage generally suffer from a low capacity. In this work, organic (ethylenediamine)&#8211;inorganic (vanadium oxide) hybrid cathodes, that is, EDA-VO, with a dual energy-storage mechanism, are designed for ultrahigh-rate and ultralong-life ZIBs. The embedded ethylenediamine (EDA) can not only increase the layer spacing of the vanadium oxide, with improved mobility of Zn ions in the V&#8211;O layered structure, but also act as a bidentate chelating ligand participating in the storage of Zn ions. This hybrid provides a high specific capacity (382.6&#160;mA h g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), elevated voltage (0.82&#160;V) and excellent long-term cycle stability (over 10&#160;000 cycles at 5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Assistant density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate the cathode has remarkable electronic conductivity, with an ultralow diffusion barrier of 0.78&#160;eV for an optimal Zn-ion diffusion path in the EDA-VO. This interesting idea of building organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid cathode materials with a dual energy-storage mechanism opens a new research direction toward high-energy secondary batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling and Focusing In&#8208;Plane Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 with a Curved Plasmonic Antenna</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Launching, controlling, and focusing in&#8208;plane hyperbolic phonon polaritons in van der Waals &#945;&#8208;MoO3 are realized with geometrically designed curved gold plasmonic antennas. By engineering the curvature of the antenna extremity, it is able to tune the focal lengths and lateral sizes of the focal points. This study can open up new avenues for planar nanophotonic devices in the mid&#8208;IR region.








Abstract
Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) sustained in polar van der Waals (vdW) crystals exhibit extraordinary confinement of long&#8208;wave electromagnetic fields to the deep subwavelength scale. In stark contrast to uniaxial vdW hyperbolic materials, recently emerged biaxial hyperbolic materials, such as &#945;&#8208;MoO3 and &#945;&#8208;V2O5, offer new degrees of freedom for controlling light in two&#8208;dimensions due to their distinctive in&#8208;plane hyperbolic dispersions. However, the control and focusing of these in&#8208;plane HPhPs remain elusive. Here, a versatile technique is proposed for launching, controlling, and focusing in&#8208;plane HPhPs in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 with geometrically designed curved gold plasmonic antennas. It is found that the subwavelength manipulation and focusing behaviors are strongly dependent on the curvature of the antenna extremity. This strategy operates effectively in a broadband spectral region. These findings not only provide fundamental insights into the manipulation of light by biaxial hyperbolic crystals at the nanoscale but also open up new opportunities for planar nanophotonic applications.

         <title>Polymer Acceptors with Flexible Spacers Afford Efficient and Mechanically Robust All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New polymer acceptors (PAs) are developed by embedding flexible conjugation&#8208;break spacer (FCBS) units into the rigid backbones. The incorporation of FCBS affords effective modulation of the crystallinity and pre&#8208;aggregation of the PA and attains optimal blend morphology. As a result, the all&#8208;polymer solar cells exhibit both a high efficiency of 14.68% and excellent mechanical robustness with a crack onset strain of 21.64%.








Abstract
High efficiency and mechanical robustness are both crucial for the practical applications of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) in stretchable and wearable electronics. In this regard, a series of new polymer acceptors (PAs) is reported by incorporating a flexible conjugation&#8208;break spacer (FCBS) to achieve highly efficient and mechanically robust all&#8208;PSCs. Incorporation of FCBS affords the effective modulation of the crystallinity and pre&#8208;aggregation of the PAs, and achieves the optimal blend morphology with polymer donor (PD), increasing both the photovoltaic and mechanical properties of all&#8208;PSCs. In particular, an all&#8208;PSC based on PYTS&#8208;0.3 PA incorporated with 30% FCBS and PBDB&#8208;T PD demonstrates a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.68% and excellent mechanical stretchability with a crack onset strain (COS) of 21.64% and toughness of 3.86&#160;MJ m&#8208;3, which is significantly superior to those of devices with the PA without the FCBS (PYTS&#8208;0.0, PCE = 13.01%, and toughness = 2.70&#160;MJ m&#8208;3). To date, this COS is the highest value reported for PSCs with PCEs of over 8% without any insulating additives. These results reveal that the introduction of FCBS into the conjugated backbone is a highly feasible strategy to simultaneously improve the PCE and stretchability of PSCs.

         <dc:description>
A proposed octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA)&#8208;treated indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc oxide (IGZO)/p&#8208;Si heterostructure photodetector exhibits an excellent on/off current ratio of 4 &#215; 103 and unique negative differential resistance (NDR) current behavior, after implementation with a simple annealing process. Uniformity tests using 156 photodiodes and a 20&#160;000 cycle test demonstrate the reliability of the proposed photodiode.








Abstract
Metal oxide semiconductors are of great interest for enabling advanced photodetectors. However, operational instability and the absence of an appropriate doping technique hinder practical development and commercialization. Here, a strategy is proposed to dramatically increase the conventional photodetection performance, having superior stability in operational and environmental atmospheres. By performing energy&#8208;band engineering through an octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA) self&#8208;assembled&#8208;monolayer&#8208;based doping treatment, the proposed indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc oxide (IGZO)/p&#8208;Si heterointerface devices exhibit greatly enhance the photoresponsive characteristics, including a photoswitching current ratio with a 100&#8208;fold increase, and photoresponsivity and detectivity with a 15&#8208;fold increase each. The observed ODPA doping effects are investigated through comprehensive analysis with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Furthermore, the proposed photodetectors, fabricated at a 4 in. wafer scale, demonstrate its excellent operation robustness with consistent performance over 237 days and 20&#160;000 testing cycles.

Abstract
Silica aerogels with accurate building&#8208;block control are realized by adjusting the surfactant concentration during the synthesis process. The resulting silica&#8208;aerogel monolith with spherical building blocks of &#8776;24&#8211;40&#160;nm, together with a deliberately created hole along the incident light direction, shows an incredibly promising application in monochromatic laser&#8208;driven lighting. The resulting coefficient of illuminance variation is as low as 8.1%, significantly outperforming commercially available ground&#8208;glass diffusers (139.0%) and polymer diffusers (249.1%); the speckle contrast is lower, as well as better, than that can be recognized by the human eye (4%), and the illuminance uniformity in the range of 0.770&#8211;0.862 is much better (higher) than that indoor workplace lighting required by the International Organization for Standardization. Lighting with any color in the visible spectrum, including white, can be obtained by using three primary color lasers (450, 532, and 638&#160;nm) with different powers simultaneously as the light source. The resulting silica aerogel, which has excellent thermal stability, high laser&#8208;damage threshold, outstanding mechanical performance, and superhydrophobicity, can be further applied to long&#8208;distance and noncontact laser&#8208;driven lighting in rain or underwater without any additional encapsulation components.

         <title>Strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking Stabilized Nanophotosensitizers: Improving Tumor Retention for Enhanced Therapy for Large Tumors in Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoparticles encapsulating BODIPY photosensitizers with strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking are prepared, demonstrating long tumor retention of up to 10 days. The nanoparticles can completely suppress regular test size tumors (100 mm3) in mice by one&#8208;time radiation. Importantly, the nanoparticles also allow treatment of large&#8208;size tumors (350 mm3) via single&#8208;dose injection and three&#8208;time light treatments, resulting in a 90% inhibition rate.








Abstract
Conventional photosensitizers (PSs) often show poor tumor retention and are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream, which is one of the key hindrances to guarantee precise and efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vivo. In this work, a photosensitizer assembly nanosystem that sharply enhances tumor retention up to &#8776;10 days is present. The PSs are synthesized by meso&#8208;substituting anthracene onto a BODIPY scaffold (AN&#8208;BDP), which then self&#8208;assembles into stable nanoparticles (AN&#8208;BDP NPs) with amphiphilic block copolymers due to the strong intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction of the anthracene. Additionally, the incorporated anthracene excites the PSs, producing singlet oxygen under red&#8208;light irradiation. Although AN&#8208;BDP NPs can completely suppress regular test size tumors (&#8776;100 mm3) by one&#8208;time radiation, only 12% tumor growth inhibition rate is observed in the case of large&#8208;size tumors (&#8776;350 mm3) under the same conditions. Due to the long&#8208;time tumor retention, AN&#8208;BDP NPs allow single&#8208;dose injection and three&#8208;time light treatments, resulting in an inhibition rate over 90%, much more efficient than single&#8208;time radiation of conventional clinically used PSs including chlorin&#8208;e6 (Ce6) and porphyrin with poor tumor retention. The results reveal the importance of long tumor retention time of PSs for efficient PDT, which can accelerate the clinical development of nanophotosensitizers.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Responsive TiO2 Biometasurfaces: Toward In Situ Photodynamic Antibacterial Therapy for Biomedical Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metasurface is constructed on a Ti alloy by a newly invented alkaline&#8211;acid bidirectional hydrothermal (aaBH) strategy, which manipulates the light&#8211;matter interaction and induces the strong adsorption of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. The aaBH&#8208;treated Ti alloy implants show potent NIR&#8208;responsive antibacterial activity and possess a strong ability to promote the anchorage of human gingival fibroblasts on their surface.








Abstract
Implant&#8208;related microbial infection is a challenging clinical problem, and its treatment requires efficient eradication of the biofilm from the implant surface. Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;responsive strategies are proposed as an emerging efficient antibacterial therapy. However, the utilization of photosensitizers or photocatalytic/photothermal nanomaterials in the available approach likely induces high potential risks of interfacial deterioration and biosafety compromise. Herein, a TiO2/TiO2&#8722;x metasurface with potent NIR&#8208;responsive antibacterial activity is produced on a Ti alloy implant by a newly invented topochemical conversion&#8208;based alkaline&#8211;acid bidirectional hydrothermal method (aaBH). Electromagnetic simulations prove that NIR absorption and near&#8208;field distribution of the metasurface can be tuned by the dimension and arrangement of the nanostructural unit. Promising antibacterial efficacy is proved by both in vitro and in vivo tests, with low&#8208;power NIR irradiation for 10 min. Besides, the designed nanostructure in the metasurface itself also shows excellence in enhancing the adhesion&#8208;related gene expression of human gingival fibroblasts that are exposed to 10 min of NIR irradiation, proving the potent nanostructure&#8208;induced biological effects. This work provides a biosafe and upscalable metasurfacing approach with extraordinary capacity of manipulating light adsorption, photocatalysis, and biological properties.

         <title>Biomimetic Trachea Engineering via a Modular Ring Strategy Based on Bone&#8208;Marrow Stem Cells and Atelocollagen for Use in Extensive Tracheal Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chondroitin&#8208;sulfate&#8208;incorporating type&#8208;II atelocollagen scaffold repopulated with bone marrow stem cells for cartilaginous rings regeneration and type&#8208;I atelocollagen scaffold for vascularized fibrous tissue formation is fabricated; then, a modular ring strategy to develop a biomimetic trachea with cartilaginous rings alternately interspersed between the vascularized fibrous tissue architecture is adopted. The biomimetic trachea is used for extensive tracheal reconstruction.








Abstract
The fabrication of biomimetic tracheas with a architecture of cartilaginous rings alternately interspersed between vascularized fibrous tissue (CRVFT) has the potential to perfectly recapitulate the normal tracheal structure and function. Herein, the development of a customized chondroitin&#8208;sulfate&#8208;incorporating type&#8208;II atelocollagen (COL II/CS) scaffold with excellent chondrogenic capacity and a type&#8208;I atelocollagen (COL I) scaffold to facilitate the formation of vascularized fibrous tissue is described. An efficient modular ring strategy is then adopted to develop a CRVFT&#8208;based biomimetic trachea. The in vitro engineering of cartilaginous rings is achieved via the recellularization of ring&#8208;shaped COL II/CS scaffolds using bone marrow stem cells as a mimetic for native cartilaginous ring tissue. A CRVFT&#8208;based trachea with biomimetic mechanical properties, composed of bionic biochemical components, is additionally successfully generated in vivo via the alternating stacking of cartilaginous rings and ring&#8208;shaped COL I scaffolds on a silicone pipe. The resultant biomimetic trachea with pedicled muscular flaps is used for extensive tracheal reconstruction and exhibits satisfactory therapeutic outcomes with structural and functional properties similar to those of native trachea. This is the first study to utilize stem cells for long&#8208;segmental tracheal cartilaginous regeneration and this represents a promising method for extensive tracheal reconstruction.

         <title>Covalent&#8208;Linking&#8208;Enabled Superior Compatibility of ZIF&#8208;8 Hybrid Membrane for Efficient Propylene Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superior interfacial compatibility in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) hybrid membranes is achieved by linking functionalized ZIF&#8208;8 and polymeric PIM&#8208;1 through chemical bonds. The fabricated membrane exhibits the highest C3H6 permeability and remarkable selectivity for C3H6 over C3H8 among ZIF analogs, potentially for efficient propylene separation.








Abstract
The interface is a critical issue for metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework hybrid membranes in propylene separation. Here, a covalent&#8208;linking strategy is reported for strikingly reinforcing the interfacial compatibility in a ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;based membrane. A functionalized ZIF&#8208;8 material named ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN is synthesized using the mixed&#8208;ligand approach. ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN has an identical crystalline structure to ZIF&#8208;8, and the 4,5&#8208;dicyanoimidazole ligand is available for further functionalization. Covalent linkage of ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN with PIM&#8208;1 is driven by the thermal reaction of the cyano groups on both entities, which strengthens the filler&#8211;polymer connection in the ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN@tPIM&#8208;1 membrane. ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN@tPIM&#8208;1 exhibits remarkably enhanced propylene permeation property with C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of &#8776;28, which is 350% and 180% higher than those on non&#8208;treated ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN/PIM&#8208;1 and non&#8208;functionalized ZIF&#8208;8@tPIM&#8208;1, respectively. Additionally, ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN@tPIM&#8208;1 shows the highest C3H6 permeability of &#8776;370 Barrer among all relevant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes. This strategy opens an avenue for precise interface engineering in membranes and the resultant high performance is appealing in the propylene separation industry.

         <title>Resolving Atomic&#8208;Scale Interactions in Nonfullerene Acceptor Organic Solar Cells with Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy, Crystallographic Modelling, and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>

The combined results from solid&#8208;state NMR, crystallography, and modelling techniques highlight key differences in the Y6 morphology in PM6:Y6 blends cast from different solvents, which lead to different power conversion efficiencies in solar cells. By interpreting the experimental data step&#8208;by&#8208;step and using the results from each step, a more complete understanding of the underlying fundamental processes is reached.








Abstract
Fused&#8208;ring core nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), designated &#8220;Y&#8208;series,&#8221; have enabled high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs) achieving over 18% power conversion efficiency (PCE). Since the introduction of these NFAs, much effort has been expended to understand the reasons for their exceptional performance. While several studies have identified key optoelectronic properties that govern high PCEs, little is known about the molecular level origins of large variations in performance, spanning from 5% to 18% PCE, for example, in the case of PM6:Y6 OSCs. Here, a combined solid&#8208;state NMR, crystallography, and molecular modeling approach to elucidate the atomic&#8208;scale interactions in Y6 crystals, thin films, and PM6:Y6 bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends is introduced. It is shown that the Y6 morphologies in BHJ blends are not governed by the morphology in neat films or single crystals. Notably, PM6:Y6 blends processed from different solvents self&#8208;assemble into different structures and morphologies, whereby the relative orientations of the sidechains and end groups of the Y6 molecules to their fused&#8208;ring cores play a crucial role in determining the resulting morphology and overall performance of the solar cells. The molecular&#8208;level understanding of BHJs enabled by this approach will guide the engineering of next&#8208;generation NFAs for stable and efficient OSCs.

         <title>Sequential Activation of Molecular and Macroscopic Spin&#8208;State Switching within the Hysteretic Region Following Pulsed Light Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of an exceptionally reversible bidirectional switching in a molecular spin&#8208;crossover crystal, pump&#8211;probe optical microscopy is used to explore the dynamics of the spin&#8208;state switching within the hysteretic region. Remarkably, before the millisecond timescale, the response of the crystal to the laser excitation involves a gradual and homogeneous molecular conversion process, as if there were&#160;no hysteresis loop.








Abstract
Molecular spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) compounds constitute a promising class of photoactive materials exhibiting efficient photoinduced phase transitions (PIPTs). Taking advantage of the unique, picture&#8208;perfect reproducibility of the spin&#8208;transition properties in the compound [Fe(HB(1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)3)2], the spatiotemporal dynamics of the PIPT within the thermodynamic metastability (hysteretic) region of a single crystal is dissected, using pump&#8211;probe optical microscopy. Beyond a threshold laser&#8208;excitation density, complete PIPTs are evidenced, with conversion rates up to 200 switched molecules per absorbed photon. It is shown that the PIPT takes place through the sequential activation of two (molecular and macroscopic) switching mechanisms, occurring on sub&#8208;microsecond and millisecond timescales, governed by the intramolecular and free energy barriers of the system, respectively. The main finding here is that the thermodynamic metastability has strictly no influence on the sub&#8208;millisecond switching dynamics. Indeed, before this millisecond timescale, the response of the crystal to the laser excitation involves a gradual, molecular conversion process, as if there were&#160;no hysteresis loop. Consequently, in this regime, even a 100% photoinduced conversion may not give rise to a PIPT. These results provide new insight on the intrinsic dynamical limits of the PIPT, which is an important issue from a technological perspective.

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon 3D Laser Printing Inside Synthetic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon 3D laser printing inside of giant unilamellar lipid vesicles is reported. 2D and 3D hydrogel architectures with high precision and nearly arbitrary shape, including transmembrane pores, are realized within the confinement of a synthetic cell.








Abstract
Toward the ambitious goal of manufacturing synthetic cells from the bottom up, various cellular components have already been reconstituted inside lipid vesicles. However, the deterministic positioning of these components inside the compartment has remained elusive. Here, by using two&#8208;photon 3D&#160;laser printing, 2D and 3D hydrogel architectures are manufactured with high precision and nearly arbitrary shape inside preformed giant unilamellar lipid vesicles (GUVs). The required water&#8208;soluble photoresist is brought into the GUVs by diffusion in a single mixing step. Crucially, femtosecond two&#8208;photon printing inside the compartment does not destroy the GUVs. Beyond this proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle demonstration, early functional architectures are realized. In particular, a transmembrane structure acting as a pore is 3D&#160;printed, thereby allowing for the transport of biological cargo, including DNA, into the synthetic compartment. These experiments show that two&#8208;photon 3D laser microprinting can be an important addition to the existing toolbox of synthetic&#160;biology.

         <title>Auxetics&#8208;Inspired Tunable Metamaterials for Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Auxetics refers to structures or materials identified by a negative Poisson's ratio and exhibiting a counterintuitive geometrical behavior. Inspired by auxetics, mechanically tunable magnetic metamaterials in both planar and hemispherical configurations operating at megahertz frequencies are proposed, which serve to enhance local magnetic fields and increase signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (&#8776;4.5&#215;) in their application to magnetic resonance imaging.








Abstract
Auxetics refers to structures or materials with a negative Poisson's ratio, thereby capable of exhibiting counterintuitive behaviors. Herein, auxetic structures are exploited to design mechanically tunable metamaterials in both planar and hemispherical configurations operating at megahertz (MHz) frequencies, optimized for their application to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Specially, the reported tunable metamaterials are composed of arrays of interjointed unit cells featuring metallic helices, enabling auxetic patterns with a negative Poisson's ratio. The deployable deformation of the metamaterials yields an added degree of freedom with respect to frequency tunability through the resultant modification of the electromagnetic interactions between unit cells. The metamaterials are fabricated using 3D printing technology and an &#8776;20&#160;MHz frequency shift of the resonance mode is enabled during deformation. Experimental validation is performed in a clinical (3.0 T) MRI system, demonstrating that the metamaterials enable a marked boost in radiofrequency field strength under resonance&#8208;matched conditions, ultimately yielding a dramatic increase in the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (&#8776;4.5&#215;) of MRI. The tunable metamaterials presented herein offer a novel pathway toward the practical utilization of metamaterials in MRI, as well as a range of other emerging applications.

         <title>Fast Uncooled Mid&#8208;Wavelength Infrared Photodetectors with Heterostructures of van der Waals on Epitaxial HgCdTe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A van der Waals on epitaxial HgCdTe for uncooled mid&#8208;wavelength infrared photodetectors with fast response and high detectivity at spectral blackbody detection is introduced. Meaningfully, the device exhibits a fast response time of 13 ns, peak detectivity of 2 &#215; 1010 and 1011 cm Hz1/2 W&#8722;1 under blackbody radiation at 300 K and at 77 K.








Abstract
Uncooled infrared photodetectors have evoked widespread interest in basic research and military manufacturing because of their low&#8208;cost, compact detection systems. However, existing uncooled infrared photodetectors utilize the photothermoelectric effect of infrared radiation operating at 8&#8211;12&#160;&#181;m, with a slow response time in the millisecond range. Hence, the exploration of new uncooled mid&#8208;wavelength infrared (MWIR) heterostructures is conducive to the development of ultrafast and high&#8208;performance nano&#8208;optoelectronics. This study explores a van der Waals heterojunction on epitaxial HgCdTe (vdWs&#8208;on&#8208;MCT) as an uncooled MWIR photodetector, which achieves fast response as well as high detectivity for spectral blackbody detection. Specifically, the vdWs&#8208;on&#8208;MCT photodetector has a fast response time of 13&#160;ns (77&#160;MHz), which is approximately an order of magnitude faster than commercial uncooled MCT photovoltaic photodetectors. Importantly, the device exhibits a photoresponsivity of 2.5 A W&#8208;1, quantum efficiency as high as 85%, peak detectivity of 2 &#215; 1010&#160;cm Hz1/2 W&#8208;1 under blackbody radiation at room temperature, and peak detectivity of up to 1011&#160;cm Hz1/2 W&#8208;1 at 77 K. Thereby, this work facilitates the effective design of high&#8208;speed and high&#8208;performance heterojunction uncooled MWIR photodetectors.

     alt="Fast Uncooled Mid-Wavelength Infrared Photodetectors with Heterostructures of van der Waals on Epitaxial HgCdTe"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A van der Waals on epitaxial HgCdTe for uncooled mid-wavelength infrared photodetectors with fast response and high detectivity at spectral blackbody detection is introduced. Meaningfully, the device exhibits a fast response time of 13 ns, peak detectivity of 2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; cm Hz&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under blackbody radiation at 300 K and at 77 K.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncooled infrared photodetectors have evoked widespread interest in basic research and military manufacturing because of their low-cost, compact detection systems. However, existing uncooled infrared photodetectors utilize the photothermoelectric effect of infrared radiation operating at 8&#8211;12&#160;&#181;m, with a slow response time in the millisecond range. Hence, the exploration of new uncooled mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR) heterostructures is conducive to the development of ultrafast and high-performance nano-optoelectronics. This study explores a van der Waals heterojunction on epitaxial HgCdTe (vdWs-on-MCT) as an uncooled MWIR photodetector, which achieves fast response as well as high detectivity for spectral blackbody detection. Specifically, the vdWs-on-MCT photodetector has a fast response time of 13&#160;ns (77&#160;MHz), which is approximately an order of magnitude faster than commercial uncooled MCT photovoltaic photodetectors. Importantly, the device exhibits a photoresponsivity of 2.5 A W&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, quantum efficiency as high as 85%, peak detectivity of 2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm Hz&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; W&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; under blackbody radiation at room temperature, and peak detectivity of up to 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm Hz&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; W&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; at 77 K. Thereby, this work facilitates the effective design of high-speed and high-performance heterojunction uncooled MWIR photodetectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Ultrahigh&#8208;Power Mesocarbon Microbeads|Na+&#8208;Diglyme|Na3V2(PO4)3 Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prototype of ultrahigh power sodium ion battery (SIB), mesocarbon microbeads|Na+&#8208;diglyme|Na3V2(PO4)3, is assembled. The as&#8208;synthesized Na3V2(PO4)3@C@CNTs cathode and mesocarbon microbeads anode display the well&#8208;matched rate capability. The assembled full&#8208;cell delivers an energy density of 88&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at ultrahigh power density of &#8776;10&#160;kW kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) show practical applications in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. But, their power density is limited by the sluggish Na+ diffusion into the cathode and anode materials. Herein, the authors demonstrate a prototype of ultrahigh power SIB, consisting of the high&#8208;rate Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode, graphite&#8208;type mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) anode, and Na+&#8208;diglyme electrolyte. It is found that the overpotential of the NVP cathode obeys the Ohmic rule. Thus, the as&#8208;synthesized NVP@C@carbon nanotubes (CNTs) cathode with the high conductive CNTs networks displays high electronic conductivity, reducing the overpotential and charge transfer resistances and leading to the remarkable rate capability over 1000C. For the MCMB anode, the initial [Na&#8208;diglyme]+ co&#8208;intercalation step is pseudocapacitive dominated, and then the expanded graphite's layers ensure the subsequent fast ions diffusion. The rapid (de)intercalation kinetics in between the cathode and anode are well&#8208;matched. Thus, the assembled MCMB|1 m NaPF6 in diglyme|NVP@C@CNTs full&#8208;cell SIB delivers the energy density of 88&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at the high power density of &#8776;10&#160;kW kg&#8722;1. Even at the ultrahigh power density of 23&#160;kW kg&#8722;1, an energy density of 58&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 is obtained. The encouraging results of the full cell will promote the development of high&#8208;power SIB for large&#8208;scale applications in the future.

A biological self&#8208;assembly technology to fabricate Rhizopus hyphae carbon fibre (RHCF) and its derivatives is proposed. The RHCFs are multifunctional as the hosts to combine with metal oxide (CoO) and S, Li metal, and a polypropylene (PP) separator to form an RHCF&#8208;based cathode, anode, and separator, respectively. The as&#8208;assembled RHCF&#8208;based full cell shows excellent cycling capacity and high&#8208;rate performance.








Abstract
Biotechnology can bring new breakthroughs on design and fabrication of energy materials and devices. In this work, a novel and facile biological self&#8208;assembly technology to fabricate multifunctional Rhizopus hyphae carbon fiber (RHCF) and its derivatives on a large scale for electrochemical energy storage is proposed. Crosslinked hollow carbon fibers are successfully prepared by conversion of Rhizopus hyphae, and macroscopic production of centimeter&#8208;level carbon balls consisting of hollow RHCFs is further realized. Moreover, the self&#8208;assembled RHCF balls show strong adsorption characteristics on metal ions and can be converted into a series of derivatives such as RHCF/metal oxides. Notably, the designed RHCF derivatives are demonstrated with powerful multifunctionability as cathode, anode, and separator for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). The RHCF can act as the host material to combine with metal oxide (CoO) and S, Li metal, and a polypropylene (PP) separator to form a new RHCF/CoO&#8208;S cathode, an RHCF/Li anode, and an RHCF/PP separator, respectively. Consequently, the optimized LSB full cell presents excellent cycling performance and superior high&#8208;rate capacity (881.3&#160;mA h g&#8211;1 at 1 C). This work provides a new method for large&#8208;scale preparation of hollow carbon fibers and derivatives for advanced energy storage and conversion.

         <title>In&#8208;Memory Realization of Eligibility Traces Based on Conductance Drift of Phase Change Memory for Energy&#8208;Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, in&#8208;memory realization of eligibility trace for energy&#8208;efficient reinforcement learning (RL) with outstanding performance in discrete&#8208; and continuous&#8208;state RL tasks is presented. For the first time, the inherent conductance drift of phase change memory is exploited as physical decay function to realize in&#8208;memory eligibility trace, demonstrating excellent performance and significantly enhanced energy efficiency compared with traditional computing platforms.








Abstract
Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown outstanding performance in handling complex tasks in recent years. Eligibility trace (ET), a fundamental and important mechanism in reinforcement learning, records critical states with attenuation and guides the update of policy, which plays a crucial role in accelerating the convergence of RL training. However, ET implementation on conventional digital computing hardware is energy hungry and restricted by the memory wall due to massive calculation of exponential decay functions. Here, in&#8208;memory realization of ET for energy&#8208;efficient reinforcement learning with outstanding performance in discrete&#8208; and continuous&#8208;state RL tasks is demonstrated. For the first time, the inherent conductance drift of phase change memory is exploited as physical decay function to realize in&#8208;memory eligibility trace, demonstrating excellent performance during RL training in various tasks. The spontaneous in&#8208;memory decay computing and storage of policy in the same phase change memory give rise to significantly enhanced energy efficiency compared with traditional graphics processing unit platforms. This work therefore provides a holistic energy and hardware efficient method for both training and inference of reinforcement learning.

By applying these self&#8208;rectifying Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristors to a 6&#160;&#215;&#160;6&#160;crossbar array, each of the 36&#160;devices are operated individually without crosstalk disturbance.








Abstract
Memristors integrated into a crossbar&#8208;array architecture (CAA) are promising candidates for nonvolatile memory elements in artificial neural networks. However, the relatively low reliability of memristors coupled with crosstalk and sneak currents in CAAs have limited the realization of the full potential of this technology. Here, high&#8208;reliability Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristors grown in&#160;situ by atomic layer deposition (ALD) are demonstrated, where reversible Na migration underlies the resistive&#8208;switching mechanism. By employing ALD growth with an aqueous NaOH reactant in deionized water, uniform implantation of Na dopants is achieved in the crystallized TiO2&#160;thin films at 250&#160;&#176;C without post&#8208;annealing. The resulting Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristors show electroforming&#8208;free and self&#8208;rectifying resistive&#8208;switching behavior, and they are ideally suited for selectorless CAAs. Effective addressing of selectorless nodes is demonstrated via electrical measurement of individual memristors in a 6&#160;&#215;&#160;6&#160;crossbar using a read current of less than 1&#160;&#181;A with negligible sneak current at or below the noise level of &#8776;100&#160;pA. Finally, the long&#8208;term potentiation and depression synaptic behavior from these Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristors achieves greater than 99.1% accuracy for image&#8208;recognition tasks using a convolutional neural network based on the selectorless of crossbar arrays.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Tin&#8211;Lead Mixed&#8208;Perovskite Solar Cells with Vertical Compositional Gradient</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
4&#8208;Hydrazinobenzoic acid is introduced to enhance the efficiency and stability of Sn&#8211;Pb mixed&#8208;perovskite solar cells. Moreover, a vertical compositional gradient with a continuous change of the Pb/Sn ratio is found in the Sn&#8211;Pb mixed&#8208;perovskite films, leading to graded heterojunctions that are beneficial for photocarrier separation. The resultant devices show a record efficiency up to 22%.








Abstract
Sn&#8211;Pb mixed perovskites with bandgaps in the range of 1.1&#8211;1.4&#160;eV are ideal candidates for single&#8208;junction solar cells to approach the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit. However, the efficiency and stability of Sn&#8211;Pb mixed&#8208;perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still lag far behind those of Pb&#8208;based counterparts due to the easy oxidation of Sn2+. Here, a reducing agent 4&#8208;hydrazinobenzoic acid is introduced as an additive along with SnF2 to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+. Meanwhile, a vertical Pb/Sn compositional gradient is formed spontaneously after an antisolvent treatment due to different solubility and crystallization kinetics of Sn&#8208; and Pb&#8208;based perovskites and it can be finely tuned by controlling the antisolvent temperature. Because the band structure of a perovskite is dependent on its composition, graded vertical heterojunctions are constructed in the perovskite films with a compositional gradient, which can enhance photocarrier separation and suppress carrier recombination in the resultant PSCs. Under optimal fabrication conditions, the Sn&#8211;Pb mixed PSCs show power conversion efficiency up to 22% along with excellent stability during light soaking.

         <title>Unusual Site&#8208;Selective Doping in Layered Cathode Strengthens Electrostatic Cohesion of Alkali&#8208;Metal Layer for Practicable Sodium&#8208;Ion Full Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>

Unusual site&#8208;selective doping with Cu ion at transition metal site (2a) and unusual Zn ion at Na site (2d) for P2&#8208; Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 can effectively restrain P2&#8211;O2 phase transition and prevent material crack due to the enhanced electrostatic cohesions between two transition metal layers, leading to ultralong life span sodium&#8208;ion full cell.








Abstract
P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 is a dominant cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, charging P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 to voltages higher than 4.2&#8201;V (vs. Na+/Na) can induce detrimental structural transformation and severe capacity fading. Herein, stable cycling and moisture resistancy of Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 at 4.35&#8201;V (vs. Na+/Na) are achieved through dual&#8208;site doping with Cu ion at transition metal site (2a) and unusual Zn ion at Na site (2d) for the first time. The Cu ion doping in 2a site stabilizes the metal layer, while more importantly, the unusual alkali&#8208;metal site doping by Zn ion serves as O2&#8208;&#63743;Zn2+&#63743;O2&#8208; &#8220;pillar&#8221; for enhancing electrostatic cohesion between two adjacent transition metal layers, preventing the crack of active material along the a&#8211;b&#8208;plane and restraining the generation of O2 phase upon deep desodiation. This unique dual&#8208;site&#8208;doped [Na0.67Zn0.05]Ni0.18Cu0.1Mn0.67O2 cathode exhibits a prominent cyclability with 80.6% capacity retention over 2000 cycles at an ultrahigh rate of 10C, demonstrating its great potential for practical applications. Impressively, the full cell devices with [Na0.67Zn0.05]Ni0.18Cu0.1Mn0.67O2 and commercial hard carbon as cathode and anode, respectively, can deliver a high energy density of 217.9&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 and excellent cycle life over 1000 cycles.

         <title>Mass&#8208;Manufactured Beam&#8208;Steering Metasurfaces for High&#8208;Speed Full&#8208;Duplex Optical Wireless&#8208;Broadcasting Communications</title>

Assisted by an silicon&#8208;on&#8208;isolator&#8208;based metasurface that can be mass&#8208;manufactured by the complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) process, an ultracompact prototype for full&#8208;duplex metabroadcasting communications is demonstrated, which shows beam&#8208;steering angles up to &#177;40&#176;, 14 broadcasting channels with capacity for downstream and upstream links up to 100 and 10&#160;Gbps for each user channel, and three operating modes for flexible signal switching.








Abstract
Beam&#8208;steering devices, which are at the heart of optical wireless&#8208;broadcasting communication links, play an important role in data allocation and exchange. An ideal beam&#8208;steering device features large steering angles, arbitrary channel numbers, reconfigurability, and ultracompactness. However, these criteria have been achieved only partially with conventional beam&#8208;steering devices based on waveguides, micro&#8208;electricalmechanical systems, spatial light modulators, and gratings, which will substantially limit the application of optical wireless&#8208;broadcasting communication techniques. In this study, an ultracompact full&#8208;duplex metabroadcasting communication system is designed and experimentally demonstrated, which exhibits beam steering angles up to &#177;40&#176;, 14 broadcasting channels with capacity for downstream and upstream links up to 100 and 10&#160;Gbps for each user channel, three operating modes for flexible signal switching, and metadevice dimensions as small as 2&#160;mm&#160;&#215;&#160;2&#160;mm. In particular, the beam&#8208;steering metadevices are mass&#8208;manufactured by a complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) processing platform, which shows their potential for large&#8208;scale commercial applications. The demonstrated metabroadcasting communication system merges optical wireless&#8208;broadcasting communications and metasurfaces, which reduces the complexity of beam&#8208;steering devices while significantly increasing their performance, opening up a new avenue for high&#8208;quality optical wireless&#8208;broadcasting communications.

         <title>Homologous Bromides Treatment for Improving the Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite surface treatment by homologous bromide salts is investigated. It is found that bromides not only passivate surface defects but also penetrate into the perovskite providing bulk passivation. This leads to a large voltage&#160;of 1.24 V&#160;in a 1.63&#160;eV bandgap device and an efficiency of 23.7%&#160;in a 1.56&#160;eV bandgap device.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solution&#8208;processed organic&#8211;inorganic mixed halide perovskite solar cells has achieved rapid improvement. However, it is imperative to minimize the voltage deficit (Woc&#160;= Eg/q&#160;&#8722; Voc) for their PCE to approach the theoretical limit. Herein, the strategy of depositing homologous bromide salts on the perovskite surface to achieve a surface and bulk passivation for the fabrication of solar cells with high open&#8208;circuit voltage is reported. Distinct from the conclusions given by previous works, that homologous bromides such as FABr only react with PbI2 to form a large&#8208;bandgap perovskite layer on top of the original perovskite, this work shows that the bromide also penetrates the perovskite film and passivates the perovskite in the bulk. This is confirmed by the small&#8208;bandgap enlargement observed by absorbance and photoluminescence, and the bromide element ratio increasing in the bulk by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry and depth&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, a clear suppression of non&#8208;radiative recombination is confirmed by a variety of characterization methods. This work provides a simple and universal way to reduce the Woc of single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells and it will also shed light on developing other high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices, including perovskite&#8208;based tandems and light&#8208;emitting diodes.

Spin&#8208;State Switching
In article number 2105468, Karl Ridier, G&#225;bor Moln&#225;r,  Azzedine Bousseksou, and co&#8208;workers dissect the spatiotemporal dynamics of the spin transition in crystals of  [Fe(HB(1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)3)2], using pump&#8211;probe optical microscopy. On the sub&#8208;millisecond timescale, the response of the crystal to the laser pulse involves a homogeneous and gradual molecular conversion process, as if there were no hysteresis loop, whereas the macroscopic switching is delayed to the millisecond timescale. These results provide guidance for achieving efficient photocontrol of bistable materials.

Tunable Metamaterials
In article number 2109032, Stephan W. Anderson, Xin Zhang, and co&#8208;workers exploit auxetic structures with a negative Poisson's ratio, exhibiting counterintuitive behaviors, to design mechanically tunable metamaterials in both planar and hemispherical configurations operating at megahertz (MHz) frequencies. Optimized for their application to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the proposed tunable metamaterials serve to enhance local magnetic fields and increase the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio in magnetic resonance image around 4.5 times.

Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons
Launching, controlling, and focusing of in&#8208;plane hyperbolic phonon polaritons in van der Waals &#945;&#8208;MoO3 with geometrically designed curved gold plasmonic antennas are realized by Huanjun Chen, Shaozhi Deng, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2104164. By engineering the curvature of the antenna extremity, it is possible to tune the focal lengths and lateral sizes of the focal points. This study can open up new avenues for planar nanophotonic devices in the mid&#8208;infrared region.

2D Janus Monolayers
In article number 2106222, Mete Atature, Sefaattin Tongay, and co&#8208;workers use an in situ deterministic plasma technique to enable the synthesis of high&#8208;quality excitonic grade 2D SWSe, SMoSe, and other 2D Janus layers. Integrated spectrometers allow for the collection of structural, optical, and phononic properties during the growth. Through time&#8208;resolved studies, the team offers the first insights into the growth process and minute control provides the first with excitonic grade Janus layers.

Orientation&#8208;Dependent Color
In article number 2104874, Ahmad Rafsanjani, Andr&#233; R. Studart, and co&#8208;workers report soft architectured composites that display striking orientation&#8208;dependent color changes when stretched. The color change results from the rotation of pre&#8208;aligned reflective coated platelets embedded in a soft polymer matrix in a well&#8208;defined architecture. A soft robotic actuator that turns from fully opaque to reflective green upon inflation is illustrated.

         <title>Plant&#8208;Based Structures as an Opportunity to Engineer Optical Functions in Next&#8208;Generation Light Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a critical assessment of lignocellulosics for engineering optically functional materials for smart devices. It discusses the effects of fibrillation, fibril alignment, densification, self&#8208;assembly, surface&#8208;patterning, and compositing on targeted optical properties, such as transparency, haze, luminescence, UV&#8208;absorption, and structural colors. The scope covers the main plant&#8208;based structural materials, as well as non&#8208;lignocellulosic additives bearing an optical function.








Abstract
This review addresses the reconstruction of structural plant components (cellulose, lignin, and hemicelluloses) into materials displaying advanced optical properties. The strategies to isolate the main building blocks are discussed, and the effects of fibrillation, fibril alignment, densification, self&#8208;assembly, surface&#8208;patterning, and compositing are presented considering their role in engineering optical performance. Then, key elements that enable lignocellulosic to be translated into materials that present optical functionality, such as transparency, haze, reflectance, UV&#8208;blocking, luminescence, and structural colors, are described. Mapping the optical landscape that is accessible from lignocellulosics is shown as an essential step toward their utilization in smart devices. Advanced materials built from sustainable resources, including those obtained from industrial or agricultural side streams, demonstrate enormous promise in optoelectronics due to their potentially lower cost, while meeting or even exceeding current demands in performance. The requirements are summarized for the production and application of plant&#8208;based optically functional materials in different smart material applications and the review is concluded with a perspective about this active field of knowledge.

         <dc:description>
Polyprodrug nanomedicines have great potential in cancer therapy owing to their well&#8208;controlled composition and high drug loading by direct polymerization of therapeutic monomers. Recent advances in the development of polyprodrug nanomedicines are summarized to provide deep insights into the design and preparation of polyprodrug nanomedicines for efficient cancer therapy.








Abstract
Nanomedicines have the potential to provide advanced therapeutic strategies in combating tumors. Polymer&#8208;prodrug&#8208;based nanomedicines are particularly attractive in cancer therapies owing to the maximum drug loading, prolonged blood circulation, and reduced premature leakage and side effects in comparison with conventional nanomaterials. However, the difficulty in precisely tuning the composition and drug loading of polymer&#8211;drug conjugates leads to batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variations of the prodrugs, thus significantly restricting their clinical translation. Polyprodrug nanomedicines inherit the numerous intrinsic advantages of polymer&#8211;drug conjugates and exhibit well&#8208;controlled composition and drug loading via direct polymerization of therapeutic monomers, representing a promising nanomedicine for clinical tumor therapies. In this review, recent advances in the development of polyprodrug nanomedicines are summarized for tumor elimination. Various types of polyprodrug nanomedicines and the corresponding properties are first summarized. The unique advantages of polyprodrug nanomedicines and their key roles in various tumor therapies are further highlighted. Finally, current challenges and the perspectives on future research of polyprodrug nanomedicines are discussed.

This review highlights the latest developments in the field of chemical engineering&#8208;based lightweight and miniaturized attachable systems, which are mainly inspired by the natural world. Their applications for real&#8208;time monitoring, point&#8208;of&#8208;care sampling, biomarker detection, and controlled release are discussed thoroughly with respect to specific products/prototypes. The perspectives of the field, including persistence guarantee, burden reduction, and personality improvement, are also discussed. It is believed that chemical engineering&#8208;based lightweight and miniaturized attachable systems have good potential in both clinical and industrial fields, indicating a large potential to improve human lives in the near future.

         <title>Macrocycle&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers for Separation, Sensing, and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycles as an emerging class of building blocks are used for porous organic polymers owing to their easy functionalization, unique host&#8211;guest properties, modifiable conformations, and tunable chemistry. Facilitated by these features, macrocycle&#8208;based porous organic polymers have attracted considerable attentions in the construction of advanced porous materials and excelled in adsorptive separation, optical sensing, and heterogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
With the rapid development of materials science, porous organic polymers (POPs) have received remarkable attentions because of their unique properties such as the exceptionally high surface area and flexible molecular design. The ability to incorporate specific functions in a precise manner makes POPs promising platforms for a myriad of applications in molecular adsorption, separation, and catalysis. Therefore, many different types of POPs have been rationally designed and synthesized to expand the scope of advanced materials, endowing them with distinct structures and properties. Recently, supramolecular macrocycles with excellent host&#8211;guest complexation abilities are emerging as powerful crosslinkers for developing novel POPs with hierarchical structures and improved performance, which can be well&#8208;organized at different spatial scales. Macrocycle&#8208;based POPs could have unusual porous, adsorptive, and optical properties when compared to their nonmacrocycle&#8208;incorporated counterparts. This cooperation provides valuable insights for the molecular&#8208;level understanding of skeletal complexity and diversity. Here, the research advances of macrocycle&#8208;based POPs are aptly summarized by showing their syntheses, properties, and applications in terms of separation, sensing, and catalysis. Finally, the current challenging issues in this exciting research field are delineated and a comprehensive outlook is offered for their future directions.

         <title>Unblocked Electron Channels Enable Efficient Contact Prelithiation for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The contact prelithiation has been strongly considered for compensating the initial capacity loss of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, exhibiting great potential in ultra&#8208;long cycle life of working batteries and the application of large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. However, the utilization of the sacrificial Li source for contact prelithiation is low (&lt; 65%). Herein we describe the fundamental mechanism of contact prelithiation from the perspective of the Li source/anode interfaces by regulating the initial contact state, and successfully deliver a clear illustration of the pathogeny for capacity attenuation. Specifically, creating plentiful electron channels is an access to making contact prelithiation with a higher Li utilization, as the mitigated local current density that reduces the etching of Li dissolution and SEI extension on electron channels. A vacuum thermal evaporation for depositing the Li film enables the contact interface to possess an adequate electron channel construction, rending a 91.0% of Li utilization and the dead Li yield is significantly reduced in a working battery.

         <title>A Flexible Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Iodine Micro&#8208;battery with Unprecedented Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Currently, reported aqueous micro&#8208;batteries (MBs) only show unsatisfactory electrochemical performance (&#8804;120 mWh cm&#8211;3 volumetric energy density and &lt;1000&#160;&#956;Wh cm&#8211;2 areal energy density) and it remains challenging to develop durable aqueous MBs that can simultaneously offer both high volumetric and areal energy density. Herein, we have adopted an in&#8208;situ electrodeposition strategy to construct a flexible aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine micro&#8208;battery (ZIDMB) for the first time. Notably, the fabrication process well avoids the use of common additives (such as binders, conductive agents, and toxic solvent) and also bypasses subsequent time&#8208;consuming procedures such as grinding, coating, drying etc., thus greatly simplifying the manufacture of the ZIDMB. Meanwhile, owing to the suppression on the shuttle effect of triiodide ions and the high ionic conductivity of the polyelectrolyte, the ZIDMB can simultaneously deliver record&#8208;high volumetric and areal energy densities of 1647.3 mWh cm&#8211;3 and 2339.1 &#956;Wh cm&#8211;2, thus achieving values at least 13.5&#8208;folds and 2.3&#8208;folds better than those of best available aqueous MBs, respectively. This work affords an innovative strategy to construct an ideal micro&#8208;power source for future miniaturized and integrated electronics.

Abstract
Quantum information science and engineering (QISE) &#8211; which entails use of quantum mechanical states for information processing, communications, and sensing &#8211; and the area of nanoscience and nanotechnology have dominated condensed matter physics and materials science research in the 21st century. Solid state devices for QISE have, to this point, predominantly been designed with bulk materials as their constituents. In this review, we consider how nanomaterials (i.e., materials with intrinsic quantum confinement) may offer inherent advantages over conventional materials for QISE. We identify the materials challenges for specific types of qubits, and we identify how emerging nanomaterials may overcome these challenges. Challenges for and progress towards nanomaterials&#8208;based quantum devices are identified. We aim to help close the gap between the nanotechnology and quantum information communities and inspire research that will lead to next&#8208;generation quantum devices for scalable and practical quantum applications.

In this review, we consider how nanomaterials (i.e., materials with intrinsic quantum confinement) may offer inherent advantages over conventional materials for QISE. We identify the materials challenges for specific types of qubits, and we identify how emerging nanomaterials may overcome these challenges. Challenges for and progress towards nanomaterials-based quantum devices are identified. We aim to help close the gap between the nanotechnology and quantum information communities and inspire research that will lead to next-generation quantum devices for scalable and practical quantum applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Biocompatible Vibration&#8208;Actuated Omni&#8208;Droplets Rectifier with Large Volume Range Fabricated by Femtosecond Laser</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vibration&#8208;actuated omni&#8208;droplets rectifier composed of an array of slippery ratchets is developed for manipulation of droplets with a large volume range in a compatible manner, which can achieve a fast, real&#8208;time, and robust transport of droplets in various modes, including transport of liquid slugs in tubes, programmable and sequential transport, and bidirectional transport, which demonstrates the great potential in biomedical detection and analysis.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance droplet transport is crucial for diverse applications including biomedical detection, chemical micro&#8208;reaction, and droplet microfluidics. Despite extensive progress, traditional passive and active strategies are restricted to limited liquid types, small droplet volume ranges, and poor biocompatibilities. Moreover, more challenges occur for biological fluids due to large viscosity and low surface tension. Here, a vibration&#8208;actuated omni&#8208;droplets rectifier (VAODR) consisting of slippery ratchet arrays fabricated by femtosecond laser and vibration platforms is reported. Through the relative competition between the asymmetric adhesive resistance originating from the lubricant meniscus on the VAODR and the periodic inertial driving force originating from isotropic vibration, the fast (up to &#8776;60&#160;mm s&#8722;1), programmable, and robust transport of droplets is achieved for a large volume range (0.05&#8211;2000&#160;&#181;L, Vmax/Vmin&#160;&#8776; 40&#8239;000) and in various transport modes including transport of liquid slugs in tubes, programmable and sequential transport, and bidirectional transport. This VAODR is general to a high diversity of biological and medical fluids, and thus can be used for biomedical detection including ABO blood&#8208;group tests and anticancer drugs screening. These strategies provide a complementary and promising platform for maneuvering omni&#8208;droplets that are fundamental to biomedical applications and other high&#8208;throughput omni&#8208;droplet operation fields.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Regulation of Hydrogel Actuators by Autocatalytic Reaction Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel actuators made of polyacrylamide bilayer hydrogel with disulfide crosslinks are controlled by an autocatalytic front of thiols. This regulation enables an autonomous sequential actuation, gradual unrolling, and screwing. In addition, these actuators can activate each other in a relay fashion or switch an electrical circuit.








Abstract
Regulating hydrogel actuators with chemical reaction networks is instrumental for constructing life&#8208;inspired smart materials. Herein, hydrogel actuators are engineered that are regulated by the autocatalytic front of thiols. The actuators consist of two layers. The first layer, which is regular polyacrylamide hydrogel, is in a strained conformation. The second layer, which is polyacrylamide hydrogel with disulfide crosslinks, maintains strain in the first layer. When thiols released by the autocatalytic front reduce disulfide crosslinks, the hydrogel actuates by releasing the mechanical strain in the first layer. The autocatalytic front is sustained by the reaction network, which uses thiouronium salts, disulfides of &#946;&#8208;aminothiols, and maleimide as starting components. The gradual actuation by the autocatalytic front enables movements such as gradual unrolling, screwing, and sequential closing of &#8220;fingers.&#8221; This actuation also allows the transmission of chemical signals in a relay fashion and the conversion of a chemical signal to an electrical signal. Locations and times of spontaneous initiation of autocatalytic fronts can be preprogrammed in the spatial distribution of the reactants in the hydrogel. To approach the functionality of living matter, the actuators triggered by an autocatalytic front can be integrated into smart materials regulated by chemical circuits.

         <title>Stepwise Energy Transfer: Near&#8208;Infrared Persistent Luminescence from Doped Polymeric Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic near infrared (NIR) persistent luminescence systems with bright and long&#8208;lived emission are highly valuable for applications in communication, imaging and sensors. However, realizing these materials (especially lifetime over 0.1 s) is a challenge, mainly because of non&#8208;radiative quenching of their long&#8208;lived excitons. Herein, a universal strategy of stepwise F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) for bright NIR system with remarkable persistent luminescence (up to 0.2 s at 810&#160;nm) is presented, based on a new triphenylene dye doped polymer (TP@PVA) with persistent blue phosphorescence of 3.29 s. This persistent NIR luminescence is demonstrated for application of not only NIR anti&#8208;counterfeiting but also NIR bioimaging of penetrating a piece of skin as thick as 2.0&#160;mm. By co&#8208;doping a red dye (such as Nile red) and a NIR dye Cyanine 7 (Cy7) into this doped PVA film, the shortage of spectral overlap between TP emission and Cy7 absorbance is successfully solved, through a stepwise FRET process involving of triplet to singlet (TS)&#8208;FRET from TP to the intermediate red dye and then singlet to singlet (SS)&#8208;FRET to Cy7. It is noted that the efficiency of the upper TS&#8208;FRET is enhanced significantly by the lower SS&#8208;FRET, leading to high efficiencies for the continuous FRETs.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional materials have been under extensive research due to their remarkable properties suitable for various optoelectronic, photonic and biological applications, yet their conventional fabrication methods are typically harsh and cost&#8208;ineffective. Optical modification has been demonstrated as an effective and scalable method for accurate and local in&#8208;situ engineering and patterning of two&#8208;dimensional materials in ambient conditions. This review focuses on the state of the art of optical modification of two&#8208;dimensional materials and their applications. Perspectives for future developments in this field are also discussed, including novel laser tools, new optical modification strategies, and their emerging applications in quantum technologies and biotechnologies.

         <title>Harnessing Plasma&#8208;Assisted Doping Engineering to Stabilize Metallic Phase MoSe2 for Fast and Durable Sodium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metallic phase MoSe2 (1T&#8208;MoSe2) has aroused as a rising star for sodium storage in comparison with its semiconductor phase (2H&#8208;MoSe2) owing to the intrinsic metallic electronic conductivity and unimpeded Na+ diffusion structure. However, the thermodynamically unstable nature of 1T phase renders it an unprecedented challenge to realize its phase control and stabilization. Herein, for the first time, a plasma&#8208;assisted P doping triggered phase transition engineering is proposed to synthesis stabilized P&#8208;doped 1T&#8208;MoSe2 nanoflowers composites (P&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2 NFs). Mechanism analysis reveals significantly decreased phase transition energy barriers of the plasma&#8208;induced Se vacancy&#8208;rich MoSe2 from 2H to 1T owing to its low crystallinity and reduced structure stability. The vacancy&#8208;rich structure arouses high concentrate P doping, which manipulates the electronic structure of MoSe2 and urges its phase transition, acquiring a high transition efficiency of 91% accompanied with ultra&#8208;high phase stability. As a result, the P&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2 NFs delivers an exceptional high reversible capacity of 510.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1 with no capacity fading over 1000 cycles at 5000&#160;mA g&#8722;1 for sodium storage. The underlying mechanism of this phase transition engineering verified by profound analysis provides informative guide for designing advanced materials for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems.

         <title>Folding and Fracture of Single Crystal Graphene Grown on a Cu(111) Foil</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A single crystal graphene film grown on a Cu(111) foil by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has ribbon&#8208;like fold structures. These graphene folds are highly&#8208;oriented and essentially parallel to each other. Cu surface steps underneath graphene are along the &lt;110&gt;&#160;and &lt;211&gt;&#160;directions, leading to the formation of the arrays of folds. The folds in the single layer graphene (SLG) are not continuous but break up into &#8220;alternating&#8221; patterns. A &#8220;joint&#8221; (an AB&#8208;stacked bilayer graphene) region connects two neighboring alternating regions, and the breaks are always along zigzag or armchair directions. Folds formed in bilayer or few&#8208;layer graphene are continuous with no breaks. Molecular dynamics simulations show that SLG suffers a significantly higher compressive stress compared to bilayer graphene when both are under the same compression, thus leading to the rupture of SLG in these fold regions. The fracture strength of a CVD&#8208;grown single crystal SLG film was simulated to be about 70&#160;GPa. This study greatly deepens the understanding of the mechanics of CVD&#8208;grown single crystal graphene and such folds, and sheds light on the fabrication of various graphene origami/kirigami structures by substrate engineering. Such oriented folds can be used in a variety of further studies.

         <title>3D Hierarchical Host with Enhanced Sodiophilicity Enabling Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have been considered as a compliment to lithium metal batteries for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy batteries because of their low cost and the abundance of sodium (Na). Herein, a 3D nanostructured porous carbon particle containing carbon shell&#8208;coated Fe nanoparticles (PC&#8208;CFe) is employed as a highly reversible Na metal host. PC&#8208;CFe has a unique 3D hierarchy based on submicron&#8208;sized carbon particles, ordered open channels within the carbon particles, and evenly distributed carbon&#8208;coated Fe nanoparticles on the surface. PC&#8208;CFe achieves high reversibility of Na plating/stripping processes over 500 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8211;2 in Na//Cu asymmetric cells, as well as over 14400 cycles at 60&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in Na//Na symmetric cells. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the superior cycling performance of PC&#8208;CFe stems from the stronger adsorption of Na on the surface of the carbon&#8208;coated Fe NPs, which can provide initial nucleation sites more favorable to Na deposition. Moreover, the full cell with a PC&#8208;CFe host without Na metal and a high&#8208;loading Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode (10&#160;mg cm&#8211;2) maintains a high capacity of 103 mAh g&#8211;1 at 1&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 even after 100 cycles, demonstrating the operation of anode&#8208;free SMBs.

         <title>Engineering macrophage exosome disguised biodegradable nanoplatform for enhanced sonodynamic therapy of glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) exhibits high tissue penetration and negligible radiation damage to normal tissues, and thus emerges as a promising cancer therapeutic modality for glioblastoma (GBM). However, the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and hypoxic microenvironment greatly limit the SDT efficiency. In this work, a biodegradable nanoplatform (termed as CSI) was fabricated by encapsulating catalase (CAT) into silica nanoparticles (CAT@SiO2) for tumor hypoxia relief, and then loaded with the sonosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG). Inspired by the ability of macrophages to cross the BBB, CSI was further coated with AS1411 aptamer&#8208;modified macrophage exosomes to form CSI@Ex&#8208;A, which possessed efficient BBB penetration and good cancer cell&#8208;targeting capability. After tumor cell endocytosis, highly expressed glutathione (GSH) triggeres biodegradation of the nanoplatform and the released CAT catalyzes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce O2 to relieve tumor hypoxia. The GSH depletion and O2 self&#8208;supplying effectively enhanced the SDT efficiency both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the resulting CSI@Ex&#8208;A exhibited good biocompatibility and long circulation time. These findings demonstrate that CSI@Ex&#8208;A may serve as a competent nanoplatform for GBM therapy, with potential for clinical translation.

         <title>Photosensitizer Nanodot Eliciting Immunogenicity for Photo&#8208;Immunologic Therapy of Postoperative Methicillin&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Infection and Secondary Recurrence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By eliciting infection&#8208;related immunogenicity to achieve a higher level of active immunologic responses during acute phase infection and long&#8208;term immunosurveillance, AgB nanodots under near&#8208;infrared irradiation can demonstrate excellent antibacterial results through photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and Ag+ ions. This strategy could solve the predicament remaining in postoperative methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus&#8208;related infection and prevent recurrence.








Abstract
The treatment of postoperative infection caused by multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria, such as methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), has become an intractable clinical challenge owing to its low therapeutic efficacy and high risk of recurrence. Apart from imperfect antibacterial therapies, induction of insufficient immunogenicity, required for the successful clearance of a pathogen, may also contribute to the problem. Herein, an ultra&#8208;micro photosensitizer, AgB nanodots, using photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and Ag+ ion sterilization, are utilized to efficiently clear invading MRSA both in vitro and in vivo. AgB nanodots are also found to upregulate host immunogenicity in a murine model and establish immunological memory by promoting the upregulated expression of danger signals that are commonly induced by stress&#8208;related responses, including sudden temperature spikes or excess reactive oxygen production. These stimulations boost the antibacterial effects of macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, or even memory B cells, which is usually defined as infection&#8208;related immunogenic cell death. Hence, the proposed AgB nanodot strategy may offer a novel platform for the effective treatment of postoperative infection while providing a systematic immunotherapeutic strategy to combat persistent infections, thereby markedly reducing the incidence of recurrence following recovery from primary infections.

&lt;p&gt;The treatment of postoperative infection caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA), has become an intractable clinical challenge owing to its low therapeutic efficacy and high risk of recurrence. Apart from imperfect antibacterial therapies, induction of insufficient immunogenicity, required for the successful clearance of a pathogen, may also contribute to the problem. Herein, an ultra-micro photosensitizer, AgB nanodots, using photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion sterilization, are utilized to efficiently clear invading MRSA both in vitro and in vivo. AgB nanodots are also found to upregulate host immunogenicity in a murine model and establish immunological memory by promoting the upregulated expression of danger signals that are commonly induced by stress-related responses, including sudden temperature spikes or excess reactive oxygen production. These stimulations boost the antibacterial effects of macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, or even memory B cells, which is usually defined as infection-related immunogenic cell death. Hence, the proposed AgB nanodot strategy may offer a novel platform for the effective treatment of postoperative infection while providing a systematic immunotherapeutic strategy to combat persistent infections, thereby markedly reducing the incidence of recurrence following recovery from primary infections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorination&#8208;Enhanced Surface Stability of Disordered Rocksalt Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic origin behind the beneficial effect of high&#8208;level fluorination for enhancing the surface stability of Mn&#8208;based cation&#8208;disordered rocksalt (DRX) cathodes with increasing F content (Li&#8211;Mn&#8211;Nb&#8211;O&#8211;Fx, x&#160;= 0, 0.05, 0.2) is revealed. Associated with the reduced O redox activity, F in the DRX mitigates the formation of an O&#8208;deficient surface upon cycling, therefore leading to increased stability of the DRX cathode.








Abstract
Cation&#8208;disordered rocksalt (DRX) oxides are a promising new class of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, their capacity fade presents a major challenge. Partial fluorine (F) substitution into the oxygen (O) lattice appears to be an effective strategy for improving the cycling stability, but the underlying atomistic mechanism remains elusive. Here, using a combination of advanced transmission electron microscopy based imaging and spectroscopy techniques, the structural and chemical evolution upon cycling of Mn&#8208;based DRX cathodes with an increasing F content (Li&#8211;Mn&#8211;Nb&#8211;O&#8211;Fx, x&#160;= 0, 0.05, 0.2) are probed. The atomic origin behind the beneficial effect of high&#8208;level fluorination for enhancing the surface stability of the DRX is revealed. It is discovered that, due to the reduced O redox activity while with increasing F concentration, F in the DRX lattice mitigates the formation of an O&#8208;deficient surface layer upon cycling. For low F&#8208;substituted DRX, the O loss near the surface results in the formation of an amorphous cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase layer and nanoscale voids after extended cycling. Increased F concentration in the DRX lattice minimizes both O loss and the interfacial reactions between DRX and the liquid electrolyte, enhancing the surface stability of DRX. These results provide guidance on the development of next&#8208;generation cathode materials through anion substitution.

         <title>All&#8208;Solution&#8208;Processed Van der Waals Heterostructures for Wafer&#8208;Scale Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D van der Waals nanosheets from molecular intercalation&#8208;assisted electrochemical exfoliation are assembled to form building blocks for wafer&#8208;scale electronics. By using graphene, MoS2 and single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube, and oxidized HfS2 as metallic, n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type semiconducting, and insulating building blocks, various devices are realized including field&#8208;effect transistors, photodetectors, p&#8211;n diodes, and complementary logic gates.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) materials have been considered as potential building blocks for use in fundamental elements of electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as electrodes, channels, and dielectrics, because of their diverse and remarkable electrical properties. Furthermore, two or more building blocks of different electronic types can be stacked vertically to generate vdW heterostructures with desired electrical behaviors. However, such fundamental approaches cannot directly be applied practically because of issues such as precise alignment/positioning and large&#8208;quantity material production. Here, these limitations are overcome and wafer&#8208;scale vdW heterostructures are demonstrated by exploiting the lateral and vertical assembly of solution&#8208;processed 2D vdW materials. The high exfoliation yield of the molecular intercalation&#8208;assisted approach enables the production of micrometer&#8208;sized nanosheets in large quantities and its lateral assembly in a wafer&#8208;scale via vdW interactions. Subsequently, the laterally assembled vdW thin&#8208;films are vertically assembled to demonstrate various electronic device applications, such as transistors and photodetectors. Furthermore, multidimensional vdW heterostructures are demonstrated by integrating 1D carbon nanotubes as a p&#8208;type semiconductor to fabricate p&#8211;n diodes and complementary logic gates. Finally, electronic devices are fabricated via inkjet printing as a lithography&#8208;free manner based on the stable nanomaterial dispersions.

         <title>Controlled n&#8208;Doping of Naphthalene&#8208;Diimide&#8208;Based 2D Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bulk conductivity of naphthalene&#8208;diimide&#8208;based 2D polymers is increased by controlled stoichiometric n&#8208;doping with cobaltocene. Following single&#8208;electron reduction, these 2DPs retain their periodic structure and become paramagnetic. Substoichiometric doping leads to the highest bulk electronic conductivities, which is found to proceed through a hopping&#8208;mechanism.








Abstract
2D polymers (2DPs) are promising as structurally well&#8208;defined, permanently porous, organic semiconductors. However, 2DPs are nearly always isolated as closed shell organic species with limited charge carriers, which leads to low bulk conductivities. Here, the bulk conductivity of two naphthalene diimide (NDI)&#8208;containing 2DP semiconductors is enhanced by controllably n&#8208;doping the NDI units using cobaltocene (CoCp2). Optical and transient microwave spectroscopy reveal that both as&#8208;prepared NDI&#8208;containing 2DPs are semiconducting with sub&#8208;2&#160;eV optical bandgaps and photoexcited charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes of tens of nanoseconds. Following reduction with CoCp2, both 2DPs largely retain their periodic structures and exhibit optical and electron&#8208;spin resonance spectroscopic features consistent with the presence of NDI&#8208;radical anions. While the native NDI&#8208;based 2DPs are electronically insulating, maximum bulk conductivities of &gt;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 are achieved by substoichiometric levels of n&#8208;doping. Density functional theory calculations show that the strongest electronic couplings in these 2DPs exist in the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (&#960;&#8208;stacking) crystallographic directions, which indicates that cross&#8208;plane electronic transport through NDI stacks is primarily responsible for the observed electronic conductivity. Taken together, the controlled molecular doping is a useful approach to access structurally well&#8208;defined, paramagnetic, 2DP n&#8208;type semiconductors with measurable bulk electronic conductivities of interest for electronic or spintronic devices.

Abstract
Breaking time&#8208;reversal symmetry by introducing magnetic order and thereby opening a gap in the topological surface state bands is essential for realizing useful topological properties such as the quantum anomalous Hall and axion insulator states. In this work, a novel topological antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase is created at the interface of a sputtered, c&#8208;axis&#8208;oriented, topological insulator/ferromagnet (TI/FM) heterostructure &#8211; Bi2Te3/Ni80Fe20 because of diffusion of Ni in Bi2Te3 (Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3). The AFM property of the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 interfacial layer was established by observation of spontaneous exchange bias in the magnetic hysteresis loop and compensated moments in the depth profile of magnetization using polarized neutron reflectometry. Analysis of structural and chemical properties of the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 layer was carried out using selected area electron diffraction, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These studies, in parallel with our first&#8208;principles calculations, indicate a solid&#8208;state chemical reaction that leads to the formation of Ni&#8208;Te bonds and the presence of topological AFM compound NiBi2Te4 in the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 interface layer. The Ne&#233;l temperature of the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 layer is &#8764;63 K, which is higher than that of typical magnetic topological insulators (MTIs). The presented results provide a pathway towards industrial CMOS&#8208;process&#8208;compatible sputtered&#8208;MTI heterostructures, leading to novel materials for topological quantum devices.

The Ne&#233;l temperature of the Ni-Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; layer is &#8764;63 K, which is higher than that of typical magnetic topological insulators (MTIs). The presented results provide a pathway towards industrial CMOS-process-compatible sputtered-MTI heterostructures, leading to novel materials for topological quantum devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Library of ROS&#8208;Catalytic Metalloenzyme&#8208;Mimics with Atomic Metal Centers</title>

Abstract
Accompanied by the development of nanomaterial science, the metal&#8208;N&#8208;coordinated centers supported by carbonaceous substrates have emerged as promising artificial metalloenzymes (AMEs) to mimic the biocatalytic effects of their natural counterparts. However, the synthesis of well&#8208;defined AMEs that contain different atomic metal&#8208;N centers but present similar physicochemical and coordination structures remains a substantial challenge. Here, we have synthesized 20 different types of AMEs with similar geometry and well&#8208;defined atomic metal&#8208;N&#8208;coordinated centers to compare and disclose the catalytic activities, substrate selectvities, kinetics, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) products. We systematically explored their oxidase&#8208;(OXD), peroxidase&#8208;(POD), and halogen peroxidase&#8208;mimetic (HPO) catalytic behaviors. The Fe&#8208;AME shows the highest OXD&#8208; and HPO&#8208;mimetic activities compared to the other AMEs due to its high vmax (0.927&#160;&#956;M s&#8722;1) and low Km (1.070&#160;mM), while the Cu&#8208;AME displays the best POD&#8208;like performance. Furthermore, theoretical calculation reveals that the ROS&#8208;catalytic paths and activities are highly related to the electronic structures of metal centers. Benefiting from its facile adsorption of H2O2 molecule and lower energy barrier to generating &#8226;O2&#8722;, the Fe&#8208;AME displays higher ROS&#8208;catalytic performances than the Mn&#8208;AME. The engineered AMEs show not only remarkably high ROS&#8208;catalytic performances but also provide new guidance toward developing metal&#8208;N&#8208;coordinated biocatalysts for broad application fields.

         <title>Selenopeptide Nanomedicine Activates Natural Killer Cell for Enhanced Tumor Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chemo&#8208;immunotherapy using the nanotechnology has shown great potential for cancer therapy in clinic. However, uncontrolled transportations and synergistic responses remain challenges. Here, we developed a self&#8208;assembled selenopeptide nanoparticle that strengthened the tumor chemo&#8208;immunotherapy through the activation of natural killer (NK) cells by the oxidative metabolite of the selenopeptide. With advantages of the enzyme&#8208;induced size&#8208;reduction and the reactive oxygen species&#8208;driven deselenization, this selenopeptide was able to deliver the therapeutics, e.g., doxorubicin (DOX) to solid tumors and further activate the NK cells in a programmed manner. Importantly, in vitro and in vivo results proved the mutual promotion between the DOX&#8208;induced chemotherapy and the selenopeptide&#8208;induced immunotherapy, which synergistically contributed to the improved anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. It is anticipated that the selenopeptide may provide a type of promising stimuli&#8208;responsive immune modulator for versatile biomedical applications.

Abstract
The eye is one of the most complex organs in the human body, containing rich and critical physiological information (e.g., intraocular pressure, corneal temperature, and pH) as well as a library of metabolite biomarkers (e.g., glucose, proteins, and specific ions). Smart contact lenses (SCLs) can serve as a wearable intelligent ocular prosthetic device capable of non&#8208;invasive and continuous monitoring of various essential physical/biochemical parameters and drug loading/delivery for the treatment of ocular diseases. Advances in SCL technologies and the growing public interest in personalized health are accelerating SCL research more than ever before. Here, we discussed the current status and potential of SCL development through a comprehensive review from fabrication to applications to commercialization. First, we discuss the material, fabrication, and platform designs of the SCLs for the diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Then, we review the latest advances in diagnostic and therapeutic SCLs for clinical translation. Later, we summarize the established techniques for wearable power transfer and wireless data transmission applied to current SCL devices. We also provide an outlook, future opportunities, and challenges for developing next&#8208;generation SCL devices. With the rise in interest of SCL development, this comprehensive and essential review can serve as a new paradigm for the SCL devices.

         <title>MXene&#8211;Based Metal Anode with Stepped Sodiophilic Gradient Structure Enables a Large Current Density for Rechargeable Na&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The metal anode is the pivotal component for advanced sodium&#8208;metal batteries such as Na&#8208;O2 batteries. Designing 3D confinement scaffold is a promising strategy for constructing dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anode, however, the cycling stability at a large current density (&gt; 10 mA&#8226;cm&#8211;2) is still difficult to realize. In this work, we design a series of new lightweight and fibrous hydroxylated Ti3C2 (h&#8208;Ti3C2) MXene based scaffolds with stepped sodiophilic gradient structure (h&#8208;M&#8208;SSG), and its thickness can be controlled (ranges from 80 to 250&#160;&#956;m). The sodiophilic of scaffold is adjusted by the content of h&#8208;Ti3C2, which is stepped increased from top (electrolyte membrane side) to bottom. The sodiophilic gradient structure can effectively induce sodium ions to preferentially deposit at the bottom thus inhibits the growth of dendrite. The h&#8208;M&#8208;SSG/Na based symmetrical batteries exhibited a low polarization voltage and long cycling life at a high current density (40 mA&#8226;cm&#8211;2) and a high cut&#8208;off capacity (40 mAh&#8226;cm&#8211;2). Moreover, Na&#8211;O2 battery with h&#8208;M&#8208;SSG/Na anode exhibits a low potential gap of 0.137&#160;V after 45 cycles at 1000 mA&#8226;g&#8211;1 (is equivalent to 0.14 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2) and 1000 mAh&#8226;g&#8211;1 (0.14 mAh&#183;cm&#8211;2). This deposition&#8211;regulation strategy would inspire the design of 3D scaffold for high&#8208;performance sodium metal anode&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Manipulating Exchange Bias in a Van der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interfaces are formed for generating a non&#8208;antisymmetric exchange bias, where ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 is coupled to antiferromagnetic CrSe with a noncollinear spin texture and oxidized Fe3GeTe2 with a weak antiferromagnetic order. This exchange bias can be manipulated with field coolings, which opens up new routes toward controlling 2D spintronic devices based on van der Waals magnets.








Abstract
Spintronics applications of thin&#8208;film magnets require control and design of specific magnetic properties. Exchange bias, originating from the pinning of spins in a ferromagnet by these of an antiferromagnet, is a part of the highly important elements for spintronics applications. Here, an exchange bias of &#8776;90 mT in a van der Waals ferromagnet encapsulated by two antiferromagnets at 5 K, the value of which is highly tunable by the field coolings, is reported. The non&#8208;antisymmetric dependence of exchange bias on field cooling is explained through considering an uncompensated interfacial magnetic layer of an antiferromagnet with a noncollinear spin texture, and a weak antiferromagnetic order in the oxidized layer, at two ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interfaces.

     alt="Manipulating Exchange Bias in a Van der Waals Ferromagnet"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interfaces are formed for generating a non-antisymmetric exchange bias, where ferromagnetic Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is coupled to antiferromagnetic CrSe with a noncollinear spin texture and oxidized Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a weak antiferromagnetic order. This exchange bias can be manipulated with field coolings, which opens up new routes toward controlling 2D spintronic devices based on van der Waals magnets.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spintronics applications of thin-film magnets require control and design of specific magnetic properties. Exchange bias, originating from the pinning of spins in a ferromagnet by these of an antiferromagnet, is a part of the highly important elements for spintronics applications. Here, an exchange bias of &#8776;90 mT in a van der Waals ferromagnet encapsulated by two antiferromagnets at 5 K, the value of which is highly tunable by the field coolings, is reported. The non-antisymmetric dependence of exchange bias on field cooling is explained through considering an uncompensated interfacial magnetic layer of an antiferromagnet with a noncollinear spin texture, and a weak antiferromagnetic order in the oxidized layer, at two ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interfaces. This work opens up new routes toward designing and controlling 2D spintronic devices made of atomically thin van der Waals magnets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An aqueous Ti3C2&#8208;MXene&#8208;functionalized poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate ink is developed for 3D printing to precisely create 3D architectures with high design freedom and a post&#8208;printing freeze&#8211;thawing treatment protocol is proposed to transform the as&#8208;printed objects into highly conductive and robust hydrogels with high fidelity on both the macro&#8208; and microscale, enabling customizable applications.








Abstract
The ongoing miniaturization of devices and development of wireless and implantable technologies demand electromagnetic interference (EMI)&#8208;shielding materials with customizability. Additive manufacturing of conductive polymer hydrogels with favorable conductivity and biocompatibility can offer new opportunities for EMI&#8208;shielding applications. However, simultaneously achieving high conductivity, design freedom, and shape fidelity in 3D printing of conductive polymer hydrogels is still very challenging. Here, an aqueous Ti3C2&#8208;MXene&#8208;functionalized poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate ink is developed for extrusion printing to create 3D objects with arbitrary geometries, and a freeze&#8211;thawing protocol is proposed to transform the printed objects directly into highly conductive and robust hydrogels with high shape fidelity on both the macro&#8208; and microscale. The as&#8208;obtained hydrogel exhibits a high conductivity of 1525.8 S m&#8211;1 at water content up to 96.6 wt% and also satisfactory mechanical properties with flexibility, stretchability, and fatigue resistance. Furthermore, the use of the printed hydrogel for customizable EMI&#8208;shielding applications is demonstrated. The proposed easy&#8208;to&#8208;manufacture approach, along with the highlighted superior properties, expands the potential of conductive polymer hydrogels in future customizable applications and represents a real breakthrough from the current state of the art.

         <title>Free&#8208;Standing Nanofilm Electrode Arrays for Long&#8208;Term Stable Neural Interfacings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanofilm electrode arrays (NEAs) that consist of high&#8208;density, free&#8208;standing gold nanofilm electrodes are developed. The NEAs are encapsulated into biodissolvable polymer carriers through an efficient elastocapillary self&#8208;assembly process, enabling their reliable implantation into deep brain tissues. Chronically implanted NEAs can form intimate and innervated interfaces with neural tissue, enabling stable neuronal activity recordings across multiple brain regions over several months.








Abstract
Flexible neural electrodes integrated on micrometer&#8208;thick polymer substrates offer important opportunities for improving the stability of neuronal activity recordings during cognitive processes. However, the bending stiffness of micrometer&#8208;thick polymer substrates is typically two orders of magnitude higher than that of nanofilm electrodes, making it a limiting factor in electrode&#8208;tissue interfacings. Here, this limitation is overcome by developing self&#8208;assembled nanofilm electrode arrays (NEAs) that consist of high&#8208;density, free&#8208;standing gold nanofilm electrodes. Chronically implanted NEAs can form intimate and innervated interfaces with neural tissue, enabling stable neuronal activity recordings across multiple brain regions over several months. As an application example, the activities of the same neuronal populations are tracked across odor discrimination reversal learning and it is illustrated how dorsal striatal neurons represent and update stimulus&#8208;outcome associations across multiple timescales. The results underscore the potential of free&#8208;standing nanoscale materials for interfacing biological systems over long terms.

         <title>Soluble Organic Cathodes Enable Long Cycle Life, High Rate, and Wide&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble organic cathodes are demonstrated with an ultra&#8208;long cycle life, excellent rate capability, and a wide operation temperature range from &#8722;70 to 100&#160;&#176;C based on bi&#8208;functional gel polymer electrolytes, which can eliminate the shuttling of the soluble organic electrode materials through molecular sieving and charge repulsion while maintaining a fast reaction kinetics.








Abstract
Organic electrode materials free of rare transition metal elements are promising for sustainable, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally benign battery chemistries. However, severe shuttling effect caused by the dissolution of active materials in liquid electrolytes results in fast capacity decay, limiting their practical applications. Here, using a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) that is in situ formed on Nafion&#8208;coated separators, the shuttle reaction of organic electrodes is eliminated while maintaining the electrochemical performance. The synergy of physical confinement by GPE with tunable polymer structure and charge repulsion of the Nafion&#8208;coated separator substantially prevents the soluble organic electrode materials with different molecular sizes from shuttling. A soluble small&#8208;molecule organic electrode material of 1,3,5&#8208;tri(9,10&#8208;anthraquinonyl)benzene demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance with an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 10&#8239;000 cycles, excellent rate capability of 203 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 C, and a wide working temperature range from &#8722;70 to 100&#160;&#176;C based on the solid&#8211;liquid conversion chemistry, which outperforms all previously reported organic cathode materials. The shielding capability of GPE can be designed and tailored toward organic electrodes with different molecular sizes, thus providing a universal resolution to the shuttling effect that all soluble electrode materials suffer.

         <title>Efficiency of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Sensitized Triplet Upconversion Doubled in Three&#8208;Component System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of the first three&#8208;component metal&#8208;free photon upconversion system on the upconversion efficiency and threshold light intensity is studied herein. While the efficiency is doubled, the threshold light intensity is also increased. The performance enhancement can be attributed to more efficient energy transfer from the sensitizer to the intermediate acceptor in combination with a high quantum yield emitter molecule.








Abstract
As in many fields, the most exciting endeavors in photon upconversion research focus on increasing the efficiency (upconversion quantum yield) and performance (anti&#8208;Stokes shift) while diminishing the cost of production. In this vein, studies employing metal&#8208;free thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers have garnered increased interest. Here, for the first time, the strategy of ternary photon upconversion is utilized with the TADF sensitizer 2,4,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)isophthalonitrile (4CzIPN), resulting in a doubling of the upconversion quantum yield in comparison to the binary system employing p&#8208;terphenyl as the emitter. In this ternary blend, the sensitizer 4CzIPN is paired with an intermediate acceptor, 1&#8208;methylnaphthalene, in addition to the emitter molecule, p&#8208;terphenyl, yielding a normalized upconversion quantum yield of 7.6% while maintaining the 0.83&#160;eV anti&#8208;Stokes shift. These results illustrate the potential benefits of utilizing this strategy of energy&#8208;funneling, previously used only with heavy&#8208;metal based sensitizers, to increase the performance of these photon upconversion systems.

         <title>Boosting Piezoelectricity under Illumination via the Bulk Photovoltaic Effect and the Schottky Barrier Effect in BiFeO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancement of piezoelectricity by external stimuli is advantageous for its simple and in situ control, and compatibility with other functionalities. In this work, light is shown to be a powerful control parameter to induce a sevenfold enhancement of piezoelectric coefficient in BiFeO3 single crystals due to the bulk photovoltaic and Schottky barrier effects, offering potential for multifunctional optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Piezoelectricity is a key functionality induced by conversion between mechanical and electrical energy. Enhancement of piezoelectricity in ferroelectrics often has been realized by complicated synthetical approaches to host unique structural boundaries, so&#8208;called morphotropic phase boundaries. While structural approaches are well&#8208;known, enhancing piezoelectricity by external stimuli has yet to be clearly explored, despite their advantages of offering not only simple and in situ control without any prior processing requirement, but compatibility with other functionalities. Here, it is shown that light is a powerful control parameter to enhance the piezoelectric property of BiFeO3 single crystals. A series of measurements based on piezoresponse force microscopy and conductive atomic force microscopy, under illumination, reveal a locally enhanced effective piezoelectric coefficient, dzz, eventually showing almost a sevenfold increase. This phenomenon is explained with theoretical models by introducing the two main underlying mechanisms attributed to the bulk photovoltaic effect and Schottky barrier effect, involving the role of open&#8208;circuit voltage and photocharge carrier density. These results provide key insights to light&#8208;induced piezoelectricity enhancement, offering its potential for multifunctional optoelectronic devices.

         <title>In Situ Sprayed Starvation/Chemodynamic Therapeutic Gel for Post&#8208;Surgical Treatment of IDH1 (R132H) Glioma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A starvation/chemodynamic therapeutic gel of GOx@MnCaP@fibrin is developed for post&#8208;surgical treatment of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) (R132H) glioma, through depleting intratumoral glucose and generating high levels of reactive oxygen species.








Abstract
Complete resection of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) (R132H) glioma is unfeasible and the classic post&#8208;surgical chemo/radiotherapy suffers from high recurrence and low survival rate. IDH1 (R132H) cells are sensitive to low concentrations of glucose and high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to inherent metabolism reprograming. Hence, a starvation/chemodynamic therapeutic gel is developed to combat residual IDH1 (R132H) tumor cells after surgery. Briefly, glucose oxidase (GOx) is mineralized with manganese&#8208;doped calcium phosphate to form GOx@MnCaP nanoparticles, which are encapsulated into the fibrin gel (GOx@MnCaP@fibrin). After spraying gel in the surgical cavity, GOx catalyzes the oxidation of glucose in residual IDH1 (R132H) cells and produces H2O2. The generated H2O2 is further converted into highly lethal hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) by a Mn2+&#8208;mediated Fenton&#8208;like reaction to further kill the residual IDH1 (R132H) cells. The as&#8208;prepared starvation/chemodynamic therapeutic gel shows much higher therapeutic efficacy toward IDH1 (R132H) cells than IDH1 (WT) cells, and achieves long&#8208;term survival.

         <title>Shielding Ferritin with a Biomineralized Shell Enables Efficient Modulation of Tumor Microenvironment and Targeted Delivery of Diverse Therapeutic Agents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible ferritin&#8208;based platform is developed through biomineralization, in which calcium phosphate is generated on the ferritin surface. Such a &#8220;shielding&#8221; strategy not only enables efficient drug delivery to tumor and powerful tumor microenvironment modulation, but also brings additional functionalities by loading diverse drugs in the cavity and the shell for potent antitumor effects on multiple cell and patient&#8208;derived xenografts.








Abstract
Ferritin (Fn) is considered a promising carrier for targeted delivery to tumors, but the successful application in vivo has not been fully achieved yet. Herein, strong evidence is provided that the Fn receptor is expressed in liver tissues, resulting in an intercept effect in regards to tumor delivery. Building on these observations, a biomineralization technology is rationally designed to shield Fn using a calcium phosphate (CaP) shell, which can improve the delivery performance by reducing Fn interception in the liver while re&#8208;exposing it in acidic tumors. Moreover, the selective dissolution of the CaP shell not only neutralizes the acidic microenvironment but also induces the intratumoral immunomodulation and calcification. Upon multiple cell line and patient&#8208;derived xenografts, it is demonstrated that the elaboration of the highly flexible Fn@CaP chassis by loading a chemotherapeutic drug into the Fn cavity confers potent antitumor effects, and additionally encapsulating a photosensitizer into the outer shell enables a combined chemo&#8208;photothermal therapy for complete suppression of advanced tumors. Altogether, these results support Fn@CaP as a new nanoplatform for efficient modulation of the tumor microenvironment and targeted delivery of diverse therapeutic agents.

         <title>Immune Checkpoint Ligand Bioengineered Schwann Cells as Antigen&#8208;Specific Therapy for Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</title>

A translational method for bioengineering programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 and cluster of differentiation 86&#8208;functionalized Schwann cells to prevent and ameliorate multiple sclerosis is developed.








Abstract
Failure to establish immune tolerance leads to the development of autoimmune disease. The ability to regulate autoreactive T cells without inducing systemic immunosuppression represents a major challenge in the development of new strategies to treat autoimmune disease. Here, a translational method for bioengineering programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1)&#8208; and cluster of differentiation 86 (CD86)&#8208;functionalized mouse Schwann cells (SCs) to prevent and ameliorate multiple sclerosis (MS) in established mouse models of chronic and relapsing&#8208;remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is described. It is shown that the intravenous (i.v.) administration of immune checkpoint ligand functionalized mouse SCs modifies the course of disease and ameliorates EAE. Further, it is found that such bioengineered mouse SCs inhibit the differentiation of myelin&#8208;specific helper T cells into pathogenic T helper type&#8208;1 (Th1) and type&#8208;17 (Th17) cells, promote the development of tolerogenic myelin&#8208;specific regulatory T (Treg) cells, and resolve inflammatory central nervous system microenvironments without inducing systemic immunosuppression.

         <title>Tuning the Transport Properties of Gases in Porous Graphene Membranes with Controlled Pore Size and Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;separation membranes based on porous graphene (PG) offer ultimate permeance; however, they show low selectivity. The pore&#8208;narrowing approach, via gold deposition onto PG, allows both the thickness and the pore size of the membrane to be tuned to obtain a high number of pores below 3&#160;nm, enabling increased gas&#8211;surface interactions and molecular sieving for high gas selectivity and permeance.








Abstract
Porous graphene membranes have emerged as promising alternatives for gas&#8208;separation applications due to their atomic thickness enabling ultrahigh permeance, but they suffer from low gas selectivity. Whereas decreasing the pore size below 3&#160;nm is expected to increase the gas selectivity due to molecular sieving, it is rather challenging to generate a large number of uniform small pores on the graphene surface. Here, a pore&#8208;narrowing approach via gold deposition onto porous graphene surface is introduced to tune the pore size and thickness of the membrane to achieve a large number of small pores. Through the systematic approach, the ideal combination is determined as pore size below 3&#160;nm, obtained at the thickness of 100&#160;nm, to attain high selectivity and high permeance. The resulting membrane shows a H2/CO2 separation factor of 31.3 at H2 permeance of 2.23&#160;&#215; 105 GPU (1 GPU = 3.35&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;10&#160;mol s&#8722;1 m&#8722;2 Pa&#8722;1), which is the highest value reported to date in the 105 GPU permeance range. This result is explained by comparing the predicted binding energies of gas molecules with the Au surface, &#8722;5.3&#160;versus &#8722;21&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for H2 and CO2, respectively, increased surface&#8211;gas interactions and molecular&#8208;sieving effect with decreasing pore size.

Through the systematic approach, the ideal combination is determined as pore size below 3&#160;nm, obtained at the thickness of 100&#160;nm, to attain high selectivity and high permeance. The resulting membrane shows a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation factor of 31.3 at H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeance of 2.23&#160;&#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; GPU (1 GPU = 3.35&#160;&#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;10&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;mol s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; Pa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), which is the highest value reported to date in the 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; GPU permeance range. This result is explained by comparing the predicted binding energies of gas molecules with the Au surface, &#8722;5.3&#160;versus &#8722;21&#160;kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, increased surface&#8211;gas interactions and molecular-sieving effect with decreasing pore size.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Super&#8208;Boosted Hybrid Plasmonic Upconversion Process for Photodetection at 1550&#160;nm Wavelength</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super&#8208;boosted hybrid plasmonic upconversion (UC) architecture comprising a hierarchical plasmonic upconversion (HPU) film and a polymeric microlens array (MLA) film is proposed for efficient photodetection at a wavelength of 1550&#160;nm. Significant UC emission enhancement is realized via the amplified plasmonic coupling of an HPU film. The plasmonic effect, super&#8208;boosted by microfocusing the incident light, by MLA leads to superior sensitivity and responsivity of devices at weak near&#8208;infrared excitation powers.








Abstract
A super&#8208;boosted hybrid plasmonic upconversion (UC) architecture comprising a hierarchical plasmonic upconversion (HPU) film and a polymeric microlens array (MLA) film is proposed for efficient photodetection at a wavelength of 1550&#160;nm. Plasmonic metasurfaces and Au core&#8211;satellite nanoassembly (CSNA) films can strongly induce a more effective plasmonic effect by providing numerous hot spots in an intense local electromagnetic field up to wavelengths exceeding 1550&#160;nm. Hence, significant UC emission enhancement is realized via the amplified plasmonic coupling of an HPU film comprising an Au CSNA and UC nanoparticles. Furthermore, an MLA polymer film is synergistically coupled with the HPU film, thereby focusing the incident near&#8208;infrared light in the micrometer region, including the plasmonic nanostructure area. Consequently, the plasmonic effect super&#8208;boosted by microfocusing the incident light, significantly lowers the detectable power limit of a device, resulting in superior sensitivity and responsivity at weak excitation powers. Finally, a triple&#8208;cation perovskite&#8208;based photodetector coupled with the hybrid plasmonic UC film exhibits the excellent values of responsivity and detectivity of 9.80&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and 8.22&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones at a weak power density of &#8776;0.03&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively, demonstrating that the device performance is enhanced by more than 104 magnitudes over a reference sample.

         <title>A Hydrogel Ionic Circuit Based High&#8208;Intensity Iontophoresis Device for Intraocular Macromolecule and Nanoparticle Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iontophoresis device based on a hydrogel ionic circuit (HIC) is developed for highly effective intraocular delivery of macromolecule and nanoparticle drugs. The HIC&#8208;based device allows safe application of high current intensities (up to 87 mA cm&#8722;2) to the ocular tissue. Moreover, therapeutically effective concentrations of bevacizumab and dexamethasone in a nanoparticle formulation can be delivered to target tissues within 10&#8211;20 min of iontophoresis application.








Abstract
Iontophoresis is an electrical&#8208;current&#8208;based, noninvasive drug&#8208;delivery technology, which is particularly suitable for intraocular drug delivery. Current ocular iontophoresis devices use low current intensities that significantly limit macromolecule and nanoparticle (NP) delivery efficiency. Increasing current intensity leads to ocular tissue damage. Here, an iontophoresis device based on a hydrogel ionic circuit (HIC), for high&#8208;efficiency intraocular macromolecule and NP delivery, is described. The HIC&#8208;based device is capable of minimizing Joule heating, effectively buffering electrochemical (EC) reaction&#8208;generated pH changes, and absorbing electrode overpotential&#8208;induced heating. As a result, the device allows safe application of high current intensities (up to 87&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, more than 10 times higher than current ocular iontophoresis devices) to the eye with minimal ocular cell death and tissue damage. The high&#8208;intensity iontophoresis significantly enhances macromolecule and NP delivery to both the anterior and posterior segments by up to 300 times compared to the conventional iontophoresis. Therapeutically effective concentrations of bevacizumab and dexamethasone are delivered to target tissue compartments within 10&#8211;20&#160;min of iontophoresis application. This study highlights the significant safety enhancement enabled by an HIC&#8208;based device design and the potential of the device to deliver therapeutic doses of macromolecule and NP ophthalmic drugs within a clinically relevant time frame.

         <title>Multivalent Noncovalent Interfacing and Cross&#8208;Linking of Supramolecular Tubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical synthetic supramolecular network is formed and interfaced to biomimetic surfaces using purely noncovalent interactions. Supramolecular synthetic copolymer bearing biotin linking group forms supramolecular networks upon addition of streptavidin, and can bind to streptavidin&#8208;modified surfaces. The architectures of these networks can be tuned by changing the biotin ratio in supramolecular copolymer and the concentration of streptavidin.








Abstract
Natural supramolecular filaments have the ability to cross&#8208;link with each other and to interface with the cellular membrane via biomolecular noncovalent interactions. This behavior allows them to form complex networks within as well as outside the cell, i.e., the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, respectively. The potential of artificial supramolecular polymers to interact through specific noncovalent interactions has so far only seen limited exploration due to the dynamic nature of supramolecular interactions. Here, a system of synthetic supramolecular tubes that cross&#8208;link forming supramolecular networks, and at the same time bind to biomimetic surfaces by the aid of noncovalent streptavidin&#8211;biotin linkages, is demonstrated. The architecture of the networks can be engineered by controlling the density of the biotin moiety at the exterior of the tubes as well as by the concentration of the streptavidin. The presented strategy provides a pathway for designing adjustable artificial supramolecular superstructures, which can potentially yield more complex biomimetic adaptive materials.

         <title>Lateral Fully Organic P&#8211;N Diodes Created in a Single Donor&#8211;Acceptor Copolymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lateral fully organic P&#8211;N diodes can be created in a single polymer, which exhibits a high rectification ratio &#8776;2100 and a high current density 3.83 A cm&#8722;2. This work opens the opportunities to create P&#8211;N junctions in ways of silicon&#8208;based inorganic semiconductors and promises new opportunities for integrating organic materials for flexible and printable organic devices.








Abstract
P&#8211;N junctions exist in many solid&#8208;state organic devices, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes, solar cells, and thermoelectric devices. Creating P&#8211;N junctions by bulk chemical doping in a single organic material (like silicon doped by boron and phosphorus) may capitalize the vast scientific and technological groundwork established in the inorganic semiconducting field. However, high&#8208;performance single&#8208;organic&#8208;material P&#8211;N junctions are seldom reported, because the diffusion of the dopant counterions often leads to transient rectification properties. Herein, a new type of lateral fully organic diodes created in single donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) copolymer films with only one P&#8208;type dopant is reported. The achieved lateral devices exhibit high current densities of &#8776;3.83 A cm&#8722;2 and a high rectification ratio of &#8776;2100, which are beyond the requirements for high&#8208;frequency identification tags. The P&#8208; to N&#8208;type polarity switching mechanism is proposed after spectroscopic and structural tests. Decent stability of the organic diode is obtained, which is due to the long channel length and low diffusion speed of the large size of dopants. This work opens the opportunities to create P&#8211;N junctions in ways of silicon&#8208;based inorganic semiconductors and promises new opportunities for integrating organic materials for flexible and printable organic devices.

         <title>Cluster Fragments in Amorphous Phosphorus and their Evolution under Pressure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;learning&#8208;driven simulations provide new insight into the structure of amorphous phosphorus. The structural model so obtained contains abundant five&#8208;membered rings and more complex cluster fragments. The simulation results help to understand previous experimental observations at ambient and high pressure, and they provide an example of the emerging application of machine&#8208;learned potentials to complex functional materials.








Abstract
Amorphous phosphorus (a&#8208;P) has long attracted interest because of its complex atomic structure, and more recently as an anode material for batteries. However, accurately describing and understanding a&#8208;P at the atomistic level remains a challenge. Here, it is shown that large&#8208;scale molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations, enabled by a machine&#8208;learning (ML)&#8208;based interatomic potential for phosphorus, can give new insights into the atomic structure of a&#8208;P and how this structure changes under pressure. The structural model so obtained contains abundant five&#8208;membered rings, as well as more complex seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;atom clusters. Changes in the simulated first sharp diffraction peak during compression and decompression indicate a hysteresis in the recovery of medium&#8208;range order. An analysis of cluster fragments, large rings, and voids suggests that moderate pressure (up to about 5&#160;GPa) does not break the connectivity of clusters, but higher pressure does. The work provides a starting point for further computational studies of the structure and properties of a&#8208;P, and more generally it exemplifies how ML&#8208;driven modeling can accelerate the understanding of disordered functional materials.

         <title>Two Birds with One Stone: Interfacial Engineering of Multifunctional Janus Separator for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;in&#8208;one multifunctional Janus separator is prepared using interfacial engineering strategies to improve the performance of Li&#8211;S batteries. The reversibility of the Li&#8208;metal anode is greatly enhanced and the shuttle effect of the sulfur cathode is effectively suppressed. This work offers a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the challenges facing the metallic Li anode and the sulfur cathode in Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8208;dendrite growth and unsatisfactory sulfur cathode performance are two core problems that restrict the practical applications of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Here, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one design concept for a Janus separator, enabled by the interfacial engineering strategy, is proposed to improve the performance of LSBs. At the interface of the anode/separator, the thin functionalized composite layer contains high&#8208;elastic&#8208;modulus and high&#8208;thermal&#8208;conductivity boron nitride nanosheets and oxygen&#8208;group&#8208;grafted cellulose nanofibers (BNNs@CNFs), by which the formation of &#8220;hot spots&#8221; can be effectively avoid, the Li&#8208;ion flux homogenized, and dendrite growth suppressed. Meanwhile, at the interface between the separator and the cathode, the homogenously exposed single&#8208;atom Ru on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO@Ru SAs) can &#8220;trap&#8221; polysulfides and reduce the activation energy to boost their conversion kinetics. Consequently, the LSBs show a high capacity of 460 mAh g&#8211;1 at 5C and ultrastable cycling performance with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.046% per cycle over 800 cycles. To further demonstrate the practical prospect of the Janus separator, a lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cell using the Janus separator delivers a cell&#8208;level energy density of 310.2&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1. This study provides a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the challenges facing the Li anode and the sulfur cathode in LSBs.

         <title>Lattice Polarity Manipulation of Quasi&#8208;vdW Epitaxial GaN Films on Graphene Through Interface Atomic Configuration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manipulation of the lattice polarity of quasi&#8208;vdW epitaxial GaN on graphene through controlling the interface atomic configuration is reported. This polarity&#8208;control rule is not affected by the growth method and is free of either crystalline or non&#8208;crystalline substrates. It makes the epitaxy of III&#8208;nitrides with preferred lattice polarity possible and improves the ability to fabricate advanced semiconductor devices.








Abstract
Quasi van der Waals epitaxy, a pioneering epitaxy of sp3&#8208;hybridized semiconductor films on sp2&#8208;hybridized 2D materials, provides a way, in principle, to achieve single&#8208;crystal epilayers with preferred atom configurations that are free of substrate. Unfortunately, this has not been experimentally confirmed in the case of the hexagonal semiconductor III&#8208;nitride epilayer until now. Here, it is reported that the epitaxy of gallium nitride (GaN) on graphene can tune the atom arrangement (lattice polarity) through manipulation of the interface atomic configuration, where GaN films with gallium and nitrogen polarity are achieved by forming C&#63743;O&#63743;N&#63743;Ga(3) or C&#63743;O&#63743;Ga&#63743;N(3) configurations, respectively, on artificial C&#63743;O surface dangling bonds by atomic oxygen pre&#8208;irradiation on trilayer graphene. Furthermore, an aluminum nitride buffer/interlayer leads to unique metal polarity due to the formation of an AlON thin layer in a growth environment containing trace amounts of oxygen, which explains the open question of why those reported wurtzite III&#8208;nitride films on 2D materials always exhibit metal polarity. The reported atomic modulation through interface manipulation provides an effective model for hexagonal nitride semiconductor layers grown on graphene, which definitely promotes the development of novel semiconductor devices.

         <title>Electrostatic&#8211;Mechanical Synergistic In Situ Multiscale Tissue Adhesion for Sustainable Residue&#8208;Free Bioelectronics Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic&#8211;mechanical, synergistic, in situ, multiscale tissue adhesion for various bioelectronic applications is demonstrated. To deduce the mechanism, a thermodynamic model based on a tailored elastomer&#8211;hydrogel combinatory adhesive architecture is proposed. Reliable real&#8208;time measurements of electrophysiological signals generated by various tissues, ranging from rodent sciatic nerve, the muscle, brain, and human skin, are also successfully demonstrated.








Abstract
Recent studies on soft adhesives have sought to deeply understand how their chemical or mechanical structures interact strongly with living tissues. The aim is to optimally address the unmet needs of patients with acute or chronic diseases. Synergistic adhesion involving both electrostatic (hydrogen bonds) and mechanical interactions (capillarity&#8208;assisted suction stress) seems to be effective in overcoming the challenges associated with long&#8208;term unstable coupling to tissues. Here, an electrostatically and mechanically synergistic mechanism of residue&#8208;free, sustainable, in situ tissue adhesion by implementing hybrid multiscale architectonics. To deduce the mechanism, a thermodynamic model based on a tailored multiscale combinatory adhesive is proposed. The model supports the experimental results that the thermodynamically controlled swelling of the nanoporous hydrogel embedded in the hierarchical elastomeric structure enhances biofluid&#8208;insensitive, sustainable, in situ adhesion to diverse soft, slippery, and wet organ surfaces, as well as clean detachment in the peeling direction. Based on the robust tissue adhesion capability, universal reliable measurements of electrophysiological signals generated by various tissues, ranging from rodent sciatic nerve, the muscle, brain, and human skin, are successfully demonstrated.

Flexible and free&#8208;standing carbon membrane with atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N4/C sites is constructed and used as electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction. In virtue of the hierarchical porous structures and optimized local atomic configurations, the as&#8208;synthesized noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free membrane as binder&#8208;free air cathode demonstrates a stable cycling over 1000 h for Zn&#8211;air battery.








Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free, durable, and high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER) are vital for rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a flexible and free&#8208;standing carbon fiber membrane immobilized with atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N4/C catalysts (Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3) is synthesized and used as air cathode for ZABs. The intertwined fibers with hierarchical nanopores facilitate the gas transportation, electrolyte infiltration and electron transfer. The large specific surface area exposes a high concentration of Fe&#8211;N4/C sites embedded in the carbon matrix. Modulation of local atomic configurations by sulfur doping in Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3 catalyst leads to excellent ORR and enhanced OER activities. The as&#8208;synthesized Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3 catalyst demonstrates a positive half&#8208;wave potential of 0.89&#160;V and a small Tafel slope of 70.82&#160;mV dec&#8211;1, outperforming the commercial Pt/C (0.86&#160;V/94.74&#160;mV dec&#8211;1) and most reported M&#8211;Nx/C (M = Fe, Co, Ni) catalysts. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations uncover the crucial role of S doping in regulating ORR and OER activities. The liquid&#8208;state ZABs with Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3 catalyst as air cathode deliver a large peak power density of 255.84&#160;mW cm&#8211;2 and long&#8208;term cycle durability over 1000 h. Solid&#8208;state ZAB shows stable cycling at various flat/bent/flat states, demonstrating great prospects in flexible electronic device applications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Nucleation and Shaping of Self&#8208;Assembling Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling self&#8208;assembly is fundamentally challenging with implications for next&#8208;generation functional materials. Herein, light&#8208;controlled nucleation and growth is demonstrated for self&#8208;assembling composites according to precise user&#8208;defined designs. Light patterns enable positioning of composites in preassigned locations, sculpting of fine details and contours, and commanding the assembly of lines over millimeters with micrometer precision, hence combining the power of photolithography with self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
Controlling self&#8208;assembly of nanocomposites is a fundamental challenge with exciting implications for next&#8208;generation advanced functional materials. Precursors for composites can be generated photochemically, but limited insight in the underlying processes has hindered precise hands&#8208;on guidance. In this study, light&#8208;controlled nucleation and growth is demonstrated for self&#8208;assembling composites according to precise user&#8208;defined designs. Carbonate is generated photochemically with UV light to steer the precipitation of nanocomposites of barium carbonate nanocrystals and amorphous silica (BaCO3/SiO2). Using a custom&#8208;built optical setup, the self&#8208;assembly process is controlled by optimizing the photogeneration, diffusion, reaction, and precipitation of the carbonate species, using the radius and intensity of the UV&#8208;light irradiated area and reaction temperature. Exploiting this control, nucleation is induced and the contours and individual features of the growing composite are sculpted according to micrometer&#8208;defined light patterns. Moreover, moving light patterns are exploited to create a constant carbonate concentration at the growth front to draw lines of nanocomposites with constant width over millimeters with micrometer precision. Light&#8208;directed generation of local gradients opens previously unimaginable opportunities for guiding self&#8208;assembly into functional materials.

         <title>The Quest for Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;cycling potassium&#8208;ion battery is demonstrated, using a K2MnFe(CN)6 Prussian white cathode, a prepotassiated graphite anode, and a concentrated electrolyte. This full cell delivers a high energy density of 260&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (based on the active mass of cathode and anode) and stable cycling over 1000 cycles.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) have attracted wide interest for energy storage because of the abundance of the electrode materials involved; however, their electrochemical performances are far behind what can be achieved from lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) or sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, key promising electrode and electrolyte materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries are identified, the coupled electrochemical reactions in the cell are investigated, and the compatibility between different materials is demonstrated to play the most important role. K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode can deliver a high capacity of &#8776;125 mAh g&#8722;1 and exceptional cycling stability over 61&#160;000 cycles (&#8776;9 months) if the side reactions from the anode can be prevented. Graphite is a good anode material but is subjected to degradation in traditional carbonate electrolytes. New concentrated electrolytes are developed and evaluated. A stable KIB system is demonstrated by coupling a stable K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode, a prepotassiated graphite anode with a concentrated electrolyte to achieve a high energy density of &#8776;260&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (based on the active mass of cathode and anode) and good cycling of over 1000 cycles.

         <title>High Miscibility Compatible with Ordered Molecular Packing Enables an Excellent Efficiency of 16.2% in All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel small&#8208;molecule donors with thioalkyl chains in the para&#8208; (P&#8208;PhS) and the meta&#8208;position (M&#8208;PhS) are synthesized to regulate surface tension and molecular packing. An optimized morphology with small domains and ordered packing is simultanously obtained in the M&#8208;PhS:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend, promoting a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.2% with excellent (FF&#160;&#215; Jsc) in all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs).








Abstract
In all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs), a high short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc) usually needs a small phase separation, while a high fill factor (FF) is generally realized in a highly ordered packing system. However, small domain and ordered packing always conflicted each other in ASM&#8208;OSCs, leading to a mutually restricted Jsc and FF. In this study, alleviation of the previous dilemma by the strategy of obtaining simultaneous good miscibility and ordered packing through modulating homo&#8208; and heteromolecular interactions is proposed. By moving the alkyl&#8208;thiolation side chains from the para&#8208; to the meta&#8208;position in the small&#8208;molecule donor, the surface tension and molecular planarity are synchronously enhanced, resulting in compatible properties of good miscibility with acceptor BTP&#8208;eC9 and strong self&#8208;assembly ability. As a result, an optimized morphology with multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale domains and highly ordered packing is realized. The device exhibits a long carrier lifetime (39.8 &#956;s) and fast charge collection (15.5&#160;ns). A record efficiency of 16.2% with a high FF of 75.6% and a Jsc of 25.4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in the ASM&#8208;OSCs is obtained. These results demonstrate that the strategy of simultaneously obtaining good miscibility with high crystallinity could be an efficient photovoltaic material design principle for high&#8208;performance ASM&#8208;OSCs.

         <dc:description>
To develop scalable, high&#8208;temperature capacitors, polyimide&#8208;poly(amic acid) copolymer&#8208;based nanocomposites with very low amount of boron nitride nanosheets are designed. The outstanding energy density of &#8776;1.38 J cm&#8722;3 with high efficiency of &gt;96%&#160;is achieved at 150&#160;&#176;C under 200 MV m&#8722;1 (working conditions in hybrid electric vehicles), &#8776;2.5 times higher than the room&#8208;temperature performance of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biaxially oriented polypropylene.








Abstract
The developments of next&#8208;generation electric power systems and electronics demand for high temperature (&#8776;150&#160;&#176;C), high energy density, high efficiency, scalable, and low&#8208;cost polymer&#8208;based dielectric capacitors are still scarce. Here, the nanocomposites based on polyimide&#8208;poly(amic acid) copolymers with a very low amount of boron nitride nanosheets are designed and synthesized. Under the actual working condition in hybrid electric vehicles of 200 MV m&#8722;1 and 150&#160;&#176;C, a high energy density of 1.38 J cm&#8722;3 with an efficiency higher than 96% is achieved. This is about 2.5 times higher than the room temperature energy density (&#8776;0.39 J cm&#8722;3 under 200 MV m&#8722;1) of the commercially used biaxially oriented polypropylene, the benchmark of dielectric polymer. Especially, the energy density and efficiency at 150&#160;&#176;C show no sign of degradation after 20&#160;000 cycles of charge&#8208;discharge test and 35 days&#8217; high&#8208;temperature endurance test. This research provides an effective and low&#8208;cost strategy to develop high&#8208;temperature polymer&#8208;based capacitors.

         <title>In Situ Architecting Endogenous Heterojunction of MoS2 Coupling with Mo2CTx MXenes for Optimized Li+ Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique endogenous hetero&#8208;MXenes of amorphous MoS2 coupling with fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx directly from Mo2Ga2C MAX is constructed in situ. The obtained hetero&#8208;Mo2C shows extraordinary structural stability and optimized Li+ storage mechanism with reversible structural transformation. Moreover, the improved capability of electron and ion transport endows hetero&#8208;Mo2C electrode with superior lithium storage performance, which surpasses all reported Mo2C MXenes electrode materials.








Abstract
Endogenous heterojunction of 2D MXenes with unique structure shows inspiring potential in energy applications, which is impeded by complex synthesis method and finite MAX materials. Herein, an in situ hydrothermal strategy is implemented to successfully synthesize unique endogenous hetero&#8208;MXenes of amorphous MoS2 coupling with fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx (hetero&#8208;Mo2C) directly from Mo2Ga2C MAX. The distinctive morphology and heterojunction structure caused by the introduction of MoS2 endow the hetero&#8208;MXenes with extraordinary structural stability and optimized Li+ storage mechanism with improved charge transport and lithium ion adsorption capabilities. As a result, hetero&#8208;Mo2C exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a high discharge specific capacity of 1242 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 and long cycle stability of 683.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1200 cycling. This work provides new insights into rational design of novel MXenes heterojunctions, practically important for the development of MXenes and their applications in high&#8208;performance energy storage systems.

Abstract
Enzyme immobilization in the confines of microfluidic chips, that promote enzyme activity and stability, has become a powerful strategy to enhance biocatalysis and biomass conversion. Here, based on a newly developed all&#8208;liquid microfluidic chip, fabricated by the interfacial assembly of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) in a biphasic system, a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly strategy to generate polysaccharide multilayers on the surface of a microchannel, greatly enhancing the mechanical properties of the microchannel and offering a biocompatible microenvironment for enzyme immobilization, is presented. Using horseradish peroxidase and glucose oxidase as model enzymes, all&#8208;liquid microfluidic enzymatic and cascade reactors have been constructed and the crucial role of polysaccharide multilayers on enhancing the enzyme loading and catalytic efficiency is demonstrated.

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance Nonfused Wide&#8208;Bandgap Acceptor for Versatile Photovoltaic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new wide&#8208;bandgap nonfused nonfullerene acceptor named GS&#8208;ISO is designed and synthesized. GS&#8208;ISO exhibits a very flat molecular backbone and stable molecular conformation. Based on GS&#8208;ISO, outstanding power conversion efficiencies of over 19% (AM 1.5G, 100&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) for a tandem organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell and over 28% (500&#160;lux, 2700&#160;K LED) for an indoor OPV cell are achieved.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) with nonfused conjugated structures play a critical role in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Here, NFAs named GS&#8208;OEH, GS&#8208;OC6, and GS&#8208;ISO, with optical bandgaps larger than 1.70&#160;eV, are synthesized without using the fused ring structures. Compared with GS&#8208;OEH and GS&#8208;OC6, GS&#8208;ISO exhibits much stronger crystallinity, leading to a smaller energetic disorder and a larger exciton diffusion coefficient. GS&#8208;ISO also possesses a higher electroluminescence external quantum efficiency of 1.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2. The OPV cell based on PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO demonstrates a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.62% under the standard one sun illumination. Besides, the PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO&#8208;based cell with effective area of 1.0&#160;cm2&#160;exhibits a PCE of 28.37% under 2700&#160;K illumination of 500&#160;lux. A tandem OPV cell using PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO as the front subcell shows an outstanding efficiency of 19.10%. Importantly, the GS&#8208;ISO&#8208;based OPV cell exhibits promising stability under the continuous illumination of simulated sunlight. This study indicates that the molecular design strategy demonstrated in this work has great superiority in developing nonfused NFAs and also that GS&#8208;ISO is a promising WBG acceptor for versatile photovoltaic applications.

         <title>Reversible Manipulation of Photoconductivity Caused by Surface Oxygen Vacancies in Perovskite Stannates with Ultraviolet Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8211;matter interaction under different oxygen pressure can reversibly manipulate photoconductivity from surface oxygen vacancies of perovskite stannate semiconductors. Utilizing surface&#8208;selective photochemical reaction combined with the low oxygen&#8208;diffusion coefficient, ultraviolet&#8208;light&#8208;excited electron&#8211;hole pairs of the perovskite compound under low oxygen pressure accelerate the unprecedented formation of spatially&#160;confined and optically&#160;programmable in&#8208;gap states induced by oxygen vacancies at room temperature.








Abstract
Programmable optoelectronic devices call for the reversible control of the photocarrier recombination process by in&#8208;gap states in oxide semiconductors. However, previous approaches to produce oxygen vacancies as a source of in&#8208;gap states in oxide semiconductors have hampered the reversible formation of oxygen vacancies and their related phenomena. Here, a new strategy to manipulate the 2D photoconductivity from perovskite stannates is demonstrated by exploiting spatially&#160;selective photochemical reaction under ultraviolet illumination at room temperature. Remarkably, the ideal trap&#8208;free photocurrent of air&#8208;illuminated BaSnO3 (&#8776;200&#160;pA) is reversibly switched into three orders of magnitude higher photocurrent of vacuum&#8208;illuminated BaSnO3 (&#8776;335&#160;nA) with persistent photoconductivity depending on ambient oxygen pressure under illumination. Multiple characterizations elucidate that ultraviolet illumination of BaSnO3&#160;under low oxygen pressure induces surface oxygen vacancies as a result of surface photolysis combined with the low oxygen&#8208;diffusion coefficient of BaSnO3; the concentrated oxygen vacancies are likely to induce a two&#8208;step transition of photocurrent response by changing the characteristics of in&#8208;gap states from the shallow level to the deep level. These results suggest a novel strategy that uses light&#8211;matter interaction in a reversible and spatially&#160;confined way to manipulate functionalities related to surface defect states, for the emerging applications using newly discovered oxide semiconductors.

         <title>Manipulating Electroluminochromism Behavior of Viologen&#8208;Substituted Iridium(III) Complexes through Ligand Engineering for Information Display and Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of viologen&#8208;substituted iridium(III) complexes is designed to manipulate their electroluminochromism behavior. By attaching pyridiniums to the diimine or cyclometalating ligand and judiciously selecting the co&#8208;ligands, luminescence response to electrical stimuli is achieved in intensity, wavelength, and lifetime, which demonstrates anti&#8208;counterfeiting display through naked&#8208;eye detection, near&#8208;infrared camera, or time&#8208;resolved luminescence.








Abstract
Electrically controlling photoluminescence has attracted great research interest and offers many opportunities for technological developments. Electroluminochromic materials undergo redox reactions under low&#8208;voltage stimuli to achieve reversible luminescence switching. Till now, photoluminescence switching of a single molecule caused by electrical stimuli is restricted to intensity response because the redox&#8208;active moieties are good electron donors or acceptors and electrical stimuli can regulate the photoinduced electron&#8208;transfer and affect the luminescence intensity. In this work, the manipulation of the electroluminochromism behavior of a series of viologen&#8208;substituted iridium(III) complexes through the regulation of ligand orbital energy levels and electronic communication between the viologen pendants and the iridium(III) complex core is reported. Electrochemical redox reactions reversibly modulate either the luminescence quenching effect or the push&#8211;pull electronic effect of the viologen substituents, achieving multicolor &#8220;on&#8211;off&#8221; luminescence response toward electrical stimuli and luminescence manipulation between two emissive states with different wavelengths and lifetimes. To illustrate the promising applications of these electroluminochromic materials, recording and displaying luminescence information under electrical stimuli are demonstrated. Information encryption is realized by letting the electroluminochromism occur in the near&#8208;infrared region or in the time domain. Near&#8208;infrared camera or time&#8208;resolved luminescence analysis can be used to help read the invisible information.

         <title>High&#8208;Performing Self&#8208;Powered Photosensing and Reconfigurable Pyro&#8208;photoelectric Memory with Ferroelectric Hafnium Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hafnium oxide (HfO2)&#8208;based self&#8208;powered, ultrafast (60 &#181;s), and high&#8208;performing (68 &#181;A&#8201;W&#8722;1) infrared pyroelectric sensor is developed. Further, a conceptually new kind of photoreadable memory with controllable suspension and reestablishment of self&#8208;biased pyro&#8208;photocurrent response with a short electric pulse is demonstrated. Using the innovative approach, advanced applications like memory storage, neuromorphic vision sensors, classification, and emergency warning systems are offered.








Abstract
With highly diverse multifunctional properties, hafnium oxide (HfO2) has attracted considerable attention not only because of its potential to address fundamental questions about material behaviors, but also its potential for applied perspectives like ferroelectric memory, transistors, and pyroelectric sensors.&#160;However, effective harvesting of the pyro&#8208;photoelectric effect of HfO2 to develop high&#8208;performing self&#8208;biased photosensors and electric writable and optical readable memory has yet to be developed. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept HfO2&#8208;based self&#8208;powered and ultrafast (response time &#8776; 60 &#181;s) infrared pyroelectric sensor with a responsivity of up to 68 &#181;A&#8201;W&#8722;1 is developed. In particular, temporal infrared light illumination induced surface heating and, in turn, change in spontaneous polarization are attributed to robust pyro&#8208;photocurrent generation. Further, controllable suspension and reestablishment of the self&#8208;biased pyro&#8208;photocurrent response with a short electric pulse are demonstrated, which offers a conceptually new kind of photoreadable memory. Potentially, the novel approach opens a new avenue for designing on&#8208;demand pyro&#8208;phototronic response over a desired area and offers the opportunity to utilize it for various applications, including memory storage, neuromorphic vision sensors, classification, and emergency alert systems.

The MMP&#8208;2&#8208;degradable gelatin&#8208;methacryloyl (GelMA) microspheres (MSs) loading guanidinobenzoic acid&#8208;modified generation 5 polyamidoamine (G5&#8208;GBA)/Smad3&#8208;small interfering RNA (siRNA) nanoparticles (siRNA@MS) were fabricated by microfluidics technique, and then were incorporated into a self&#8208;healing hyaluronan (HA) hydrogel (siRNA@MS@HA) on the polycaprolactone (PCL) electrospun nanofibers to form peritendinous anti&#8208;adhesion membrane. Here it is hypothesized that Smad3&#8208;siRNA nanoparticles would be released from GelMA MSs responded to the elevation of MMP&#8208;2 after tendon injury, thus downregulating the expression of Smad3 and fibroblast proliferation in peritendinous area. Moreover, the hydrogel&#8208;electrospun nanofibers could attenuate inflammation and act as a physical barrier to prevent adhesion tissue invading into the repaired tendon.








Abstract
Antiadhesion barriers such as films and hydrogels used to wrap repaired tendons are important for preventing the formation of adhesion tissue after tendon surgery. However, sliding of the tendon can compress the adjacent hydrogel barrier and cause it to rupture, which may then lead to unexpected inflammation. Here, a self&#8208;healing and deformable hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel is constructed as a peritendinous antiadhesion barrier. Matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP&#8208;2)&#8208;degradable gelatin&#8208;methacryloyl (GelMA) microspheres (MSs) encapsulated with Smad3&#8208;siRNA nanoparticles are entrapped within the HA hydrogel to inhibit fibroblast proliferation and prevent peritendinous adhesion. GelMA MSs are responsively degraded by upregulation of MMP&#8208;2, achieving on&#8208;demand release of siRNA nanoparticles. Silencing effect of Smad3&#8208;siRNA nanoparticles is around 75% toward targeted gene. Furthermore, the self&#8208;healing hydrogel shows relatively attenuated inflammation compared to non&#8208;healing hydrogel. The mean adhesion scores of composite barrier group are 1.67 &#177; 0.51 and 2.17 &#177; 0.75 by macroscopic and histological evaluation, respectively. The proposed self&#8208;healing hydrogel antiadhesion barrier with MMP&#8208;2&#8208;responsive drug release behavior is highly effective for decreasing inflammation and inhibiting tendon adhesion. Therefore, this research provides a new strategy for the development of safe and effective antiadhesion barriers.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Mediated Intracellular Polymerization of AIEgens for Light&#8208;Up Tumor Localization and Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorogen&#8208;peptide conjugates (D2P1) and 3CBT that can undergo in situ polymerization to form aggregates in tumor cells are rationally designed. Upon tumor&#8208;specific cathepsin B enzyme reactions, the peptide cleavage on D2P1 induces covalent polymerization between 3CBT, which triggers aggregation and accumulation of D2P1 into the tumor site, resulting in enhanced fluorescence signal and tumor treatment efficacy.








Abstract
Improving the enrichment of drugs or theranostic agents within tumors is vital to achieve effective cancer diagnosis and therapy with reduced dosage and damage to normal tissues. In this work, an enzyme&#8208;mediated aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorogen (AIEgen) intracellular polymerization strategy that can simultaneously promote the accumulation and retention of the AIEgen in the tumor for prolonged imaging and enhanced tumor growth inhibition is described. An AIEgen&#8208;peptide conjugate (D2P1) and cyanobenzothiazole&#8208;cysteine (3CBT) that can undergo rapid condensation reaction to form nanoaggregates in tumor cells are rationally designed. Upon tumor&#8208;specific cathepsin protease reaction, the cleavage of peptides induces condensate polymerization between the exposed cysteine and 2&#8208;cyanobenzothiazole on 3CBT, triggering accumulation of D2P1 into the tumor site, leading to fluorescence light&#8208;up. Such enzyme&#8208;mediated polymerization of D2P1 and 3CBT alters cellular motility via disrupting actin organization and in turn inhibiting cell proliferation. In addition, due to the built&#8208;in intrinsic photosensitization property of the AIEgen, the accumulation of D2P1 can remarkably promote the tumor photodynamic therapy effect in vivo under light irradiation. This study thus represents the enzyme&#8208;mediated intracellular polymerization system with high potential to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes of tumors in vivo.

         <title>Highly Efficient Blue Phosphorescence from Pillar&#8208;Layer MOFs by Ligand Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient (QYphos.&#160;= 80.6%), long&#8208;lived (169.7&#160;ms) blue phosphorescence has been achieved in pillar&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks based on the isolation and lock of ligand chromophores. The potential applications of these phosphors in 3D printing, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and fingerprint visualization have been demonstrated owing to the excellent chemical and mechanical stability.








Abstract
Room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) has been extensively researched in heavy&#8208;metal containing complexes and purely organic systems. Despite the rapid blossom of RTP materials, it is still a tremendous challenge to develop highly efficient blue RTP materials with long&#8208;lived lifetimes. Taking the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as a model, herein, a feasible strategy of ligand functionalization is proposed, including two essential elements, to develop blue phosphorescence materials with high efficiency and long&#8208;lived lifetimes simultaneously under ambient conditions. One is isolation of the chromophores with assistance of another predefined co&#8208;ligands, the other is restriction of the chromophores&#8217; motions through coordination and host&#8208;guest interactions. Remarkably, it renders the MOFs with highly efficient blue phosphorescence up to 80.6% and a lifetime of 169.7&#160;ms under ambient conditions. Moreover, a demo of the crown is fabricated with MOFs ink by 3D printing technique. The potential applications for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and fingerprint visualization have been also demonstrated. This finding not only outlines a universal principle to design and synthesize highly efficient RTP materials, but also endows traditional MOFs with fresh vitality for potential applications.

         <title>Tailored Double Emulsions Made Simple</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple method is developed to produce double emulsions of a single core and a thin shell at a milliliter per minute production rate, requiring minimal instrumentation, cost, and expertise. This two&#8208;step emulsification technique offers control of shell thickness, diversity of liquid formulations, integration with microfluidic devices, and potential to scale&#8208;up.








Abstract
Double emulsions, such as water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water droplets, are important material platforms for conducting fundamental research and for technological applications. To date, well&#8208;defined double&#8208;emulsion droplets consisting of a single water core and a thin oil shell can be exclusively formed with sophisticated microfluidic devices. The fabrication, preparation, and operation of such devices is challenging, which reduces the availability of tailored double emulsions to a limited community of experts. Here, a simple method is introduced to produce single&#8208;core double emulsions with high yield in large quantities, using a vortex mixer. Utilizing the density difference between the dispersed droplet and the continuous phase, this two&#8208;step emulsification method can achieve very small core droplet diameters below 10 &#956;m and ultrathin shells with thicknesses below 1 &#956;m. A detailed picture of the formation mechanism is provided and it is demonstrated that the process can be extended to produce multishell and multicore emulsions. Finally, its application is demonstrated to produce structurally colored colloidal supraparticles with unprecedented uniformity and yield. The method allows the creation of tailored double emulsions with minimal time, cost, effort, and expertise, and may widen its application to nonspecialized scientific communities.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Assisted 4D Programming and Reprogramming of Liquid Crystalline Organogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An entropic approach is reported to program and reprogram the molecular ordering in liquid crystalline organogels via directed solvent evaporation. A wide variety of active origami/kirigami structures and 4D shape morphing of 3D printed LCNs with unattainable spatial and temporal control can be readily reached without meticulous alignment during network formation.








Abstract
Encoding molecular ordering during liquid crystalline network (LCN) formation endows preprogrammed but fixed shape morphing in response to external stimuli. The incorporation of dynamic covalent bonds enables shape reprogramming but also permanently alters the network structures. Here, an entropic approach that can program complex shapes via directed solvent evaporation from an isotropic LCN organogel is discoursed. Different shapes can be erased and reprogrammed from the same LCN on demand depending on the modes of deformation of the organogel during solvent evaporation. The ability to decouple network synthesis and molecular alignment relaxes the requirements to LCN chemistry and alignment methods, allowing for the realization of a variety of origami/kirigami structures and 4D shape morphing of LCNs printed from the digital light processing technique with unattainable spatial and temporal controls.

         <title>Strong Metal Phosphide&#8211;Phosphate Support Interaction for Enhanced Non&#8208;Noble Metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong metal support interaction (SMSI) is crucial for heterogeneous catalysis but limited by reducible oxide supports and the activity and stability contradiction. A new strong metal phosphide&#8211;phosphate support interaction (SMPSI) induced by P activation is reported for the non&#8208;noble metal catalyst with superior hydrogenation activity, stability, anti&#8208;oxidant and anti&#8208;acid capacity.








Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is crucial for supported catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. Here is the first report on strong metal phosphide&#8208;phosphate support interaction (SMPSI). The key to SMPSI is the activation of P species on the support, which leads to simultaneous generation of metal phosphide nanoparticles (NPs) and core&#8211;shell nanostructures formed by support migration onto the NPs. The encapsulation state of metal phosphide and charge transfer are identical to those of classical SMSIs and can be optimally regulated. Furthermore, the strong interactions of Co2PL/MnP&#8208;3 not only significantly enhance the anti&#8208;oxidation and anti&#8208;acid capability of non&#8208;noble metal but also exhibit excellent catalytic activity and stability toward hydrogenating a wide range of compounds into value&#8208;added fine chemicals with 100% selectivity, which is even better than Pd/C and Pt/C. The SMPSI construction can be generally extended to other systems such as Ni2PL/Mn3(PO4)2, Co2PL/LaPO4, and CoPL/CePO4. This study provides a new approach for the rational design of advanced non&#8208;noble metal catalysts and introduce a novel paradigm for the strong interaction between NPs and support.

         <title>Toward Perfect Optical Diffusers: Dielectric Huygens&#8217; Metasurfaces with Critical Positional Disorder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metasurfaces based on disordered arrangements of silicon nanoresonators are used to implement wavelength&#8208;selective optical diffusers with nearly Lambertian scattering profiles and a high tolerance for incidence angles and polarizations. Their working principles and scattering performances are discussed on the basis of exhaustive experimental and numerical studies. Such diffusers open new opportunities in applications like fluorescence microscopy, augmented reality displays, or wavefront&#8208;shaping.








Abstract
Conventional optical diffusers, such as thick volume scatterers (Rayleigh scattering) or microstructured surface scatterers (geometric scattering), lack the potential for on&#8208;chip integration and are thus incompatible with next&#8208;generation photonic devices. Dielectric Huygens&#8217; metasurfaces, on the other hand, consist of 2D arrangements of resonant dielectric nanoparticles and therefore constitute a promising material platform for ultrathin and highly efficient photonic devices. When the nanoparticles are arranged in a random but statistically specific fashion, diffusers with exceptional properties are expected to come within reach. This work explores how dielectric Huygens&#8217; metasurfaces can implement wavelength&#8208;selective diffusers with negligible absorption losses and nearly Lambertian scattering profiles that are largely independent of the angle and polarization of incident waves. The combination of tailored positional disorder with a carefully balanced electric and magnetic response of the nanoparticles is shown to be an integral requirement for the operation as a diffuser. The proposed metasurfaces&#8217; directional scattering performance is characterized both experimentally and numerically, and their usability in wavefront&#8208;shaping applications is highlighted. Since the metasurfaces operate on the principles of Mie scattering and are embedded in a glassy environment, they may easily be incorporated in integrated photonic devices, fiber optics, or mechanically robust augmented reality displays.

         <title>Cell Sheet&#8208;Like Soft Nanoreactor Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
3&#160;nm&#8208;thick soft polystyrene&#8208;encased nanoframe (PEN) reactor arrays are designed to confine and guide the inward crystallization of nanocrystals. Such cell&#8208;like soft nanoreactor sheets change the reaction kinetics and offer a general platform to synthesize a set of mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and trimetallic, and even semiconductor nanocrystals with tunable interior structures that are difficult to achieve using traditional bulk solution&#8208;based systems.








Abstract
Tissues, which consist of groups of closely packed cell arrays, are essentially sheet&#8208;like biosynthesis plants. In tissues, individual cells are discrete microreactors working under highly viscous and confined environments. Herein, soft polystyrene&#8208;encased nanoframe (PEN) reactor arrays, as analogous nanoscale &#8220;sheet&#8208;like chemosynthesis plants&#8221;, for the controlled synthesis of novel nanocrystals, are reported. Although the soft polystyrene (PS) is only 3&#160;nm thick, it is elastic, robust, and permeable to aqueous solutes, while significantly slowing down their diffusion. PEN&#8208;associated palladium (Pd) crystallization follows a diffusion&#8208;controlled zero&#8208;order kinetics rather than a reaction&#8208;controlled first&#8208;order kinetics in bulk solution. Each individual PEN reactor has a volume in the zeptoliter range, which offers a unique confined environment, enabling a directional inward crystallization, in contrast to the conventional outward nucleation/growth that occurs in an unconfined bulk solution. This strategy makes it possible to generate a set of mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and trimetallic, and even semiconductor nanocrystals with tunable interior structures, which are difficult to achieve with normal systems based on bulk solutions.

         <title>Electronically and Geometrically Modified Single&#8208;Atom Fe Sites by Adjacent Fe Nanoparticles for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlations between electronic and geometric structures of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites and their oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance are investigated by varying the secondary heat&#8208;treatment of a NC&#8208;supported Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst. The adjacent Fe nanoparticles can regulate the electronic and geometric structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites, reducing energy barriers of the rate&#8208;limiting steps of ORR, resulting in outstanding ORR performance.








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C materials exhibit excellent activity and stability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), as one of the most promising candidates to replace commercial Pt/C catalysts. However, it is challenging to unravel features of the superior ORR activity originating from Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C materials. In this work, the electronic and geometric structures of the isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites and their correlations with the ORR performance are investigated by varying the secondary thermal activation temperature of a rationally designed NC&#8208;supported Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC). The systematic analyses demonstrate the significant role of coordinated atoms of SA and metallic Fe nanoparticles (NPs) in altering the electronic structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites. Meanwhile, strong interaction between isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites and adjacent Fe NPs can change the geometric structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites. Theoretical calculations reveal that optimal regulation of the electronic and geometric structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites by the co&#8208;existence of Fe NPs narrows the energy barriers of the rate&#8208;limiting steps of ORR, resulting in outstanding ORR performance. This work not only provides the fundamental understanding of the underlying structure&#8211;activity relationship, but also sheds light on designing efficient Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts.

         <title>Brain&#8208;Targeted Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Nanoparticles with Near&#8208;Infrared Imaging at 1550&#160;nm Boosts Orthotopic Glioblastoma Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II)&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) of nanofluorophores is a promising approach for theranostic of orthotopic glioma. Brain&#8208;targeting nanofluorophores featuring novel molecular design of &#8220;backbone distortion + molecular rotor&#8221; are prepared. They can balance the photon energy flow to achieve advanced NIR&#8208;II imaging at 1550&#160;nm and photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat ratio for PTT in orthotopic&#8208;glioma&#8208;bearing mice.








Abstract
A remaining challenge in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is surmounting the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB). Such a challenge prevents the development of efficient theranostic approaches that combine reliable diagnosis with targeted therapy. In this study, brain&#8208;targeted near&#8208;infrared IIb (NIR&#8208;IIb) aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (AIE) nanoparticles are developed via rational design, which involves twisting the planar molecular backbone with steric hindrance. The resulting nanoparticles can balance competing responsiveness demands for radiation&#8208;mediated NIR fluorescence imaging at 1550&#160;nm and non&#8208;radiation NIR photothermal therapy (NIR&#8208;PTT). The brain&#8208;targeting peptide apolipoprotein E peptide (ApoE) is grafted onto these nanoparticles (termed as ApoE&#8208;Ph NPs) to target glioma and promote efficient BBB traversal. A long imaging wavelength 1550&#160;nm band&#8208;pass filter is utilized to monitor the in vivo biodistribution and accumulation of the nanoparticles in a model of orthotopic glioma, which overcomes previous limitations in wavelength range and equipment. The results demonstrate that the ApoE&#8208;Ph NPs have a higher PTT efficiency and significantly enhanced survival of mice bearing orthotopic GBM with moderate irradiation (0.5&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2). Collectively, the work highlights the smart design of a brain&#8208;targeted NIR&#8208;II AIE theranostic approach that opens new diagnosis and treatment options in the photonic therapy of GBM.

Hetero&#8208;MXenes
Endogenous heterojunction of 2D MXenes with unique structure shows inspiring potential in energy applications. In article number 2108809, Li Song and co&#8208;workers successfully synthesize unique endogenous hetero&#8208;MXenes of amorphous MoS2 coupling with fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx directly from Mo2Ga2C MAX via an optimal in situ hydrothermal strategy. The distinctive morphology and heterojunction structure endow the hetero&#8208;MXenes with extraordinary structural stability and an optimized Li+&#8208;storage mechanism, with improved charge transport and Li+&#8208;adsorption capabilities.

Interfacial Atomic Configurations
In article number 2106814, Kaihui Liu, Xin&#8208;Zheng Li, Xinqiang Wang, and co&#8208;workers profile a novel perspective of the lattice arrangement (polarity) manipulation of a quasi&#8208;van der Waals epitaxial hexagonal III&#8208;nitride film on graphene by interfacial atomic configuration engineering. Through using atomic O preirradiation and a specific supply sequence of Ga and N atoms to form the C&#8211;O&#8211;N&#8211;Ga(3) and C&#8211;O&#8211;Ga&#8211;N(3) configurations, N&#8208; and Ga&#8208;lattice polarity GaN films are achieved on transferred graphene, respectively.

2D Photoconductivity
Light&#8211;matter interaction under different oxygen pressures can reversibly manipulate photoconductivity from surface oxygen vacancies of perovskite stannate semiconductors. In article number 2107650, utilizing a surface&#8208;selective photochemical reaction, Junwoo Son and co&#8208;workers report that ultraviolet&#8208;excited electron&#8211;hole pairs of a perovskite compound under low oxygen pressure accelerate the unprecedented formation of spatially confined and optically programmable in&#8208;gap states induced by oxygen vacancies at room temperature.

Tissue Adhesives
In article number 2105338, Donghee Son, Changhyun Pang, and co&#8208;workers report an electrostatic&#8211;mechanical synergistic multiscale tissue adhesive for sustainable residue&#8208;free bioelectronics interfaces. To deduce the mechanism, a thermodynamic model based on a tailored elastomer&#8211;hydrogel combinatory adhesive architecture is proposed. This patch also successfully demonstrates reliable real&#8208;time measurements of electrophysiological signals generated by various tissues ranging from rodent sciatic nerve, muscle, brain, and human skin.

         <title>Advanced Multifunctional Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries Design: From Materials and Devices to Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional aqueous rechargeable batteries (MARBs) can provide additional functions to realize unprecedented applications where conventional batteries normally fail. This review describes the recent advances of MARBs in terms of materials engineering, device design, system integration, and applications. The challenges and opportunities for further developments in the emerging field of MARBs are deeply discussed.








Abstract
Multifunctional aqueous rechargeable batteries (MARBs) are regarded as safe, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable electrochemical energy storage devices, which offer additional functionalities that conventional batteries cannot achieve, which ideally leads to unprecedented applications. Although MARBs are among the most exciting and rapidly growing topics in scientific research and industrial development nowadays, a systematic summary of the evolution and advances in the field of MARBs is still not available. Therefore, the review presented comprehensively and systematically summarizes the design principles and the recent advances of MARBs by categories of smart ARBs and integrated systems, together with an analysis of their device design and configuration, electrochemical performance, and diverse smart functions. The two most promising strategies to construct novel MARBs may be A) the introduction of functional materials into ARB components, and B) integration of ARBs with other functional devices. The ongoing challenges and future perspectives in this research and development field are outlined to foster the future development of MARBs. Finally, the most important upcoming research directions in this rapidly developing field are highlighted that may be most promising to lead to the commercialization of MARBs and to a further broadening of their range of applications.

Anisotropy is the characteristic of a material to exhibit variations in its mechanical, electrical, thermal, optical properties, etc. along different directions. Anisotropic materials have attracted great research interest because of their wide applications in aerospace, sensing, soft robotics, and tissue engineering. 3D printing provides exceptional advantages in achieving controlled compositions and complex architecture, thereby enabling the manufacture of 3D objects with anisotropic functionalities. Here, a comprehensive review of the recent progress on 3D printing of anisotropic polymer materials based on different techniques including material extrusion, vat photopolymerization, powder bed fusion, and sheet lamination is presented. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies implemented in manipulating anisotropic structures are highlighted with the discussion of material categories, functionalities, and potential applications. This review is concluded with analyzing the current challenges and providing perspectives for further development in this field.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Supported Atomically Dispersed Metals as Bifunctional Catalysts for Next&#8208;Generation Batteries Based on Conversion Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review analyzes the key factors that hinder the reversible conversion of conversion&#8208;type materials, provides a fundamental understanding of graphene&#8208;, or graphene&#8208;like carbon&#8208;supported atomically dispersed metal catalysts (G&#8208;ADMCs), and provides guidance on the bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs to be used in high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation batteries, including aqueous metal&#8211;air batteries, nonaqueous alkali metal&#8208;O2 and &#8208;CO2 batteries, alkali metal&#8208;chalcogen batteries, and alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation batteries based on conversion reactions, including aqueous metal&#8211;air batteries, nonaqueous alkali metal&#8208;O2 and &#8208;CO2 batteries, alkali metal&#8208;chalcogen batteries, and alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries have attracted great interest. However, their use is restricted by inefficient reversible conversion of active agents. Developing bifunctional catalysts to accelerate the conversion reaction kinetics in both discharge and charge processes is urgently needed. Graphene&#8208;, or graphene&#8208;like carbon&#8208;supported atomically dispersed metal catalysts (G&#8208;ADMCs) have been demonstrated to show excellent activity in various electrocatalytic reactions, making them promising candidates. Different from G&#8208;ADMCs for catalysis, which only require high activity in one direction, G&#8208;ADMCs for rechargeable batteries should provide high activity in both discharging and charging. This review provides guidance for the design and fabrication of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries based on conversion reactions. The key challenges that prevent their reversible conversion, the origin of the activity of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs, and the current design principles of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs for highly reversible conversion, have been analyzed and highlighted for each conversion&#8208;type battery. Finally, a summary and outlook on the development of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMC materials for next&#8208;generation batteries with a high energy density and excellent energy efficiency are given.

Graphene-, or graphene-like carbon-supported atomically dispersed metal catalysts (G-ADMCs) have been demonstrated to show excellent activity in various electrocatalytic reactions, making them promising candidates. Different from G-ADMCs for catalysis, which only require high activity in one direction, G-ADMCs for rechargeable batteries should provide high activity in both discharging and charging. This review provides guidance for the design and fabrication of bifunctional G-ADMCs for next-generation rechargeable batteries based on conversion reactions. The key challenges that prevent their reversible conversion, the origin of the activity of bifunctional G-ADMCs, and the current design principles of bifunctional G-ADMCs for highly reversible conversion, have been analyzed and highlighted for each conversion-type battery. Finally, a summary and outlook on the development of bifunctional G-ADMC materials for next-generation batteries with a high energy density and excellent energy efficiency are given.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
