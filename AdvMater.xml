         <title>Flexible Multiband Photonic Synapses for Nociceptive Perception and Neuromorphic Computation via Fluorinated InP Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully solution&#8208;processed and self&#8208;supporting flexible transparent photonic synaptic transistor based on eco&#8208;friendly InP&#8208;based QDs modified with novel fluorinated thiol ligands is presented. These devices exhibit an ultralow energy consumption of 0.016 fJ per operation. Moreover, they are capable of emulating prioritized information processing in the brain, simulating corneal damage under weak ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, and performing target recognition tasks. This work highlights new insights into designing high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;power visual perception systems.








ABSTRACT
Organic photonic synaptic transistors (OPSTs), emulating biological synaptic behaviors under optical stimulation, serve as essential hardware components for neuromorphic visual systems. To satisfy various demands, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OPSTs typically require multispectral responsiveness that is often pursued by leveraging the excellent optoelectronic properties and solution&#8208;processability of quantum dots (QDs). However, this strategy suffers from complex fabrication procedures, limited mechanical flexibility and toxic cadmium/lead compositions in QDs, which raise serious environmental and biosafety concerns. In this work, we demonstrate a fully solution&#8208;processed and self&#8208;supporting flexible OPST based on environmentally benign indium phosphide (InP) QDs. Through ligand exchange with fluorinated thiols, the QDs demonstrate improved photostability and enhanced energy level alignment with organic semiconductors. Furthermore, the interfacial dipole induced by fluorinated ligands enables long&#8208;term charge retention. The resulting QD&#8208;OPST devices exhibit broadband excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) responses, tunable synaptic plasticity, remarkable mechanical durability and ultralow energy consumption of 0.016 fJ, effectively mimicking cornea&#8208;like nociceptor behaviors. In addition, the QD&#8208;OPSTs display pronounced color selectivity, enabling blue&#8208;feature recognition while suppressing red&#8208;green background noise. This study provides a feasible strategy for developing high&#8208;performance, eco&#8208;friendly, and flexible photonic synapse devices, highlighting great potential for applications in visual perception and brain&#8208;inspired computing.

         <title>Guanidyl&#8208;Engineered SAMs with Electrostatic&#8211;Coordination Synergy for High&#8208;Efficiency Tandem&#8208;Compatible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A guanidyl&#8208;engineered SAM strategy is developed to establish electrostatic&#8211;coordination synergy, effectively suppressing SAM aggregation, optimizing energy&#8208;level alignment, and passivating buried interface defects. This approach enables record efficiencies in wide&#8208;bandgap single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells and laminated perovskite/silicon tandems, with exceptional operational stability. By resolving key interfacial challenges, this work offers a practical route toward scalable, durable, and high&#8208;efficiency tandem photovoltaics for sustainable energy applications.








ABSTRACT
Wide&#8208;bandgap inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant interest owing to their excellent stability feature and unique compatibility with tandem device architectures. However, two major challenges remain: the inhomogeneity of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) and the insufficient passivation of buried interface defects. In this study, we introduce polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride (PHMG) as an additive to 4&#8208;(7H&#8208;dibenzo[c,g]carbazole&#8208;7&#8208;yl) phosphonic acid (4PADCB) SAMs, wherein guanidyl groups in PHMG establish electrostatic&#8211;coordination synergy with 4PADCB and perovskite species, respectively. The electrostatic interaction suppresses SAM aggregation, reduces interfacial defects, and optimizes energy&#8208;level alignment at the SAM/perovskite interface, while the coordination effect promotes perovskite crystallization, enlarges grains, reduces defect densities, and relaxes interface stress. Consequently, the optimized 1.68&#160;eV&#8208;bandgap PSC delivers a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.62%, representing the highest value reported to date, with over 95% efficiency retention after 1300&#160;h of thermal aging at 85&#176;C in N2. Furthermore, these PSCs are integrated into perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, achieving a record PCE of 32.49% for a laminated tandem device and the superior values of 32.25% (with an active area of 1 cm2) and 29.34% (with an active area of 20 cm2) for monolithic tandem devices.

         <title>Proximity&#8208;Driven Non&#8208;Volatile Spin and Valley Control in a Van Der Waals Antiferromagnetic Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates non&#8208;volatile spin and valley control in a van der Waals heterostructure of monolayer MoSe2 and bulk antiferromagnetic CrPS4, via interfacial spin&#8208;polarized charge transfer. Persistent chiral photoluminescence and hysteresis are achieved at a switching field 17 times lower than the bulk spin&#8208;flip field of CrPS4, enabling low&#8208;energy, magnetically tunable quantum devices.








ABSTRACT
The integration of non&#8208;volatile spin and valley control in 2D quantum systems remains a pivotal challenge for spintronic and valleytronic functionalities. Here, we demonstrate persistent spin and valley polarizations in a van der Waals heterostructure comprising bulk antiferromagnetic CrPS4 and monolayer MoSe2, achieved via interfacial magnetic proximity effects. The 1L&#8208;MoSe2/bulk&#8208;CrPS4 heterostructure exhibits non&#8208;volatile hysteresis in chiral photoluminescence (PL), directly linked to the antiferromagnetic ordering of bulk&#8208;CrPS4. This helicity of PL persists at zero field, enabled by the spin&#8208;polarized charge transfer from the K valley in the MoSe2 monolayer to the conduction band of CrPS4, breaking the valley degeneracy without external stimuli. Remarkably, the PL helicity switches surprisingly at a magnetic field of &#8764; 0.5 T, a 17&#8208;fold smaller than the spin&#8208;flip field of &#8764;8.5 T in bulk CrPS4. Our work establishes bulk antiferromagnet&#8208;based heterostructure as a robust platform for low&#8208;energy, magnetically tunable quantum devices, bridging the gap between the transient valleytronic phenomena and practical non&#8208;volatile applications.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable All&#8208;Weather Moisture Power Generation via Asymmetric Structured Color Photothermal Evaporation&#8208;Induced Cotton Fabrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photothermal evaporation&#8208;driven moisture power generator (PEMG) constructs an asymmetric photothermal gradient to harvest moisture energy by forming a PDA&#8208;structured colored film on fabric. This structure prevents moisture adsorption saturation and excessive evaporation, thereby maintaining a stable humidity gradient. The PEMG enables continuous power generation in all&#8208;weather, providing stable electricity for wearable electronic devices.








ABSTRACT
Harvesting electrical energy from the ubiquitous water cycle to power flexible electronic devices is receiving increasing attention. However, the development of moisture&#8208;driven generators with high and stable power output remains a significant challenge. Here, we design a photothermal evaporation&#8208;driven moisture generator (PEMG) that modifies a cotton fabric with in situ polymerized pyrrole by a polydopamine (PDA)&#8208;structured color film to form an asymmetric photothermal temperature gradient. The PDA asymmetric photothermal layer not only effectively addresses the issue of insufficient sustained power generation caused by water adsorption saturation but also mitigates the unstable moisture gradient resulting from excessive water evaporation. CF@PPy@PDA (purple) achieved an open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.74&#160;V and a short&#8208;circuit current (Isc) of 0.72&#160;mA under 60% relative humidity (RH) and 1&#8208;sun illumination, respectively. White LED bulbs emit a steady stream of light for more than 24 h. Moreover, the Voc of the PEMG (six units in series) reaches 1.18&#160;V at an average solar intensity of 1000&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 and 43% RH, while the Voc is 0.72&#160;V at night (52% RH). Meanwhile, wearable systems designed with integrated PEMG units provide sufficient power supply for electronic devices under natural conditions.

         <title>Precision&#8208;Engineered Electronic Modulation of Ruthenium Clusters and Single Atoms on Vacancy&#8208;Rich &#945;&#8208;MoC1&#8208;x Enables Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>

         <dc:description>
The different local interfacial charge polarizations of Ru clusters and Ru single atoms incorporated with &#945;&#8208;MoC1&#8208;x/C lead to exceptional electrocatalytic performances for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. DFT calculations combined with in situ characterizations reveal that the dual excitation of Ru individual atoms and &#945;&#8208;MoC1&#8208;x weakens the binding strength of H* to Ru clusters, thereby optimizing the adsorption/desorption energy of intermediates and accelerating reaction dynamics of HER.








ABSTRACT
Maximizing the utilization of active metals while maintaining efficient catalytic activity is of great importance for electrocatalytic alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, we report a facile pyrolysis strategy to anchor Ru clusters and adjacent Ru single atoms on &#945;&#8208;MoC1&#8208;x coated carbon nanospheres (termed as RuCS/SA/&#945;&#8208;MoC1&#8208;x/C). Theoretical calculations combined with in situ characterizations reveal that an electron&#8208;bridging mechanism whereby Ru single atoms donate electrons to the defective &#945;&#8208;MoC1&#8208;x, which subsequently transfers electron to Ru clusters, enabling a cooperative modulation of the electronic structure across different types of Ru sites. Therefore, the dual excitation of Ru single atoms and &#945;&#8208;MoC1&#8208;x weakens the binding strength between Ru clusters and H*, accelerates the desorption of H2. The as&#8208;obtained 3%&#8208;RuCS/SA/&#945;&#8208;MoC1&#8208;x/C sample attains an excellent overpotential of 9&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 along with a mass activity of 20.38 A mg&#8722;1Ru (&#8208;100&#160;mV) and a turnover frequency of 1.71 H2 s&#8722;1 at 25&#160;mV, which is larger than those of 20% Pt/C. Moreover, Both the anion exchange membrane water electrolysis cells and Zn&#8211;H2O batteries employing 3%&#8208;RuCS/SA/&#945;&#8208;MoC1&#8208;x/C as the cathode electrocatalyst exhibit exceptional performance.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Exciplex White OLEDs for Natural&#8208;Quality Lighting and Optical Data Transmission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;exciplex backbone formed within a single neat PPCzTrz layer, combined with three ultrathin phosphorescent emitters, enables nondoped white OLEDs with natural&#8208;light&#8208;quality emission (CRI = 97, EQEmax = 27%) that also function as visible light communication transmitters.








ABSTRACT
The integration of high&#8208;quality organic solid&#8208;state lighting with high&#8208;speed optical wireless communication offers an innovative pathway toward next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices. Here, we report a structurally simplified white organic light&#8208;emitting diode (WOLED) that achieves seamless integration of natural&#8208;light&#8208;quality illumination and visible light communication (VLC) using a unique dual&#8208;exciplex architecture. Central to this design is a versatile organic layer of PPCzTrz that serves as both an electron donor and acceptor at two distinct interfaces, establishing complementary charge&#8208;transport pathways and a voltage&#8208;controlled dynamic shift of the exciton recombination zone. This spatial redistribution balances blue and green exciplex emissions, while F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) sequentially funnels energy to strategically positioned green, orange, and red phosphorescent ultrathin layers. The resulting multi&#8208;path exciton management strategy ensures spectrally stable white light from 400 to 700&#160;nm, yielding a record&#8208;high color rendering index (CRI = 97), a peak external quantum efficiency of 27.0%, and a power efficiency of 85.8&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1. The same device enables high&#8208;speed VLC with a data rate of 14.0&#160;Mbps. This work provides a scalable and energy&#8208;efficient platform that simultaneously addresses the needs of high&#8208;quality lighting and optical data transmission, paving the way for smart lighting systems and fully organic integrated optoelectronics.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Nanoarchitectonics of Fluorescent Transparent Materials via Co&#8208;Assembling Non&#8208;Aromatic Amino Acids and Tetrafluorophthalic Acid for Adhesion, Coating, and Information Encryption Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
Employing a non&#8208;covalent strategy, non&#8208;aromatic amino acids co&#8208;assemble with tetrafluorophthalic acid to form fluorescent bulk glasses. Amino acid glasses display high fluorescence quantum yields and large Stokes shifts. Their fluorescence performance is maintained even under various harsh conditions, including low temperatures, exposure to organic solvents, and coating with porous materials.








ABSTRACT
Realizing fluorescence emission from non&#8208;aromatic amino acids is a difficult challenge in the development of optical materials in the absence of polymeric backbones and covalent cross&#8208;linkers. Herein, a non&#8208;covalent approach is used to fabricate a series of bulk glasses exhibiting strong fluorescence from non&#8208;aromatic amino acids (&#671;&#8208;arginine, &#671;&#8208;lysine, &#671;&#8208;proline, and &#671;&#8208;histidine) by co&#8208;assembling them with tetrafluorophthalic acid (FA). FA, amino acids, and non&#8208;covalent bonding between them play essential roles in both glass formation and fluorescent properties. The high viscosity and rapid annealing process of the glass formation process effectively prevent the crystallization and packing of FA and amino acids, slow the free internal rotations of the amino acids, and reduce the intermolecular collisions, thus increasing the fluorescence emissions of glasses. FA&#8208;amino acids glasses display high fluorescence quantum yields (&gt; 44%) and large Stokes shifts. Their fluorescence performance is maintained even under various harsh conditions, including low temperatures, exposure to organic solvents, and coating with porous materials. Based on their robust anti&#8208;freezing adhesion capacity (4.77 MPa at &#8722;40&#176;C, 3.30 MPa at &#8722;196&#176;C) and long&#8208;term stable solid&#8208;state luminescence characteristics, these materials show great potential as fluorescent coatings and labeling agents suitable for use at low temperatures.

         <title>Balancing Performance and Device Complexity in Single&#8208;Point Miniaturized Spectrometers via Multi&#8208;Peak Modulation Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bias&#8208;driven multi&#8208;peak modulation strategy is introduced to fundamentally improve single&#8208;point spectrometers by mitigating the ill&#8208;posed inverse problem through low&#8208;correlation response functions. Leveraging an asymmetric back&#8208;to&#8208;back organic architecture, the device yields stable and tunable spectral signatures within a structurally simple two&#8208;terminal platform, enabling compact and energy&#8208;efficient spectral sensing and imaging.








ABSTRACT
Balancing resolution, complexity, bandwidth, power, and scalability is essential for advancing single&#8208;point miniaturized spectrometers from lab prototypes to practical portable and integrated photonic systems. In this paper, we present a high&#8208;performance two&#8208;terminal asymmetric back&#8208;to&#8208;back organic spectrometer (BTBOS) that utilizes a bias&#8208;controlled multi&#8208;peak modulation strategy to mitigate the ill&#8208;posed inverse problem common in single&#8208;point architectures. The device achieves a 1&#160;nm spectral resolution across the broad 300&#8211;1000&#160;nm range, with a &#8764;0.25&#160;nm peak error and &lt;2% spectral crosstalk, using only a low driving voltage of 0.6&#160;V. The device further features a structurally simple design along with remarkable stability and reproducibility. In addition, we demonstrate its practical applicability in spectral imaging. This scalable and energy&#8208;efficient approach paves the way for practical and commercial use of miniaturized spectrometers in wearable and on&#8208;chip optical systems.

Combining STM measurements and ab&#8208;initio calculations, we show that zig&#8208;zag edges in graphene nanoislands grown on Ni(111) by CVD retrieve their spin&#8208;polarized edge states after intercalation of a few monolayers of Au.








ABSTRACT
Spin&#8208;split states localized on zigzag edges have been predicted for different free&#8208;standing graphene nanostructures. However, the stability of the edge magnetism can be severely compromised by interfacial interactions when supported on metallic substrates. This imposes a serious challenge for the surface&#8208;assisted synthesis and characterization of magnetic graphene nanostructures, and their application in metal supports. In this work we demonstrate that graphene nanoislands with well&#8208;defined zigzag edges, synthesized by ultra&#8208;high vacuum chemical vapour deposition, can retrieve their spin&#8208;split edge states by minimizing interfacial interactions through metal intercalation. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy we detect edge states with subnanometer spatial localization and 1.2 eV energy splitting, comparable to the spin&#8208;polarized states predicted by ab&#8208;initio calculations. The fabrication of magnetic nanographenes by CVD opens a new avenue for the fabrication of 2D nanostructures that cannot be achieved by on&#8208;surface synthesis, and enables the implementation of demonstrated processes for scaling up&#160;synthesis.

         <title>Redirecting Tryptophan Metabolism Through Host&#8208;Microbial Crosstalk to Enhance Precise Bioorthogonal Chemoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides a synergistic strategy for enhancing bioorthogonal chemoimmunotherapy through precise prodrug activation and probiotic&#8208;mediated metabolic reprogramming by host&#8208;microbial crosstalk. The nanosystem utilizes the IDO inhibitor NLG919 and Lactobacillus reuteri to reverse tryptophan metabolism from the immunosuppressive pathway to the immunostimulatory pathway, thereby restoring the function of CD8+ T cells and maximizing the efficiency of immunotherapy.








ABSTRACT
Bioorthogonal chemistry offers a promising approach for advancing chemoimmunotherapy, yet two critical challenges remain: (1) achieving deep tumor penetration of catalysts while ensuring precise tumor&#8208;confined prodrug activation, and (2) reversing metabolic immunosuppression to potentiate immunotherapy efficacy. To tackle these issues, here we fabricate a bioorthogonal probiotic nanosystem (NP@ZIF&#8208;8@Apt&#8208;Lr) by engineering prodrug catalysts and an indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor onto AS1411 aptamer&#8208;modified Lactobacillus reuteri (Lr). AS1411&#8208;guided recognition and GSH&#8208;responsive prodrug decaging provide a double guarantee for tumor&#8208;selective drug activation, enabling localized tumor killing and further immunogenic cell death (ICD). Also, the inherent tumor&#8208;homing properties of Lr endow the nanosystem with the ability of penetrating deep tissue. More crucially, the released IDO inhibitor blocks the immunosuppressive kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism, while Lr redirects tryptophan metabolism toward the immunostimulatory indole&#8208;3&#8208;aldehyde pathway through host&#8208;microbial crosstalk. Upon treatment, NP@ZIF&#8208;8@Apt&#8208;Lr overcomes immune tolerance and stimulates T lymphocyte infiltration into tumors. Furthermore, it significantly enhances the efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy by suppressing bilateral tumor development and inducing an immune memory response. This work presents a new strategy for enhancing bioorthogonal chemoimmunotherapy through precise prodrug activation and probiotic&#8208;mediated metabolic reprogramming by host&#8208;microbial crosstalk.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Alloy&#8208;Based Artificial Enzymes With Modulated D&#8208;Band Center and pH&#8208;Controllable ROS Biocatalysis for Stage&#8208;Specific Treatment of Inflammatory and Infectious Oral Diseases</title>

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy alloy&#8208;based artificial enzymes with pH&#8208;controllable reactive oxygen species (ROS) biocatalysis function as dual&#8208;effect artificial enzymes, offering a stage&#8208;specific and bioadaptive therapeutic strategy for the complex microenvironment of periodontal disease. Extensive assessments confirmed the capacity of these HEA nanoparticles to disrupt pathogenic biofilms, attenuate ROS&#8208;mediated damage, redirect macrophage polarization toward the pro&#8208;regenerative M2 phenotype, and significantly enhance alveolar bone regeneration.








ABSTRACT
Periodontitis, characterized by tenacious polymicrobial biofilms and persistent oxidative stress, presents a formidable therapeutic challenge in clinical practice. Current treatment modalities often fall short in achieving simultaneous biofilm eradication and inflammatory resolution. Here, we present the de novo design of high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA, PtPdRuRhIr)&#8208;based artificial enzymes with modulated d&#8208;band center and pH&#8208;controllable biocatalysis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for stage&#8208;specific treatment of inflammatory and infectious periodontitis. Our studies demonstrate that the unique structure of PtPdRuRhIr&#8208;based HEA stabilizes the d&#8208;band center, enhances the electron density of Ru atoms, and optimizes the binding strength of oxygen species, thus enabling exceptional ROS biocatalysis and pH&#8208;controllable switching between antioxidase&#8208;like functions at physiological pH conditions and peroxidase&#8208;like activity under acidic infectious environments. Therefore, the PtPdRuRhIr&#8208;based HEA simultaneously exhibits superior regenerative functions by mitigating oxidative damage and bioadaptive antibacterial properties by generating bactericidal ROS. Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo evaluations demonstrate suppression of inflammatory cytokines, functional regeneration of alveolar bone, and also microenvironment&#8208;adaptive disruption of biofilm. By integrating pH&#8208;dependent anti&#8208;inflammatory and antimicrobial activities with immunomodulatory capacity in a single nanoplatform, this smart biocatalyst represents a promising therapeutic strategy for periodontitis and other biofilm&#8208;associated inflammatory disorders, effectively bridging the gap between microbial clearance and tissue restoration.

         <title>Geometry&#8208;Engineered Bipolar Photodetectors for Multivalued Logic&#8208;Gate Encrypted Optical Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A geometry&#8208;engineered strategy enables precise balancing of positive and negative photocurrents in fully amorphous, parallel&#8208;structured, self&#8208;powered p&#8208;NiOX&#8211;n&#8208;GaOX photoelectrochemical photodetectors. This design supports robust dual&#8208;band bipolar photoresponse and reconfigurable binary and ternary logic gates, which are successfully applied as encryption architectures in underwater optical communication systems with significantly enhanced information throughput, signal fidelity, and encryption security.








ABSTRACT
Bipolar photodetectors, with positive&#8208;negative photocurrent responses and coupling&#8208;enabled multifunctionality, show great promise for logic&#8208;gate&#8208;encrypted optical communication, where precise photocurrent balancing is essential to minimize polarity&#8208;induced logic errors and ensure transmission accuracy. Here, a parallel&#8208;structured, self&#8208;powered photoelectrochemical photodetector (PEC&#8208;PD) based on fully amorphous p&#8208;NiOX and n&#8208;GaOX thin films is developed, exhibiting dual&#8208;band (254 nm/365 nm) bipolar photoresponses. To address the intrinsic photocurrent asymmetry, we first employ thermal annealing to mitigate the imbalance. More significantly, leveraging the unique parallel architecture, we propose a universal geometry&#8208;engineered strategy to accurately balance positive and negative photocurrents by simply adjusting the area ratio of the two photoactive materials. This approach enables robust photocurrent symmetry across diverse wavelength combinations, ensuring broad adaptability to complex optical environments. Based on this tunability, reconfigurable binary and ternary exclusive OR (XOR and TXOR) logic gates are demonstrated as encryption frameworks in optical communication systems. The ternary encryption scheme enhances information throughput by &#8764;1.585 &#215; and expands the key space by 89% compared to binary systems. This work presents a universal strategy for implementing balanced bipolar photodetectors, facilitating their application in secure, high&#8208;throughput underwater optical communication.

         <title>Visibly Transparent Monolithic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells Achieving Over 6% Light&#8208;Utilization Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a design strategy for perovskite/organic tandem solar cells with high visible transparency. An ultra&#8208;wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite top cell absorbs mainly below 530&#160;nm. A ternary organic bottom cell harvests near&#8208;infrared light with minimization of visible absorption. The monolithic tandem device delivers LUE 6.04%, which is the world&#8208;record performance for transparent solar cells.








ABSTRACT
Transparent photovoltaics for solar&#8208;window applications must balance human&#8208;visible clarity with meaningful power output. Here, we report a selectively absorbing, monolithic perovskite/organic tandem that decouples visible transmittance from photocurrent generation and minimizes voltage loss delivering record light&#8208;utilization efficiency (LUE) for visibly transparent (VT) tandem devices. An ultra&#8208;wide&#8208;bandgap, DMA&#8208;alloyed perovskite top sub&#8208;cell harvests primarily &lt;&#8764;530&#160;nm, achieving, as a single junction, AVT 65.68% and power conversion efficiency (PCE) 8.23% (LUE 5.46%). Complemented by a ternary PCE10&#8208;2Cl:Y6:Y12 bottom stack that minimizes visible absorption while harvesting in the NIR, the tandem reaches PCE 10.91% at AVT 55.39%, yielding LUE 6.04%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first VT monolithic perovskite/organic tandem to surpass 6% LUE at AVT &#8805; 50%, while delivering a record&#8208;high open circuit voltage (VOC) of 2.38&#160;V. These results establish optical&#8211;electrical co&#8208;design guidelines for high&#8208;clarity, power&#8208;generating glazing, which explicitly connect materials and interface choices in both sub&#8208;cells to energetic disorder, built&#8208;in potential, and recombination.

These results establish optical&#8211;electrical co-design guidelines for high-clarity, power-generating glazing, which explicitly connect materials and interface choices in both sub-cells to energetic disorder, built-in potential, and recombination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Printing&#8208;Assisted Interpenetrating&#8208;Phase Composite Implant Materials Integrating Structural&#8208;Functional Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interpenetrating&#8208;phase composite implant materials are fabricated by infiltrating one constituent into 3D&#8208;printed porous scaffolds of another. After implantation, they demonstrate two potential degradation pathways: selectively partial and sequentially complete degradation. Their mechanical/functional properties can be modulated by combining appropriate constituents and regulating their interpenetrating&#8208;phase structures. These materials hold significant promise for achieving structural&#8208;functional integration, offering new opportunities to enhance bone repair efficacy.








Abstract
Implant materials play a pivotal role in bone repair; however, existing materials face considerable challenges in simultaneously achieving adequate mechanical properties and biological functions. In this perspective, drawing inspiration from nature and leveraging 3D printing technologies, we propose a new strategy to achieve structural&#8208;functional integration through the development of bicontinuous interpenetrating&#8208;phase composite implant materials. These materials are fabricated by infiltrating one constituent into 3D&#8208;printed porous scaffolds of another, and demonstrate two potential degradation pathways after implantation &#8211; selectively partial degradation and sequentially complete degradation &#8211; depending on the types of constituents and their combinations. We elucidate the associated degradation behaviors, regulatory strategies, and the resulting biological functions, and analyze their underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Moreover, targeted functional integration and delivery can be realized by infiltrating hydrogels loaded with functional agents into 3D&#8208;printed scaffolds. The mechanical and functional properties of these materials can be deliberately modulated by selecting appropriate constituents and by designing and regulating the interpenetrating&#8208;phase structures. We further examine the challenges faced by these materials and outline prospective directions for future research. Distinct from conventional single&#8208;component materials, 3D printing&#8208;assisted composite implant materials hold significant promise for achieving structural&#8208;functional integration, thereby offering new opportunities to enhance bone repair efficacy.

         <title>Reconfigurable Hydroxyl Dissociation for Spectrally Decoupled Weight Programming and Photocurrent Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To tackle the fundamental challenge in optical programmed processing&#8208;in&#8208;sensor (PIS) paradigm, this work presents a spectral&#8208;decoupling strategy. The reversible surface hydroxyl dissociation in bismuth oxyselenide reconfigures oxygen vacancy dynamics upon ultraviolet (UV) light, directly modulating photoresponsivities in the visible range. This enables a valid PIS paradigm that programs weights and computes photocurrents in different spectral bands.








ABSTRACT
The rise of the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) demands sensory systems with reduced size, weight, and power (SWaP). The processing&#8208;in&#8208;sensor (PIS) paradigm offers a solution, providing superior compactness and power&#8208;efficiency, critical for edge vision applications. Among emerging optoelectronic neuromorphic devices, the direct photocurrent computing (DPC) route is uniquely attractive, using photoresponsivity to encode weights for in&#8208;sensor multiply&#8211;accumulate (MAC) operations. However, current DPC devices rely on electrical signals for weight programming, which complicates circuitry and limits bandwidth compared to all&#8208;optical approaches. To address this, we present an optically programmable DPC device based on a vacancy&#8208;modulated bismuth oxyselenide (BOS) material platform. Critically, the reversible surface hydroxyl dissociation is found to reconfigure oxygen vacancy dynamics upon ultraviolet light, enabling the spectrally decoupled weight programming and photocurrent computing. Based on this, we demonstrate a BOS array implemented PIS hardware for low&#8208;power, coarse classification and as a pre&#8208;processing unit for more complex vision tasks in a processing&#8208;near&#8208;sensor (PNS) paradigm. Finally, a hybrid architecture is proposed to intelligently allocate computational resources between PIS and PNS, promising for an optimal balance of power and performance for next&#8208;generation edge AIoT applications.

         <title>Tunable Stability and Performance of Fused Thienothiophene Based Polymers for Organic Electrochemical Transistors and Artificial Synapse Based on A Side Chain Reorganization Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By extending the conjugated backbone and reorganizing side chains, we developed 4gTT&#8208;2gT, a polythiophene&#8208;based mixed conductor with high &#181;C* (729 F&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1), low threshold voltage, and excellent operational stability. The material functions reliably in OECT&#8208;based artificial synapses across 233&#8211;373&#160;K, showing great promise for smart wearable electronics.








ABSTRACT
We report a series of novel polymeric mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors based upon the incorporation of fused thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene and bithiophene with isomeric sidechains. The enhanced rigidity in the polymer backbone facilitated the formation of stabilized bipolarons, while the reorganized ethylene glycol side chains not only maintained the polymer's hydrophilicity but also unexpectedly enhanced the crystallinity of the polymer film. This design strategy led to the development of 4gTT&#8208;2gT, a high&#8208;performance and stable organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor. The polymer exhibited a maximum &#181;C* of 729 F V&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, one of the highest values among low&#8208;threshold voltage polythiophene derivatives, while demonstrating excellent operational stability, retaining 99% of its maximum current after 1&#8208;h device switching cycles and 94% after 9&#8208;h at lower bias. We implemented the material in OECT&#8208;based artificial synapses, which maintained functionality under a large temperature range (23&#8211;373 K). These combined properties establish 4gTT&#8208;2gT as a prime candidate for next&#8208;generation mixed conductor devices.

         <title>Suppressing Thermal Aggregation of Fullerene Enables ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsatisfactory thermal aggregation of fullerene derivatives has long hindered the realization of thermally durable inverted perovskite solar cells. Inspired by the robust architecture of spider webs, a &#8220;fullerene&#8208;fixed web&#8221; strategy is presented to immobilize fullerene molecules effectively. The resulting devices deliver a champion efficiency of 26.39% and retain &gt;90% of their initial performance after 800 h operation under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 condition.








ABSTRACT
Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), as the promising candidates for practical photovoltaics, always undergo severe degradation under standard commercial testing conditions (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3, 1 sun + RH&#8805;50% + 85&#176;C), posing a major obstacle to their commercialization. One of the inherent bottlenecks lies on that the fullerenes would spontaneously aggregate into crystalline clusters at high temperature, causing the irreversible interface destruction. Herein, drawing inspiration from the bionic spider web, &#8220;fullerene&#8208;fixed web&#8221; is constructed to firmly immobilize [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) molecules via in situ polymerized 3&#8208;aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS)&#8208;derived siloxane network. The hydrolyzed and polymerized APTMS forms a robust 3D framework that confines PCBM through strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, thereby suppressing its thermal aggregation. Simultaneously, the exposed amino groups of the network passivate the perovskite surface defects and strengthen the perovskite/ETL interfacial coupling. As a result, the target inverted PSCs achieve a champion efficiency of 26.39% (certified 26.27%) and retain over 90% of initial performance after 800 h age under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 condition&#8212;significantly outperforming the control (24.98%, T90 &lt; 250 h). This work provides a feasible and effective pathway toward achieving highly efficient and photothermally durable perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Coordinatively Unsaturated IrC3 Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Methanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a single Ir atom catalyst with unsaturated IrC3 sites for methanol oxidation. It breaks the scaling relationship for balanced *CH3OH/*CO adsorption and promotes *OH generation via water dissociation. This overcomes sluggish kinetics, achieving a low potential of 0.05&#160;V and a high H2 production rate of 8694&#160;mol&#160;H2&#160;mol&#160;Ir&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at 180&#176;C in an HT&#8208;PEME. 








ABSTRACT
Methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) plays a crucial role in renewable energy conversion and storage, where the key steps involve dehydrogenation and subsequent *CO electrooxidation. However, *CO oxidation remains challenging due to its strong adsorption and insufficient *OH species at active sites, severely limiting reaction kinetics. Here, the single Ir atom catalyst with abundant coordinatively unsaturated IrC3 sites is developed to electrocatalysis MOR under elevated temperature, the IrC3 sites with stronger CH3OH adsorption and weaker *CO adsorption, which break the scaling relationship between methanol and *CO adsorption energy. Moreover, the IrC3 could accelerate the electrochemical water dissociation with assistance of protophilic IrC4 to form adsorbed *OH. The balanced adsorption energy and the appearance of ample *OH would efficiently decrease the reaction energy barriers, and further accelerate the methanol dehydrogenation and *CO oxidation. By assemble the high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer (HT&#8208;PEME) with IrC3 sites at 180&#176;C, it shows an excellent MOR efficiency with onset potential about 0.05&#160;V and H2 generation rate with 8694 molH2&#160;molIr&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at cathode, which is much higher than that of Ir&#8208;C SACs parent catalyst and Pt/C catalysts. This finding provides an avenue to conquer the formidably sluggish kinetics of MOR for hydrogen utilization.

         <title>Electrically Tunable and Linearly Polarized Mid&#8208;Infrared Photoluminescence in 2D Tellurium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and electrically tunable mid&#8208;infrared emitter based on 2D tellurium is demonstrated. Notably, under electrical modulation, the emitter preserves two key intrinsic properties: a stable emission wavelength and near&#8208;perfect linear polarization. By leveraging this robust control, we construct high&#8208;speed electro&#8208;optical switches and logic gates, addressing the critical need for integrated mid&#8208;infrared photonic components.








ABSTRACT
The integration of electronic and photonic chips hinges on the availability of efficient light sources and modulators that are compatible with on&#8208;chip interconnects. Among these, mid&#8208;infrared (mid&#8208;IR) emitters are especially critical, as they enable low&#8208;loss transmission through atmospheric windows and unlock powerful capabilities for molecular fingerprinting and chemical sensing. In this study, we demonstrate that 2D tellurium (Te) nanoflakes can serve as highly efficient, electrically tunable, and linearly polarized mid&#8208;IR emitters. Leveraging the narrow direct bandgap (&#8776;0.36&#160;eV) and anisotropic crystal symmetry of Te nanoflakes, we achieve electrically tunable mid&#8208;IR photoluminescence (PL) with near&#8208;complete PL intensity modulation, a stable emission wavelength (&#8776;3.4&#160;&#181;m), and near&#8208;perfect linear polarization. In addition, we demonstrate a dual&#8208;gate device that allows independent control of the electrostatic doping and vertical electric field, and further theoretical analysis reveals that the electrical tunability of the PL intensity originates primarily from the gate&#8208;controlled carrier density. Building on this robust control, we demonstrate high&#8208;speed electro&#8208;optical switches and programmable logic gates for on&#8208;chip encryption, underscoring the excellent compatibility of Te with advanced optoelectronic circuits. Collectively, these advances establish Te as a cornerstone material for hybrid electronic&#8208;photonic systems, directly addressing the urgent demand for mid&#8208;IR components in next&#8208;generation optical interconnects.

         <title>Breaking the &#8220;Seesaw Effect&#8221;: 20.72% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells via Cascade Energy Transfer with a Fluorescent Sensitizer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that incorporating the fluorescent small molecule SD&#8208;EDOT into the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend mitigates the Voc&#8211;Jsc trade&#8208;off. SD&#8208;EDOT reduces energetic disorder, forms an energy cascade, promotes efficient charge generation, and suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination. Consequently, ternary organic solar cells achieve simultaneously enhanced Voc and Jsc, boosting the power conversion efficiency from 18.75% to 20.72%.








ABSTRACT
Though organic solar cells (OSCs) have achieved remarkable progress recently, the intrinsic limitation of the &#8220;seesaw effect&#8221; between open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) hinders their further improvements. In this study, a fluorescent small molecule, namely SD&#8208;EDOT, is incorporated into the widely used PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 system to overcome this challenge. The addition of SD&#8208;EDOT lowers the energetic disorder and electron&#8211;phonon coupling within the system. More importantly, it forms an energy cascade between donor and acceptor, enabling a side cascade energy transfer pathway and a more favorable energetic landscape. The high fluorescent property of SD&#8208;EDOT improves the utilization rate of high&#8208;energy excitons. These effects collectively promote faster and more efficient charge generation (improving Jsc), deeper highest occupied molecular orbit of donors, and suppressed non&#8208;radiative energy loss (elevating Voc). Consequently, the ternary devices achieve simultaneously higher Voc and Jsc, significantly boosting the power conversion efficiency from 18.75% to 20.72%. This study provides a rational strategy for mitigating the Voc&#8211;Jsc trade&#8208;off by incorporating a highly fluorescent third component with tailored energy levels, offering a promising pathway toward higher&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Plasma Design of Alloy&#8208;Based Gradient Solid Electrolyte Interphase on Lithium Metal Anodes for Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We pioneer a novel SnCl4/trifluorotoluene hybrid plasma technology to construct a Li&#8208;Sn alloy&#8208;based gradient SEI on lithium metal anodes with a Li&#8208;Sn alloy constituting the bottom layer, LiF occupying the middle layer, and a composite layer of LiCl and organic lithium compounds forming the top layer.

ABSTRACT
Design and optimization of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is extremely important for the construction of advanced lithium metal anodes. Herein, we pioneer a novel SnCl4/trifluorotoluene hybrid plasma technology to construct a Li&#8208;Sn alloy&#8208;based gradient SEI on lithium metal anodes to synergistically regulate reaction kinetics, structure, and crystal orientation of lithium deposition. Notably, the designed SEI displays a gradient layered structure, with a Li&#8208;Sn alloy constituting the bottom layer, LiF occupying the middle layer, and a composite layer of LiCl and organic lithium compounds forming the top layer. The formation mechanism is primarily attributed to the differential acceleration effects exerted by the plasma shell's electric field on different plasma ions. The gradient SEI exhibits multifunctionality, featuring not only high Young's modulus (13.9&#160;GPa) and enhanced interfacial structural stability, but also enabling the Li&#8208;Sn alloy component within the SEI to facilitate the preferential growth of the (110) crystal plane with a low migration barrier, thereby achieving the uniform deposition of Li without dendrite growth. Consequently, the modified Li anode exhibits a low overpotential and high coulombic efficiency, and the corresponding pouch cell shows improved cycling stability. This research provides a pioneering interfacial modification strategy for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance lithium metal anodes.

         <title>Unsaturated Vinyl Branching: A Molecular&#8208;Tailoring Strategy for Synergistic Stacking Regulation and Energy&#8208;Loss Suppression Toward 20%&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
The uncontrolled aggregation of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors critically limits the performance of organic solar cells. We introduce an unsaturated vinyl branching (UVB) strategy that simultaneously minimizes steric hindrance and strengthens non&#8208;covalent interactions to precisely tune molecular stacking and aggregation kinetics. The resulting acceptor, BTP&#8208;vinyl, forms an optimal blend morphology, leading to suppressed energy loss and achieving a champion efficiency of 20.06%.








ABSTRACT
The performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) is critically constrained by energy losses arising from disordered molecular packing and suboptimal blend morphology in non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) systems. Achieving precise control over NFA aggregation during film formation is thus essential to realize optimal molecular orientation and phase separation. Herein, we propose an unsaturated vinyl branching (UVB) strategy that enables synergistic morphology control through the concurrent minimization of steric hindrance and enhancement of non&#8208;covalent interactions. By incorporating UVB units into the inner side chains of the Y6&#8208;OD backbone, we create a novel acceptor, BTP&#8208;vinyl, which demonstrates optimized aggregation kinetics and facilitates compact 3D molecular packing. When blended with polymer donor D18, the BTP&#8208;vinyl&#8208;based system exhibits retarded crystallization, optimized domain size, and highly ordered face&#8208;on orientation, collectively promoting efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. Consequently, OSCs based on BTP&#8208;vinyl display significantly reduced energetic disorder and suppressed non&#8208;radiative energy loss compared to Y6&#8208;OD&#8208;based devices. The binary devices achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.6%, substantially outperforming the Y6&#8208;OD&#8208;based devices (18.1%). Furthermore, ternary devices incorporating L8&#8208;BO attain a champion PCE of 20.06%, crossing the significant 20% threshold. This work establishes UVB as an effective molecular&#8208;design paradigm for achieving ideal blend morphology through precise aggregation control in high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Light&#8208;Activated Neurostimulation Enabled by Broad&#8208;Angle Light Concentrating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A battery&#8208;free implantable neurostimulator precisely controlled by NIR&#8208;II light via photothermal&#8208;pyroelectric conversion, which features a highly efficient, Papaver radicatum&#8208;inspired quadric structure for laser concentration.








ABSTRACT
Precise, wireless control of battery&#8208;free implantable neurostimulators using light offers a promising avenue for treating neurological disorders, while the strong tissue absorption, scattering, and alignment uncertainties under in vivo conditions limit their reliability. Here, we harness the deep tissue penetration of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1400&#160;nm) light to develop a NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;activated neurostimulation based on integrated photothermal and pyroelectric energy conversion with a special broad&#8208;angle lens&#8208;free light concentrator. The flower&#8208;inspired light concentrator enables efficient harvesting of scattered, non&#8208;collimated light deep within tissues and eliminates the angular dependence common to existing systems. The synergistic photothermal&#8208;pyroelectric conversion mechanism enables effective utilization of diffuse 1064&#160;nm NIR&#8208;II laser illumination and facilitates substantial device miniaturization, resulting in an exceptionally high voltage&#8208;to&#8208;volume output ratio. In vitro and in vivo evaluations confirm its biocompatibility and ability to precisely activate the nerve and modulate limb motion in frogs. Furthermore, in vivo studies in rabbits demonstrate that the device, following subcutaneous implantation, enables immediate light&#8208;triggered electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve through pulsed 1064&#160;nm NIR&#8208;II laser irradiation. This work establishes a robust and minimally invasive paradigm for light&#8208;controlled neuromodulation, offering broad applicability in next&#8208;generation bioelectronic systems.

         <title>Homology&#8208;Guided Zwitterionic Interlayers for 21% Efficiency Non&#8208;Fullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing a homology&#8208;guided strategy, we developed interlayer materials by grafting zwitterionic sidechains onto a pentacyclic fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor, affording high electron mobility, desirable interfacial compatibility while concurrently modulating the cathode/active&#8208;layer interface and promoting photocurrent generation via hole/energy transfer. These combined effects render multifunctional cathode interlayers with good versatility and exceptional thickness tolerance for 21.07% efficiency single&#8208;junction organic solar cells.








ABSTRACT
The performance evolution of organic solar cells (OSCs) is increasingly constrained by a growing mismatch between state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoactive layers and conventional cathode interlayer materials (CIMs). Here, we report a homology&#8208;guided molecular design strategy to synchronize CIM with fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (FREAs). Grafting zwitterionic sidechains onto the high&#8208;performance pentacyclic FREA, we created a novel CIM, SZ1. This design grants SZ1 a deeper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level, higher electron mobility, and superior interfacial compatibility compared to the perylene diimides&#8208;based counterpart. SZ1 simultaneously lowers the cathode work function and elevates the active layer's work function, facilitating Ohmic contact and enhancing electron extraction. SZ1 also acts as a supplemental light&#8208;harvester, with hole/energy transfer at the SZ1/polymer interface contributing to photocurrent generation. These attributes make SZ1 a highly efficient and versatile CIM with an optimal thickness near 30&#160;nm and exceptional thickness tolerance, retaining &#8764;89% of peak performance even at a thick interlayer of 90&#160;nm. An impressive efficiency of 21.07% is achieved, ranking among the most efficient OSCs. The generality of this homology concept is demonstrated by its successful extension to non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors. This work establishes a transformative design paradigm for multifunctional, thickness&#8208;insensitive interlayers, paving the way for commercially viable OSCs.

         <title>Integrating Vibrio natriegens for Photon Manipulation in Living Lighting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rationalization of genetic and material engineering tools has enabled the engineering of fluorescent Vibrio natriegens (V. natriegens) to fabricate straightforward, highly emissive and stable V. natriegens&#8208;silicones color filters for the first red&#8208;emitting bacteria&#8208;hybrid light&#8208;emitting diodes. This pinpoints V. natriegens as a high&#8208;performance protein production platform to advance bacteria optoelectronics, in general, and bacteria photon down&#8208;conversion filters for lighting, in particular. 








ABSTRACT
Photon manipulation with bacteria is an emerging field in photonics (lasers, bio&#8208;imaging, and cell&#8208;sensing) and optoelectronics (bacterial&#8208;hybrid light&#8208;emitting diodes (BaHLEDs) and photovoltaics). In BaHLEDs, living photon down&#8208;conversion filters based on the direct use of bacteria in optically desirable hydrophobic and/or waterless coatings have not been realized yet. Herein, we put forward a simple concept: the engineering of fluorescent Vibrio natriegens (V. natriegens) that enable easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare, untreated bacteria&#8208;silicone filters for the first red&#8208;emitting BaHLEDs. More specifically, we have rationalized genetic and material engineering tools to optimize i) the protein production time with a 1.7&#8208;fold enhanced volumetric productivity compared to E. coli with the same spectroscopic quality for the fluorescent protein (FP) DsRed, ii) the straightforward fabrication of highly emissive and stable V. natriegens&#8208;silicones, and iii) device reproducibility and performance to reach competitive devices with stabilities ranging from a few days up to weeks depending on device working conditions and architectures. Overall, this work sets in bacterial photon down&#8208;conversion using V. natriegens directly as a viable and more straightforward concept toward further advances in living lighting applications.

The synergistic effect of strong photon harvesting, Type&#8208;I band alignment, and low phonon energy (138&#160;cm&#8722;1) in Cs2Te0.92Mo0.08Cl6 yields a record IQE of 97.4% and EQE of 65.6% for broadband NIR emission (750&#8211;1350&#160;nm). The resulting NIR LED achieves a 15.2% electro&#8208;optical conversion efficiency and 112&#160;mW output, enabling advanced sensing, night vision, solar energy harvesting, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.








ABSTRACT
Broadband near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphor&#8208;converted LEDs are efficient light sources for imaging, sensing, and security. However, the development of NIR phosphors has been limited by a strategy that prioritizes internal quantum efficiency (IQE) while leaving absorption efficiency (AE) largely underexplored, causing the external quantum efficiency (EQE) to plateau. Here, we break from this convention and demonstrate an absorption&#8208;engineered, single&#8208;component solid solution, Cs2Te0.92Mo0.08Cl6, designed under a new strategy that synergistically optimizes AE and IQE. The material delivers broadband NIR emission spanning 750&#8211;1350&#160;nm with an IQE of 97.4% and a record&#8208;high EQE of 65.6% for broadband NIR phosphors beyond 900&#160;nm. This performance originates from the synergistic effect of strong photon harvesting, low phonon energy (138&#160;cm&#8722;1), and a Type&#8208;I band alignment, as confirmed by experimental and theoretical studies. Notably, Cs2Te0.92Mo0.08Cl6 maintains outstanding stability, enabling NIR LED fabrication on 395&#160;nm UV chips. The fabricated device achieves a electro&#8208;optical conversion efficiency of 15.2% and an optical output of 112&#160;mW, setting a new benchmark for NIR light sources. Practical demonstrations in ethanol concentration detection, solar energy harvesting, night vision, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting confirm its utility, thereby establishing a transformative design platform for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics.

         <title>Dispersion&#8208;Engineered Terahertz Spoof Plasmonic Neural Network for Parallel Computing and On&#8208;Chip Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a terahertz spoof plasmonic neural network (SPNN) comprising cross&#8208;cascaded spoof surface plasmonic waveguides with strong engineered dispersion properties. Experimental results demonstrated that this compact platform successfully separates spectral components, with each mapped to a distinct classification task, thereby enabling parallel computation. These findings highlight the potential of SPNNs for machine learning applications and future terahertz chip integration.








ABSTRACT
Diffractive neural networks offer a novel physical implementation for optical computing to achieve parallelism, low power consumption, and light&#8208;speed processing. However, their limited dispersion engineering necessitates increasingly complex architectures for tasks such as spectrum recognition and simultaneous multi&#8208;class classification, which in turn leads to increased energy demands. Here, we propose a spoof plasmonic neural network (SPNN) comprising cross&#8208;cascaded spoof surface plasmonic waveguides with strong engineered dispersion properties designed for operation in the terahertz regime. This compact platform efficiently separates spectral components from a broadband input signal, achieving a data rate of 22 Gbit/s across two separated spectral channels. We experimentally show that the SPNN can simultaneously classify multiple inputs from Fashion&#8208;MNIST+MNIST or Fashion&#8208;MNIST+EMNIST datasets, achieving classification accuracies of 98.3% and 97.4% or 97.4% and 93.8%, respectively. For multi&#8208;color CIFAR&#8208;10 dataset classification, the network architecture incorporating multiple cascaded SPNNs realizes over 10% higher accuracy than single&#8208;color&#8208;channel methods by leveraging distinct color channels mapped to respective spectrum channels. These findings highlight the potential of SPNNs for machine learning applications and lay the groundwork for future terahertz chip integration.

         <title>High Performance 4.6&#160;V LiCoO2 Cathode Materials Enabled by Surface Lattice Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study, through a decomposition of conformal Y(OH)CO3 nanoshells, transforms the layered structure of the LiCoO2 (LCO) crust into a rock&#8208;salt&#8208;like feature, the renovated surface with high chemical/electrochemical stability, thereby enabling the LCO cathode to have both high capacity and structural integrity for its stable working at 4.6 V.








ABSTRACT
Charging the cathode of LiCoO2 (LCO) to higher voltages, typically 4.6&#160;V, is able to increase reversible capacity, but meanwhile raises serious stability issues. Here, through a decomposition&#8208;induced reconstruction (DIR) process, we demonstrate the possibility of modulating the surface lattice of LCO with high precision in depth control, thereby enabling the 4.6&#160;V LCO cathode to have both high capacity and structural integrity. Following the precise construction of a conformal Y(OH)CO3 nanoshell, a sintering process induces the hydrocarbonate decomposition, which releases CO2 to transform the layered structure of the LCO crust into rock&#8208;salt&#8208;like lattices, forming a renovated surface with high electrochemical and mechanical stability. The prepared LCO cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 215.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C with an extraordinary capacity retention of 93.0% after 100 cycles at 4.6&#160;V. The much&#8208;improved stability is meanwhile manifested by cyclability test at 1 C (85.5%&#160;vs 13.6% of pristine LCO after 500 cycles), as well as tests at harsh conditions. Our results highlight the essential role played by the surface chemistry in addressing the stability issue of high voltage LCO cathode, and provide useful guidelines for the development of lithium&#8208;ion batteries with higher energy density.

         <title>Engineering Stress&#8208;Potential Coupled Interface on Ultrathin Lithium Anodes Toward 450&#160;Wh Kg&#8722;1&#8208;Level Long&#8208;Cycling Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

This work designed a stress&#8208;potential coupled interface, enabling adaptive dendrite suppression and achieving ultralong cycling in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries.








ABSTRACT
Dendrite&#8208;free lithium anodes are crucial for developing practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries (&gt;400&#160;Wh/kg) with extended cycle life, but conventional interface design lack self&#8208;adaptive adjustment against dendrite growth during Li plating. Herein, we obtain a dendrite&#8208;free ultrathin Li@FcCHO anode by engineering a stress&#8208;responsive nano&#8208;interface on lithium strips via a mechanochemical reaction between ferrocene carboxaldehyde (FcCHO) and metallic Li. As proved by in situ Kelvin probe force microscopy and scanning electrochemical microscopy tests, the Li@FcCHO anode shows local potential response to the Li plating stress. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations show that the local surface potential change originates from stress&#8208;induced redistribution of anion&#8208;pair coordination. The stress&#8208;potential coupled interface layers induce uniform and dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition beneath the interface by suppressing dendritic Li from capturing Li+ with the extra electric field. As a result, the Li@FcCHO anode exhibits ultralong cycling life over 5000&#160;h under high areal capacity conditions, whilst a practical 452&#160;Wh/kg pouch cell (9 Ah) based on the Li@FcCHO anode can survive over 470 cycles with capacity retention of 85.20%. This work pioneers a stress&#8208;potential coupled interface design to advance practical ultrathin Li anodes for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Low&#8208;Energy Consumed Switchable Windows with Ultralong Optical Memory via Semiconductor&#8208;Enabled Reversible Zinc Electrodeposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a bistable reflectance&#8208;modulated reversible zinc electrodeposited switchable window (ZERD) has been developed. The excellent bistable property gives ZERD efficient solar modulation with low energy consumption. The reflectance&#8208;modulated property gives ZERD enhanced heat management during long&#8208;term period than that of transmittance&#8208;modulated switchable windows. Such bistable reflectance&#8208;modulated ZERD provide a novel reference for construction of high performance switchable windows.








ABSTRACT
Electro&#8208;response switchable windows (ERSWs) can dynamically control light transmission on demand, which showed great application potential for construction of zero&#8208;energy buildings. However, ERSWs' poor bistability compromises their energy efficiency, and the solar heat absorption in dark colored state leads to undesirable parasitic heat re&#8208;emission, thereby diminishing their effectiveness in thermal management. In this work, a bistable reflectance&#8208;modulated electroreflective device based on reversible zinc electrodeposition (ZERD) is designed and prepared to achieve ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power heat management. A dynamic balancing strategy with highly matched potential for the Zn2&#8314;/Zn redox reaction on both side electrodes gave ZERD excellent bistability (28 days), fast switching (4 s for colored and 8 s for bleached). The reflectance&#8208;modulated property gave ZERD high Rsol (64.25%) and low SHGC (0.066), which meant it can reduce parasitic heat re&#8208;emission significantly. Outdoor tests demonstrated reflectance&#8208;modulated ZERD provided enhanced cooling performance compared to transmittance&#8208;modulated ERSW (a maximum temperature reduction of up to 8.4&#176;C). Energy consumption calculations indicated ZERD required only needed to consume up to 0.8% of the total energy savings, while enabling substantial annual energy savings (up to 57.9% in worldwide).

&lt;p&gt;In this work, a bistable reflectance-modulated reversible zinc electrodeposited switchable window (ZERD) has been developed. The excellent bistable property gives ZERD efficient solar modulation with low energy consumption. The reflectance-modulated property gives ZERD enhanced heat management during long-term period than that of transmittance-modulated switchable windows. Such bistable reflectance-modulated ZERD provide a novel reference for construction of high performance switchable windows.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electro-response switchable windows (ERSWs) can dynamically control light transmission on demand, which showed great application potential for construction of zero-energy buildings. However, ERSWs' poor bistability compromises their energy efficiency, and the solar heat absorption in dark colored state leads to undesirable parasitic heat re-emission, thereby diminishing their effectiveness in thermal management. In this work, a bistable reflectance-modulated electroreflective device based on reversible zinc electrodeposition (ZERD) is designed and prepared to achieve ultra-low-power heat management. A dynamic balancing strategy with highly matched potential for the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;/Zn redox reaction on both side electrodes gave ZERD excellent bistability (28 days), fast switching (4 s for colored and 8 s for bleached). The reflectance-modulated property gave ZERD high R&lt;sub&gt;sol&lt;/sub&gt; (64.25%) and low SHGC (0.066), which meant it can reduce parasitic heat re-emission significantly. Outdoor tests demonstrated reflectance-modulated ZERD provided enhanced cooling performance compared to transmittance-modulated ERSW (a maximum temperature reduction of up to 8.4&#176;C). Energy consumption calculations indicated ZERD required only needed to consume up to 0.8% of the total energy savings, while enabling substantial annual energy savings (up to 57.9% in worldwide). The ultralow-power bistable reflectance-modulated ZERD offered a valuable strategy for designing high-performance ERSW and supported progress toward zero-energy buildings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sacrificing Knight for Pawn&#8208;Queen Promotion: Sonosensitive Nano&#8208;Xanthiums Orchestrate NO to Retain H2O2 for Antibiofilm Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sonosensitive nano&#8208;xanthiums are prepared to anchor bacterial biofilm and release nitric oxide (NO) under ultrasound stimulation. NO is sacrificed to retain hydrogen peroxide for enhanced biofilm sterilization via producing lethal hydroxyl radicals.








ABSTRACT
Biofilm infections present escalating clinical challenges due to their intrinsic resistance to conventional treatments, underscoring the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. Here, we show a pioneering approach that leverages sacrificial nitric oxide (NO) to enhance hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) retention for antibiofilm therapy. H2O2 has the ability to produce hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH), the most potent oxidants in nature, but it is often neutralized by H2O2 scavengers before &#8226;OH formation. Our design utilizes ultrasound irradiation to release NO from the biofilm&#8208;anchoring nano&#8208;xanthiums (G&#8208;B@NXs), which subsequently interact with biofilm&#8208;associated H2O2 scavengers, including catalase and glutathione, to suppress the decomposition ability toward H2O2. Additionally, glucose oxidase on the surface of G&#8208;B@NXs supplements H2O2 production, facilitates its conversion into &#8226;OH, and exhibits effective biofilm sterilization in different infection models. Our strategy not only shows the promise for advancing antibiofilm applications but also provides novel insights into the development of NO&#8208;assisted biomaterials.

         <title>Colloidal Quantum Dot Liquid Lasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal quantum dot liquid lasers combine solution&#8208;processable nanocrystals with fluidic gain media, offering efficient heat dissipation, enhanced photostability, and wide spectral tunability. This Review highlights recent progress in materials design, lasing mechanisms, and device architectures, and discusses key challenges and opportunities for future development. 








ABSTRACT
Thermal management of lasers fundamentally limits the upper limit of their output power as well as their operational stability. In this context, liquid&#8208;state lasers exhibit an unparalleled advantage in power scalability and stability, owing to their highly efficient heat dissipation facilitated by continuous fluid circulation. Additionally, the intrinsic compatibility of liquid lasers with microfluidic platforms also holds great promise for integration into energy&#8208;efficient, miniaturized photonic systems. Colloidal quantum dots (QDs), which are solution&#8208;processed semiconductor nanocrystals, have emerged as highly versatile optical gain materials. While research over the past decade has been predominantly centered on solid&#8208;state QD lasers made from densely packed QD films or composite matrices, there has been a recent surge of interest in exploring QDs in their native dispersion form as active gain media for liquid&#8208;state lasers. This review provides a systematic overview of recent advances in QD&#8208;based liquid lasers, detailing their operational principles, critical performance metrics, and highlighting their unique advantages. Moreover, we point out current technical bottlenecks and explore prospective strategies for overcoming these limitations to pave the way for practical&#160;QD&#8208;based liquid lasing technologies.

         <title>Correlated Dual&#8208;Gradient Electrodes Enabling Spatially Synchronized Sulfur Redox in High&#8208;Mass&#8208;Loading Li&#8211;S Batteries Under High Current Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupling a dual&#8208;gradient carbonized framework with Fe2O3/Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalytic sites enables spatially synchronized sulfur redox across the entire electrode thickness in high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading Li&#8211;S batteries. This synergistic structural&#8211;catalytic design effectively mitigates concentration, ohmic, and electrochemical polarization, thereby achieving high&#8208;capacity utilization rates under both high areal mass loading and fast&#8208;charging conditions, advancing the practical realization of high&#8208;energy&#8208; and high&#8208;power&#8208;density Li&#8211;S batteries.








ABSTRACT
The practical deployment of Li&#8211;S batteries is hindered by sluggish redox kinetics and poor ion transport in high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading sulfur cathodes, especially under fast&#8208;charging and high&#8208;power&#8208;density conditions. Conventional electrocatalyst&#8208;based strategies partially mitigate electrochemical polarization by lowering reaction energy barriers but fail to address concentration and ohmic polarization, which become more pronounced in thick electrodes. Here, a coupled material&#8208;architecture approach is demonstrated by integrating electrocatalysts into a low&#8208;tortuosity, correlated dual&#8208;gradient electrode, fabricated via programmable high&#8208;resolution stereolithography and pyrolysis&#8208;induced carbonization. The microscale pore gradient is deliberately correlated with the active&#8208;material gradient to spatially synchronize redox progression across electrode depth, thereby homogenizing cathode utilization and alleviating concentration polarization. Pyrolysis generates additional nanoscale pores, establishing a hierarchical structure and transforming polymer&#8208;salt precursors into a conductive carbon framework embedding Li2S@Fe2O3/Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C, enhancing ion accessibility and minimizing ohmic polarization, while Fe2O3/Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C accelerates polysulfide conversion, reducing electrochemical polarization. Benefiting from this synergy, the Li2S@Fe2O3/Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C electrode delivers high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacities of 22.7&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 (1048&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) at 0.1&#160;C, 15.7&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 (725&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) at 5&#160;C, and retains 82% capacity over 1100 cycles at 4&#160;C. A single&#8208;layer pouch cell achieves a specific energy of 403&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, demonstrating the promise of this dual&#8208;gradient strategy for real&#8208;world high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;power Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Flexible and Robust Metasurface&#8208;Based Wearable Sensor for Intelligent Human Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel wearable metasurface sensor&#8212;BioTopo Life Pocket. This sensor is capable of non&#8208;contact capture of cardiopulmonary signals during motion. The sensor can be easily integrated into clothing and interacts with the human body through wireless signals. Compared to traditional SSPP and microstrip line, our method maintains robust functionality even under structural fractures. This opens up new possibilities in materials science, physics, and medicine.








ABSTRACT
Wearable sensors enabling noninvasive healthcare monitoring encounter significant challenges in preserving signal integrity under motion artifacts and mechanical deformation. Here, we present for the first time a wearable sensor that integrates topologically protected flexible metasurface technology, combining topological photonics with AI&#8208;enhanced sensing technology to enable multifunctional human monitoring. This intelligent system harnesses electromagnetic wave&#8208;body interactions to precisely capture cardiopulmonary dynamics, effectively overcoming the limitations of conventional wearable sensors in dynamic conditions. Specifically, the topological design of the sensor ensures stable operational performance even in bent or fractured states, while deep learning algorithms facilitate robust extraction of personalized biometric features to simultaneously achieve multiple healthcare functions, including vital sign monitoring, activity recognition, and individual identification. Experimental results demonstrate the system's capability for real&#8208;time health assessment across diverse scenarios, from exercise to rest states. By combining adaptive wearability with intelligent signal processing, this platform represents a transformative approach to next&#8208;generation smart healthcare systems, advancing applications from chronic disease management to AI&#8208;driven personalized healthcare.

         <title>Confinement&#8208;Locking Strategy Enables Ionogels With Remarkable Mechanical Robustness and Fatigue Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A confinement&#8208;locking strategy is developed to fabricate mechanically robust and fatigue&#8208;resistant phase&#8208;separated ionogels: part of soft segments are confined in hard domains to buffer stress and facilitate the reorganization of hydrogen&#8208;bonding assemblies, while IL is confined in soft phases to eliminate interference with hard segments and enhance the stability of hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks.








ABSTRACT
Ionogels with favorable mechanical robustness, high conductivity, and excellent resistance to tear and fatigue are crucial for portable energy devices and/or flexible electronics. However, the intrinsic plasticizing effect and network dilution caused by ionic liquids (IL) compromise their mechanical robustness. Herein, a confinement&#8208;locking strategy is developed to produce mechanically robust and fatigue&#8208;resistant phase&#8208;separate ionogels. First, a portion of soft segments is confined within the hard domains to buffer stress and facilitate hydrogen bonding (H&#8208;bonding) assemblies reorganization. Second, the IL are confined within soft phases, which eliminates the interference with hard segments and consequently enhances the stability of H&#8208;bonding networks. The synergistic effects of robust H&#8208;bonding networks, extensive supramolecular interactions between soft segments (polycaprolactone, PCL) and IL, strain&#8208;induced crystallization of PCL, and stress&#8208;damping by confined soft segments endow the ionogel with an exceptional combination of tensile strength (&#8764;45.4&#160;MPa), fracture toughness (256.1 MJ&#183;m&#8722;3), elongation at break (1576.6%), elastic recovery (&gt;91%), ionic conductivity (1.04 mS&#183;cm&#8722;1), tear strength (&#8764;108.1 kJ&#183;m&#8722;2), and a record&#8208;high fatigue threshold (8796 J&#183;m&#8722;2), enabling the ionogel with great potential in perceptive artificial ligaments.

         <title>Perspective: OLED Displays Singing with the Blues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While blue pixels consume approximately 50% of the energy of OLED display front planes, in the 25 years since their invention, 100% internal efficiency triplet&#8208;controlled phosphorescent OLEDs have not met the stability standards necessary for their adoption. In this perspective, we discuss the progress and challenges encountered during this long journey of exploration and discovery. Using a combination of strategies, these devices are nearly ready to meet the most stringent demands of the highest quality mobile displays and televisions.








ABSTRACT
While blue pixels consume approximately 50% of the energy of organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) display front planes, in the 25 years since their invention, 100% internal efficiency phosphorescent OLEDs (PHOLEDs) have not met the stability standards necessary for their adoption. In this perspective, we discuss the significant progress and challenges encountered during this long journey of exploration and discovery. Today, using a combination of solutions including robust molecular design, graded doping of the emission layer, increasing the optical density of states to decrease the triplet radiative lifetime, and employing light outcoupling schemes, deep blue PHOLEDs are now achieving lifetimes approaching those of their green analogs. This perspective elaborates on the challenges and opportunities confronting further development of triplet&#8208;controlled emitters, including PHOLEDs using heavy&#8208;metal phosphors and thermally activated delayed fluorescent OLEDs. We also address some persistent problems commonly found in the literature concerning the measurement of quantum efficiency and operational lifetime.

This work demonstrates a ferroelectric&#8208;configured weight&#8208;reconfigurable photovoltaic device array for in&#8208;sensor dynamic computing, enabling robust recognition of dim objects. 2D perovskite ferroelectric nanoplates with controlled size and high crystallinity are directly synthesized and utilized to achieve reconfigurable and nonvolatile photoresponsivity.

ABSTRACT
Machine vision systems face significant challenges in accurately extracting critical features from dim objects under complex scenarios. Here, we demonstrate a ferroelectric&#8208;configured weight&#8208;reconfigurable photovoltaic device array for in&#8208;sensor dynamic computing, enabling robust recognition of dim objects. A series of 2D perovskite ferroelectric nanoplates with controllable size, high crystallinity, and excellent yield are directly synthesized. Reconfigurable and nonvolatile photovoltaics in a graphene/ferroelectric/graphene heterostructure are modulated through switchable ferroelectric polarization. Leveraging the ferroelectric&#8208;configured photoresponsivity, a convolution kernel optoelectronic sensor array with dynamic correlation of adjacent units is designed for in&#8208;sensor dynamic computing. Compared with traditional static optoelectronic convolution processing, our approach selectively amplifies subtle differences of local image pixels, enabling effective edge feature extraction even in low&#8208;contrast scenes. Integrated with a convolutional neural network, the system significantly enhances the robustness and accuracy of dim object detection, offering a promising platform for advanced machine vision applications.

         <title>Mesoscale Magnetostructural Phase Separation in Fe&#8208;deficient Fe5GeTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lorentz 4D&#8208;STEM reveals magnetostructural Fe&#8208;vacancy induced phase separation at different length scales in 2D ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2. The distribution and size of the Fe&#8208;deficiency phase strongly affects its magnetic anisotropy.








Abstract
2D Van der Waals ferromagnet Fe5&#8208;xGeTe2 (F5GT) is promising for spintronic applications due to its high Curie temperature, layered structure, and ability to host complex magnetic textures. However, the origin of its sample&#8208;dependent magnetic anisotropy remains unclear, hindering control of its magnetic behavior. Here, spatially resolved cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is used to correlatively map magnetism, lattice structure, and chemistry across atomic&#8208;to&#8208;micron scales. This is revealed that only mesoscale, not nanoscale, inclusions of a Fe&#8208;deficient secondary phase significantly modify magnetic behavior, establishing a previously unrecognized critical length scale. This phase separation, induced by quenching, leads to in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy, while slow cooling confines separation to a few nanometers and preserves out&#8208;of&#8208;plane anisotropy. These findings reconcile prior inconsistencies and establish a predictive framework for tuning magnetism in F5GT through thermal processing, with broader implications for controlling anisotropy in other 2D magnetic materials.

         <title>Diverse Cation Exchange in Layered Titanate Nanostructures for Tailored Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H+(H3O+)&#8208;intercalated layered titanate enables stable intercalation of 42 single&#8208;metal and multication combinations. Alkali&#8208;metal intercalation tunes Rh charge density, yielding an efficient propylene hydroformylation catalyst. These results establish a generalizable intercalation platform for rational catalyst design and provide a library supporting fundamental studies and applications in catalysis and energy storage.








ABSTRACT
Layered titanates (LTs) offer exceptional structural and chemical tunability, enabling precise modulation of their electronic states and catalytic properties. However, systematic studies on the range&#160;of cations that can serve as intercalants for LTs remain limited, and conventional synthesis methods often require additional treatments for cation intercaltion. In this study, we present a cation&#8208;free H+ (H3O+)&#8208;intercalated LT as a versatile platform for direct cation insertion. This LT can be intercalated with single metal cations (42 metals from five groups) or a combination of 5&#8211;30 cations without structural deformation. Intercalation with alkali metals (AMs) precisely tuned the charge density of Rh species when the prepared LTs are used as catalytic supports. Among the Rh&#8208;loaded AM&#8208;bearing LTs, Rh/K&#8211;LT delivered the highest turnover frequency (23&#160;685 h&#8722;1), surpassing those of other AM&#8208;intercalated systems and previously reported Rh&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts, during propylene hydroformylation. Combined in situ/ex situ analyses and density functional theory calculations revealed that AM intercalation promotes charge transfer to Rh, thereby enhancing adsorption behavior and catalytic activity. This work establishes not only a broad cation intercalation library but also a generalizable strategy for cation engineering in LTs, highlighting the potential of intercalation&#8208;driven charge modulation for rational catalyst design across diverse reactions.

         <title>A Biochar&#8208;Based Composite Hydrogel Microenvironment for Enhanced Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the synthesis of a polyacrylamide hydrogel wherein biomass&#8208;derived biochar is co&#8208;encapsulated with the enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The resulting composite hydrogel possesses balanced electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient domains, creating an optimal microenvironment that concentrates both hydrogen peroxide and phenol molecules in the vicinity of the HRP, leading to dramatically enhanced biocatalytic oxidation efficiency.








ABSTRACT
Addressing water pollution with sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly strategies is a significant global challenge. Traditional methods of decontaminating water via enzyme catalysis have limitations, particularly due to the mass transfer resistance resulting from enzyme immobilization. In this study, we report a novel approach in which biochar (BC), a biomass&#8208;derived porous material rich in surface functional groups, is integrated with polyacrylamide hydrogels to encapsulate the enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The resulting Gel/BC&#8208;HRP composite hydrogel exhibits superior biocatalytic activity for the oxidation of phenolic contaminants in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Our findings demonstrate that the Gel/BC&#8208;HRP composite greatly enhances mass transfer efficiency, achieving a reaction rate 91.4 times faster than the biochar&#8208;free control, together with exceptionally high turnover frequency (TOF) values. The composite maintains approximately 60% efficiency for phenol removal even after eight reaction cycles. Mechanistic&#160;investigations suggest that the polyacrylamide gel creates electron&#8208;rich domains, while the biochar segments provide electron&#8208;deficient domains, leading to the formation of an optimal microenvironment that concentrates both H2O2 and phenol in the vicinity of the HRP, thereby significantly accelerating the oxidation process. The innovative integration of biochar with hydrogel&#8208;immobilized biocatalysts offers a promising and environmentally friendly solution for the degradation of organic pollutants in water remediation.

         <title>Coupling Mitochondrial Homeostasis to Oxi&#8208;Inflamm&#8208;Aging Network Disruption via Peptide&#8208;Functionalized Nanocomposite Hydrogel for Osteoarthritis Intervention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pioneers a mitochondria&#8208;centered regulation strategy for osteoarthritis using a peptide&#8208;functionalized nanocomposite hydrogel. The nanocomposite hydrogel enables MMP&#8208;responsive release of a chimeric peptide and 2D GeSe nanozyme to disrupt the pathogenic oxi&#8208;inflamm&#8208;aging network. By protecting mitochondrial homeostasis and blocking the cGAS/STING pathway, it effectively reverses cartilage degeneration in vivo, offering a promising therapeutic approach.








ABSTRACT
Osteoarthritis(OA) is an age&#8208;related degenerative joint disease, and the absence of clinically effective therapy places a substantial burden on global health. The crosstalk among oxidation, inflammation, and aging (oxi&#8208;inflamm&#8208;aging)&#160;disrupts chondrocytes homeostasis, serving as a critical driver in OA initiation and progression. Here, we developed a mitochondria&#8208;centered therapeutic strategy aimed at concomitantly disrupting the pathogenic oxi&#8208;inflamm&#8208;aging network. This strategy emphasized a novel chimeric peptide (MW) designed by integrating the mitochondrial protective MOTS&#8208;s and cartilage&#8208;targeting WYRGRL. To enhance therapeutic delivery and efficacy, the bifunctional chimeric peptide MW is immobilized onto GeSe nanosheets, which are then embedded within a multifunctional responsive hydrogel composed of HA&#8208;MAL, MMP13&#8208;sensitive peptide, and PF127 (HMP), forming the peptide&#8208;functionalized nanocomposite hydrogel (MW@GeSe@HMP). This engineered nanocomposite hydrogel not only exhibited efficient enzyme&#8208;mimicking mimetic properties to scavenge harmful oxygen radicals, but also enabled MMP&#8208;responsive targeted release in chondrocytes. Subsequent biological experiments revealed that MW@GeSe@HMP effectively disrupted the oxi&#8208;inflamm&#8208;aging network by modulating mitochondrial function, thereby maintaining chondrocyte homeostasis. Mechanistically, MW@GeSe@HMP protected chondrocytes via hindering cGAS/STING signaling. The nanocomposite hydrogel also significantly suppressed cartilage damage and matrix degradation, effectively alleviating OA progression in a rat OA model. In conclusion, this study developed a nanocomposite hydrogel integrating bioactive peptides and two&#8208;dimensional nanoenzyme, providing a prospective therapeutic strategy and potential target for OA treatment by regulating oxi&#8208;inflamm&#8208;aging integrative network.

         <title>Electrostatic Ion Trapping in Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Record Neuromorphic Memory Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecularly engineered channel architecture overcomes the inherent performance limitations of neuromorphic OECTs. Through photo&#8208;crosslinking a zwitterionic molecule within the polymer matrix, we generate high&#8208;density electrostatic traps of ions. This strategy effectively suppresses ion back&#8208;diffusion and stabilizes the doped state without disrupting the polymer's charge&#8208;transporting microstructure, enabling record&#8208;breaking memory performance and high&#8208;fidelity synaptic functions.








ABSTRACT
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) leverage the chemical tunability of polymeric semiconductors; however, their potential as memory devices remains constrained by insufficient ion retention. Previous studies on physical trapping of ions within polymer crystalline domains have generally reported memory windows below 5.3&#160;V. Here, we achieve molecular&#8208;level hysteresis control by designing a dual&#8208;functional zwitterionic crosslinker that creates an electrostatic ion&#8208;trapping channel. Its fixed anionic sulfonate group establishes a repulsive barrier to delay ion injection, while its cationic ammonium site forms a deep electrostatic trap that creates a 2.03&#160;eV barrier, thereby stabilizing the doped state, and collectively producing pronounced hysteresis. GIWAXS under sequential biasing reveals reversible lamellar dynamics, enabled by ionic interactions among side&#8208;chain&#8208;tethered zwitterion units. The resulting OECTs achieve record hysteresis strength (96.4&#160;V) and memory window (8.65&#160;V) while maintaining an on/off ratio &#8764;106 and 86.4% conductance retention after 200,000 pulses. Moreover, the Z&#8208;FPA scheme generalizes to other polymer semiconductors, providing a polymer&#8208;agnostic route to high&#8208;fidelity neuromorphic OECTs. Synaptic metrics are more symmetric; device&#8208;informed models reach 92.87% on MNIST, and ECG reservoir computing confirms biosignal compatibility. Our findings provide key molecular insights into the material design and operating mechanisms critical for advancing next&#8208;generation neuromorphic OECTs.

         <title>Metabolic Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Molecular Clusters for Advanced Type 2 Diabetic Complications by Alleviating Immunosuppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging a deep learning&#8208;guided &#8216;size&#8208;fitting effect&#8217;, an atomic&#8208;precision metal cluster is engineered with remarkable inhibition rates of 98% for &#945;&#8208;amylase and 88% for &#945;&#8208;glucosidase. By targeting metabolic abnormalities and immunosuppression, it effectively prevents diabetic complications.








ABSTRACT
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is the most prevalent disease in the world, with one&#8208;tenth of the population suffering from the disease, and the most critical challenges are its complications that induce high disability and mortality rates. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art therapeutic agents can manage glucose but fail to prevent renal failure as well as neurodegeneration with immunosuppression. Herein, we developed a deep learning design strategy that exploits the &#8216;size&#8208;fitting effect&#8217; to engineer an atomic&#8208;precision metal cluster for preventing diabetic complications by targeting metabolic abnormality and immunosuppression. The designed AuZn cluster achieves almost 100% &#945;&#8208;amylase inhibition and 88% &#945;&#8208;glucosidase inhibition, resulting in the normalized glycated hemoglobin and sustained glucose control. The intrinsic redox properties reduce oxidative stress damage, promoting &#946;&#8208;cell regeneration and metabolic stress alleviation. Consequently, the renal function, the most prevalent complications, shows that glomerular filtration can be restored to normal levels without urinary protein, while the clinical dulaglutide is not show any improvement. The key marker during early neurocognitive disorders, the amyloid precursor protein (APP) induced by complications, can be effectively suppressed, and diabetes induced organelle degeneration in neurons can be restored.

         <title>Two&#160;nm Atomic Thickness Amorphous Red Phosphorus Enables Ultrafast and Ultrastable Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#160;nm atomic thickness amorphous red phosphorus with abundant surface defects demonstrates stronger Na+ combining capacity and superior volume expansion tolerance, next the red phosphorus is composited with highly conductive MXene, the built&#8208;in electric field at the heterointerfaces are enhanced, that is beneficial to Na+ transfer and adsorption. As a result, the composite electrodes show ultrafast and ultrastable cycling performance.








ABSTRACT
Red phosphorus (RP) has shown great potential as anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), but its development is hindered by sluggish Na+ storage kinetics, poor intrinsic conductivity and terrible volume changes. This work focuses on the pivotal role of atomic thickness ultrasmall amorphous RP, the ultrathin amorphous RP with an atomic&#8208;thickness of 0.9&#160;nm exhibits a stronger Na+ binding capability and this advantage becomes particularly pronounced as the RP approaches size of around 2&#160;nm. Moreover, the developed RP anode shows exceptional expansion tolerance due to the ultrathin structure. Subsequently, the RP are integrated with highly conductive MXene, owing to the ultrasmall amorphous features of RP, the built&#8208;in electric field at the RP/MXene heterointerface are enhanced, which significantly promotes Na+ transfer and adsorption.

&lt;p&gt;2&#160;nm atomic thickness amorphous red phosphorus with abundant surface defects demonstrates stronger Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; combining capacity and superior volume expansion tolerance, next the red phosphorus is composited with highly conductive MXene, the built-in electric field at the heterointerfaces are enhanced, that is beneficial to Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer and adsorption. As a result, the composite electrodes show ultrafast and ultrastable cycling performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red phosphorus (RP) has shown great potential as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), but its development is hindered by sluggish Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage kinetics, poor intrinsic conductivity and terrible volume changes. This work focuses on the pivotal role of atomic thickness ultrasmall amorphous RP, the ultrathin amorphous RP with an atomic-thickness of 0.9&#160;nm exhibits a stronger Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; binding capability and this advantage becomes particularly pronounced as the RP approaches size of around 2&#160;nm. Moreover, the developed RP anode shows exceptional expansion tolerance due to the ultrathin structure. Subsequently, the RP are integrated with highly conductive MXene, owing to the ultrasmall amorphous features of RP, the built-in electric field at the RP/MXene heterointerface are enhanced, which significantly promotes Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer and adsorption. As a result, the resulting RP-based composites shows superior rate performance. A high capacity of 835 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; can be maintained at high current density of 10 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, the composites electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 1447&#160;mA h g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at current density of 5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 1000 cycles.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Path Exciton Harvesting Guided by Molecular Packing and Orientation Achieves Highly Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chrysene&#8208;based deep&#8208;blue emitter, PChCz, delivers 21.3% EQE through high&#8208;energy reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC). Co&#8208;deposition with a sensitizer enables triplet recycling via triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA), raising the EQE to 25.5% with reduced roll&#8208;off. This dual&#8208;path exciton&#8208;harvesting strategy, supported by optimized molecular mixing and orientation, provides an effective route toward high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue OLEDs.








ABSTRACT
Efficient and color&#8208;pure deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are of critical significance for next&#8208;generation display technologies, yet the realization remains challenging owing to the stringent requirements of wide bandgap emitters, inefficient exciton utilization, and pronounced efficiency roll&#8208;off. In this study, we proposed a dual&#8208;path exciton harvesting strategy that combines high&#8208;energy reverse intersystem crossing with triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation to improve exciton utilization. The new deep&#8208;blue emitter PChCz, based on the chrysene moiety, exhibits favorable high&#8208;energy reverse intersystem crossing from high&#8208;lying triplet states, enabling non&#8208;doped OLEDs with a peak external quantum efficiency of 21.3%. To alleviate triplet&#8208;polaron annihilation at elevated current densities, a co&#8208;deposited sensitizer is employed to reutilize low&#8208;energy triplet via the triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation mechanism, thereby further improving the external quantum efficiency to 25.5% with suppressed roll&#8208;off. Morphological analysis reveals that co&#8208;deposition enhances compositional homogeneity and optimizes molecular orientation, which are conducive to efficient energy transfer and light outcoupling. Supported by rational molecular design and morphological control, the proposed dual&#8208;path exciton harvesting mechanism presents an effective approach for the development of high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue OLEDs.

         <title>Engineered Oligomeric Indolizine&#8208;Fused BODIPY Fluorophores for Interventional NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Imaging of Acute Cardio&#8208;Cerebrovascular Events</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our work represents a pivotal advancement in the design of indolizine&#8208;fused BODIPY oligomers, specifically engineered for interventional NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging of acute cardio&#8208;cerebrovascular events.








ABSTRACT
Vascular networks are essential for life maintenance, and their dysfunction can result in severe diseases. However, current biomedical imaging modalities possess constraints in diagnosing these diseases. NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging has emerged as a powerful tool, offering rapid feedback, high spatial resolution, and superior biosafety. Among NIR&#8208;II fluorophores, BODIPY oligomers stand out due to their excellent optical performance and versatile tunability. Yet, they confront challenges in design, synthesis, brightness, and blood circulation half&#8208;life. Here, we introduce a novel approach that integrates vascular interventional techniques with NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging, utilizing de&#8208;novo designed and synthesized indolizine&#8208;fused BODIPY oligomers for diagnosing cardio&#8208;cerebrovascular diseases. The synthesized oligomers absorb and emit within the NIR&#8208;II window. Notably, (&#945;&#945;SIFB)4, a representative singly indolizine&#8208;fused tetramer, features highly planar indolizine&#8208;fused BODIPY subunits with a twisted linkage, mitigating detrimental aggregation via suppressed intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Consequently, (&#945;&#945;SIFB)4 demonstrates high brightness, a substantial Stokes shift, and robust chemical and photostability. ((&#945;&#945;SIFB)4@PSMA) exhibits remarkable performance in imaging mouse cardio&#8208;cerebral vasculature. Crucially, direct administration via a interventional catheter addresses the issue of short blood circulation half&#8208;life, significantly enhancing target&#8208;site contrast. Interventional NIR&#8208;II imaging with (&#945;&#945;SIFB)4@PSMA enables real&#8208;time, continuous monitoring of vascular dynamics and visualization of acute cardio&#8208;cerebrovascular events.

         <title>Melt Densification Enables Fracture&#8208;Resistant Blend Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melt densification of miscible polymers enables the formation of highly entangled blend hydrogels with exceptional fracture resistance. The resulting networks combine high stiffness and fatigue thresholds with optical transparency, oxygen permeability, and antifouling performance. This generalizable approach provides a straightforward strategy to design robust functional hydrogels for biomedical and electronic applications.








ABSTRACT
Hydrogels and elastomers are integral components in biomedical and electronics devices, but their toughness and crack resistance are often unsatisfactory for load&#8208;bearing applications. Synthetic polymer networks predominantly rely on solution fabrication, which compromises the ultimate mechanical properties. This work presents a universal melt crosslinking strategy, which densifies entanglements well beyond solvated conditions. When deformed, mutually entangled dissimilar chains stiffen the gels, while sparse crosslinks amplify fracture resistance. At water contents up to 83%, the resultant hydrogels demonstrate over 2 orders increase in mechanical properties, including moduli (1.3&#8211;35 MPa), toughness (0.7&#8211;24.5 kJ/m2), and fatigue thresholds (1.2&#8211;3.3 kJ/m2), tunable in a wide range beyond existing hydrogels. Furthermore, the hydrogels show high optical clarity (&gt;96%), oxygen permeability (Dk/t &gt; 40), and anti&#8208;fouling properties (&lt;0.6&#160;&#181;g cm&#8722;2). This generalizable strategy could guide the design of tough functional soft materials in fields such as healthcare and smart electronics.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Self&#8208;Supply Synthesis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Fe2Mo3O8 Semiconductor Single Crystal With Colossal Ferroelectric Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;self&#8208;supply CVD strategy is designed to synthesize a 2D Fe2Mo3O8 ferroelectric semiconductor. The FeO4 tetrahedral cage contributes to the long displacement of the iron ion and induces the generation of large polarization. Oxygen&#8208;deficient growth environment and ultrathin thickness enable the generation of oxygen vacancy/lattice distortion, which further enhances the polarization. As expected, ultrahigh polarization and ultralong endurance are achieved in Fe2Mo3O8.2








ABSTRACT
Developing ferroelectric semiconductors with colossal polarizations is crucial for fabricating large&#8208;capacity/high&#8208;density memory devices to meet the artificial intelligence demands. Although remarkable ferroelectric polarizations have been uncovered in perovskite&#8208;type oxides, the compatibility with electronic device scaling is becoming an insurmountable bottleneck. Here, we design an oxygen&#8208;self&#8208;supply chemical vapor deposition strategy to synthesize a 2D ferroelectric semiconductor single crystal of Fe2Mo3O8. The unique FeO4 tetrahedral cage contributes to the long displacement of the iron ion and induces the generation of large polarization. In parallel, the oxygen&#8208;deficient growth environment and ultrathin thickness enable the generation of oxygen vacancies and lattice distortion, which further enhance the ferroelectric polarization. As expected, ultrahigh polarization value up to 230 &#181;C/cm2 and ultralong endurance (4 &#215; 109 cycles) are achieved in 2D Fe2Mo3O8, ten to one hundred times larger than most 2D ferroelectric materials. Concurrently, ferroelectric tunnel junctions based on 2D Fe2Mo3O8 exhibit high switching speed and long retention time. This work represents a substantial leap for developing new 2D ferroelectric semiconductors with giant polarizations, which will stimulate the further exploration of large&#8208;capacity/high&#8208;density memory chips to overcome von Neumann architecture bottlenecks.

The unique FeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedral cage contributes to the long displacement of the iron ion and induces the generation of large polarization. In parallel, the oxygen-deficient growth environment and ultrathin thickness enable the generation of oxygen vacancies and lattice distortion, which further enhance the ferroelectric polarization. As expected, ultrahigh polarization value up to 230 &#181;C/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ultralong endurance (4 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; cycles) are achieved in 2D Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, ten to one hundred times larger than most 2D ferroelectric materials. Concurrently, ferroelectric tunnel junctions based on 2D Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; exhibit high switching speed and long retention time. This work represents a substantial leap for developing new 2D ferroelectric semiconductors with giant polarizations, which will stimulate the further exploration of large-capacity/high-density memory chips to overcome von Neumann architecture bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Amorphous Engineering of Transparent High&#8208;Crystallinity Luminescent Nano&#8208;Glass&#8208;Ceramics for Advanced Photonic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a universal amorphous engineering approach that combines amorphous phase separation and glass&#8208;network confinement to achieve ultra&#8208;high crystallinity (&gt;90%) and high optical transparency (&gt;90%) in transparent glass&#8208;ceramics, overcoming the low crystallinity limitation and demonstrating its applicability across various material systems, with potential for advanced optical technologies such as transparent displays, laser&#8208;driven lighting, and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging.








ABSTRACT
Transparent glass&#8208;ceramics are promising materials for advanced applications, but their development is fundamentally constrained by low crystallinity (&lt;70%), leading to significant &#8220;performance deterioration&#8221;. In order to overcome this bottleneck, this study proposes a universal amorphous engineering approach, which synergistically exploits amorphous phase separation and glass&#8208;network confinement. This method promotes heterogeneous nucleation at phase boundaries and spatially restricts crystal growth, achieving ultra&#8208;high crystallinity (&gt; 90%) while maintaining high optical transparency (&gt; 90%). Unlike conventional approaches that rely on specific compositions or crystallization pathways, this broadly adaptable strategy has been successfully extended to fluoride, oxide, perovskite, and sulfide&#8208;based glass&#8208;ceramics, demonstrating its versatility. Upon rare&#8208;earth doping, the composites exhibit superior performance in transparent displays, laser&#8208;driven lighting, and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging. The results provide an adaptable strategy for next&#8208;generation photonic materials in advanced optical technologies.

         <title>An Immune Nanoenhancer Revitalizes Chemotherapeutics to Tailor Tumor&#8208;Derived dsDNA for Anticancer Immunoengineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An immune nanoenhancer transforms machine learning&#8208;optimized chemotherapeutics into potent inducers of immunogenic tumor&#8208;derived DNA, overcoming barriers to cGAS&#8208;STING activation. By integrating rational drug optimization, tumor&#8208;selective delivery, and robust dsDNA release, this platform enables precise immune reprogramming and durable antitumor responses, exemplifying the power of materials design in next&#8208;generation cancer immunotherapy.








ABSTRACT
Immunotherapy has revolutionized the landscape of cancer treatment; however, most current strategies target only isolated steps of the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle and therefore struggle to achieve durable clinical success. Central to immune surveillance, the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway orchestrates innate and adaptive responses by promoting dendritic cell maturation, cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration, and durable immunological memory. However, chemotherapeutic activation of this axis remains elusive due to a paucity of safe, efficacious, and translatable inducers of tumor&#8208;derived double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA). Here, we report a rationally engineered immune nanoenhancer platform&#8211;C&#8208;iNE/A, that reprograms approved chemotherapeutics to initiate robust dsDNA&#8208;driven cGAS&#8208;STING activation in tumors even at low drug doses. Guided by machine learning, we optimize chemotherapeutic encapsulation and combine it with photophysically triggered mild hyperthermia to impair DNA repair while sparing healthy tissues. This cascade promotes intratumoral dsDNA accumulation, immunogenic release, and sustained immune activation. C&#8208;iNE/A elicited potent immune responses across tumor models, enhancing dendritic cell maturation, amplifying cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration, suppressing metastasis, and establishing memory T cell populations. Our approach establishes a generalizable strategy to convert conventional chemotherapeutics into immune activators at safe drug doses, offering a clinically relevant platform to overcome current limitations in STING&#8208;based immunotherapy and advance the next generation of tumor&#8208;immunomodulatory regimens.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Zero&#8208;Gap Glycerol&#8208;Fed Electrolyzer for C3 Chemicals and Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a dynamic, self&#8208;regulating operation strategy that enables selective glycerol electrooxidation in the OER&#8208;free regime, co&#8208;producing C3 chemicals and hydrogen at cell voltages below 1.25 V. Voltage&#8208; and temperature&#8208;resolved analyses define optimal operating conditions, achieving a sustained current density of 500 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8764;1.21 V with &gt;88% C3 selectivity. This work establishes a mechanistically grounded pathway for high conversion, low&#8208;voltage glycerol electrooxidation.








ABSTRACT
The electrochemical oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived glycerol offers a promising low&#8208;voltage alternative to water oxidation in electrolyzers, enabling the co&#8208;production of hydrogen and value&#8208;added chemicals. However, achieving high conversion rates at current densities above 300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 remains challenging due to the rapid deactivation of platinum&#8208;based catalysts. Here, we present a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) featuring a platinum&#8208;decorated nickel foam (Pt/NiF) anode that sustains operation for 24&#160;h at 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with an average cell voltage of just 1.21&#160;V, outperforming all previously reported glycerol&#8208;fed electrolyzers operating below 1.5&#160;V. The system exhibits &gt;88% selectivity toward C3 products, achieving 227&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 partial current density for lactic acid and 9% single&#8208;pass glycerol conversion. In situ impedance spectroscopy identifies voltage&#8208;dependent regimes linked to platinum hydroxide formation, glycerol oxidation, and oxygen evolution. Systematic variation of electrolyte composition and temperature reveals an optimized window (1.2&#8211;1.4&#160;V, 55&#8211;65&#176;C) for sustained performance. Under these conditions, a single 24 h cycle co&#8208;generates &#8764;175&#160;mmol of H2 and 45&#160;mmol of C3 products. These results establish new operational and mechanistic benchmarks for efficient, low&#8208;voltage electrochemical valorization of biomass&#8208;derived polyols at industrially relevant rates.

         <title>A Retina&#8208;Inspired Organic Iono&#8208;Optoelectronic Synapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A retina&#8208;inspired organic photoelectrochemical transistor integrates light sensing with ionic charge modulation using a p&#8208;type mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor and an ionic liquid. Acting as both the light absorber and the semiconducting channel and gate of the transistor, the material enables broadband photodetection and synaptic plasticity akin to retinal processing, generating a building block for biohybrid vision systems.








ABSTRACT
Retina&#8208;inspired neuromorphic systems require seamless integration of light sensing and adaptive synaptic modulation, yet conventional materials fail to integrate ionic charge transport with optoelectronic signal processing. Organic iono&#8208;optoelectronic devices offer a promising solution by coupling the optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers with ionic and electronic transport. Here, we present an organic iono&#8208;optoelectronic synapse enabled by a p&#8208;type mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor (OMIEC). The OMIEC material, gDPP&#8208;MeOT2, a donor&#8208;acceptor polymer comprising a thiophene&#8208;flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole acceptor and methoxy&#8208;bithiophene donor, serves simultaneously as a light absorber and an ion reservoir, enabling light&#8208;modulated mixed charge transport. Our iono&#8208;optoelectronic synapse exhibits broad&#8208;band light detection spanning the visible to near&#8208;infrared range and synaptic plasticity features central to learning processes of the human brain. These results suggest that OMIECs can unify light detection, logic operation, and energy&#8208;efficient information processing, paving the way for next generation biohybrid vision systems and bio&#8208;inspired neuromorphic electronics.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient, Sustainable Cascade Glucose Electrooxidation into Glucaric Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a tandem system that efficiently converts glucose into glucaric acid while generating renewable electricity. By decoupling the oxidation process into two cascaded steps, the system achieves an overall 90% Faradaic efficiency and 80% conversion efficiency at &#8764;0.6 VRHE, significantly reducing energy consumption compared to traditional one&#8208;step routes at &gt;1.2 VRHE.








ABSTRACT
Glucaric acid (GRA) is a critical platform chemical for manufacturing biodegradable materials. Selective glucose (GLU) electrooxidation into GRA provides a sustainable route for biomass valorization. However, conventional methods suffer from energy&#8208;intensive processes due to excessive operational potential exceeding 1.2&#160;V. Here we demonstrate an energy&#8208;efficient tandem system that decouples GRA electrosynthesis into cascade GLU&#8208;to&#8208;gluconic acid (GNA) and GNA&#8208;to&#8208;GRA oxidation. When pairing an Au/C catalyst for selective aldehyde oxidation and an AuPt/C catalyst for hydroxyl oxidation, we achieve 91.8% Faradaic efficiency and nearly 100% conversion efficiency at 0.6 VRHE for GLU&#8208;to&#8208;GNA oxidation, and 81% Faradaic efficiency and 90% conversion efficiency at 0.55 VRHE for GNA&#8208;to&#8208;GRA oxidation. Chronoamperometry demonstrates &#8764;100% substrate conversion with a minor decrease in product selectivity, confirming the catalyst's excellent stability. Our tandem system improves the overall GLU&#8208;to&#8208;GRA energy efficiency from 13.8% for conventional one&#8208;step route to 31.8%. When oxygen reduction is selected as paired reaction, our system not only enables efficient chemical electrosynthesis, but is also estimated to generate electricity of 1.24 &#215; 105&#160;kWh per kiloton GRA, outperforming traditional method with energy consumption of 4.31 &#215; 105&#160;kWh. Our work establishes a sustainable and economically viable pathway for biomass valorization, offering a blueprint for circular, carbon&#8208;neutral chemical production.

         <title>Energy Density Recovery by Enhanced Hydrogen Bonding for High&#8208;Performance Composite Phase Change Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanofillers can improve thermal conductivity of PCM but lower its energy density. We recover the lost energy by strengthening the hydrogen bonds between the fillers and the PCM. This hydroxyl&#8208;modified method almost restores the full latent heat of polyols and also works for acids and hydrated salts, offering a universal strategy to develop composite PCM with both high energy and power density.








ABSTRACT
Phase change materials (PCMs) for thermal energy storage require both high latent heat and high thermal conductivity, which is almost infeasible because the energy&#8208;dense materials are usually poor heat conductors, and increasing their thermal conductivity by making composites inevitably leads to a sacrifice in latent heat. Here, we propose a strategy for recovering the unavoidable loss of energy density of a composite PCM by strengthening the molecular connections between the fillers and matrix PCM. Taking erythritol (a polyol rich in hydroxyl groups) as an example, we use hydroxyl&#8208;modified nanofillers to reconstruct the filler&#8208;to&#8208;PCM intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Compared to unmodified graphene, we observe a remarkable recovery in the latent heat of erythritol using hydroxylated graphene, and verify the extension of this strategy to acids and hydrated salts. We show an almost full recovery of the energy density loss for composite erythritol at 1&#160;wt.% loading, reaching an ultrahigh latent heat of fusion (328.5&#177;0.9 J g&#8722;1). Using molecular simulations, we confirm the formation of strong hydrogen bonds between the model PCM molecules and hydroxylated graphene. Our strategy enables the development of polyol&#8208;based composite PCMs, which can be generalized to other matrix PCMs, toward more balanced performance in high energy density and power density.

         <title>Eutectozymes as Soft Hybrid Materials for Advanced Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eutectozymes are sustainable hybrid materials that embed a GOx&#8211;HRP cascade within hydrophobic eutectogels featuring a dual supramolecular&#8211;covalent network. This architecture preserves native enzyme structure and stability, enables efficient heterogeneous biocatalysis in aqueous media, and positions eutectogels as robust platforms for next&#8208;generation biocatalytic and multifunctional hybrid materials.








ABSTRACT
The development of soft hybrid materials that combine structural integrity, biocompatibility, and catalytic function is a central challenge in advanced biocatalysis. Here, we introduce eutectozymes, enzyme&#8208;loaded eutectogels built from natural hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents (HES) and stabilized through a dual supramolecular polymeric network. This unique architecture not only preserves the conformational integrity of enzymes but also creates confined microcavities acting as protective microreactors, thereby enhancing their stability and substrate affinity. Eutectozymes exhibit remarkable resilience under harsh operational conditions, including high temperatures, extreme pH, and organic solvents, while maintaining high catalytic efficiency and reusability. Their versatility is further demonstrated in environmental remediation, achieving over 90% degradation of recalcitrant dyes, and in antimicrobial applications against resistant bacterial strains. By synergistically merging the stabilizing properties of HES with robust gel matrices, eutectozymes establish a transformative platform for heterogeneous biocatalysis, opening new avenues in biotechnology, bioelectronics, and environmental technologies.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Action Nucleoside&#8208;Based Supramolecular Hydrogel Combats Periodontitis by Disrupting the Bacteria&#8208;Osteoclast Cascade</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PEGylated nucleoside&#8208;based supramolecular hydrogel (APC) is developed to break the pathogenic feedback loop between periodontal bacteria and osteoclast (OC)&#8208;driven bone resorption. Through sequential antibacterial activity and cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8208;protein kinase G (cGMP&#8208;PKG) mediated OC suppression, the hydrogel restores microbial homeostasis and reduces bone loss in vivo, offering a dual&#8208;action platform for inflammation&#8208;associated bone degeneration.








ABSTRACT
Periodontitis is a highly prevalent oral inflammatory disease and a recognized risk factor for multiple systemic disorders. The major therapeutic challenge in periodontitis lies in addressing alveolar bone loss driven by the complex interplay between microbial dysbiosis, immune dysregulation, and bone homeostatic imbalance. Here, we identify a positive feedback loop between periodontal bacteria and osteoclast (OC)&#8208;mediated bone resorption, and design a novel self&#8208;drug delivery system (APC hydrogel) aiming to break this destructive cycle. This supramolecular hydrogel, constructed from PEGylated, structurally optimized nucleoside derivatives, self&#8208;assembles via multivalent hydrogen bonding and demonstrates favorable biocompatibility and metabolic stability in vivo. Functionally, the hydrogel exerts a dual&#8208;action by sequentially eradicating key periodontal pathogens and suppressing OC activity. In a ligation model of periodontitis, local application of the hydrogel restored microbial homeostasis and reduced alveolar bone loss by approximately 60%. Mechanistic investigations revealed that APC metabolites activated the cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8208;protein kinase G (cGMP&#8208;PKG) signaling pathway in OC precursors, thereby blocking their differentiation into mature, bone&#8208;resorbing cells. This dual&#8208;action approach effectively disrupts the pathogenic cascade of microbial infection and osteoclastic bone destruction within a single platform, redefining local therapeutic strategies for periodontitis and highlighting the broader potential of nucleoside&#8208;based supramolecular systems in the treatment of inflammation&#8208;associated bone loss.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Concentration All&#8208;Phosphate Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage and High&#8208;Safety Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;concentration all&#8208;phosphate electrolyte incorporating a newly designed cyclic phosphate solvent (HTP) demonstrates wide potential window, unmeasurably high flash point, excellent nonflammability and thermal stability. This endows the stable operation of 4.5&#160;V graphite||NMC811 cells at extreme temperatures up to 100&#176;C and pass various rigorous safety tests, which is unattainable for previous electrolyte design and can be broadly applicable to other batteries.








ABSTRACT
The majority of safety incidents associated with lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) arise from the utilization of highly volatile and flammable carbonate electrolytes. The adoption of non&#8208;flammable all&#8208;phosphate&#8208;solvent electrolytes could significantly enhance the safety of LIBs. Nevertheless, all&#8208;phosphate&#8208;solvent electrolytes at low&#8208;concentrations (&#8776;1&#160;m) are not compatible with commercial graphite anodes. Herein, we design and synthesize a new six&#8208;membered cyclic phosphate (HTP) with intrinsic graphite passivation ability as electrolyte solvent. Conventional tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) phosphate (FTEP) is introduced as co&#8208;solvent to regulate the electrolyte solvation structure through solvent&#8211;solvent interactions between HTP and FTEP, which facilitates Li+ de&#8208;solvation and contributes to the formation of a highly robust inorganic&#8208;polymeric CEI/SEI. The resulting low&#8208;concentration electrolyte with all&#8208;phosphate&#8208;solvent not only exhibits wide potential window, unmeasurably high flash point, excellent non&#8208;flammability and thermal stability, but also promises the 4.5&#160;V graphite||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 full&#8208;cells to operate stably at extreme temperatures up to 100&#176;C and pass various rigorous safety tests. This work provides new insights into the design of non&#8208;flammable electrolytes for high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;safety LIBs and are broadly applicable to other batteries.

&lt;p&gt;The majority of safety incidents associated with lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) arise from the utilization of highly volatile and flammable carbonate electrolytes. The adoption of non-flammable all-phosphate-solvent electrolytes could significantly enhance the safety of LIBs. Nevertheless, all-phosphate-solvent electrolytes at low-concentrations (&#8776;1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;) are not compatible with commercial graphite anodes. Herein, we design and synthesize a new six-membered cyclic phosphate (HTP) with intrinsic graphite passivation ability as electrolyte solvent. Conventional tris(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) phosphate (FTEP) is introduced as co-solvent to regulate the electrolyte solvation structure through solvent&#8211;solvent interactions between HTP and FTEP, which facilitates Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; de-solvation and contributes to the formation of a highly robust inorganic-polymeric CEI/SEI. The resulting low-concentration electrolyte with all-phosphate-solvent not only exhibits wide potential window, unmeasurably high flash point, excellent non-flammability and thermal stability, but also promises the 4.5&#160;V graphite||LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full-cells to operate stably at extreme temperatures up to 100&#176;C and pass various rigorous safety tests. This work provides new insights into the design of non-flammable electrolytes for high-voltage and high-safety LIBs and are broadly applicable to other batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bridging Acidic and Alkaline Hydrogen Electrocatalysis via Ru&#8208;Modified Pt3Co for Waste&#8208;to&#8208;Energy Electrochemical Neutralization Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study developed a Ru&#8208;modulated ordered P3Co intermetallic electrocatalyst with exceptional cross&#8208;environment hydrogen shuttling capability. Through Ru coordination, the electronic structure of Co is tuned to enhance the hydroxyl binding energy, thereby reconstructing the interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bonding network and water dynamics, which significantly improved the activity of both the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction and the acidic hydrogen evolution reaction.








ABSTRACT
The hydrogen oxidation (HOR) and hydrogen evolution (HER) reactions define the core of hydrogen electrochemistry, yet demand distinct control over hydroxyl binding and interfacial water structuring. Here, we engineer a ruthenium single&#8208;atom anchored Pt3Co intermetallic on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (O&#8208;Pt3Co&#8208;RuNC) to bridge this divide. The catalyst delivers a mass activity 4.1 times higher than Pt/C for alkaline HOR with only 9.3% CO&#8208;induced loss, while simultaneously exhibiting remarkable activity for acidic HER, thus establishing a rare cross&#8208;environment bifunctional platform. Leveraging this property, we design an electrochemical neutralization energy fuel cell (ENFC) that converts acid&#8212;base neutralization energy directly into electricity. Using O&#8208;Pt3Co&#8208;RuNC as both anode and cathode catalyst, the ENFC achieves a peak power density of 75.0&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 and stable operation beyond 400&#160;h while simultaneously neutralizing waste acid and alkali. Operando spectroscopy and theoretical analyses reveal that Ru atoms electronically reprogram adjacent Co sites, strengthening hydrogen bonding in interfacial water and accelerating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. This study offers a blueprint for constructing hydrogen electrocatalysts and hybrid fuel cells that harmonize activity, durability, and sustainable resource utilization.

         <title>Tailored Biodegradable Copolymers With Random&#8208;Block Architecture for High&#8208;Performance Absorbable Tissue Ligation Clips</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A random&#8208;block copolymer (PLCL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA) is innovatively designed for absorbable tissue ligation clips. This tailored molecular architecture combines the flexibility of random PLCL copolymer and the high strength of PLLA homopolymer, providing good rebound ability and strong closure force, along with controlled degradability and biocompatibility. The copolymer highlights a structural innovation that advances next&#8208;generation absorbable tissue ligation clips.








ABSTRACT
To address the balance between mechanical strength and flexibility in absorbable tissue ligation clips, a novel copolymer poly(L&#8208;lactide&#8208;r&#8208;&#949;&#8208;caprolactone)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(L&#8208;lactide) (PLCL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA) with random&#8208;block molecular architecture is developed by integrating the flexibility of PLCL random copolymer and the high strength of PLLA homopolymer. Three random&#8208;block copolymers with different LLA/CL ratios are designed and synthesized. Among them, the copolymer with an LLA/CL ratio of 75:25 (PLC75&#8208;RB) exhibits the most balanced overall performance. The PLC75&#8208;RB copolymer is injected into Hem&#8208;o&#8208;lok&#8211;shaped clips (CLIP75&#8208;RB), and the CLIP75&#8208;RB possesses sufficient closure force and favorable rebound ability, meeting the requirements for tissue ligation. The degradation evaluation indicates that the CLIP75&#8208;RB maintains effective closure force for up to 4 weeks and then begins to degrade gradually. Further validation in a rabbit unilateral nephrectomy model confirms that CLIP75&#8208;RB effectively performs ligation function and subsequently undergoes controlled degradation. The histological analysis demonstrates the good biocompatibility of the clips. The random&#8208;block PLCL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA copolymers expand the range of biodegradable polymers, and the PLC75&#8208;RB exhibits well&#8208;matched mechanical performance and degradation behavior, highlighting the potential for the next generation of absorbable tissue ligation clips.

Enamel&#8208;Mimetic Composites
An enamel analog is fabricated with a gradient structure similar to inner enamel based on the crisscross assembly of aligned hybrid nanowires through a magnetic&#8208;assisted freeze casting and subsequent mechanical compression strategy. The composites exhibit high mechanical performance surpassing the natural tooth enamel, which is fundamentally accounted for the interface reinforcement of gradient structure, crystal/amorphous and organic/inorganic. More details can be found in the Research Article by Junfeng Lu, Tianqi Guo, Hewei Zhao, Lin Guo, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202503537).

         <dc:description>
The nature&#8208;inspired fibrous&#8208;guided direct&#8208;writing strategy, which enables controllable liquid transfer, has demonstrated advantages in making various desired micro&#8208;patterns with cm&#8208;scale uniformity, &#181;m&#8208;scale resolution, and molecular&#8208;scale orientation. This review systematically summarizes the research progress in making micro&#8208;patterns using a fibrous&#8208;guided strategy, including both the fundamentals of liquid manipulation and applications in optoelectronics, as well as the remaining challenges.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed micro&#8208;patterning is a crucial process for making high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices, since the carrier transfer behavior is closely related to the uniformity, orientation, and resolution of micro&#8208;patterns. Developing solution processes with good controllability has thus attracted increasing research interest in the last decade. Inspired by Chinese brushes, a fibrous&#8208;guided direct&#8208;writing strategy is recently developed that enables controllable liquid transfer for making micro&#8208;patterns, which is systematically reviewed from viewpoints of both the fundamentals in liquid manipulation and the applications in optoelectronics. First, a model structure of dual&#8208;conical fibers (CFs) is proposed, whose capacity in liquid transfer is featured as the dynamic liquid balance and the uniform liquid film. On the basis, triple&#8208; and multi&#8208; CFs are developed for transferring liquid onto the target substrate in a controllable manner, where the tri&#8208;phase contact line can be finely tuned. Thereafter, micro&#8208;patterns with &#181;m&#8208;scale resolution, cm&#8208;scale uniformity, and molecular&#8208;scale orientation can be achieved, as is demonstrated by the as&#8208;prepared ultrasmooth quantum dot films, highly aligned silver nanowires films, and wrinkle&#8208;free reduced graphene oxide films, respectively. The high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices, including quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes, flexible transparent electrodes, and pressure sensors, are demonstrated. Perspectives for solution&#8208;processed micro&#8208;patterning in optoelectronics are also suggested.

Life engineering of materials: Constructing life plugins based on artificial materials, and achieving non&#8208;natural transformation and evolution of biological systems through the mutual integration and interaction between materials and life processes. Transform nonliving materials into components of life, breaking the boundaries between traditional material science and life science.








Abstract
Biomineralization is nature's precision engineering system, creating functional biomaterials with exceptional performance through orchestrated organic&#8211;inorganic synergistic interactions. Beyond fundamental investigations into biomineralization processes and mechanisms, research has evolved from structural biomimetics toward creating interdependent material&#8211;organism hybrids through mineralization&#8208;inspired design. Breakthroughs in technologies such as inorganic ion polymerization have significantly advanced strategies for fusing artificial materials with hard tissue regeneration (teeth/bones). Through material&#8211;biological integration strategies such as extracellular assembly, artificial organelle transplantation, and artificial functional tissue construction, the creation of artificial life plugins with enhanced nongenetic biological functions (not directly encoded by the DNA) has been achieved. A key pathway to achieving mineralization&#8208;inspired design lies in the development of a material&#8208;engineered bio&#8208;plugin, the material unit with interfaces characterized by chemically tailored compatibility and programmable bio&#8208;interactions. Materials that can serve as bio&#8208;plugins confer organisms with emergent functionalities such as cell protection, vaccine enhancement, and disease treatment. This review systematically summarizes recent advancements in artificial material&#8211;biological fusion technologies, highlights their critical role in the life engineering of materials, and envisions their potential to catalyze new paradigms in biomedical applications.

         <title>Elastic Energy Storage in Biological Materials: Internal Stresses and Their Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing and storing internally generated elastic energy is a clever strategy by biological materials to perform functions like shape transformation, movement, and predation. This review explores how biological systems manipulate mechanisms like atomic or protein integration into minerals, protein conformational shifts, phase transitions, and osmotic pressure to store and utilize elastic energy&#8212;functioning as &#8220;elastic energy batteries&#8221; to drive biological processes.








Abstract
In the biological world, materials are often heterogeneous and anisotropic, comprising components with very different elastic properties. The resulting structures are exposed to force generation by chemo&#8208;mechanical energy conversion&#8212;such as water absorption, phase separation, or crystallization. Such phenomena may result in strain misfits that generate internal stresses that store elastic energies, which turn out to be extremely useful for enabling functions such as shape change, locomotion, or predation. However, the significance of elastic energy storage has received little attention. In this review, by considering examples of a broad spectrum of biological materials spanning shape&#8208;morphing plant seed pods, smart appendages of crustaceans, ballistic tongues, and damage&#8208;tolerant mineralized tissues, the fundamental aspects involved in the generation, storage, and release of internally generated elastic energies are surveyed. These have major implications for functions such as strengthening and toughening, shape morphing and actuation, ballistic movements, tensegrity, and bending stabilization. How Phenomena such as atomic or protein incorporation into minerals, conformational changes of proteins, phase transformation, and osmotic pressure are manipulated in the biological world to generate function by storing elastic energy are described. Such &#8220;elastic energy batteries&#8221; provide efficient performance and evolutionarily adapted functionality through a smart, structure&#8208;based energy management.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Liquid Crystal Polymer Actuators: From Alignment Regulation to Nano&#8208;composition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of nature&#8208;inspired LCP actuators appears as a bridge between artificial systems and the natural biological intelligence. Here, an overview of the development and cutting&#8208;edge advancements is provided in nature&#8208;inspired LCP actuators, focusing on how alignment regulation and nano&#8208;composition influence their actuation modes and performance. Furthermore, an outlook is proposed for the LCP actuators closer to actual biological muscles and their potential in soft robotics.








Abstract
Liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) that possess crosslinked networks and ordered alignment of mesogens are renowned for their large and reversible anisotropic deformation in response to external stimuli, which holds great potential in the burgeoning field of nature&#8208;inspired actuators and robots. Continuous efforts have been made in revealing the interplay between materials chemistry, processing, and alignment of LCPs, to broaden the actuation modes and enhance the actuation performance toward practical utilization. In this review, the advances in nature&#8208;inspired LCP actuators is focused with special attentions devoted in their mesogen alignment and the macroscopic geometry. Since the mesogen alignment is vital for the attainable actuation modes, the methods for alignment regulating are detailly combed, including surface&#8208;enforced alignment, field&#8208;assisted alignment, mechanical alignment, rheological alignment, and self&#8208;assembly. Subsequently, the composition of nanomaterials is futher surveyed in LCP actuators with a focus on enhancing the actuation performance. Finally, perspectives on the current challenges and potential development trends are discussed, which may shed light on future investigations.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Learning from unique chemical and topological characteristics of natural prototypes, researchers have developed plentiful particle materials for diverse bioanalytical applications. In this review, a comprehensive summary of the advances in nature&#8208;inspired particles, encompassing design principles, preparation methods, and bioanalytical applications is presented. It also critically evaluates the unresolved challenges hindering practical implementations in bioanalysis and proposes some promising research directions.








Abstract
Nature has evolved sophisticated prototypes to achieve functions from efficient separation to selective capture, targeted interaction, and interactive communication. These biological blueprints provide transformative inspiration for engineering advanced particle materials tailored for bioanalytical challenges. This review comprehensively examines recent advances in nature&#8208;inspired particles from natural prototypes to preparation methods and various bioanalytical applications. The design principle of nature&#8208;inspired particles originates from the unique chemical and topological characteristics of natural prototypes including biomolecules (proteins and nucleic acids), subcellular particles (virus, extracellular vesicles (EVs), bacteria, and platelet), cells (erythrocyte, sperm cell, immune cell, and pollen), creatures (urchin and hedgehog), and minerals (zeolites). Various preparation methods have been developed to replicate the intricate features of these prototypes. These nature&#8208;inspired particles have demonstrated effectiveness in bioanalytical applications, such as i) adsorption, separation, and removal of biological molecules, ii) interaction, recognition, and capture of biological particles, iii) biological sensing, and iv) biological imaging. Some existing challenges and potential research opportunities have also been indicated in bioanalytical practice. It is anticipated that more nature&#8208;inspired particles would be created with programmable chemistry and topology, exhibiting integrated functions, and benefiting various practical bioanalytical applications with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data processing.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Multidisciplinary Strategies for Tissue and Organ Cryopreservation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rooted in evolutionary adaptations observed in freeze&#8208;resistant organisms, these bioinspired strategies converge to form a cross&#8208;disciplinary synergy&#8212;harnessing principles from physics, molecular biophysics, supramolecular chemistry, and biomimetic materials science&#8212;to engineer tailored cryopreservation protocols for architecturally diverse biosystems such as tissues and organs. By emulating nature's antifreeze mechanisms, desiccation tolerance, and cold&#8208;adaptive cellular signaling, this paradigm shift addresses the unique thermodynamic and structural challenges of complex biological specimens.








Abstract
Cryopreservation of organs and tissues represents a significant advancement in biomedicine, integrating fields such as cell biology, tissue engineering, and organ transplantation. However, this technique faces substantial challenges, primarily due to ice&#8208;related damage and biological stress responses. This review first highlights these critical obstacles and then examines the sophisticated strategies that various organisms have evolved to survive extreme cold. Key mechanisms include complex biological stress responses (involving cold signal perception, metabolic reconfiguration) and physical ice&#8208;control strategies, such as deep eutectic solvents (DESs), adsorption&#8208;inhibition by ice&#8208;binding proteins (IBPs), and the crowding assemblies such as coacervates and hydrogels. Inspired by these biological principles, the review discusses significant advances in cryoprotection technology: 1) Innovative cold&#8208;adaptation biology applied to organ preservation; 2) Advanced techniques to develop artificial ice&#8208;controlling molecules and materials; 3) Advanced rewarming strategies utilizing nanoparticles. Despite this promising progress, key challenges in translating these laboratory innovations into clinical practice are discussed. Finally, we propose an ideal &#8220;cocktail&#8208;style&#8221; cryoprotectant combining vascular&#8208;targeted nanoparticles for ice control, extracellular matrix&#8208;stabilizing polymers, cell&#8208;specific ice regulators, and metabolic modulators, potentially transforming transplant medicine through global organ banking and advancing regenerative therapies.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Design Strategies for Efficient Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents advances in bioinspired atmospheric water harvesting systems, emphasizing how structural motifs such as wettability gradients, directional transport, and hierarchical porosity have been translated into engineered fog&#8208;collection and vapor&#8208;sorption strategies for enhanced water uptake, accelerated transport, and energy&#8208;efficient release. It outlines the design principles that bridge biological inspiration with practical, scalable solutions to address the global water challenges.








Abstract
The accelerating global scarcity of freshwater, driven by rapid economic growth, environmental degradation, and climate change, has heightened the urgency for the development of advanced atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) strategies. Earth's atmosphere contains an enormous reservoir of &#8776;13 trillion tons of water, exceeding the volume of all accessible surface freshwater, yet it remains vastly underutilized. Effectively utilizing the atmospheric water requires efficient capture and release strategies that can function under diverse climatic conditions. Through millions of years, organisms in both arid and humid environments have evolved specialized structures or surfaces to capture water directly from the atmosphere. This review highlights recent advances in bioinspired AWH systems, emphasizing how structural motifs such as wettability gradients, directional transport, and hierarchical porosity are translated into engineered fog&#8208;collection and vapor&#8208;sorption systems, leading to enhanced water uptake, accelerated transport, and energy&#8208;efficient release. By integrating insights from various complementary approaches, the design principles and fabrication strategies that bridge biological inspiration with practical, high&#8208;efficiency AWH for scalable solutions to address the global water challenges are outlined.

         <title>Bionic Recognition Technologies Inspired by Biological Mechanosensory Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical information recognition technology, which integrates information acquisition, pre&#8208;processing&#160;and processing, promises to enable applications in intelligent robotics, healthcare, and virtual reality. The mechanosensory systems of organisms in nature have inspired to develop mechanical information bionic recognition technology to address the challenges of information acquisition performance and information processing efficiency. In this work, bionic strategies for information pre&#8208;processing, acquisition, and processing are summarized systematically. The potential applications, future challenges, and opportunities of MIBRT are also presented.








Abstract
Mechanical information is a medium for perceptual interaction and health monitoring of organisms or intelligent mechanical equipment, including force, vibration, sound, and flow. Researchers are increasingly deploying mechanical information recognition technologies (MIRT) that integrate information acquisition, pre&#8208;processing, and processing functions and are expected to enable advanced applications. However, this also poses significant challenges to information acquisition performance and information processing efficiency. The novel and exciting mechanosensory systems of organisms in nature have inspired us to develop superior mechanical information bionic recognition technologies (MIBRT) based on novel bionic materials, structures, and devices to address these challenges. Herein, first bionic strategies for information pre&#8208;processing are presented and their importance for high&#8208;performance information acquisition is highlighted. Subsequently, design strategies and considerations for high&#8208;performance sensors inspired by mechanoreceptors of organisms are described. Then, the design concepts of the neuromorphic devices are summarized in order to replicate the information processing functions of a biological nervous system. Additionally, the ability of MIBRT is investigated to recognize basic mechanical information. Furthermore, further potential applications of MIBRT in intelligent robots, healthcare, and virtual reality are explored with a view to solve a range of complex tasks. Finally, potential future challenges and opportunities for MIBRT are identified from multiple perspectives.

However, this also poses significant challenges to information acquisition performance and information processing efficiency. The novel and exciting mechanosensory systems of organisms in nature have inspired us to develop superior mechanical information bionic recognition technologies (MIBRT) based on novel bionic materials, structures, and devices to address these challenges. Herein, first bionic strategies for information pre-processing are presented and their importance for high-performance information acquisition is highlighted. Subsequently, design strategies and considerations for high-performance sensors inspired by mechanoreceptors of organisms are described. Then, the design concepts of the neuromorphic devices are summarized in order to replicate the information processing functions of a biological nervous system. Additionally, the ability of MIBRT is investigated to recognize basic mechanical information. Furthermore, further potential applications of MIBRT in intelligent robots, healthcare, and virtual reality are explored with a view to solve a range of complex tasks. Finally, potential future challenges and opportunities for MIBRT are identified from multiple perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mussel&#8208;Inspired Molecular Strategies for Fabricating Functional Materials With Underwater Adhesion and Self&#8208;Healing Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically examines the nanomechanical mechanisms of mussel&#8208;inspired molecular interactions, primarily investigated by direct force measurement techniques such as surface forces apparatus and atomic force microscopy. The macroscopic adhesive and self&#8208;healing performances of mussel&#8208;inspired functional materials, including coacervates, coatings, and hydrogels, are correlated with the underlying reversible and dynamic molecular interactions.








Abstract
The exceptional underwater adhesion and self&#8208;healing capabilities of mussels have fascinated researchers for over two decades. Extensive studies have shown that these remarkable properties arise from a series of reversible and dynamic molecular interactions involving mussel foot proteins. Inspired by these molecular interaction strategies, numerous functional materials exhibiting strong underwater adhesion and self&#8208;healing performance have been successfully developed. This review systematically explores the nanomechanical mechanisms of mussel&#8208;inspired molecular interactions, mainly revealed&#160;by direct force measurement techniques such as surface forces apparatus and atomic force microscopy. The development of functional materials, including coacervates, coatings, and hydrogels, with underwater adhesion and self&#8208;healing properties, is then summarized. Furthermore, the macroscopic material&#160;performances are correlated with the underlying molecular mechanisms, providing valuable insights for the rational design of next&#8208;generation mussel&#8208;inspired functional materials with enhanced underwater adhesion and self&#8208;healing properties.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Nacre&#8208;Inspired 2D Carbon&#8208;Based Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advancements in nacre&#8208;inspired 2D carbon&#8208;based nanocomposites (TDCNs) based&#8208;graphene and MXene. Innovative fabrication strategies have been developed to align nanosheets while effectively eliminating voids through interfacial bridging, synergistic toughening, and confined assembly. The resulting densified TDCNs demonstrate exceptional fatigue resistance, electrical conductivity, and durability, making them suitable for applications in flexible electronics, bone tissue regeneration, and thermal insulation.








Abstract
Nacre has become the golden standard for the structural design of high&#8208;performance composites due to extraordinary fracture toughness, which exceeds the mixing principle of traditional composites by two orders of magnitude. Surprisingly, the unique biomaterials are formed under ambient temperature and pressure conditions, resulting in low energy consumption and no pollution. It is an effective approach to obtain inspiration from structure&#8208;activity relationships of biomaterials for developing the next&#8208;generation of high&#8208;performance composites. Furthermore, 2D carbon nanomaterials, such as graphene and MXene, having exceptional mechanical and electrical properties, are ideal candidates for fabricating new generation high&#8208;performance composites that would replace carbon fiber (CF) composites. This review systematically summarizes relevant works for high&#8208;performance 2D carbon nanocomposites (TDCNs) inspired by nacre. The review first explores structural insights from the nacre. Next, the fabrication strategies of TDCNs are systematically summarized, with an emphasis on achieving highly aligned 2D carbon nanosheets through advanced assembly techniques. Subsequently, the critical role of void defects, which is a key factor governing the mechanical properties of TDCNs, is addressed by analyzing their formation mechanisms, characterization methodologies, and elimination strategies. Finally, the applications and challenges of high&#8208;performance TDCNs obtained through highly aligned assembly and densification processes are discussed.

         <title>Hofmeister Effect in Flexible Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing the Hofmeister effect for smart elasticity control in flexible devices, this review reveals how ion&#8208;material interactions enable simplified and adaptive mechanical regulation. It highlights applications in flexible electronics, optics, and biomedicine, and outlines a forward&#8208;looking roadmap for developing next&#8208;generation intelligent and responsive materials.








Abstract
The Hofmeister effect has attracted considerable attention for its unique ability to modulate elasticity in flexible devices. Unlike traditional approaches that often involve complex procedures and yield unstable outcomes, the Hofmeister effect enables efficient and controllable elasticity tuning through specific ion&#8208;material surface interactions. This mechanism allows precise regulation of surface wettability, thereby facilitating dynamic adjustment of elastic properties. The review systematically summarizes the research progress on the Hofmeister effect, including its concept, underlying mechanisms, and influencing factors, with a particular focus on its applications in flexible electronics, optics, and biomedical devices. By elucidating the underlying mechanisms of ion&#8208;induced material modulation, the review highlights the potential of the Hofmeister effect to advance the design of next&#8208;generation smart materials. It aims to provide both a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for developing high&#8208;performance flexible systems.

         <title>Natural Cell&#8208;Inspired Nanoparticles: Preparation, Mechanisms, Applications, and Prospects for Clinical Translation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively examines nature cell&#8208;inspired nanoparticles (NCINPs), which achieve molecular&#8208;level emulation of natural cells through precise reconstruction of membrane interfaces. It systematically catalogs diverse natural cell membrane sources, details advanced biofabrication strategies, and elucidates functional mechanisms and therapeutic potential across diverse biomedical applications. The review critically analyzes barriers to clinical translation and discusses potential regulatory solutions for NCINP technologies.








Abstract
Natural cell&#8208;inspired nanoparticles (NCINPs) represent a transformative innovation in nanomedicine, featuring a core&#8211;shell structure coated with isolated natural cell membranes (NCMs) that effectively mimic the functions of native cells. The development of NCINPs achieves molecular&#8208;level emulation of native cells by precisely reconstructing the hierarchical architecture of the bio&#8208;interface, including the structure of the phospholipid bilayer, lipid rafts, protein matrix, and polysaccharide interactions. This advanced biomimetic strategy not only retains the inherent biocompatibility and targeting precision of natural cells but also enables programmable functionalities that surpass those of natural systems, offering enhanced therapeutic potential. In this review, an in&#8208;depth introduction to the background of natural cell&#8208;inspired research is provided, the current prevalent synthesis methods of NCINPs is delineated, and the application mechanisms based on various types of NCMs, as well as their applications in both benign and malignant diseases are elucidated. However, clinical translation faces significant challenges: complex synthesis, compromised membrane functionality, and unpredictable in vivo behavior. The work comprehensively synthesizes the progress, limitations, and challenges encountered throughout the development of NCINPs, while delineating future prospects. Bridging the translational gap from bench to bedside accelerates the clinical translation of NCINPs and fully realizes their therapeutic potential across diverse medical applications.

The development of NCINPs achieves molecular-level emulation of native cells by precisely reconstructing the hierarchical architecture of the bio-interface, including the structure of the phospholipid bilayer, lipid rafts, protein matrix, and polysaccharide interactions. This advanced biomimetic strategy not only retains the inherent biocompatibility and targeting precision of natural cells but also enables programmable functionalities that surpass those of natural systems, offering enhanced therapeutic potential. In this review, an in-depth introduction to the background of natural cell-inspired research is provided, the current prevalent synthesis methods of NCINPs is delineated, and the application mechanisms based on various types of NCMs, as well as their applications in both benign and malignant diseases are elucidated. However, clinical translation faces significant challenges: complex synthesis, compromised membrane functionality, and unpredictable in vivo behavior. The work comprehensively synthesizes the progress, limitations, and challenges encountered throughout the development of NCINPs, while delineating future prospects. Bridging the translational gap from bench to bedside accelerates the clinical translation of NCINPs and fully realizes their therapeutic potential across diverse medical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This review systematically summarizes bioinspired solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) architectures that synergistically integrate membrane separation, adsorption, and photocatalytic processes. Beyond clean water production, the multifunctional SDIE expanded its potential as a pivotal platform for addressing interconnected challenges in resource reclamation and environmental sustainability.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) has emerged as a transformative technology for clean water generation by localizing solar&#8208;thermal energy conversion at the air&#8208;liquid interface. Beyond water production, recent advancements reveal its potential as a pivotal platform for addressing the challenges in resource reclamation and environmental sustainability. Drawing inspiration from plant transpiration mechanisms, particularly ion&#8208;selective absorption, long&#8208;distance transport, and bioactive enrichment, this review systematically examines bioinspired SDIE architectures that synergistically integrate membrane separation, adsorption, and photocatalytic processes. The recent progress is summarized across three tiers: 1) structural biomimetics replicating natural plants, 2) functional hybridization coupling complementary purification mechanisms, and 3) hierarchical integration of multi&#8208;process cascades. The review highlights the recent progress in material innovation and structure design to expand its function. Furthermore, implementation frameworks addressing interfacial engineering, process optimization, and system durability are proposed to bridge lab&#8208;scale prototypes with practical applications. The future prospects are also outlined for multifunctional SDIE technologies to address water&#8208;energy&#8208;resource interdependency, advancing their role in sustainable environmental management.

         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively overviews the latest progress in advanced nanofluidic channels, focusing on optimizing permselectivity to boost ion transport efficiency. It emphasizes the systematic manipulation of nanochannel architectures to balance permeability and selectivity. Finally, it provides forward&#8208;looking insights into the future of osmotic energy conversion, including AI integration in nanofluidic design, expanded applications, and technology integration.








Abstract
As industrialization deepens and population surges, the demand for sustainable energy has emerged as a globally critical challenge. Osmotic energy&#8212;generated from Gibbs free energy between different solutions&#8212;stands out as a viable solution to the energy crisis. The key to efficient osmotic energy conversion is the development of nanofluidic materials with high&#8208;selectivity and high&#8208;flux transmembrane ion transport behaviors. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest progress in advanced nanofluidic channels, focusing on optimizing permselectivity to enhance ion transport efficiency. The systematic manipulation of nanochannel architectures is underscored to navigate the inherent balance between permeability and selectivity. Furthermore, the impact of external field regulation on the controlled ion transport within nanofluidic channels, aiming to boost osmotic energy conversion, is explored. At last, visionary insights into the future of osmotic energy conversion are offered, encompassing the combination with artificial intelligence (AI) in nanofluidic design, the expansion of application landscapes, and the integration with other complementary technologies.

         <title>Superwetting Catalysts: Principle, Design, and Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here strategies for constructing superwetting catalyst systems via physical mixing and chemical modification are highlighted. The physical mixing strategy emphasizes the selection and classification of diverse superwetting inorganic materials and polymers, while the chemical modification approach focuses on the design of molecular sieves, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and single&#8208;atom catalysts with tailored surface wettability.








Abstract
Superwettability has revolutionized catalyst design for multiphase reactions by significantly enhancing interfacial interactions and mass transport. Here the design principles and synthesis strategies of superwetting catalysts are primarily introduced, with a particular focus on their confinement effects and mass transport mechanisms. First, the critical roles of superwettability is highlighted in facilitating efficient reactant mass transport, product desorption, and intermediate confinement within catalysts, which are pivotal for optimizing multiphase reaction systems. Besides, the key strategies, including physical mixing and chemical modification, are summarized to engineer superwettability interfaces in catalysts. Particular attention is given to wettability regulation in porous materials such as molecular sieves, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), emphasizing its effect on improving mass transport and confinement effects. The materials used for superwetting catalysts design are summarized. Finally, future directions, including large&#8208;scale fabrication of superwetting membrane reactors, dynamic wettability tuning under operational conditions, and advanced in situ characterization techniques to capture real&#8208;time triple&#8208;phase interfacial phenomena, are outlined. These advancements are poised to expand the application of superwetting catalysts in sustainable energy, environmental remediation, and industrial catalysis, addressing key challenges in multiphase reaction systems.

         <title>Nanostructured Protein Surfaces Inspired by Spider Silk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing recombinant spider silk technology, bioengineered spidroin variants enable the creation of functionalized nanostructured coatings with tunable affinity for specific targets, supporting a broad range of applications &#8208; from antifouling surfaces and targeted drug delivery to advanced cell therapies and precision bio&#8208;patterning via lithography.








Abstract
Spider silk is renowned for its exceptional mechanical properties, surpassing those of many natural and synthetic materials. This review focuses on biotechnologically produced recombinant spidroin variants inspired by well&#8208;understood major ampullate spider silk proteins (=spidroins), which are role models for understanding molecular composition, architecture, and the nanoscopic and mesoscopic structures formed through self&#8208;assembly and phase separation of spider silk fibers. The use of recombinant spidroins is explored to fabricate functionalized nanostructured surfaces, and molecular engineering is highlighted to tailor the interfacial properties of various morphologies, including particles, capsules, electrospun nanofibers, films/coatings, macroscopic nanofibril&#8208;based hydrogels, and nanohydrogel coatings. One focus is on functionalization of spidroins with peptide tags enabling a variety of affinity&#8208;based targets from cellular markers to inorganic nanoparticles, and allowing for instance specific drug delivery, cell accommodation in hydrogels, or bioselective immobilization of cells on surfaces. Furthermore, applying nanostructured spidroin coatings in combination with photo&#8208; and soft&#8208;lithography techniques is demonstrated, which can be used to produce micro&#8208; and nanostructured patterns exhibiting confined, spidroin&#8208;defined targeting, affinity, or repulsion properties.

         <title>Biological and Biologically Inspired Functional Nanostructures: Insights into Structural, Optical, Thermal, and Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological and biologically&#8208;inspired functional nanostructures with structural, thermal, optical, and sensing applications are reviewed. The role of nanoscale features in biological materials on performance is described, and their blueprints are used for bio&#8208;inspired nanomaterials, synthesized using advanced techniques (i.e., photolithography, bio&#8208;templating, additive manufacturing), demonstrating analogous functional mechanisms and superior performance relative to conventional materials.








Abstract
Biological materials developed over millennia consist of simple biogenic materials, yet exhibit exceptional functional properties. Leveraging design features from these structures with engineered nanomaterial components can lead to bio&#8208;inspired structures that demonstrate superior performance over traditional engineering materials. We describe nanoscale based architectures in biological systems, their role in enhancement of structural, optical, thermal and sensing properties, and their subsequent translation to bio&#8208;inspired structures. In structurally robust biological materials, we highlight nanoscale design features that enhance strength and stiffness, while retaining toughness. In optically active biological materials, we show how periodic nanostructures manipulate electromagnetic waves resulting in structural coloration as well as antireflective and camouflaging properties. Thermally regulating biological materials utilize nanopores and other nanostructural features to statically or dynamically control temperature. In addition, biological materials that are used in sensing utilize various nanostructures that enhance sensitivity by decreasing activation thresholds for signal transduction. We discuss challenges and opportunities including understanding control mechanisms in the formation of biological materials and leveraging advancements in self&#8208;assembly with new additive manufacturing techniques. The continued evaluation of organisms, including those that exhibit multifunctionality, provides not only new design features and pathways, but significant prospects for innovation in this ever&#8208;emerging field.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biological materials developed over millennia consist of simple biogenic materials, yet exhibit exceptional functional properties. Leveraging design features from these structures with engineered nanomaterial components can lead to bio-inspired structures that demonstrate superior performance over traditional engineering materials. We describe nanoscale based architectures in biological systems, their role in enhancement of structural, optical, thermal and sensing properties, and their subsequent translation to bio-inspired structures. In structurally robust biological materials, we highlight nanoscale design features that enhance strength and stiffness, while retaining toughness. In optically active biological materials, we show how periodic nanostructures manipulate electromagnetic waves resulting in structural coloration as well as antireflective and camouflaging properties. Thermally regulating biological materials utilize nanopores and other nanostructural features to statically or dynamically control temperature. In addition, biological materials that are used in sensing utilize various nanostructures that enhance sensitivity by decreasing activation thresholds for signal transduction. We discuss challenges and opportunities including understanding control mechanisms in the formation of biological materials and leveraging advancements in self-assembly with new additive manufacturing techniques. The continued evaluation of organisms, including those that exhibit multifunctionality, provides not only new design features and pathways, but significant prospects for innovation in this ever-emerging field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances in Reactive Microdroplets for Clean Water and Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive microdroplets enable precise and sustainable chemistry at small scales. This review explores their role as confined reactors and dynamic interfaces for synthesizing functional materials, fuels, and microdevices. It offers a critical perspective on how droplet&#8208;based platforms can drive next&#8208;generation technologies in clean energy, environmental remediation, and smart sensing.









Abstract
Microdroplets have emerged as powerful and sustainable platforms for the design and synthesis of functional materials under mild and environmentally friendly conditions. Their unique physicochemical environments &#8208; characterized by high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratios and confined internal space &#8208; enable precise control over mass and heat transfer, interfacial energy conversion, and chemical reactions. These features have been harnessed in two main ways: first, by employing microdroplets as microreactors for the fabrication of advanced materials such as polymeric microlenses, artificial compound eyes, metal oxide nanoparticles, and metal&#8208;organic framework microstructures; and second, by using microdroplets as reactive entities to accelerate interfacial reactions relevant to hydrogen and biodiesel production, as well as nitrogen and carbon dioxide fixation. Together, these strategies have driven significant advances in clean energy generation, environmental monitoring, and water treatment. This review provides a critical overview of recent progress in microdroplet&#8208;assisted synthesis of functional materials and their integration in energy and environmental technologies. An emerging direction in the integration of microdroplet&#8208;based systems into adaptive sensing and human&#8208;machine interfaces driven by artificial intelligence is also&#160;highlighted.

         <title>Automated Label&#8208;Free Assay for Viral Detection and Inhibitor Screening via Biomembrane&#8208;Functionalized Microelectrode Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioelectronic sensor integrating 2D cell membranes with organic microelectrode arrays enables detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 fusion pathways. Natively&#8208;expressed viral receptors promote monitoring of viral entry and screening of antibody&#8208;based inhibitors. Integration with microfluidics further enhances throughput and usability, establishing a powerful platform for investigating viral fusogenicity and accelerating antiviral drug development.








Abstract
Most virus infection assays have indirect readout such as virus number following entry (e.g., PCR, cell lysis). While effective, these technologies are labor&#8208;intensive, require specialized environments (e.g., sterile or RNA&#8208;free), and detect later&#8208;stage viral events like lysis or cell death, lacking sensitivity to early fusion events. To address these limitations, we present biologically relevant 2D membrane materials, host&#8208;cell&#8208;derived supported lipid bilayers (hcd&#8208;SLBs), integrated with organic microelectrode arrays (OMEAs) for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2)&#160;fusion. By overexpressing angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the native membranes, the platform functions as a viral sensor capable of detecting virus pseudo particles (VPPs) through the late pathway. Additionally, hcd&#8208;SLBs extracted from human lung epithelium expressing native ACE2 detect fusion events through the early pathway. The platform's utility as a drug&#8208;screening tool is demonstrated by testing antibodies targeting either the ACE2 on the host membrane or the viral spike (S) proteins. To enhance the throughput, microfluidics are integrated for automation and OMEAs are incorporated within each channel, miniaturizing the testing units. This system supports high&#8208;throughput data generation, automation, and scalability, providing an efficient platform for viral fusion detection that advances the study of pathogen&#8208;host interactions and accelerates antiviral drug discovery.

         <title>A Gradient Enamel&#8208;Mimetic Composite via Crisscross Assembly of Aligned Hybrid Nanowires for Excellent Mechanical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gradient enamel&#8208;mimetic composites (GEMC) are fabricated by the magnetic&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;directional freezing assembly of amorphous ZrO2 layer&#8208;coated hydroxyapatite nanowires and subsequently, scalable layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly with nanowires&#8217; direction crossed stacking. The enamel analog exhibits high strength and toughness surpassing the natural tooth enamel, and simultaneously high stiffness and damping comparable to those of enamel, as well as high fatigue resistance. Such an enamel biomimetic strategy offers guidelines for the engineering of gradient structure materials with excellent mechanical properties.








Abstract
Materials with excellent comprehensive mechanical properties (e.g., strength and toughness, stiffness and damping, fatigue et&#160;al.) are highly desirable for engineering applications, while it is still challenged for design. Tooth enamel is a typical biomaterial with outstanding mechanical properties that originate from its multiscale and gradient structure. Some composites with enamel&#8208;like multiscale structures are successfully synthesized, but mimicking the gradient structure of tooth enamel is still difficult to realize. Here, an enamel analog is fabricated with a gradient structure similar to inner enamel based on the crisscross assembly of aligned hybrid nanowires through a magnetic&#8208;assisted freeze casting and subsequent mechanical compression strategy. The gradient enamel&#8208;mimetic composites exhibited high strength and toughness surpassing the natural tooth enamel, and simultaneously high stiffness and damping comparable to those of enamel, as well as high fatigue resistance. The interface reinforcement of gradient structure, crystal/amorphous and organic/inorganic, fundamentally accounted for high mechanical performance. The gradient design strategy provides an avenue for the engineering of structural materials with excellent mechanical properties.

         <title>How Does a Delicate Insect Wing Resist Damage? Chitin Orientation Is Adapted to the Mechanical Demands at the Nanoscale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale chitin fiber orientations in the insect wing play a critical role in adapting to complex mechanical demands. These findings reveal two distinct and functionally adaptive chitin orientation patterns in the membranes that vary regionally, optimizing mechanical resilience and deformation control. These insights provide a foundation for bioinspired designs in micro air vehicles and advanced fiber&#8208;reinforced materials.








Abstract
Insect wings achieve an extraordinary balance between structural robustness and lightweight flexibility, enabling efficient and durable flight. This performance arises from their hierarchical composite architecture, where nanoscale chitin fiber orientations play a critical role in adapting to complex mechanical demands. Using scanning X&#8208;ray micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;diffraction, the spatial distribution and orientation of chitin fibers in the hindwing of the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria are systematically mapped. These findings reveal two distinct and functionally adaptive chitin orientation patterns in the membranes that vary regionally, optimizing mechanical resilience and deformation control. Finite element simulations further demonstrate how these nanoscale structural adaptations enhance crack resistance, structural integrity, and elastic strain energy distribution, reinforcing vein&#8208;membrane connections for sustained functionality under various loadings. By integrating high&#8208;resolution structural analysis with computational modeling, this study uncovers the sophisticated biomechanical strategies that enable insect wings to endure extreme flight conditions. These insights provide a foundation for bioinspired designs in micro air vehicles and advanced fiber&#8208;reinforced materials.

This work proposes a torrent&#8208;like charge regulation (TCR) strategy that simultaneously enhances charge transport rate and the total amount of charges by combining transistor&#8208;inspired switching architecture and bio&#8208;inspired vascular system. Compared to traditional energy harvesters, the TCR&#8208;based energy harvester increases the energy density by 100 times, achieving a volumetric peak power density over 10 MW&#160;m&#8722;3.








Abstract
The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy harvesters that harness environmental kinetic energy toward realizing battery&#8208;free Internet of Things (IoT) applications are susceptible to low power density owing to low charge density and high output impedance. Here, a new charge regulation strategy is introduced that simultaneously enhances charge transport rate and the total amount of charges, allowing for achieving a volumetric peak power density exceeding 10 MW&#160;m&#8722;3. It is demonstrated that such an enhanced performance results from the synergistic cooperation between a transistor&#8208;inspired switching architecture that accelerates charge transfer rate whereas minimizing internal impedance and a bio&#8208;inspired charge vascular system that enhances the amount of generated charge, together contributing to a torrent&#8208;like charge regulation (TCR). The unique TCR strategy as well as the induced high power output endows a fully battery&#8208;free wireless sensing and communication platform, highlighting its potential to enable sustainable, distributed battery&#8208;free IoT networks in real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Anisotropically Thermal&#8208;Protective Porous Ceramics Enabled by Nacre&#8208;Like Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relying on the porous nacre&#8208;like framework, large&#8208;scale thermal&#8208;protective ceramic is produced via a simple bottom&#8208;up film&#8208;to&#8208;bulk assembly strategy. This porous ceramic achieves the combination of mechanical and anisotropic thermal properties, making it good candidate for complex thermal protection applications.








Abstract
Ever more severe energy dilemma and unfulfilled demands for thermal protection applications have drawn a great interest in developing thermal protective materials. Though great progress is achieved by implementing several advanced micro&#8208;architectures, the conflict between thermal insulation and mechanical properties, along with the complex manufacturing process, remains the main obstacles for fabricating ideal integrated thermal insulation materials. Here, a scalable nacre&#8208;like porous ceramic is reported with a good combination of thermal insulation and mechanical strength (&#8776;0.058&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, 22&#160;MPa) via a bottom&#8208;up film&#8208;to&#8208;bulk assembly. The well&#8208;aligned microplatelets constructed the nacre&#8208;like framework and produced porosity in between for thermal insulation while the mineral bridges between microplatelets connected and strengthened the whole framework. Besides, the structure&#8208;induced anisotropy of thermal conductivity on out&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane directions provides the possibilities for heat management. Moreover, this material shows an excellent fire&#8208;resistance and maintained performance after fire. These structure&#8208;induced integrated superiorities made this material good candidate for complex thermal protection applications.

         <title>Towards Differentiation in Untethered Microactuators: A Soft Fabrication Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces a fabrication strategy for developing soft microactuators with orthogonally programmed shape, texture, and molecular anisotropy. Using microfluidics to generate liquid crystal droplets encased in hydrogel fibers enables the shaping of droplets into various geometries, which are then magnetically aligned and polymerized to give rise to a diverse library of soft microactuators.








Abstract
This work describes a microfluidic high&#8208;throughput fabrication method for untethered soft microactuators which, while initially unspecific, develop distinct shapes, surface textures, and actuation modes based on various environmental cues. Analogous to the core concept of cell differentiation, the central idea of this technique is to apply controlled mechanical and chemical stimuli to a deformable hydrogel fiber and transmit the induced geometrical and textural changes to embedded droplets. Using liquid crystal (LC) monomer droplets as a core allows&#160;us to orthogonally program the geometric, textural, and molecular architecture of the resulting microactuators upon droplet polymerization. Fine&#8208;tuning of the microfluidic parameters yields microdroplets that dry and transform into microparticles with a variety of shapes, including spindle, rod, pancake, dumbbell, pyramid, and worm&#8208;like assemblies with a range of aspect ratios. Leveraging mechanical instability via rapid dehydration of hydrogel fibers allows us to generate and impart stable 3D patterns to the core, resulting in microparticles that vary both in global shape and surface texture. After polymerizing these precursor droplets in a magnetic field to encode the mesogenic orientation, LCE microactuators are realized with a rich library of shapes, surface patterns, and molecular structures, each displaying distinct deformations upon heating, validated via finite element analysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustained, Continuous Jumping of a Light&#8208;Driven Electronics&#8208;Free Insect&#8208;Scale Soft Robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a 301 mg soft robot capable of continuous, autonomous jumping with energy harvesting, actuation, and control embedded in their physical structure without electronics. Coupling snap&#8208;through instability with self&#8208;shadowing of photoresponsive LCEs yields over 188 nonstop and 800 lifetime jumps, with self&#8208;righting, directional locomotion, sensing, and heavy load&#8208;bearing, advancing long&#8208;lived insect&#8208;scale autonomy.








Abstract
Insects scavenge energy from the environment for self&#8208;sustained operation, and some species use repeated jumping to traverse varied terrain. Such capabilities are desirable for surveillance, disaster recovery, environmental monitoring, and hazardous environment exploration. However, insect&#8208;scale (sub&#8208;gram) robots are typically limited to few jumps due to inefficient integration of energy, actuators, and control. Here, insect&#8208;scale (301&#160;mg) soft robots capable of continuous, autonomous jumping with energy harvesting, actuation, and control embedded in their physical structure without electronics are introduced. Powered by constant light, a single robot achieves 188 nonstop jumps and accumulates over 800 jumps in a year without diminished performance. This behavior is enabled by self&#8208;sustained, repeated snapping (SSRS), a light&#8208;driven mechanism from a self&#8208;shadowing&#8208;induced feedback loop based on dynamic light&#8211;material interplay. The SSRS exploits snap&#8208;through instability and self&#8208;shadowing of photoresponsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs), enabling untethered, perpetual actuation, and the snapping dynamics are investigated through simulations and experiments. Beyond sustained motion, the robot demonstrates self&#8208;righting, directional jumping, obstacle negotiation, hazardous gas sensing, and extreme load&#8208;bearing (&#8776;1700 times its weight), highlighting potential for disaster recovery, confined&#8208;space exploration, and environmental monitoring. This work advances insect&#8208;scale robotics toward fully autonomous, long&#8208;lived micro&#8208;robots.

         <title>Heterogeneous Nanopore Arrays &#8211; Selective Modification of Nanopores Embedded in a Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological processes rely on the concerted action of channels with different functionalities embedded in the same membrane. Inspired by nature, heterogeneous nanopore arrays are prepared where two nanopores are connected in parallel and function as two different elements of an ionic circuit: a diode and a resistor. The results provide the basis to design ionic circuits that mimic physiological processes and communication.








Abstract
Much effort in the field of nanopore research has been directed toward reproducing the efficient transport phenomena of biological ion channels. For synthetic nanopores to replicate channel function on the scale of a cellular membrane, it is necessary to consider the modes of crosstalk between channels as well as to develop approaches to prepare nanopore arrays consisting of pores with different transport properties, akin to a membrane in an axon. In this manuscript, first ion concentration polarization (ICP) is identified as the primary means of the crosstalk, and subsequently, the extent and degree of ICP is tuned via targeted chemical modification of the pore walls&#8217; functional groups. Next, two fabrication methods of a model two&#8208;nanopore array are presented in a silicon nitride membrane in which one nanopore contains a bipolar ionic junction and functions as an ionic diode, while the other one is a homogeneously charged ionic resistor. The targeted chemical modification of a thin gold layer at the opening of one pore in an array that leaves the other pore located a few tens of nm away, unmodified, is utilized. These results provide an important framework for designing abiotic ionic circuits that can mimic physiological multichannel ion transport and communication.

         <title>Bioinspired Superwetting Nanomaterials and Beyond: Ultralow Energy Consumption in High&#8208;Efficiency Bio&#8208;Synthesis, Energy Conversion, and Information Transmission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective summarizes the progress of superwettability research in the group. Beyond superwettability, A crucial question is raised: how can life systems achieve ultralow energy consumption (UEC) in high&#8208;efficiency bio&#8208;synthesis/energy conversion/information transmission? The physicochemical essence to achieve these UEC processes is revealed, and a summary and perspective on high&#8208;efficiency bio&#8208;synthesis/energy conversion/information transmission in artificial systems are provided.








Abstract
This Perspective first briefly summarizes the progress of superwettability research in the group over the past 25 years, starting by studying the effect of nanostructure and micro/nanostructure on surface wettability. The intrinsic wetting thresholds for different liquids according to the transition point of superlyophilicty and superlyophobicity on nanostructured surface are experimentally determined, and over 10 superwetting interfacial materials are invented. Recently, the study of dynamic superwettability is focused, which refers to the property of liquids superspreading on 1D or 2D surfaces with micro/nano structures, or partial ordered flow in micro/nano channels, and even the ordered flow of ions and molecules in biological ion channels/water channels/enzyme channels. Furthermore, a crucial question in life science is raised: how can life systems achieve ultralow energy consumption (UEC) in high&#8208;efficiency bio&#8208;synthesis, energy conversion, and information transmission? It is revealed that the ordered directional collective motion of ions/molecules in biological nanochannels is the physicochemical essence to achieve these UEC processes, and provides a summary and perspective on high&#8208;efficiency bio&#8208;synthesis, energy conversion, and information transmission in artificial systems.

De&#8208;Saturation of Single&#8208;Atom Copper Catalysts
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202509221), Jiong Lu, Yafei Zhao, Shibo Xi, and co&#8208;workers introduce a de&#8208;saturation strategy that efficiently converts the CuN4 into CuN3 under a KOH&#8208;mediated Joule thermal shock. The resulting de&#8208;saturated CuN3 catalysts promote copper&#8211;alkyny formation and significantly enhance catalytic performance. Symbolically, the CuN4&#8212;with a molecular weight of exactly 120&#8212;celebrates the 120th anniversary of NUS.

         <title>Advances in In Vitro Modeling of Cancer&#8208;Stromal Interactions: From Fundamental Insights to Translational Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate in vitro recreation of the tumor microenvironment, particularly the complex cancer&#8211;stromal interactions, is essential for deciphering cancer biology and advancing therapies. This review summarizes fundamental design principles for developing physiologically faithful tumor models, surveys recent technological and translational developments, and provides guidance for selecting modeling approaches based on specific&#160;research questions. Outstanding&#160;challenges and future directions are also discussed.








Abstract
Accurate in vitro modeling of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is essential for advancing our understanding of cancer biology and for developing effective anti&#8208;cancer therapeutics. Context&#8208;dependent and patient&#8208;specific, the dynamic interactions between cancer cells and stromal elements significantly affect tumor progression and treatment response. Recent advances in biomaterials, microdevices, and molecular analysis techniques have facilitated the development of in vitro tumor models that better replicate these cancer&#8208;stromal interactions. In turn, these models have deepened the understanding of cancer biology, leading to the discovery of new prognostic markers and establishing preclinical platforms that more reliably predict clinical outcomes. However, challenges persist in fully capturing the immense complexity of the TME and translating these models for real clinical impact. In this review, key design principles for creating physiologically relevant tumor models are first described, then the latest advances in tumor modeling that have contributed to new biological insights and progress in drug development are discussed.

         <title>From Pollution to Value: Electrochemical Systems for Transforming Flue Gas into Chemicals and Fuels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a comprehensive overview of the strategies whereby low&#8208;concentration CO2 in flue gas can be directly valorized to value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels. It covers recent progress in integrated CO2 capture and conversion, including amine and bi(carbonate) reduction&#8208;based systems. This study also focuses on how the presence of impurities such as oxygen, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides can be overcome.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) can enable the production of fuels and chemicals from CO2 emissions. Direct flue gas conversion can address the emissions from hard&#8208;to&#8208;abate sectors, including cement, steel, and power generation industries. Such integration with SCO2RR can also decarbonize the petrochemical industry and eliminate separation and purification steps. Here, recent progress and emerging opportunities for transformative flue&#8208;gas&#8208;tolerant systems for producing fuels and chemicals are reviewed. The review begins by analyzing recent progress in direct flue gas conversion and highlighting emerging micro&#8208;reaction environment features. Next, performance degradation mechanisms associated with flue gas conversion in CO2RR systems are discussed. Following this, the bicarbonate reduction reaction (BRR) and CO2RR from amine&#8208;based capture as emerging strategies for high&#8208;rate, selective, and stable electrosynthesis of chemicals from feeds containing low CO2 concentrations are highlighted. Finally, the mitigation of flue gas impurities such as oxygen, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides, is discussed,&#160;and perspectives for emerging opportunities are shared.

This review highlights recent advances in 2D open framework materials (2D OFMs), including metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), with a focus on programmable pore architectures and functional skeletons. It underscores the critical roles of porosity and framework design in facilitating adsorption and membrane&#8208;based separations, as well as in developing semiconductors with electronic properties vital for energy storage and conversion applications.








Abstract
2D open framework materials (2D OFMs), including metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), have emerged as a versatile class of materials that combine atomic precision, intrinsic porosity, and tunable chemical functionality. By bridging the structural features of inorganic layered materials with the chemical diversity of organic polymers, 2D OFMs provide unique opportunities in molecular separations, semiconductors, and related technologies. Their in&#8208;plane periodicity and layered architectures enable precise control over pore environment, stacking mode, and electronic coupling, thereby unlocking structure&#8211;property relationships not accessible in conventional porous materials. This review highlights recent advances in the topological design of 2D OFMs, incorporating functional skeletons and programmable pore architectures, as well as emerging characterization techniques capable of resolving structural details or providing high&#8208;resolution imaging at the atomic scale. Particular attention is given to the roles of porosity and the framework skeleton in enabling adsorptive and membrane&#8208;based separations, as well as to semiconductors with electronic properties that underpin energy storage and conversion applications. By providing a comprehensive overview of current progress and future directions, this review underscores the technological promise of 2D OFMs. The advances summarized here establish a foundation for further innovation and practical deployment across diverse scientific and engineering domains.

         <title>Advances in Intelligent Nano&#8208;Micro&#8208;Scale Sensors and Actuators: Moving toward Self&#8208;Sustained Edge AI Microsystems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a system&#8208;level synthesis of advances enabling next&#8208;generation Edge&#8208;AI microsystems: transduction materials and mechanisms, hybrid photonic&#8211;MEMS platforms, rigid and stretchable devices, in/near&#8208;sensor computing, and tribo/piezo energy harvesting. Integrating photonics&#8208;enabled sensing and AI across edge and cloud will yield autonomous, human&#8208;centric systems and energy&#8208;aware AIoT, including digital&#8208;human twins and city sensing commons across healthcare, industry, and smart cities.








Abstract
Over recent decades, nano&#8208;micro&#8208;scale sensors and actuators have evolved from discrete microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) components. As demand for maintenance&#8208;free systems grew, developments emphasized integrating energy harvesting into sensing platforms and deploying self&#8208;powered sensors that utilize piezoelectric and triboelectric transducers. Such co&#8208;localization enabled self&#8208;sustained Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things (IoT) deployments, supporting continuous operation without external power and improving network autonomy and scalability. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) at the sensor edge has further transformed these platforms into intelligent AI&#8208;of&#8208;Things (AIoT) systems, enabling multimodal analytics, adaptive decision&#8208;making, and immersive human&#8211;machine interaction. Concurrently, advances in photonics&#8212;including mid&#8208;infrared, terahertz, and near&#8208;infrared technologies&#8212;have produced sensitive molecular and chemical sensors with improved selectivity and spectral resolution. These advances have also yielded photonic integrated circuits capable of ultrafast in&#8208;sensor computation and real&#8208;time Bayesian photonic neural inference, delivering sophisticated edge&#8208;AI processing with low latency and power consumption. Hybrid systems that combine flexible wearable electronics with integrated photonic platforms have emerged, allowing direct transduction and interpretation of mechanical and physiological signals from flexible sensors via photonic chips. Progress in materials, packaging, and system co&#8208;design underpins reliability and operation in harsh environments. Together, these advances foreshadow highly integrated, self&#8208;sustained edge&#8208;AI microsystems that embody perpetual, real&#8208;time intelligence and seamless user&#8211;environment interaction.

         <title>Targeted ROS Scavenging for Disease Therapies Using Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging nanomaterials, their mechanisms, classifications, and targeting strategies for disease treatment. It discusses progress, challenges, and perspectives for future clinical applications of ROS&#8208;related nanomedicines.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential by&#8208;products of cellular metabolism and serve as key mediators in cell signaling and homeostasis. Excessive ROS production is associated with cellular damage and various diseases. Therefore, targeted ROS scavenging may enhance therapeutic efficacy and minimize side effects. With significant progress in nanotechnology, various nanomaterials with targeted ROS&#8208;scavenging properties have been developed to modulate ROS levels in biological microenvironments. In this review, the mechanisms underlying ROS generation and elimination in humans and in ROS&#8208;related diseases are first outlined. The latest advancements in ROS&#8208;scavenging nanomaterials, particularly their mechanisms and composition&#8208;based classifications, are then focused on. Strategies for improving the targeting ability of ROS&#8208;scavenging nanomaterials and their application in the therapeutics of ROS&#8208;induced diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, acute kidney injury, diabetic wounds, and cancer are highlighted. Finally, the challenges faced by ROS&#8208;targeted nanotherapeutics are discussed, and possible alternatives to accelerate their clinical translation are proposed.

         <title>Recent Advances in Impurity&#8208;Induced Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), emphasizing the critical role of trace impurities. Their origins, mechanisms, and potential applications are discussed for RTP systems while underscoring the importance of purity analysis to avoid misinterpretations and ensure an accurate understanding of RTP mechanisms.








Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with large Stokes shifts and prolonged afterglows are gaining increasing attention in a variety of applications, including displays, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensing, and bioimaging. However, achieving high&#8208;performance organic RTP remains challenging due to weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling, rapid non&#8208;radiative decay, and unstable triplet excitons. Early studies focused on crystal engineering, as ordered lattices restrict molecular motion and stabilize triplet excitons. Analyzing crystal structures and packing provides valuable insights into intermolecular interactions, while theoretical calculations have clarified electronic structures, laying the foundation for rational RTP material design. However, recent findings suggest RTP in many single&#8208;component systems may arise from trace impurities, significantly influencing RTP properties. This discovery has greatly advanced the understanding of impurity&#8208;induced phosphorescence. This review systematically examines the role of impurities in RTP, detailing their origins from starting materials, solvents, and side reactions. It also explores how these identified impurities can serve as essential building blocks for designing new RTP materials. Finally, essential methods for evaluating compound purity, emphasizing the critical importance of rigorous analysis and validation are presented. Material purity plays a pivotal role in RTP research, as impurities can distort experimental data, potentially leading to misinterpretations that can impede advancements in understanding the underlying mechanisms.

The tunability of band gap enables wide bandgap perovskites to serve as top subcells shared by various emerging tandem technologies. Based on the application of wide bandgap perovskites in perovskite/silicon, perovskite/perovskite, perovskite/organic, and perovskite/CIGS tandem solar cells, this review outlines the theory, progress, challenges, and future path of wide bandgap perovskites.








Abstract
The global demand for clean energy is driving the need for next&#8208;generation solar technologies with higher power conversion efficiencies. Multijunction solar cells, which stack absorbers with cascaded bandgaps, offer a compelling path forward by more efficiently utilizing the solar spectrum. Among these, metal halide perovskites stand out for their bandgap tunability, enabling efficient tandem solar cells (TSCs) when paired with a range of semiconductors&#8212;including perovskite/perovskite, perovskite/silicon, perovskite/organic, and perovskite/CIGS. Central to these architectures are wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites, which harvest high&#8208;energy, short&#8208;wavelength photons. This review highlights recent advances and challenges in perovskite&#8208;based TSCs, focusing on the photophysical properties and application of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites across different tandem configurations. Future research directions are outlined aimed at enhancing performance and long&#8208;term stability to accelerate industrial deployment.

         <title>Utilize Natural Forces in Water Treatment Through 3D&#8208;Printed Structures: From Purification to Clean Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review investigates recent advances in 3D&#8208;printed functional materials and devices that utilize natural forces for water treatment, including oil/water separation, photodegradation, desalination, and photovoltaic water splitting for clean energy, with a particular focus on the unique benefits conferred by structural design. Integrated design and modular manufacturing workflow are proposed, promoting standardized production and collaborative development to accelerate design iteration.








Abstract
The utilization of natural forces for water purification has long been a pursuit of scientific and technological interest, offering the potential to reduce both energy consumption and secondary pollution associated with conventional processes. Structural materials play a pivotal role in water treatment by harnessing natural forces, such as gravity, capillarity, and solar energy, to purify water or even to generate clean energy from water, enabling structure&#8208;determined properties beyond material functionality. With their advantages in design freedom and structural customization, 3D printing techniques offer significant potential for materializing these designs into functional devices. This review investigates recent advances in 3D&#8208;printed materials and devices that utilize natural forces for water purification, including gravity&#8208;driven oil/water separation, solar&#8208;powered photodegradation, solar evaporation desalination, and photovoltaic water splitting for clean energy, with a particular focus on the benefits conferred by structural design. Harnessing the holistic design freedom and modular manufacturing capabilities afforded by 3D printing, the approach proposes an integrated water treatment system where an oil/water separator and a photodegradation module are assembled with solar evaporators to generate purified water for photovoltaic water splitting. This design aims to establish a conceptual framework that enables rapid iteration, collaborative innovation, and digital model&#8208;based standardization across the field.

         <title>Dry Transfer of CVD Graphene Film Using Adhesion Switchable Ferroelectric Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic charge doping of graphene can tailor its adhesion to the copper surface, thus enabling etchant&#8208;free dry delamination. A switchable ferroelectric P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) film first acts as a graphene transfer support layer, where polarization controls adhesion to peel graphene from copper, and subsequently releases graphene onto SiO2 substrates upon depolarization. This method yields clean graphene with low crack density and is extendable to other 2D materials.








Abstract
Although chemical vapor deposition (CVD) produces meter&#8208;scale, high&#8208;quality graphene (Gr) on copper (Cu) foils, its practical integration is hampered by challenges in the transfer process. Conventional wet transfers are slow, produce chemical waste, and lack scalability, whereas existing dry transfer methods struggle with mechanical damage and residues due to strong Gr&#8208;Cu adhesion and the difficulty in precisely tuning interfacial forces. Here, a fully dry, industrially compatible transfer platform utilizing a ferroelectric poly(vinylidene&#8208;fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) film with electrostatically switchable adhesion, serving as both a mechanical support and a transfer layer, is demonstrated. Negative Corona poling of P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) induces p&#8208;type doping in graphene. Density Functional Theory calculations confirm that this simultaneously reduces Gr&#8208;Cu adhesion while increasing P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)&#8208;Gr adhesion, enabling clean, large&#8208;scale graphene delamination from Cu foils with &gt;99% coverage. Subsequent thermal annealing above P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)&#8217;s Curie temperature (&#8776;135&#160;&#176;C) depolarizes the film, neutralizing the interfacial charge for a clean release. The versatility of this method is shown for other two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, including molybdenum disulfide and hexagonal boron nitride. Crucially, the process has been validated on cm&#8208;scale samples using a fully automated system with a transfer time of &lt;5 min, highlighting a viable path toward industrial&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;quality 2D material films.

         <title>Spatially Programmable Electroadhesive Enables In Situ Site&#8208;Selective Functional Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;activated, in situ spatially programmable bioadhesive (STICH) enables microscale, site&#8208;selective integration of bioelectronic devices with wet tissue. It achieves robust mechanical bonding and low&#8208;impedance electrical coupling, enabling reconfigurable neuromodulation and directional electromechanical sensing in vivo and ex vivo.








Abstract
Precise intraoperative integration of bioelectronic devices with wet tissue surfaces remains a challenge due to the limited spatial control of adhesion sites. Here, an in situ spatially programmable electrical bioadhesive (termed &#8220;STICH&#8221;)&#160;is reported that enables site&#8208;selective adhesion and functional coupling via light&#8208;activated bonding with wet biological tissue. Upon irradiation with patterned green light, Rose Bengal in a chitosan/silver nanowire hydrogel matrix generates singlet oxygen, which oxidizes amino acid residues into carbonyl groups on the tissue surface. The covalent bonding is then formed between the newly formed reactive carbonyl group and amine groups on chitosan. The spatially programmable adhesive allows robust tissue bonding with a lap&#8208;shear strength of 160&#160;kPa and precise adhesion regions at &#8776;2 &#181;m resolution. The light&#8208;patternable adhesive enables spatially resolved mechanical coupling for directional electromechanical sensing on ex vivo cardiac tissue. The low impedance adhesive interface also provides spatially programmed electrical coupling for in vivo neuromuscular stimulation on intraoperatively selected muscle groups. This platform advances microscale device&#8208;tissue integration and paves the way for reconfigurable bioelectronic therapies.

         <title>Self&#8208;Spiking Linear Neuromorphic Soft Pressure Sensor for Underwater Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel design of a neuromorphic pressure sensor that can generate self&#8208;spiking symmetric signals with direct event&#8208;based encoding through the integration of magnetic spheres and alternating coil circuits. The key advantages of this work include high linearity up to 200&#160;kPa (R2&#160;=&#160;0.997), self&#8208;spiking behavior for simplified signal processing, and robust underwater stability.








Abstract
Many aquatic vertebrates rely on neuromasts in their lateral line system to detect water vibrations and pressure gradients. These neuromasts contain specialized hair cells that function as mechanoreceptors, converting mechanical stimuli into electric signals for brain processing. While neuromorphic sensors can emulate biologic sensory systems, they are facing significant challenges in underwater stability and complex data processing. Here, a bioinspired neuromorphic soft pressure sensor designed for stable underwater performance and simplified signal processing is proposed. This is achieved through a novel integration of micro&#8208;magnetic spheres, a microfluidic channel, and alternating coil connections. This sensor exhibits self&#8208;spiking behavior upon applied force with high linearity (R2&#160;=&#160;0.997) in response to pressure changes up to 200&#160;kPa. The proposed mechanism generates distinct magnetic action potentials via its alternating coil design, enabling efficient signal processing. This artificial neuromast achieves 92.19% accuracy in game control applications and 94.71% accuracy in underwater object recognition using machine learning. Additionally, the sensor was validated in both experimental ocean basins and open&#8208;sea environments, confirming its potential for underwater robotics, ocean environmental monitoring, and marine industrial applications.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Coordinated Trienzyme Nanogel Cascade Therapy for Accelerated Post&#8208;Pancreatectomy Cutaneous Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc&#8208;coordinated nanogel assembly is reported that co&#8208;delivers three enzymes to regulate glucose, oxidative stress, and oxygen levels. This system mimics natural enzyme cascades to reprogram the wound environment after pancreatectomy. In a post&#8208;pancreatectomy mouse model, it accelerates healing by reducing infection, promoting blood vessel growth, and supporting tissue regeneration. The design offers a modular strategy for post&#8208;surgical therapy.








Abstract
Orchestration of enzyme cascades in synthetic systems remains a major challenge for catalytic control in complex biological environments. Here, a zinc&#8208;coordinated tri&#8208;enzyme nanogel system (Zn@nGSC) is reported that mimics natural enzymatic assemblies by confining individual glucose oxidase (GOX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) within an imidazole&#8208;functionalized polymeric nanogel matrix. The nanogel is fabricated via mild in situ polymerization combined with Zn2&#8314;&#8208;imidazole coordination, yielding structurally stable multi&#8208;enzyme assemblies. The engineered assemblies demonstrate simultaneous preservation of enzymatic activity and enhanced cascade efficiency under thermal and proteolytic stress. Cascade reactions proceed as follows: i) glucose is depleted by GOX, ii) superoxide radicals are scavenged by SOD to alleviate oxidative stress, and iii) residual H2O2 is converted into oxygen by CAT in order to mitigate hypoxia. Functionally, Zn@nGSC restores redox balance and metabolic homeostasis, demonstrated in a murine model of post&#8208;pancreatectomy wound healing, with emphasis on treating hyperglycemia and improving regeneration. Another pronounced advantage of Zn@nGSC treatment is its antibacterial effect, which enhances angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and immune modulation. Overall, this modular nanoplatform provides a blueprint for designing robust, bioresponsive cascade systems with therapeutic potential in metabolically compromised microenvironments.

     alt="Zinc-Coordinated Trienzyme Nanogel Cascade Therapy for Accelerated Post-Pancreatectomy Cutaneous Wound Healing"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A zinc-coordinated nanogel assembly is reported that co-delivers three enzymes to regulate glucose, oxidative stress, and oxygen levels. This system mimics natural enzyme cascades to reprogram the wound environment after pancreatectomy. In a post-pancreatectomy mouse model, it accelerates healing by reducing infection, promoting blood vessel growth, and supporting tissue regeneration. The design offers a modular strategy for post-surgical therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orchestration of enzyme cascades in synthetic systems remains a major challenge for catalytic control in complex biological environments. Here, a zinc-coordinated tri-enzyme nanogel system (Zn@nGSC) is reported that mimics natural enzymatic assemblies by confining individual glucose oxidase (GOX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) within an imidazole-functionalized polymeric nanogel matrix. The nanogel is fabricated via mild in situ polymerization combined with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;-imidazole coordination, yielding structurally stable multi-enzyme assemblies. The engineered assemblies demonstrate simultaneous preservation of enzymatic activity and enhanced cascade efficiency under thermal and proteolytic stress. Cascade reactions proceed as follows: i) glucose is depleted by GOX, ii) superoxide radicals are scavenged by SOD to alleviate oxidative stress, and iii) residual H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is converted into oxygen by CAT in order to mitigate hypoxia. Functionally, Zn@nGSC restores redox balance and metabolic homeostasis, demonstrated in a murine model of post-pancreatectomy wound healing, with emphasis on treating hyperglycemia and improving regeneration. Another pronounced advantage of Zn@nGSC treatment is its antibacterial effect, which enhances angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and immune modulation. Overall, this modular nanoplatform provides a blueprint for designing robust, bioresponsive cascade systems with therapeutic potential in metabolically compromised microenvironments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reconfigurable Magnetotransport in MnBi2Te4 via Gate and Magnetic Field Tuning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gate&#8208;tunable magnetoresistance sign reversal under in&#8208;plane magnetic fields is observed in an ultrathin MnBi2Te4 device, arising from spin reorientation and distinct scattering mechanisms. Moreover, angular&#8208;dependent measurements reveal clear gate&#8208;controlled magnetotransport anisotropy, underscoring the strong coupling between gating, spin configuration, and transport behavior in MnBi2Te4.








Abstract
The intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 is a promising platform for exploring quantum phases with nontrivial band topology and for enabling electrical control over coupled magnetic and electronic phase transitions. In&#8208;plane magnetic fields, in particular, offer a distinct means of tuning these properties by strengthening quantized Hall effects, enhancing surface energy gaps, and driving spin reorientation transitions. However, a systematic understanding of how such fields affect magnetotransport is limited. Here, the magnetotransport behavior of few&#8208;layer MnBi2Te4 as a function of gate voltage, temperature, and magnetic field angle, with a primary focus on in&#8208;plane field effects, are investigated. A gate&#8208;tunable crossover in magnetoresistance is observed from positive to negative values under in&#8208;plane magnetic fields as the gate voltage is swept below the charge neutrality point at temperatures below the N&#233;el temperature. The in&#8208;plane field drives a transition from the antiferromagnetic ground state to a ferromagnetic configuration with spins aligned in&#8208;plane, while simultaneously altering the electronic structure, as revealed by gate&#8208;dependent transport features. The angle&#8208;dependent measurements reveal strongly gate&#8208;tunable magnetotransport anisotropy. These results establish in&#8208;plane magnetic fields as an effective tuning parameter for modulating spin and charge transport in MnBi2Te4, advancing prospects for reconfigurable spintronic and topological devices.

         <title>Rhus Chinensis &#8208; Inspired Vertical Hierarchical Structure for Solar &#8208; Driven All &#8208; Weather Co &#8208; Harvesting of Fresh Water, Clean Salts, and Authigenic Electricity</title>

The unsatisfactory outdoor performance and potential contamination of recovered products limit the wider practical deployment of interfacial solar evaporators. In response, we develop a Rhus chinensis &#8208; inspired vertical hierarchical structure (RVHS) to achieve all &#8208; weather extraction of fresh water, clean salt, and authigenic electricity.








Abstract
The escalating challenges in water, energy, and environmental sustainability necessitate the efficient utilization of diverse water sources, such as seawater and wastewater. Herein, a Rhus chinensis &#8208;inspired vertical hierarchical structure (RVHS) is developed to achieve all &#8208; weather extraction of fresh water, clean salt, and authigenic electricity. The RVHS achieves high water production rates of 5.07&#160;kg m&#8722;2 during the day and 2.04&#160;kg m&#8722;2 at night, approximately 1.2 times and 1.8 times those of conventional ones, respectively, by strategically&#160;manipulating phase change material (PCM) and heat storage. Simultaneously, it enables an enhanced salt recovery of 2.24&#160;kg m&#8722;2, yielding purified salt free from detectable contaminants (such as microplastics and persistent organic pollutants), facilitated by a pollutant capture trap integrated into the RVHS, a feature rarely explored in prior research. Furthermore, during salt recovery, the optimized salt concentration gradient can be further utilized for energy harvesting with high power output through thermodynamic optimization, which is approximately 60% greater than traditional devices. Further performance improvements can be realized by optimizing thermodynamic structures or integrating higher &#8208; performance materials. In conclusion, this work offers a universal routine for solar &#8208; driven resource recovery from seawater.

         <title>HZO/HSO Superlattice ReFET Array Integrating Optical Sensing for Neuromorphic Vision Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photonic ReFET array with an engineered HZO&#8211;HSO superlattice enables monolithic integration of optical sensing, nonvolatile memory, and synaptic computation. It exhibits forming&#8208;free, &gt;8&#8208;bit analog states, &gt;1010 endurance cycles, and light&#8208;tunable conductance. Integrated into a 20&#160;&#215;&#160;20 array, it achieves 94.45% accuracy on Fashion&#8208;MNIST in an in&#8208;sensor vision transformer.








Abstract
Neuromorphic vision systems require artificial synapses that integrate sensing, memory, and computation with high precision and stability. Conventional memristors face limitations including forming requirements, few multilevel states, low endurance, and poor integration density, while ferroelectric and flash&#8208;based transistors suffer trade&#8208;offs among endurance, retention, and switching ratio, and generally lack intrinsic photonic sensitivity, constraining in&#8208;sensor computing. Here, a photonic resistive&#8208;gate field&#8208;effect transistor (ReFET) array is presented that combines optical sensing, forming&#8208;free multilevel memory, and analog computation in a single device. The ReFET employs a Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/Hf0.95Sr0.05O2 (HZO/HSO) superlattice gate and an amorphous InGaZnO (IGZO) channel, achieving 272 stable conductance states (&gt;8&#8208;bit) in a 20&#160;&#215;&#160;20 array, ON/OFF ratios &gt;10&#8310;, endurance &gt;1010 cycles, and retention &gt;10&#8310;&#160;s. The array functions as an in&#8208;sensor optical convolutional layer, performing multiply&#8211;accumulate (MAC) operations with 94.45% accuracy on Fashion&#8208;MNIST using 8&#8208;bit quantized weights, while delivering high energy efficiency. This platform enables scalable, high&#8208;precision, energy&#8208;efficient photonic neuromorphic computing, integrating sensing, memory, and computation in one architecture.

         <title>3D Photonic Metacrystals with Enhanced Collective Mie Resonances for Dual Structural Coloration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents high&#8208;quality 3D CdS metacrystals with long&#8208;range order that suppress radiation losses, yielding 13&#8208;fold enhanced magnetic Mie resonances (Q = 17) and dual nonfading structural coloration. &#160; Wafer&#8208;scale inkjet printing using metafluid inks of CdS and ZnS nanoparticles demonstrates stable coloration and angle&#8208;sensitive hues F.








Abstract
3D photonic crystals offer nonfading structural coloration and complex optical properties through coupled Mie resonances in high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index materials. Although strong magnetic resonances make them promising, they often suffer from optical losses in the visible spectrum. Enhancing Mie resonances and quality factors through collective coupling in lithographically ordered arrays has been demonstrated. However, large&#8208;area applications using self&#8208;assembled colloidal resonators in metafluid inks have been limited by&#160;inadequate monodispersity and insufficient surface charge, hindering effective ordering. Here, we report high&#8208;quality 3D Mie&#8208;resonant metacrystals formed by high&#8208;temperature self&#8208;assembly of CdS nanoparticles (refractive index 2.5). Their long&#8208;range ordering attenuates local density of states overlapping with Mie resonances, minimizing external radiation losses and yielding&#160;one order of magnitude enhancement in collective Mie behavior. A 13&#8208;fold enhancement in magnetic Mie resonances with quality factors reaching 17 is experimentally demonstrated. The structures produce Bragg peaks that coexist with enhanced collective Mie resonances, enabling angle&#8208;dependent, dual nonfading structural coloration across the visible and near&#8208;infrared spectrum. As a proof of concept, wafer&#8208;scale inkjet printing using metafluid inks of CdS and ZnS nanoparticles demonstrates stable coloration and angle&#8208;sensitive hues. This work opens new avenues in durable structural coloration and multifunctional optical platforms for applications such as ultrasensitive polarimetry and advanced optical sensing.

&lt;p&gt;This work presents high-quality 3D CdS metacrystals with long-range order that suppress radiation losses, yielding 13-fold enhanced magnetic Mie resonances (Q = 17) and dual nonfading structural coloration. &#160; Wafer-scale inkjet printing using metafluid inks of CdS and ZnS nanoparticles demonstrates stable coloration and angle-sensitive hues F.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D photonic crystals offer nonfading structural coloration and complex optical properties through coupled Mie resonances in high-refractive-index materials. Although strong magnetic resonances make them promising, they often suffer from optical losses in the visible spectrum. Enhancing Mie resonances and quality factors through collective coupling in lithographically ordered arrays has been demonstrated. However, large-area applications using self-assembled colloidal resonators in metafluid inks have been limited by&#160;inadequate monodispersity and insufficient surface charge, hindering effective ordering. Here, we report high-quality 3D Mie-resonant metacrystals formed by high-temperature self-assembly of CdS nanoparticles (refractive index 2.5). Their long-range ordering attenuates local density of states overlapping with Mie resonances, minimizing external radiation losses and yielding&#160;one order of magnitude enhancement in collective Mie behavior. A 13-fold enhancement in magnetic Mie resonances with quality factors reaching 17 is experimentally demonstrated. The structures produce Bragg peaks that coexist with enhanced collective Mie resonances, enabling angle-dependent, dual nonfading structural coloration across the visible and near-infrared spectrum. As a proof of concept, wafer-scale inkjet printing using metafluid inks of CdS and ZnS nanoparticles demonstrates stable coloration and angle-sensitive hues. This work opens new avenues in durable structural coloration and multifunctional optical platforms for applications such as ultrasensitive polarimetry and advanced optical sensing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bio&#8208;Resorbable Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;resorbable magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is presented that combine on&#8208;demand data erasure, transient functionality, and biocompatibility, making them suitable for secure, short&#8208;lived electronics. Through dissolution studies under physiological conditions, this is demonstrated that MTJ functionality can be removed within 10 h. Moreover, the bio&#8208;resorbable lifetime can be tuned by selecting appropriate materials and adjusting the layer thickness of individual layers.








Abstract
Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) play a crucial role in spintronic applications, particularly data storage and sensors. Especially as a non&#8208;volatile memory, MTJs has received substantial attention due to its CMOS compatibility, low power consumption, fast switching speed, and high endurance. In parallel, bio&#8208;resorbable electronics have emerged as a promising solution for systems requiring temporary operation and secure data disposal, especially in military, intelligence, and biomedical systems where devices must safely disintegrate under physiological conditions. In this study, the bio&#8208;resorbability of MTJ is investigated by analyzing the dissolution behavior of its nanometer&#8208;thick constituent layers in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline solution at pH 7.4, simulating physiological environments. The MTJ structures, composed of bio&#8208;resorbable materials, exhibit well&#8208;controlled degradation behaviors. Critically, as one of the ferromagnetic layers dissolves, binary information is irreversibly lost, within 10 h of immersion. These findings highlight the potential of MTJs not only as high&#8208;performance memory elements but also as secure, transient data storage platforms. The ability to modify the dissolution lifetime by materials and thickness selection offers unique advantages for short&#8208;lived implantable devices, paving the way for integrating spintronic functionality into next&#8208;generation bioresorbable electronics.

         <title>Ce Single Atom&#8208;Engineered Amorphous/Crystalline Nanosheets for Enhanced Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We leveraged Ce single&#8208;atom engineering to generate short&#8208;range ordered crystalline nanodomains in amorphous RuOx for creating amorphous/crystalline nanojunctions, in an effort to regulate the water dissociation kinetics for enhanced HER. Specifically, the Ce&#8208;doped crystalline nanodomains greatly reduce the energy barrier to water dissociation and possess optimal free energy for H* adsorption, which collectively contributes to the enhanced HER performance.








Abstract
Designing nanocatalysts with fast water dissociation kinetics is key to achieving the industrial current density of the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for green hydrogen production via water electrolysis, which remains a grand challenge. Here, leverage single&#8208;atom engineering,a Ce single&#8208;atom&#8208;doped amorphous RuOx nanosheet featuring abundant amorphous/crystalline nanojunctions, namely, ac&#8208;CeSARuOx is successfully developed. When employed as a catalyst for alkaline HER, the ac&#8208;CeSARuOx catalyst displays an overpotential of only 8.3 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope as low as 23.1&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, outperforming the Ru&#8208;based catalysts reported in recent studies. Anion exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) tests using ac&#8208;CeSARuOx as the cathode catalyst exhibit a low cell voltage of 1.71 V at 1000 mA cm&#8722;2, and the performance can be well maintained after 300 h. In situ spectroscopic analyses demonstrate the increased coverage of OH species on ac&#8208;CeSARuOx for enhanced water dissociation. Density function theory calculations suggest that the Ce&#8208;doped crystalline nanodomains in the amorphous/nanocrystalline nanojunction could effectively reduce the energy barrier to water dissociation, while the Ce&#8208;doped amorphous constituents regulate the H* adsorption, which collectively boost the HER performance. This work offers a new strategy to create amorphous/nanocrystalline nanojunctions in nanocatalysts for enhanced electrocatalysis.

         <title>Tailoring Graphite Interlayers with Electron&#8208;Acceptor Bridges Raises Ion Diffusion Kinetics for Ultrafast Charging Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study systematically identifies and develops an electron&#8208;acceptor aluminum chloride pre&#8208;intercalation graphite. The pre&#8208;intercalated graphite builds C&#9472;Cl&#9472;Al&#9472;C electron&#8208;acceptor bridges within the graphite interlayers, which facilitate charge transfer kinetics during lithium&#8208;ion diffusion and storage, thereby enabling fast&#8208;charging performance in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Sluggish solid&#8208;state diffusion kinetics of lithium ions is among the primary bottlenecks limiting the fast&#8208;charging performance of graphite anodes. Pre&#8208;intercalating molecules in graphite interlayers can tune the valence &#960;&#8208;electrons, but there are few systematic studies in designing such structures by electron coupling to optimize the charge transfer kinetics. Herein, deliberately guided by simulations, the present study identifies and develops a class of electron&#8208;acceptor aluminum chloride species for intercalation into graphite (AC&#8208;G), aiming to accelerate lithium ions charge transfer to the intercalated graphite through the formation of electron&#8208;acceptor bridges within the graphite interlayers. Consequently, the AC&#8208;G achieves a two&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement in lithium ions diffusion coefficient (5.85 &#215; 10&#8722;7 cm2 s&#8722;1) compared to that in pristine graphite. It delivers stable cycling over 2000 cycles with a high areal capacity retention of 3.84 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 1C and maintains 500&#8208;cycle stability at 5C. Furthermore, an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell assembled with AC&#8208;G and cathode achieves an energy density of 285&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 3C. The present work provides a new design strategy for graphite by introducing interlayer electron&#8208;bridging structures, offering valuable insights for next&#8208;generation fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries

         <title>De&#8208;Saturation of Single&#8208;Atom Copper Catalysts for Accelerating Propargylic Substitution Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
De&#8208;saturation of copper&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (De&#8208;sat SACs) are realized by a KOH&#8208;mediated Joule thermal shock strategy. Benefiting from the under&#8208;saturation coordination environment of single&#8208;atom Cu center, De&#8208;sat Cu SACs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity in propargylic substitution reactions, tolerating a broad range of nucleophiles (N&#8211;, C&#8211;, and O&#8211;), as well as diverse aryl, alkyl, tertiary, and cyclic propargylic carbonates.








Abstract
Rational design of proximal coordination microenvironments surrounding catalytic sites to achieve optimal reaction kinetics represents a paramount pursuit in single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), yet continues to pose substantial synthetic challenges. Developing innovative strategies that simultaneously stabilize low&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;metal species on solid supports, while ensuring atomic precision and high activity, remains imperative. Herein, a de&#8208;saturation strategy for SACs is demonstrated (denoted as De&#8208;sat SACs) using a top&#8208;down approach based on a KOH&#8208;mediated Joule thermal shock to obtain under&#8208;coordinated and asymmetric SACs for efficient organic synthesis. Using copper&#8208;based SACs as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the de&#8208;saturation strategy effectively converts the CuN4 to CuN3 configuration. The De&#8208;sat Cu SACs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity in propargylic substitution reactions, tolerating a broad range of nucleophiles (N&#8211;, C&#8211;, and O&#8211;), as well as diverse aryl, alkyl, tertiary, and cyclic propargylic carbonates. The coordination reduction in these De&#8208;sat SACs not only breaks the structural symmetry to enhance site accessibility but also elevates the energy of the dz2${d}_{{z}^{2}}$ orbital of Cu atom, thereby facilitating the formation of copper&#8211;alkynyl intermediates and boosting their catalytic performance. These findings establish a new platform for the rational design and synthesis of de&#8208;saturated yet stable SACs, facilitating challenging catalytic transformations toward sustainable chemical manufacturing.

Benefiting from the under-saturation coordination environment of single-atom Cu center, De-sat Cu SACs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity in propargylic substitution reactions, tolerating a broad range of nucleophiles (N&#8211;, C&#8211;, and O&#8211;), as well as diverse aryl, alkyl, tertiary, and cyclic propargylic carbonates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rational design of proximal coordination microenvironments surrounding catalytic sites to achieve optimal reaction kinetics represents a paramount pursuit in single-atom catalysts (SACs), yet continues to pose substantial synthetic challenges. Developing innovative strategies that simultaneously stabilize low-coordinated single-metal species on solid supports, while ensuring atomic precision and high activity, remains imperative. Herein, a de-saturation strategy for SACs is demonstrated (denoted as De-sat SACs) using a top-down approach based on a KOH-mediated Joule thermal shock to obtain under-coordinated and asymmetric SACs for efficient organic synthesis. Using copper-based SACs as a proof-of-concept, the de-saturation strategy effectively converts the CuN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to CuN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; configuration. The De-sat Cu SACs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity in propargylic substitution reactions, tolerating a broad range of nucleophiles (N&#8211;, C&#8211;, and O&#8211;), as well as diverse aryl, alkyl, tertiary, and cyclic propargylic carbonates. The coordination reduction in these De-sat SACs not only breaks the structural symmetry to enhance site accessibility but also elevates the energy of the dz2${d}_{{z}^{2}}$ orbital of Cu atom, thereby facilitating the formation of copper&#8211;alkynyl intermediates and boosting their catalytic performance. These findings establish a new platform for the rational design and synthesis of de-saturated yet stable SACs, facilitating challenging catalytic transformations toward sustainable chemical manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Energy&#8208;Confined Multi&#8208;Layer Inkjet Printing for Customizable Optical Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface energy&#8208;confined multi&#8208;layer inkjet printing strategy is developed for customizable fabrication of 3D optical microstructures. By combining interfacial energy confinement with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer processing, various 3D curved optical microstructures with tailorable morphology, material composition, and spatial configuration are precisely fabricated and integrated, offering great promise for applications in miniaturized optical systems, multi&#8208;dimensional imaging, and high&#8208;security encryption.








Abstract
Inkjet printing emerges as a versatile on&#8208;demand patterning technique for additive manufacturing of optical microstructures, yet its ability to regulate the ink droplet morphology is constrained by the intrinsic interplay between ink&#8208;substrate wetting conditions, thereby hindering the customizable fabrication of 3D microstructures. Here, a surface energy&#8208;confined multi&#8208;layer inkjet printing strategy is developed for precisely fabricating curved optical microstructures with tunable size, solid angle, and configuration. The strategy is implemented through custom&#8208;engineered layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer printing on a pre&#8208;patterned substrate with spatially defined interfacial energy barriers, enabling the precise construction and integration of distinct optical microdomes (characterized by substrate attachment and uniform curved profiles) at the microscale. Notably, the strategy facilitates the high&#8208;throughput printing of diverse topological microdomes, ranging from triangular to hexagonal architectures. The as&#8208;fabricated microdomes, featuring precisely engineered morphology and sub&#8208;nanometer surface roughness, exhibit integrated light&#8208;field manipulation capabilities and unique multifocal characteristics, highlighting their potential for miniaturized optical systems and intelligent imaging devices. Beyond UV&#8208;cured polymers, this methodology is extendable to nanomaterial&#8208;based micro&#8208;3D printing (e.g., colloidal photonic crystal microdomes), opening avenues for more sophisticated optical functionalities. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a non&#8208;imaging multidimensional encryption platform is printed leveraging 3D morphology&#8208;tailored optical readout.

The emerging galvanic&#8208;cell&#8208;based self&#8208;powered bioelectronics for biomedical applications with passive and active control strategies are summarized. In addition, the challenges and opportunities for galvanic devices are also discussed.








Abstract
Bioelectronic devices hold significant promise for advancing biomedical technologies, addressing critical healthcare challenges, and improving the quality of human life. Conventional bioelectronic devices are typically powered by external, bulky batteries connected by extended electrical wires, which limit the compactness and miniaturization of bioelectronics, restrict patient mobility, and increase the risk of complications such as infections and device&#8208;related failures. This perspective discusses the emerging concept of galvanic&#8208;cell&#8208;based self&#8208;powered bioelectronic devices, in which galvanic electrodes serve directly as the tissue&#8208;contacting interfaces. We provide an overview of the principles and working mechanisms of biocompatible galvanic cells in galvanic devices for diverse biomedical applications, including electrical modulation, chemical and biochemical modulation, and hybrid electrical/(bio)chemical modulation, along with their control strategies: passive control and active control. Furthermore, we envision that the advancement of galvanic devices will represent a promising direction for biomedical applications, despite the presence of inherent challenges.

         <title>Materials Design and Assessment of Redox&#8208;Mediated Flow Cell Systems for Enhanced Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;mediated flow cells, which operate on an electrochemical&#8208;chemical cycle, shift desired reactions from electrode compartments to dedicated reactors and enable diversified applications for high&#8208;density flow batteries, fuel cells, CO2 capture, electrosynthesis, waste recycling, etc. This perspective outlines the material selection criteria, evaluation methods, and targeted design strategies toward next&#8208;generation applications.








Abstract
The transition toward sustainable energy systems necessitates innovations that overcome the limitations of conventional electrochemical systems. Redox&#8208;mediated flow cell systems emerge as a transformative paradigm by decoupling energy storage, conversion, and chemical processes from traditional electrode&#8208;bound reactions. These systems employ soluble redox mediators to shuttle electrons between electrodes and spatially separated reactive phases (solid, liquid, or gas), thereby enabling unprecedented operational flexibility and scalability. This standpoint underscores the adaptability of redox&#8208;mediated electrified systems across a range of applications, encompassing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density redox targeting&#8208;based flow batteries, fuel cells, electrified CO2 capture, sustainable chemical synthesis, waste recycling, etc. The rational design of redox&#8208;active materials is central to their success, with precise alignment of redox potentials, enhanced electron&#8208;transfer kinetics, and robust stability underpinning performance. The challenges of new materials development, system durability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness can be addressed through advances in experimental measurement, computational modeling, operando characterization, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Moving forward, the integration of redox&#8208;mediated technologies with renewable energy systems and industrial processes is predicted to transform energy and chemical landscapes. The integration of laboratory innovations with real&#8208;world deployment facilitates a pathway to decarbonization, resource efficiency, and the circular economy. This perspective emphasizes the pivotal functions of redox&#8208;mediated architectures in fostering a robust, electrified future, where the convergence of energy storage, environmental stewardship, and sustainable chemical production is pivotal in addressing global challenges.

         <title>Precise Surface Engineering of Metal Nanoclusters: Ligand Programming for Functionality Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand programming offers a precise strategy to tune metal nanocluster surfaces at the atomic level. By controlling metal&#8208;ligand coordination, intra/inter&#8208;ligand interactions, and interfacial chemistry, this approach enables customizable structures with enhanced catalytic, optical, and biomedical functions. This work highlights how precise surface engineering transforms metal nanoclusters into smart platforms for next&#8208;generation materials.








Abstract
Precise surface engineering of metal nanoclusters (MNCs) has emerged as a powerful strategy for tailoring their structural, electronic, and catalytic properties. On the basis of traditional surface chemistry, ligand programming enables atomic&#8208;level control over MNC functionality by modulating metal&#8208;ligand coordination, intra/inter&#8208;ligand interactions, and interfacial chemistry. These three layers within the &#8220;Engineering Zone&#8221; define structural flexibility, charge transfer pathways, molecular rigidity, and surface accessibility, key factors in optimizing catalytic activity, luminescence efficiency, and molecular recognition. This Perspective explores the chemistry governing ligand&#8208;directed MNC behavior in the three layers, highlighting its role in catalysis, photonics, and biomedicine. By integrating coordination chemistry, intra/inter&#8208;ligand design, and interfacial interactions, how ligand programming transforms MNCs is demonstrated into tunable platforms for next&#8208;generation functional materials. Insights from MNCs also provide a model for advancing surface engineering in broader nanomaterials, paving the way for innovative applications in materials science.

Flexible Integration Method for Flexible Electronics
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202417590), Kenjiro Fukuda, Takao Someya, Tomoyuki Yokota, and co&#8208;workers present a novel hybrid direct bonding method that enables both gold and parylene bonding without adhesives. This technique enables the connection of wiring and devices without increasing thickness, thereby providing high flexibility, mechanical robustness, and electrical conductivity required for integrated, flexible devices. Leveraging this method for flexible electronics integration promises the development of flexible stacked devices.

         <title>Designing Physical Unclonable Functions From Optically Active Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assigning unforgeable &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; to manufactured goods is a key strategy to fight global counterfeiting. Optical physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are chemically generated random patterns of optically active materials serving as unique authenticators. Here, recent advances in optical PUF devices are presented for anticounterfeiting via an overview of available optical taggants and compatible fabrication techniques.








Abstract
Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are artificial &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; provided by physical devices to authenticate manufactured goods. Their inherent unclonable nature positions them as one of the most promising tools to tackle global counterfeiting challenges.

&lt;p&gt;Assigning unforgeable &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; to manufactured goods is a key strategy to fight global counterfeiting. Optical physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are chemically generated random patterns of optically active materials serving as unique authenticators. Here, recent advances in optical PUF devices are presented for anticounterfeiting via an overview of available optical taggants and compatible fabrication techniques.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are artificial &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; provided by physical devices to authenticate manufactured goods. Their inherent unclonable nature positions them as one of the most promising tools to tackle global counterfeiting challenges. Leveraging the large parameter space in solution chemistry, chemically generated PUFs can achieve excellent device performance. Particularly, optically active materials have become valuable security inks thanks to their versatile, non-invasive, and non-destructive readouts, and PUF devices generated from stochastic nano-/micro-patterns of optical inks hold great potential. This review highlights recent advances in the design of optical PUF devices. A range of resonant and non-resonant optical materials used as security taggants are presented and their incorporation in state-of-the-art PUF devices is examined using non-deterministic fabrication techniques. By outlining design criteria, challenges, and opportunities, a roadmap is provided for developing next-generation PUFs using established and emerging optical probes and help advance security and reliability in anticounterfeiting technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
The field of nanophotonics has seen remarkable advances, with gold&#8208;based materials standing out. By precisely fine&#8208;tuning the size and shape of metal nanoparticles (NPs), such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), it has been possible to gain control over light interaction, modulating localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), a phenomenon that involves the collective oscillation of free conduction electrons. This has opened the path toward more powerful biomedical applications, including surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and photothermal therapy (PTT). When AuNPs dimensions fall below 2 nm, they become gold nanoclusters (AuNCs), losing the LSPR but acquitting fluorescence due to their molecule&#8208;like behavior. This unique feature makes them ideal for high&#8208;resolution imaging, biomarker detection, and advanced therapies. Beyond traditional uses, the recent inclusion of AuNPs into nanomotors (NMs) enhances precise in vivo tracking and targeted drug delivery. This review highlights the different applications of plasmonic nanomaterials with particular emphasis on AuNPs and AuNCs as a function of their shapes, sizes, and stabilization ligands. Moreover, it dives into the biosensing applications of plasmonic materials by addressing their so&#8208;called far&#8208;field and near&#8208;field optical properties, giving a detailed overview of different high&#8208;sensitivity immunoassays and biosensing. A comprehensive outlook on the evolution of plasmonic&#8208;based materials for the next therapies is provided.

         <title>Unperceivable Designs of Wearable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unperceivable wearable technologies seamlessly integrate into everyone's daily life, for healthcare and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things applications. By remaining completely unnoticed both visually and tactilely, by the user and others, they ensure medical privacy and allow natural social interactions. Herein are introduced recent strategies employed at material, design, and integration levels to reach unperceivable technologies, whether through transparent materials or strategically hidden devices.








Abstract
Wearable smart electronics are taking an increasing part of the consumer electronics market, with applications in advanced healthcare systems, entertainment, and Internet of Things. The advanced development of flexible, stretchable, and breathable electronic materials has paved the way to comfortable and long&#8208;term wearables. However, these devices can affect the wearer's appearance and draw attention during use, which may impact the wearer's confidence and social interactions, making them difficult to wear on a daily basis. Apart from comfort, one key condition for user acceptance is that these new technologies seamlessly integrate into our daily lives, remaining unperceivable to others. In this review, strategies to minimize the visual impact of wearable devices and make them more suitable for daily use are discussed. These new devices focus on being unperceivable when worn and comfortable enough that users almost forget their presence, reducing psychological discomfort while maintaining accuracy in signal collection. Materials selection is crucial for developing long&#8208;term and unperceivable wearable devices. Recent developments in these unperceivable electronic devices are also covered, including sensors, transistors, and displays, and mechanisms to achieve unperceivability are discussed. Finally, the potential applications are summarized and the remaining challenges and prospects are discussed.

         <title>Selective Lipolysis by Photoactivation of Chaperone&#8208;Mediated Autophagy Using Adipocyte Membrane&#8208;Coated Nanoparticle in Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adipocyte membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles loaded with rosiglitazone in hydrogel offer an alternative approach to conventional obesity treatments. This system selectively targets adipocytes, inducing lipolysis by activating chaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy through mild photothermal stimulation. Demonstrating significant weight loss in animal models, this nanomaterial&#8208;based strategy holds promise for obesity management and other autophagy&#8208;related disorders.








Abstract
Despite the clinical importance of obesity, treatments have been confined to surgery or drugs, both of which carry adverse effects. Herein a nanomaterial consisting of adipocyte membrane&#8208;coated and rosiglitazone&#8208;loaded polydopamine nanoparticles embedded in hydrogel (ARNP&#8208;H) is designed aiming to induce selective lipolysis in adipocyte through activation of chaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy (CMA) by mild photothermal heat stress. Adipocyte membrane&#8208;coated and rosiglitazone&#8208;loaded polydopamine nanoparticles (ARNP) are taken up by adipocyte to a significantly greater extent than other cell membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles. Adipocyte interactions with ARNP are significantly higher than those with other cells such as macrophages and T cells. ARNP&#8208;H enabled selective activation of CMA in adipocytes, increasing levels of heat shock cognate protein 70, a key component of CMA. Colocalization of heat shock cognate protein 70 and breakdown of CMA substrate perilipin 2, led to enhancement of adipose triglyceride lipase access to lipid droplets, initiating lipolysis. In high&#8208;fat diet&#8208;fed mice, ARNP&#8208;H retention at the local injection site is greater than in other groups, maintaining photothermal responsiveness for over 3 days. ARNP&#8208;H treatment significantly enhanced adipocyte lipolysis and led to substantial weight loss. While this study focuses on obesity model, ARNP&#8208;H for CMA photoactivation holds potential for treating other diseases associated with autophagy dysregulation.

         <title>Wideband Tuning and Deep&#8208;Tissue Spectral Detection of Indium Phosphide Nano&#8208;Laser Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces indium phosphide (InP) nanolaser particles operating in the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;I (NIR&#8208;I) spectrum, with ultrawide tunability (740&#8211;970&#160;nm) and nanometer&#8208;scale linewidths. Optimized for deep&#8208;tissue imaging and multiplexed barcoding, these particles offer excellent stability, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios in scattering media, and biocompatibility, making them highly promising for advanced biomedical research and applications.








Abstract
Laser particles (LPs) emitting narrowband spectra across wide spectral ranges are highly promising for high&#8208;multiplex optical barcoding of biological cells. Here, LPs based on indium phosphide (InP) nanodisks are presented, operating in the near&#8208;infrared wavelength range of 740&#8211;970&#160;nm. Utilizing low&#8208;order whispering gallery resonance modes in size&#8208;tuned nanodisks, an ultrawide color palette with 25% spectral utilization and nanometer&#8208;scale linewidth is achieved. A simple theoretical model accurately predicts spectral ranges based on particle size. The minimum laser size is 430&#160;nm in air and 560&#160;nm within cells, operating at mode orders of 4 or 5. The high brightness and narrow linewidths of polymer&#8208;silica&#8208;protected InP LPs, combined with a silicon&#8208;detector spectrometer, enable spectral detection of laser peaks with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios in highly&#8208;scattering media, including 1&#8208;cm&#8208;thick chicken breast tissue and blood vessels in live mice.

Mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing materials that can reversibly and resiliently change color in response to stress are highly desirable for diverse technologies in optics, sensors, and robots; however, such materials are rarely achieved. This work reports a fatigue&#8208;resistant mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing hydrogel that exhibits reversible, resilient, and predictable color changes under mechanical stress, for tactile robots by translating tactile sensations into visual images.









Abstract
Mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing materials that can&#160;reversibly&#160;and resiliently change color in response to mechanical deformation are highly desirable for diverse modern technologies in optics, sensors, and robots; however, such materials are rarely achieved. Here, a fatigue&#8208;resistant mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing hydrogel (FMCH) is reported that exhibits reversible, resilient, and predictable color changes under mechanical stress. At its undeformed state, the FMCH remains dark under a circular polariscope; upon uniaxial stretching of up to six times its initial length, it gradually shifts its color from black, to gray, yellow, and purple. Unlike traditional mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing materials, FMCH maintains its performance across various strain rates for up to 10 000 cycles. Moreover, FMCH demonstrates superior mechanical properties with fracture toughness of 3000 J m&#8722;2, stretchability of 6, and fatigue threshold up to 400 J m&#8722;2. These exceptional mechanical and optical features are attributed to FMCH's substantial molecular entanglements and desirable hygroscopic salts, which synergistically enhance its mechanical toughness while preserving its color&#8208;changing performance. One application of this FMCH as a tactile sensoris then demonstrated for vision&#8208;based tactile robots, enabling them to discern material stiffness, object shape, spatial location, and applied pressure by translating stress distribution on the contact surface into discernible images.

         <title>Multifunctional Neural Probes Enable Bidirectional Electrical, Optical, and Chemical Recording and Stimulation In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Convergence drawing is used to create flexible, microscale, multifunctional fiber&#8208;based neural probes. Optimized materials selection enables individual devices to perform neural recording, electrical stimulation, optogenetics, fiber photometry, fluid delivery, and voltammetric neurotransmitter detection in rodents. These bidirectional tools may permit multimodal interrogation of neural signaling across multiple brain regions in mechanistic and translational studies.








Abstract
Recording and modulation of neuronal activity enables the study of brain function in health and disease. While translational neuroscience relies on electrical recording and modulation techniques, mechanistic studies in rodent models leverage genetic precision of optical methods, such as optogenetics and fluorescent indicator imaging. In addition to electrical signal transduction, neurons produce and receive diverse chemical signals which motivate tools to probe and modulate neurochemistry. Although the past decade has delivered a wealth of technologies for electrophysiology, optogenetics, chemical sensing, and optical recording, combining these modalities within a single platform remains challenging. This work leverages materials selection and convergence fiber drawing to permit neural recording, electrical stimulation, optogenetics, fiber photometry, drug and gene delivery, and voltammetric recording of neurotransmitters within individual fibers. Composed of polymers and non&#8208;magnetic carbon&#8208;based conductors, these fibers are compatible with magnetic resonance imaging, enabling concurrent stimulation and whole&#8208;brain monitoring. Their utility is demonstrated in studies of the mesolimbic reward pathway by interfacing with the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens in mice and characterizing the neurophysiological effects of a stimulant drug. This study highlights the potential of these fibers to probe electrical, optical, and chemical signaling across multiple brain regions in both mechanistic and translational studies.

         <title>Deeply Implantable, Shape&#8208;Morphing, 3D MicroLEDs for Pancreatic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work is deeply implantable, shape&#8208;morphing 3D microLEDs (SMLED) for mPDT, tailored to solid pancreatic tumor models with irregular and dynamically changing sizes. The device, based on a shape morphing, enables tumor&#8208;specific and continuous light irradiation. This approach results in significant PDAC volume reduction and modifications within the tumor microenvironment without adverse effects on surrounding tissues. This work represents a promising advancement in anticancer phototherapy, offering a safe, adaptable, and targeted approach for mPDT that can adjust to tumor volume changes.








Abstract
Controlled photooxidation&#8208;mediated disruption of collagens in the tumor microenvironment can reduce desmoplasia and enhance immune responsiveness. However, achieving effective light delivery to solid tumors, particularly those with dynamic volumetric changes like pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), remains challenging and limits the repeated and sustained photoactivation of drugs. Here, 3D, shape&#8208;morphing, implantable photonic devices (IPDs) are introduced that enable tumor&#8208;specific and continuous light irradiation for effective metronomic photodynamic therapy (mPDT). This IPD adheres seamlessly to the surface of orthotopic PDAC tumors, mitigating issues related to mechanical mismatch, delamination, and internal lesions. In freely moving mouse models, mPDT using the IPD with close adhesion significantly reduces desmoplastic tumor volume without causing cytotoxic effects in healthy tissues. These promising in vivo results underscore the potential of an adaptable and unidirectional IPD design in precisely targeting cancerous organs, suggesting a meaningful advance in light&#8208;based therapeutic technologies.

         <title>Robust Full&#8208;Surface Bonding of Substrate and Electrode for Ultra&#8208;Flexible Sensor Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct hybrid bonding method that enables both gold and parylene bonding without adhesives is developed. This technique achieves full&#8208;surface direct bonding of electrodes and substrates in flexible electronic connections. The method offers high flexibility, stable mechanical durability, and high&#8208;resolution interconnections, accommodating varying electrode shapes and sizes in flexible electronic applications.








Abstract
The integration of multiple flexible electronics is crucial for the development of ultra&#8208;flexible wearable and implantable devices. To fabricate an integrated system, robust and flexible bonding throughout the connection area, irrespective of the electrode or substrate, is needed. Conventional methods for flexible direct bonding have primarily been confined to metal electrodes or substrate&#8208;only bonding due to varying material properties. Consequently, the mechanical and electrical properties of the connections deteriorate based on their shape and size. This study introduces a bonding technique for wearable electronics, achieving strong, flexible connections between materials like gold and parylene at a low temperature (85&#160;&#176;C). This hybrid direct bonding method ensures strong bonding across both the Au electrode and parylene substrate within electronic interconnections. Additionally, a 3D&#8208;stacked flexible structure that maintains robustness and high flexibility without an adhesive layer is successfully developed. An ultrathin photoplethysmography sensor developed by stacking an ultrathin organic photodetector atop an organic light&#8208;emitting diode is demonstrated. Unlike traditional methods requiring adhesives or high pressure, this approach maintains flexibility essential for deformation, withstanding bending at a radius of 0.5&#160;mm. The technique's robustness suggests promising applications in durable, ultra&#8208;flexible electronics integration.

         <title>Upconversion Nanoparticle&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework Core&#8211;shell Particles as Therapeutic Microrobots Trackable With Optoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upconversion nanoparticle&#8208;covalent organic framework core&#8211;shell particles provide enhanced contrast for optoacoustic imaging by leveraging the optical absorption of upconversion luminescence within the covalent organic framework matrix. Beyond their role as contrast agents, these particles enable customizable therapeutic agent loading and release, as well as magnetic microrobotic steering within vascular environments.








Abstract
Despite the development of various medical imaging contrast agents, integrating contrast signal generation with therapeutic and microrobotic functions remains challenging without complicated fabrication processes. In this study, upconversion nanoparticle&#8208;covalent organic framework (UCNP&#8208;COF) core&#8211;shell sub&#8208;micron particles are developed that function as therapeutic microrobots trackable with multi&#8208;spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging and can be loaded with desired therapeutic molecular agents in a customizable manner. The mechanism of optoacoustic signal generation in UCNP&#8208;COF particles is attributed to the quenching of upconversion luminescence emitted by the UCNPs, which is absorbed by the encapsulating COF and subsequently converted into acoustic waves. Unlike other microparticulate agents previously imaged with MSOT, UCNP&#8208;COF particles do not pose concerns about their stability and biocompatibility. Simultaneously, the mesoporous texture of the COF provides a large surface area, allowing for the efficient loading of various drug molecules, which can be released at target sites. Furthermore, the magnetic UCNP&#8208;COF Janus particles can be magnetically navigated through in vivo vasculature while being visualized in real&#8208;time with volumetric MSOT. This study proposes an approach to design photonic materials with multifunctionality, enabling high&#8208;performance medical imaging, drug delivery, and microrobotic manipulation toward their future potential clinical use.

&lt;p&gt;Upconversion nanoparticle-covalent organic framework core&#8211;shell particles provide enhanced contrast for optoacoustic imaging by leveraging the optical absorption of upconversion luminescence within the covalent organic framework matrix. Beyond their role as contrast agents, these particles enable customizable therapeutic agent loading and release, as well as magnetic microrobotic steering within vascular environments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the development of various medical imaging contrast agents, integrating contrast signal generation with therapeutic and microrobotic functions remains challenging without complicated fabrication processes. In this study, upconversion nanoparticle-covalent organic framework (UCNP-COF) core&#8211;shell sub-micron particles are developed that function as therapeutic microrobots trackable with multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging and can be loaded with desired therapeutic molecular agents in a customizable manner. The mechanism of optoacoustic signal generation in UCNP-COF particles is attributed to the quenching of upconversion luminescence emitted by the UCNPs, which is absorbed by the encapsulating COF and subsequently converted into acoustic waves. Unlike other microparticulate agents previously imaged with MSOT, UCNP-COF particles do not pose concerns about their stability and biocompatibility. Simultaneously, the mesoporous texture of the COF provides a large surface area, allowing for the efficient loading of various drug molecules, which can be released at target sites. Furthermore, the magnetic UCNP-COF Janus particles can be magnetically navigated through in vivo vasculature while being visualized in real-time with volumetric MSOT. This study proposes an approach to design photonic materials with multifunctionality, enabling high-performance medical imaging, drug delivery, and microrobotic manipulation toward their future potential clinical use.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctional Photonic Nanomaterials and Devices for Digital Photomedicine via Neuro&#8208;Immune Cross&#8208;Talks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>

This Perspective covers photonic nanomaterials and devices currently used in photobiomodulation and optogenetics for digitally controlled neurostimulation, providing the potential for neuro&#8208;immune interactions.








Abstract
The nervous and immune systems are closely interconnected, and influence the onset and progress of various diseases. Accordingly, understanding the interaction of the neural system and the immune system becomes very important for the treatment of intractable diseases with the analysis of therapeutic mechanisms, such as autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and so on. The conventional immunomodulation treatments have been mainly carried out by drug administration, but they have suffered from systemic negative side&#8208;effects with only limited effects on the specific disease. In this Perspective, photonic nanomaterials and devices are reviewed and discussed for digitally controlled neurostimulating photomedicine via photobiomodulation and optogenetics from the unique viewpoint of neuro&#8208;immune cross&#8208;talks. The prospects and perspectives to integrate photonic nanomaterials with advanced wearable and implantable healthcare devices are also provided and highlighted to revolutionize the therapeutic strategies by the interaction of neural and immune systems, and optimize the treatment protocols for futuristic digital photomedicine. This approach will revolutionize the fields of neurostimulation and immune regulation for further clinical applications.

Alleviating Atherosclerosis via Sonocatalytic Therapy
A dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking and ultrasound&#8208;responsive Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG nanozyme efficiently eliminates ROS in the atherosclerotic microenvironment and performs anti&#8208;inflammatory capability under ultrasound irradiation. Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG&#8208;mediated sonocatalytic therapy (SCT) exerts an outstanding anti&#8208;atherosclerosis efficacy by regulating intraplaque redox homeostasis, contributing to lesional shrinkage and a more stable plaque phenotype in plaque&#8208;bearing mice. More details can be found in the Research Article by Jianhua Hao and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202420189).

         <title>Engineering Framework Materials in Water Systems for Targeted Ion Extraction and Spontaneous Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through comprehensive analysis of framework materials in ion extraction, osmotic energy conversion, and evaporative energy harvesting, this review establishes interdisciplinary connections centered on ion&#8208;selective transport mechanisms across these applications and identifies critical challenges and knowledge gaps in existing studies.








Abstract
Developing techniques that can extract required salt resources and harvest spontaneous energy from natural water environment is essential to promote the global decarbonization and electrification. Construction of advanced framework materials with intrinsic nanochannels has been considered the most promising solution to implement this technique owing to the specific fluid transport performances in such confined space. However, this design requires a deep understanding of the structural properties of framework material nanochannels in different scenarios, as well as the corresponding construction strategies. Consequently, it is an urgent necessity to elucidate the specific ion capture behavior and fluid transport mechanism in these framework materials to build targeted nanofluidic systems for guiding developments in water related resources and energy acquisition technologies. Herein, the recent advances in ion extraction and energy harvesting based on metal&#8208;organic framework and covalent&#8208;organic framework materials have been outlined, along with the discussion about the nanochannels specificity by combining ions and fluid properties and nanochannel structures. Finally, an outlook to trends, challenges and emerging opportunities is given to foresee the future developments in this important field.

It introduces fundamental components, discusses strategies for spatial and spatiotemporal modulation of magnetization in magnetic soft materials, and highlights representative applications in fluid manipulation, biomedical engineering, and wearable electronics. The outlook section emphasizes future opportunities for advanced magnetization modulation technologies in magnetic soft materials.








Abstract
Recent decades have witnessed significant advancements in the exploration of magnetic soft materials, driven by diverse fabrication techniques and the demands of various applications. This progress can mainly be attributed to the unique properties of magnetic soft materials, including their untethered and low&#8208;latency manipulation characteristics as well as mechanical compliance. Spatiotemporal magnetization modulation is fundamentally crucial in magnetic soft materials, as it governs the magnetic body forces and torques for self&#8208;actuation, as well as the generation of magnetic fields for external interaction. Despite remarkable progress in magnetic soft materials, a comprehensive review focusing on spatiotemporal magnetization modulation is lacking. This review begins by introducing fundamental components of magnetic soft materials and then explores various strategies for achieving spatial and spatiotemporal modulation of magnetization. Finally, an overview is provided of the typical applications in fluid manipulation, biomedical engineering, and wearable electronics based on magnetization&#8208;modulated magnetic soft materials, along with perspectives on future advancements.

         <title>Personal Moisture Management by Advanced Textiles and Intelligent Wearables</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores advancements in personal moisture management (PMM) through advanced textiles and intelligent wearables, evolving from traditional methods like wicking and evaporation to cutting&#8208;edge innovations such as directional water transport, stimuli&#8208;responsive textiles, and AI&#8208;driven wearables. It also highlights PMM&#8208;enabled applications in health monitoring, energy harvesting, and thermoregulation, while addressing challenges in durability, scalability, and adaptability with intelligent, sustainable solutions.








Abstract
As global climate change intensifies, personal moisture management (PMM) is increasingly crucial for regulating body temperature and near&#8208;skin humidity, sustaining comfort, health, and productivity. Advances in textile materials and wearable technologies are moving PMM beyond traditional wicking&#8208;drying and waterproof&#8208;breathable designs toward directional sweat transport, stimuli&#8208;responsive control, and integration with personal thermal management (PTM). Advanced textiles and intelligent wearables enable more efficient, adaptive PMM; meanwhile, effective PMM enhances sensing performance and long&#8208;term comfort of wearable systems, and supports sweat&#8208;based health monitoring and energy harvesting, forming closed&#8208;loop, intelligent comfort&#8208;health&#8208;performance ecosystems. This review critically discusses PMM mechanisms and designs from capillary wicking and evaporation/diffusion to directional water transport and responsive moisture regulation, alongside manufacturing strategies spanning advanced fibers, nanoengineering, bioinspired architectures, smart polymers, and wearable electronics. PMM&#8208;enabled implementations in health monitoring and energy harvesting are introduced, and elucidate coupled moisture&#8208;heat transport to guide the co&#8208;optimization of PMM and PTM. Finally, key challenges are outlined, including sweat accumulation, reduced durability and washability, limited manufacturing scalability, and insufficient cross&#8209;scenario adaptability, and offer potential solutions, particularly AI&#8209;enabled pathways for intelligent, sustainable, next&#8209;generation PMM textiles and wearables.

This study reviews the latest advancements in broadband PDs utilizing heterostructures that combine 2D semimetals with materials of various dimensions and highlights their applications in optoelectronics.








Abstract
Hybrid heterostructures are pivotal in the advanced broadband detection technology. The emergence of 2D semimetals has expanded the range of materials in heterostructures beyond conventional narrow&#8208;gap materials for room&#8208;temperature broadband detection applications due to their extraordinary optical and electrical properties. This review outlines the cutting&#8208;edge and latest advancements in broadband photodetectors (PDs) engineered from heterostructures that synergistically combine 2D semimetals with several different dimensional materials. It begins with a fundamental investigation, offering an in&#8208;depth explanation of the essential material properties and a summary of synthesis methodologies. Then, the discussion advances to provide an analytical overview of the categorization, underlying photodetection mechanism, and figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit of these advanced PDs. Subsequently, the narrative shifts to a comprehensive analysis of heterogeneous integrated devices. The review further highlights the diverse optoelectronic applications of broadband PDs, spanning image sensing, optical communication, position&#8208;sensitive detection, integrated sensing and computing, spintronics, and computational spectroscopy are thoroughly highlighted. Finally, the review concludes by addressing the challenges and opportunities in advancing 2D semimetal materials for photodetection.

         <title>Advanced Air Electrodes for Reversible Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) face challenges from sluggish and unstable oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in the air electrode. This review discusses recent progress in triple&#8208;conducting air electrodes, emphasizing mechanisms, performance factors, and design strategies, offering guidance for creating efficient and stable air electrode materials for R&#8208;PCECs.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) have great potential for efficient and clean power generation, energy storage, and sustainable synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals. However, the sluggish and unstable kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the air electrode hinder the R&#8208;PCEC development. Durable H+/e&#8722;/O2&#8722; triple&#8208;conducting air electrode materials are promising for enhancing reaction kinetics and improving catalytical stability. This review synthesizes the recent progress in triple&#8208;conducting air electrodes, focusing on their working mechanisms, including electrode kinetics, lattice and its defect structure in oxides, and the generation and transport processes of H+, O2&#8722;, and e&#8722;. It also examines the required physicochemical properties and their influencing factors. By synthesizing and critically analyzing the latest theoretical frameworks, advanced materials, and regulation strategies, this review outlines the challenges and prospects shaping the future of R&#8208;PCEC technology and air electrode development. Based on these theories and multiple strategies about the bulk triple conducting properties and surface chemical states, this review provides practical guidance for the rational design and development of efficient and stable air electrode materials for R&#8208;PCECs and related electrocatalytic materials.

         <title>Recent Advances in Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ubiquitous defects predominately account for photo&#8208;instability and open&#8208;circuit voltage losses in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (WBG PSCs). This review comprehensively presents the underlying impact mechanisms, summarizes the advanced optimization strategies across various functional layers and their interfaces to develop efficient and stable WBG PSCs, and evaluates their performance in semitransparent solar cells, tandem solar cells, and indoor photovoltaic applications.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered considerable attention of late for their potential as semitransparent photovoltaics for building integration, top&#8208;cells in tandem configurations, and indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, recent investigations have unveiled that underlying defect&#8208;mediated phase segregation, ion migration, lattice strain, and other factors can give rise to self&#8208;accelerated degradation reactions and the contraction of quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting (QFLS) within devices. Extensive efforts have been undertaken to reduce defect densities in bulks, at surfaces, and across interfaces with charge transport layers (CTLs). This review provides a timely and comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic defect ecosystem in WBG perovskites, and mechanistically elucidates their impacts on device stability and open circuit voltage losses. Subsequently, recent advances in defect passivation strategies are cross&#8208;sectionally overviewed, covering various components of devices. The applications of WBG PSCs in semitransparent devices, tandem applications, and IPVs are discussed. Finally, prospects and challenges are proposed, providing insights for future research and technological advancements.

         <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Upconversion Nanoparticles for Emerging NIR Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The special photo&#8208;responsiveness of upconversion nanoparticles has opened up a new path for the advancement of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;responsive optoelectronics. However, challenges such as low energy&#8208;conversion efficiency and high nonradiative losses still persist. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between materials properties and device performance, offering both theoretical and empirical guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance NIR optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), incorporating lanthanide (Ln) dopants, can convert low&#8208;energy near&#8208;infrared photons into higher&#8208;energy visible or ultraviolet light through nonlinear energy transfer processes. This distinctive feature has attracted considerable attention in both fundamental research and advanced optoelectronics. Challenges such as low energy&#8208;conversion efficiency and nonradiative losses limit the performance of UCNP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. Recent advancements including optimized core&#8211;shell structures, tailed Ln&#8208;doping concentration, and surface modifications show significant promise for improving the efficiency and stability. In addition, combining UCNPs with functional materials can broaden their applications and improve device performance, paving the way for the innovation of next&#8208;generation optoelectronics. This paper first categorizes and elaborates on various upconversion mechanisms in UCNPs, focusing on strategies to boost energy transfer efficiency and prolong luminescence. Subsequently, an in&#8208;depth discussion of the various materials that can enhance the efficiency of UCNPs and expand their functionality is provided. Furthermore, a wide range of UCNP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices is explored, and multiple emerging applications in UCNP&#8208;based neuromorphic computing are highlighted. Finally, the existing challenges and potential solutions involved in developing practical UCNPs optoelectronic devices are considered, as well as an outlook on the future of UCNPs in advanced technologies is provided.

         <title>Advancements in Carbon&#8208;Based Piezoelectric Materials: Mechanism, Classification, and Applications in Energy Science</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials are systematically categorized based on their structural and functional properties. The mechanisms of stress&#8208;induced charge transfer are elucidated, and their applications are explored across three key domains: piezoelectric catalysis for energy conversion and environmental remediation, piezoelectric biomedical treatments for tissue regeneration and antitumor therapies, and piezoelectric generators and sensors for energy harvesting and advanced sensing technologies.








Abstract
The piezoelectric phenomenon has garnered considerable interest due to its distinctive physical properties associated with the materials involved. Piezoelectric materials, which are inherently non&#8208;centrosymmetric, can generate an internal electric field under mechanical stress, enhancing carrier separation and transfer due to electric dipole moments. While inorganic piezoelectric materials are often investigated for their high piezoelectric coefficients, they come with potential drawbacks such as toxicity and high production cost, which hinder their practical applications. Consequently, carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials have emerged as an alternative to inorganic materials, boasting advantages such as a large specific surface area, high conductivity, flexibility, and eco&#8208;friendliness. Research into the applications of carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials spans environmental remediation, energy conversion, and biomedical treatments, indicating a promising future. This review marks the first comprehensive attempt to discuss and summarize the various types of carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials. It delves into the underlying mechanisms by which piezoelectricity influences catalysis, biomedical applications, nanogenerators, and sensors. Additionally, various potential techniques are presented to enhance the piezoelectric performance. The design principles of representative fabrication strategies for carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials are analyzed, emphasizing their current limitations and potential improvements for future development. It is believed that recent advances in carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials will make a significant impact.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategies achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are summarized and analyzed from both their separate advancements and the integrated effectiveness in this review. Then, perspectives are given for valuable guidance for further development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are emerging as a promising energy storage technique supplementary to Li&#8208;ion batteries, attracting much research attention owing to their intrinsic safety, cost economy, and environmental friendliness. However, energy densities for AZIBs still do not fulfill practical requirements because of the low specific and areal capacity, limited working potential, and excessive negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive electrode capacity (N/P) ratio. In this review, a comprehensive overview of basic requirements and major challenges for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density AZIBs is provided. Following that, recent progress in the optimization of each component and the overall configuration is summarized, and crucial design principles are discussed. Apart from conventional emphasis on each part, especially cathode materials, separately, the comprehensive discussion about the synergistic interactions among all components is conducted. Finally, the outlook and research direction are given to provide valuable guidance for the further holistic development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Harnessing Synergistic Cooperation of Neighboring Active Motifs in Heterogeneous Catalysts for Enhanced Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the critical role of neighboring active motifs in heterogeneous catalysts, emphasizing how their synergistic cooperativity can be rationally designed to modulate catalytic properties. The discussion centers on the modulation of electronic and geometric structures, categorizing the catalytic systems into metal&#8208;acid (Br&#248;nsted/Lewis) pairs, metal&#8208;base pairs, and metal&#8208;metal pairs. The goal is to provide a systematic overview that offers insights into the design and characterization of next&#8208;generation multifunctional catalysts.








Abstract
Understanding the intricate interplay between catalytically active motifs in heterogeneous catalysts has long posed a significant challenge in the design of highly active and selective reactions. Drawing inspiration from biological enzymes and homogeneous catalysts, the synergistic cooperation between neighboring active motifs has emerged as a crucial factor in achieving effective catalysis. This synergistic control is often observed in natural enzymes and homogeneous systems through ligand coordination. The synergistic interaction is especially vital in reactions involving tandem or cascade steps, where distinct active motifs provide different functionalities to enable the co&#8208;activation of the reaction substrate(s). Situated within a 3D spatial domain, these catalytically active motifs can shape favorable catalytic landscapes by modulating electronic and geometric characteristics, thereby stabilizing specific intermediate or transition state species in a specific catalytic reaction. In this review, we aim to explore a diverse array of the latest heterogeneous catalytic systems that capitalize on the synergistic cooperativity between neighboring active motifs. We will delve into how such synergistic interactions can be utilized to engineer more favorable catalytic landscapes, ultimately resulting in the modulation of catalytic reactivities.

         <title>Bioinspired Design of Heterogenous Single&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Site Catalysts for Electrocatalysis and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review gives a summary on the representative bioinspired single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SACs) and their applications in heterogeneous electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. The fundamentals of bioinspired design strategies are systematically discussed in the context of the first shell coordination, the second/long&#8208;range coordination, and the outer microenvironment. The applications of SACs in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis as inspired by natural enzymes are discussed.








Abstract
The emergence of single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SACs) provides a specific model to bridge the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. An interesting aspect in SACs is how to apply the bioinspired strategies in homogeneous biocatalysis to the design of heterogeneous SACs. The effectiveness of this approach relies on systematic insights in structural characteristics and catalytic mechanisms of both the biocatalysts and the heterogeneous SACs. This review will give a summary on the representative bioinspired single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts and their applications in heterogeneous electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. The fundamentals of bioinspired design strategies will be systematically discussed in the first shell coordination (quasi&#8208;homogeneous metal centers and coordination numbers/species) and the second/long&#8208;range coordination (heteroatoms doping, dual&#8208;metallic sites, nano&#8208;single&#8208;atom&#8208;site, and metal&#8208;support interaction). Also, the unique non&#8208;covalent interactions and oriented mass/proton/electron transfer channels in heterogenous SACs are highlighted as inspired by the outer microenvironment of biological systems. The practical electrocatalytic and photocatalytic applications of bioinspired SACs are further discussed by drawing inspiration from hydrogenase, nitrogenase, oxidase, and dehydrogenase to produce hydrogen&#8208;, carbon&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, and oxygen&#8208;based value&#8208;added chemicals. The current challenges and future opportunities for the development of bioinspired heterogenous SACs will also be discussed.

Abstract
Soft ionic conductors, characterized by their inherent flexibility and tissue&#8208;like ion dynamics, are ideal for intimate applications such as wearable electronics for sensing, energy harvesting, signal transmission, and bioelectronics applications. Shaping ionic conductors into fiber and textile formats (i.e., ionic conductive textiles) to replace the focus on rigid electron&#8208;based conductors heralds a transformative technology in wearable electronics and smart textiles, offering advantages that align with human&#8208;device compatibility, wearability, and sustainability demands. In this review, the category of ionic conductors, the essential characteristics of ionic conductors, the methodologies for the fabrication and integration of ionic conductive textiles, and the diverse applications of these textile&#8208;based soft ionic conductors are summarized. By providing perspectives and raising potential challenges on the future design and development of ionic conductive textiles in terms of sustainability, wearability, fabrication strategies, and integration with electrical systems, this review aims to highlight the potential of ionic conductors as key components for the next generation of wearable technologies and electronic textiles.

         <title>Advanced Electrode Materials for Efficient Hydrogen Production in Protonic Ceramic Electrolysis Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) are a promising intermediate&#8208;temperature hydrogen production technology, leveraging high proton conductivity in electrolytes yet constrained by insufficient catalytic activity and interfacial instability in fuel/air electrodes. This review systematically categorizes advanced electrode materials and critically evaluates optimization strategies, including doping, interface engineering, and microstructure control, to enhance their catalytic activity and durability.








Abstract
Protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) exhibit superior proton conductivity under intermediate&#8208;temperature operation (300&#8211;600&#160;&#176;C), emerging as a promising water electrolysis technology compared to traditional low&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;conducting polymer electrolysis and high&#8208;temperature oxygen ion&#8208;conducting oxide electrolysis. However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and electrode instability in PCECs hinder their large&#8208;scale development. This review highlights recent advancements in PCEC technology, emphasizing its thermodynamic and kinetic advantages, the categorization of advanced electrode materials, and material regulation strategies, including chemical doping, microstructural engineering, and multiphase design to improve their catalytic performance and stability. Additionally, the current challenges are discussed and future research directions are outlined for advanced PCEC electrode materials. By summarizing recent advancements in electrode materials and their optimization strategies, this review provides valuable insights into the rational design of efficient and stable electrode materials, advancing PCEC technology for green hydrogen production.

Abstract
Solar energy is the most promising and ultimate renewable energy resource, and silicon photovoltaic technology has gone through exciting growth globally. Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) provide solar energy solutions for application scenarios different from existing PV technologies. The organic PV technology, with the synergetic progress in the past decades, has now reached 20% power conversion efficiency (PCE), which has the potential to empower serious new applications using the unique features of OPV&#8212;light weight, colorful, semitransparent, flexibility, etc. The concise review focuses on recent device engineering progress in OPV technologies. The background of OPV devices and materials, especially recent nonfullerene acceptors, will first be presented; then, in the recent device engineering progress, the focus will be on active layer engineering to control the morphology of OPV, leading to recent 19%&#8211;20% efficiency. The parallel progress in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) and sequential layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer approaches will be summarized. The transparent OPV (TOPV) devices are of great interest with unique features and provide the broadest design space among all solar technologies. This work reviews the TOPV progress covering the active layer and transparent optical structure designs. The future research directions in OPV are discussed with perspective.

         <title>Progress and Prospect for Conducting Polymer Fibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, conducting polymer fibers (CPFs) are examined along five lines: classification based on raw materials, dispersion behaviors, fabrication methods, multilevel structure&#8208;performance correlations, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications as flexible and wearable electronics. A deep discussion on the dependence of overall performance on the multilevel structure is presented. Finally, existing challenges, possible solutions, and potential applications of CPFs are discussed.








Abstract
The integration of plastic&#8208;like mechanical flexibility and metal&#8208;level electrical conductivity makes conducting polymer fibers (CPFs) find extensive uses, covering from lightweight conductors to wearable devices. Preceding conventional conductors, the additional combination of unique electrochemical activity and biocompatibility guides CPF to promise a new era of fibrous and textile electronics. Intriguing performance of CPFs roots in the intrinsic properties of conducting polymers, but is also highly related to the multilevel structures of chain aggregates. This fundamental structure&#8208;performance relationship deserves a deep discussion to understand the dramatically increasing achievements in both research and products. Herein, the latest research on CPFs is reviewed to introduce their classification, fabrication methods, and performance. Then, the structure&#8208;performance correlations of reported CPFs are presented to understand the dependence of overall properties on multilevel structures. Further, recent developments regarding the microstructural control and performance optimization of CPFs are discussed as well as their frontier applications in wearable systems, energy converters, and biological probes. Finally, existing challenges, possible solutions, and potential applications of CPFs are prospected. This review can provide helpful guidance for manufacturing ideally structured high&#8208;performance CPFs for advanced flexible electronics.

         <title>Plaque&#8208;Targeted Delivery of Fluoride&#8208;Free MXene Nanozyme for Alleviating Atherosclerosis via Sonocatalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work has developed a dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking and ultrasound&#8208;responsive Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG nanozyme. ROS&#8208;eliminating and anti&#173;inflammatory capability of Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG under US irradiation are demonstrated on macrophages and endothelial cells in vitro. Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG&#8208;mediated sonocatalytic therapy exerts an outstanding anti&#8208;atherosclerosis efficacy by regulating intraplaque redox homeostasis, contributing to lesional shrinkage and a more stable plaque phenotype in plaque&#8208;bearing mice.








Abstract
Atherosclerosis is an oxidative stress&#8208;induced chronic inflammatory condition underpinning the progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), ultimately resulting in leading mortality rate globally. Ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered catalysis offers localized treatment for deep&#8208;seated plaques effectively and safely, with demand for targeted delivery and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties of sonosensitizers. 2D MXene&#8208;based nanomedicine is garnering attention because of their intriguing catalytic properties of scavenging excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), yet MXene&#8208;assisted sonocatalytic therapy (SCT) for treating CVDs remains scarce. Here, this study reports a dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking and US&#8208;responsive MXene termed Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG for alleviating atherosclerosis. US irradiation enhances the capability of Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG nanozymes in eliminating broad&#8208;spectrum ROS and resolving vascular inflammation. Besides, actively targeting lesional macrophages improves their systemic delivery to plaque and further boosts anti&#8208;atherosclerotic efficacy, contributing to &#8776;30% plaque size reduction and a more stabilized plaque phenotype. Notably, etching without hydrofluoric acid renders this nanozyme highly biocompatible. In long&#8208;term biosafety studies, Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG is pronouncedly cleared from major organs and no severe changes of liver and kidney functions are observed. Consequently, this work demonstrates that Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG&#8208;mediated SCT effectively ameliorates advanced atherosclerosis without inducing severe cytotoxicity, offering promising translational potential of MXene&#8208;based nanomedicine. Besides, it broadens application prospects of MXenes to the biomedical field of treating CVDs.

         <title>Active Fabric Origami Enabled by Digital Embroidery of Magnetic Yarns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a scalable textile manufacturing process that fabricates active origami fabrics (AFO) via digital embroidery of magnetic yarns. The programmable AFO exhibits reversible 2D and 3D transformations under magnetic fields, enabling functionalities such as altering surface roughness and linear actuation. These reversible deformation fabrics show promising potential for diverse applications in smart textiles and wearable devices.








Abstract
Active fabrics can perform deformations such as contraction, expansion, and bending when exposed to external stimuli. Origami, the ancient art of paper folding, transforms a 2D sheet into a complex 3D structure. However, integrating origami&#8208;inspired designs into active fabrics presents significant challenges, including the large&#8208;scale production of stimuli&#8208;responsive yarns that can be processed using standard textile techniques to achieve intricate origami patterns with high precision and versatility. In this work, the large&#8208;scale fabrication of magnetic yarns featuring high magnetic susceptibility, mechanical strength, and flexibility is reported, which is enabled by processing magnetic polymer composites with a series of textile engineering processes. Utilizing digital embroidery, these magnetic yarns are programmed into origami patterns with predefined yarn alignments on flexible fabrics to create various active fabric origami structures that are mechanical durable and functional consistent. These structures can reversibly transform among shapes in response to specific magnetic fields, enabling a range of functionalities such as altering surface roughness, delivering linear actuation, mimicking flower blooming, and providing switchable thermal insulation. The novel active fabric origami provides promising smart platforms across areas as diverse as smart textiles, soft robotics, wearable devices, and fashion.

&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates a scalable textile manufacturing process that fabricates active origami fabrics (AFO) via digital embroidery of magnetic yarns. The programmable AFO exhibits reversible 2D and 3D transformations under magnetic fields, enabling functionalities such as altering surface roughness and linear actuation. These reversible deformation fabrics show promising potential for diverse applications in smart textiles and wearable devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active fabrics can perform deformations such as contraction, expansion, and bending when exposed to external stimuli. Origami, the ancient art of paper folding, transforms a 2D sheet into a complex 3D structure. However, integrating origami-inspired designs into active fabrics presents significant challenges, including the large-scale production of stimuli-responsive yarns that can be processed using standard textile techniques to achieve intricate origami patterns with high precision and versatility. In this work, the large-scale fabrication of magnetic yarns featuring high magnetic susceptibility, mechanical strength, and flexibility is reported, which is enabled by processing magnetic polymer composites with a series of textile engineering processes. Utilizing digital embroidery, these magnetic yarns are programmed into origami patterns with predefined yarn alignments on flexible fabrics to create various active fabric origami structures that are mechanical durable and functional consistent. These structures can reversibly transform among shapes in response to specific magnetic fields, enabling a range of functionalities such as altering surface roughness, delivering linear actuation, mimicking flower blooming, and providing switchable thermal insulation. The novel active fabric origami provides promising smart platforms across areas as diverse as smart textiles, soft robotics, wearable devices, and fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrastable Calcium Metal Anodes Enabled by a Strongly Coordinated Electrolyte Derived Bilayer Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring reliable electrolytes and constructing favorable SEI structure are pivotal for advancing calcium metal batteries. A strongly solvated and alkaxyborate anion mediated electrolyte demonstrates ultra&#8208;stable Ca metal anodes for over 1450&#160;h. This electrolyte derives an organic (outer)&#8208;inorganic (inner) bi&#8208;layered SEI that facilitates Ca ion migration for Ca metal plating/stripping reactions.








Abstract
Calcium (Ca) metal battery is a promising alternative to current lithium battery chemistry due to the high crustal abundance of Ca element and potentially dendrite&#8208;free cycling of high&#8208;capacity Ca metal anodes. However, reversible Ca metal stripping and plating have been hindered by the lack of effective electrolytes and the formation of obstructive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. Here a strongly coordinated electrolyte system by incorporating LiB(hfip)4 into Ca[B(hfip)4]2/glyme solutions is introduced. The highly coordinated glyme molecules and B(hfip)4&#8722; anions are ready to decompose into organic rich compounds and CaH2, CaB2O4 nanocrystals in the SEI layers on Ca metal surface. Transmission electron microscopy observations reveal that these ionically conductive inorganic particles are embedded beneath the organic&#8208;rich outer layer, thus forming a bilayer SEI configuration. This unique structure facilitates efficient Ca&#8208;ion transfer while preventing further electrolyte decomposition. Effectiveness of this electrolyte is evidenced by the ultrastable Ca//Ca symmetrical cells (over 1450&#160;h with low potentials of &lt;0.5&#160;V vs. Ca/Ca2+ at a high current density of 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and the high&#8208;energy Ca//polyaniline full cells (energy densities of above 200&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 over 200 cycles), which set new benchmarks in the field of room&#8208;temperature Ca metal batteries.

         <title>Upper Layer&#8208;Modulated Pseudo Planar Heterojunction with Metal Complex Acceptor for Efficient and Stable Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal complex acceptor (MCA), PtAC&#8208;Cl, is synthesized and incorporated into the upper host acceptor layer of PM6/Y6 to regulate morphology and fill trap states. A high PCE of 18.16% in PM6/Y6:PtAC&#8208;Cl devices is achieved with a T80 lifetime of &#8776;401 h under continuous illumination at MPP tracking and 1265 h under continuous heating at 70&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Modulating self&#8208;aggregation and charge transport in the upper acceptor layer of the pseudo planar heterojunction (PPHJ) is crucial for enhancing dielectric constant and suppressing trap density, leading to efficient and stable organic photovoltaics (OPVs). In this work, a metal complex acceptor (MCA), PtAC&#8208;Cl, is selectively incorporated into the upper host Y6 layer of PPHJ to regulate morphology and fill trap states. There exists a strong chemical interaction between PtAC&#8208;Cl and Y6, which can promote electron transfer. PtAC&#8208;Cl can regulate the self&#8208;aggregation and extend the exciton diffusion length of Y6, resulting in enhanced charge transport and reduced energetic disorder. Consequently, upper layer&#8208;modulated PPHJ devices with PtAC&#8208;Cl achieved a significant power conversion efficiency of 18.16%. The universality of PtAC&#8208;Cl is also demonstrated in PM6/eC9 and PM6/L8&#8208;BO systems, achieving the highest PCEs of 18.79 and 19.30%, respectively. All the improved PCEs are mainly attributed to the enhanced fill factor (FF) and short circuit current (Jsc) compared with the controls. Additionally, PtAC&#8208;Cl significantly improves the thermal stability and photostability of the devices, with a T80 lifetime of &#8776; 401 h under continuous illumination with simulated 1&#8208;Sun light and 1265 h under continuous heating at 70&#160;&#176;C. Overall, this work introduces the concept of MCA and proposes a practical and efficient method to enhance the efficiency and stability of OPVs through selective upper&#8208;layer modulation in PPHJ with MCA.

A reusable carbon&#8208;gel ink, incorporating cottonseed peptone as a natural mediator, enables cross&#8208;linked ionic polymer networks for advanced conductivity, stability, and biocompatibility. Compatible with direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing, it facilitates flexible electronics on polymeric and textile substrates for multifunctional applications, including motion sensing, energy harvesting, and self&#8208;powered pressure detection. Integrated smart e&#8208;textile systems have demonstrated human&#8208;machine interaction for signal translation and robotic manipulation.








Abstract
Soft electronics textiles have garnered global attention for their wearability and promising applications in healthcare, energy devices, and artificial intelligence. Recently, direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing (DIW) technology has shown a growing trend because of its controllability, ease of fabrication, and efficiency. However, the design novelty of printable ink for soft electronic textiles is severely hampered by the intrinsic challenges of integrating printability, conductivity, stretchability, biocompatibility, and durability. Herein, a reusable DIW bio&#8208;carbon gel ink is proposed for printing soft electronic textiles where cottonseed peptone&#8208;functionalized multi&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (CPCNTs) exhibit high dispersibility and reactive surface groups, enabling stable cross&#8208;linking with phytic acid (PA) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to form a strong ionic polymer composite. Encouragingly, the gel ink can be directly exploited to design complex circuits and versatile electronics via DIW printing on both polymeric and textile substrates. The viscoelasticity, mechanical recovery, electric properties, robustness, and stretchable architectures enable it to function as flexible circuits, smart sensors, and renewable generators. As demonstrations, multifunctional applications are presented by real&#8208;time healthcare monitoring, LED lighting, and power generation. Furthermore, this printable gel ink is effectively assembled into an integrated wearable unit for robot manipulation and real&#8208;time gesture recognition, suggesting a significant printing strategy for next&#8208;generation wearable electronics.

         <title>Efficient Low&#8208;temperature Ammonia Cracking Enabled by Strained Heterostructure Interfaces on Ru&#8208;free Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the strong metal&#8208;support interaction effect, heterostructured interfaces in a Co&#8208;based catalyst are designed to enable low&#8208;temperature ammonia (NH3) decomposition. The induced tensile lattice strain within the core&#8208;shell structure modulates d&#8208;band center of Co, enhancing NH3 adsorption and facilitating N&#9472;H bond dissociation. Furthermore, the dynamic lattice strain release and restoration mechanism promotes NH3 dehydrogenation and by&#8208;product desorption, effectively optimizing the reaction pathway and ensuring sustained catalytic activity.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) has emerged as a promising liquid carrier for hydrogen (H2) storage. However, its widespread adoption in H2 technology is impeded by the reliance on costly Ru catalysts for low&#8208;temperature NH3 cracking reaction. Here, a strained heterostructure Co@BaAl2O4&#8722;x core@shell catalyst is reported that demonstrates catalytic performance at low reaction temperatures comparable to most Ru&#8208;based catalysts. This catalyst exhibits exceptional activity across a range of space velocity conditions, maintaining high conversion rates at 475 to 575&#160;&#176;C and achieving an impressive H2 production rate of 64.6&#160;mmol H2 gcat&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, and kinetic studies are carried out to elucidate the dynamic changes of the strained heterostructure interface of Co&#8208;core and BaAl2O4&#8722;x&#8208;overlayer under catalytic working conditions. The performance enhancement mechanisms are attributed to the tensile strained Co surface encapsulated in the defective BaAl2O4&#8722;x, which enhances NH3 adsorption and facilitates the rate&#8208;determining N&#9472;H dissociation. Furthermore, the strain release and restoration during NH3 dehydrogenation enable efficient nitrogen desorption, preventing active site poisoning. This work highlights the effectiveness of lattice strain engineering and the development of synergistic strong metal&#8208;support interfaces between active metal nanoparticles and oxide support to boost low&#8208;temperature NH3 cracking.

Furthermore, the dynamic lattice strain release and restoration mechanism promotes NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; dehydrogenation and by-product desorption, effectively optimizing the reaction pathway and ensuring sustained catalytic activity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) has emerged as a promising liquid carrier for hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) storage. However, its widespread adoption in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; technology is impeded by the reliance on costly Ru catalysts for low-temperature NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cracking reaction. Here, a strained heterostructure Co@BaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&#8722;x&lt;/sub&gt; core@shell catalyst is reported that demonstrates catalytic performance at low reaction temperatures comparable to most Ru-based catalysts. This catalyst exhibits exceptional activity across a range of space velocity conditions, maintaining high conversion rates at 475 to 575&#160;&#176;C and achieving an impressive H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 64.6&#160;mmol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, synchrotron X-ray diffraction, and kinetic studies are carried out to elucidate the dynamic changes of the strained heterostructure interface of Co-core and BaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&#8722;x&lt;/sub&gt;-overlayer under catalytic working conditions. The performance enhancement mechanisms are attributed to the tensile strained Co surface encapsulated in the defective BaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&#8722;x&lt;/sub&gt;, which enhances NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and facilitates the rate-determining N&#9472;H dissociation. Furthermore, the strain release and restoration during NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; dehydrogenation enable efficient nitrogen desorption, preventing active site poisoning. This work highlights the effectiveness of lattice strain engineering and the development of synergistic strong metal-support interfaces between active metal nanoparticles and oxide support to boost low-temperature NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cracking.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interface Reinforced Tailoring of Quantum Dots Regulates Reaction Trajectory of CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interface&#8208;reinforced regulation strategy is proposed to tailor the activation mode of CO2 in water. The facilitation of directional electron transfer and the interface&#8208;reinforced charge difference of the catalytic site at the CdSe/S/InS QD interface greatly promotes the shift of reaction trajectory of CO2 photoreduction, i.e., the main HCOO&#8722; product for CdSe is transformed into CO for CdSe/S/InS QDs.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis using semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) is one of the most promising pathways toward converting CO2 into valuable chemicals. However, the multistep process of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion endows the regulation of reaction trajectory from CO2 to specific products very challenging in aqueous solution. Here, it is first disclosed that the anisotropic growth of CdSe&#8722;S&#8722;InS interface in ultrafine heterojunction QDs alters the trajectory of CO2 photoreduction in water, i.e., CdSe/S/InS QDs mainly produce CO while CdSe QDs generate HCOO&#8722;. Under optimal conditions, the CO turnover number of CdSe/S/InS QDs is &#8776;1000 (12 h; vs QDs) with a selectivity of &gt;96% in C&#8208;based products or &#8776;57.6% when considering H2. The formation of anisotropic CdSe/S/InS ultrafine heterojunction facilitates charge migration at the interface, which is confirmed by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transient absorption spectroscopy. Further DFT simulations and in situ experiments demonstrate that the interfacial lattice expansion reinforces the charge difference at the interface, thus contributing to the product shift from HCOOH to CO, which clarifies the mechanism of interface&#8208;reinforced tailoring of CO2 reaction trajectories. This work can not only provide guidance for interfacial CO2 activation mode in water but also inspire the design of novel artificial photocatalysts with new functions.

         <title>Green, Safe, Durable, Printed Fabric Hygroelectric Generators for Wearable Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work achieves a green hygroelectric generator with enhanced electric outputs. All chemicals and materials used in the hygroelectric generators are safe for human and environmentally friendly. The device achieves an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.2 V and a short&#8208;circuit current of 1.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 at room humidity of 55% through the synergistic effect of ion migration and water absorption.








Abstract
Hygroelectric generators, converting energy from moisture into electricity, have attracted great interest due to sustainable and ubiquitous moisture in the environment. However, it is absolutely necessary to replace the fragile and noxious materials reported previously in the hygroelectric generators before real applications for wearables. Herein, a green hygroelectric generator with a high current density is designed for the first time by printing functional materials that are abundant, safe to humans and environments. By engineering printable hydrogel through the synergistic effect of water absorption and ion migration on the fabric, the wearable fabric hygroelectric generators deliver a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.2&#160;V with a remarkable short&#8208;circuit current density of 1.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2, more than 7 times that of most reported hygroelectric generators. The devices show no performance declination after long&#8208;term storage and bending tests due to the design of stable hydrogel and robust electrode/hydrogel interfaces. Moreover, the devices with cross&#8208;finger structures achieve a facile scalable integration for enhanced electric outputs. Exemplifying applications illustrate the great potential of the printed fabric hygroelectric generators as a direct current power supply for wearable applications. This work sheds light on a novel avenue to design safe and environmentally friendly energy harvesting devices for practical applications.

         <title>Janus Cellular Design Drives Solar&#8208;Powered Spatial Lithium Extraction and Water Co&#8208;Generation from Salt&#8208;Lake Brines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D&#8208;printed Janus cellular solar platform integrates photothermal evaporation, ion&#8208;diffusion&#8208;guided lithium enrichment, and flipping&#8208;induced salt removal. The asymmetric lattice, fabricated via high&#8208;resolution printing and functionalized with porous adsorbents, enables simultaneous water harvesting and selective lithium extraction from hypersaline brines, offering a scalable and energy&#8208;efficient route for sustainable resource recovery.








Abstract
Lithium plays a vital role in energy storage technologies, with global demand rapidly increasing. Current adsorption&#8208;based direct lithium extraction from salt&#8208;lake brines holds promise but suffers from low ion extraction efficiency due to sluggish intercalation kinetics and poor selectivity, necessitating repeated cycles that increase water and energy consumption. Here, a Janus cellular&#8208;structured solar&#8208;powered platform (JCSP) is developed for energy&#8208;efficient lithium extraction and sustainable water harvesting. The cellular platform features a symmetrical, multi&#8208;branched cantilever geometry with distinct upper and lower lattice architectures, where the lower lattice is functionalized with titanium&#8208;based porous adsorbents. This rational lattice design and functionalized adsorption interfaces enhance light absorption, sustain evaporative flow, and create an ion diffusion gradient for selective lithium extraction. Its cantilever configuration enables a self&#8208;flipping mechanism, preventing salt crystallization and ensuring long&#8208;term stability in high&#8208;salinity environments. This design boosts water evaporation efficiency to 3.85&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, increases lithium adsorption capacity to 43.5&#160;mg g&#8722;1, and enhances Li+/Na+ and Li+/Mg2+ selectivity to 112 and 268, respectively, when treating multi&#8208;ionic hypersaline environment (20 wt% total dissolved salt). The JCSP system demonstrates stable long&#8208;term performance in water evaporation and lithium recovery under extreme conditions, providing a sustainable solution to global water scarcity and rising lithium demand.

         <title>Advancing Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules Toward Interface&#8208;Optimized Perovskite Solar Cells: from One to Two</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the past few years, self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) have ushered in a new era of interface engineering for perovskite solar cells. Herein, the recent progresses of co&#8208;SAM, namely two SAMs with synergy, are comprehensively summarized and analyzed, focusing on topics including deposition methods and design principles, while further challenges about mechanisms, materials, and applications are also outlined.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly gained prominence as a leading candidate in the realm of solution&#8208;processable third&#8208;generation photovoltaic (PV) technologies. In the high&#8208;efficiency inverted PSCs, self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) are often used as hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs) due to&#160;the advantages of high transmittance, energy level matching, low non&#8208;radiative recombination loss, and tunable surface properties. However, SAMs have been recognized to suffer from some shortcomings, such as incomplete coverage, weak bonding with substrate or perovskite, instability, and so on. The combination of different SAMs or so&#8208;called co&#8208;SAM is an effective strategy to overcome this challenge. In this Perspective, the latest achievements in molecule design, deposition method, working principle, and application of the co&#8208;SAM are discussed. This comprehensive overview of milestones in this rapidly advancing research field, coupled with an in&#8208;depth analysis of the improved interface properties using the co&#8208;SAM approach, aims to offer valuable insights into the key design principles. Furthermore, the lessons learned will guide the future development of SAM&#8208;based HSLs in perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, self-assembled molecules (SAMs) have ushered in a new era of interface engineering for perovskite solar cells. Herein, the recent progresses of co-SAM, namely two SAMs with synergy, are comprehensively summarized and analyzed, focusing on topics including deposition methods and design principles, while further challenges about mechanisms, materials, and applications are also outlined.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly gained prominence as a leading candidate in the realm of solution-processable third-generation photovoltaic (PV) technologies. In the high-efficiency inverted PSCs, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are often used as hole-selective layers (HSLs) due to&#160;the advantages of high transmittance, energy level matching, low non-radiative recombination loss, and tunable surface properties. However, SAMs have been recognized to suffer from some shortcomings, such as incomplete coverage, weak bonding with substrate or perovskite, instability, and so on. The combination of different SAMs or so-called co-SAM is an effective strategy to overcome this challenge. In this Perspective, the latest achievements in molecule design, deposition method, working principle, and application of the co-SAM are discussed. This comprehensive overview of milestones in this rapidly advancing research field, coupled with an in-depth analysis of the improved interface properties using the co-SAM approach, aims to offer valuable insights into the key design principles. Furthermore, the lessons learned will guide the future development of SAM-based HSLs in perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
