         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D quick response (QR) cube platform leverages true 3D space for significantly increased information storage and advanced multi&#8208;level encryption using spatial keys for enhanced security. A near&#8208;infrared&#160;imaging system enables noise&#8208;free images, allowing precise and detailed analysis of the 3D QR cube structure. A convolutional neural network&#8208;based 3D reconstruction model is developed, achieving consistently high prediction accuracy.








Abstract
The growing significance of information technology requires advanced information storage and security solutions. While extending traditional 2D&#160;codes with additional parameters has led to promising 3D codes, increasing information capacity and security remains challenging. Herein, a 3D quick response (QR) cube platform that utilizes near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;to&#8208;NIR upconversion nanoparticles as light&#8208;emitting probes, benefiting from their photostability and low scattering properties. These features enable precise reconstruction of the 3D QR cube. The platform employs volumetric space for information encoding by leveraging spatial information in a 3D environment, demonstrating potential to significantly increase information capacity and facilitate access from all three spatial dimensions (x, y, z), while enhancing security. This study develops a platform for analyzing and reconstructing 3D QR cubes using NIR imaging and employs a convolutional neural network model to determine the 3D structure from image intensity variations, achieving 99.9% accuracy in predicting cube configurations. By leveraging 3D spatial information and logical circuits, the encryption method has the potential to significantly surpass the encryption strength of traditional 2D codes. The findings demonstrate high prediction accuracy and introduce new possibilities for multi&#8208;level encryption with spatial security keys in 3D space, offering a robust solution for advanced information storage and security.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Vitrimer Nanocomposites: Photo&#8208;Thermal Repair, Reinforcement, and Conductivity at Low Volume Fractions Through a Percolative Voronoi&#8208;Inspired Microstructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils MXene&#8208;vitrimer nanocomposites with a distinct biphasic Voronoi&#8208;inspired microstructure, where a percolative MXene minor&#8208;phase spans throughout a vitrimer major&#8208;phase. Fabricated via a streamlined three&#8208;step process of precipitation polymerization, MXene aqueous coating, and melt&#8208;pressing, these nanocomposites deliver photo&#8208;thermal repairability, mechanical reinforcement, and conductivity at low loadings, achieving greatly diminished percolation thresholds and multifunctionality for advanced smart materials and sustainable composites.








Abstract
An innovative process to multifunctional vitrimer nanocomposites with a percolative MXene minor phase is reported, marking a significant advancement in creating stimuli&#8208;repairable, reinforced, sustainable, and conductive nanocomposites at diminished loadings. This achievement arises from a Voronoi&#8208;inspired biphasic morphological design via a straight&#8208;forward three&#8208;step process involving ambient&#8208;condition precipitation polymerization of micron&#8208;sized prepolymer powders, aqueous powder&#8208;coating with 2D MXene (Ti3C2Tz), and melt&#8208;pressing of MXene&#8208;coated powders into crosslinked films. Due to the formation of MXene&#8208;rich boundaries between thiourethane vitrimer domains in a pervasive low&#8208;volume fraction conductive network, a low percolation threshold (&#8776;0.19&#160;vol.%) and conductive polymeric nanocomposites (&#8776;350 S&#160;m&#8722;1) are achieved. The embedded MXene skeleton mechanically bolsters the vitrimer at intermediate loadings, enhancing the modulus and toughness by 300% and 50%, respectively, without mechanical detriment compared to the neat vitrimer. The vitrimer's dynamic&#8208;covalent bonds and MXene's photo&#8208;thermal conversion properties enable repair in minutes through short&#8208;term thermal treatments for full macroscopic mechanical restoration or in seconds under 785&#160;nm light for rapid localized surface repair. This versatile fabrication method to nanocoated pre&#8208;vitrimer powders and morphologically complex nanocomposites is compatible with classic composite manufacturing, and when coupled with the material's exceptional properties, holds immense potential for revolutionizing advanced composites and inspiring next&#8208;generation smart materials.

         <title>Deeply Implantable, Shape&#8208;Morphing, 3D MicroLEDs for Pancreatic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work is deeply implantable, shape&#8208;morphing 3D microLEDs (SMLED) for mPDT, tailored to solid pancreatic tumor models with irregular and dynamically changing sizes. The device, based on a shape morphing, enables tumor&#8208;specific and continuous light irradiation. This approach results in significant PDAC volume reduction and modifications within the tumor microenvironment without adverse effects on surrounding tissues. This work represents a promising advancement in anticancer phototherapy, offering a safe, adaptable, and targeted approach for mPDT that can adjust to tumor volume changes.








Abstract
Controlled photooxidation&#8208;mediated disruption of collagens in the tumor microenvironment can reduce desmoplasia and enhance immune responsiveness. However, achieving effective light delivery to solid tumors, particularly those with dynamic volumetric changes like pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), remains challenging and limits the repeated and sustained photoactivation of drugs. Here, 3D, shape&#8208;morphing, implantable photonic devices (IPDs) are introduced that enable tumor&#8208;specific and continuous light irradiation for effective metronomic photodynamic therapy (mPDT). This IPD adheres seamlessly to the surface of orthotopic PDAC tumors, mitigating issues related to mechanical mismatch, delamination, and internal lesions. In freely moving mouse models, mPDT using the IPD with close adhesion significantly reduces desmoplastic tumor volume without causing cytotoxic effects in healthy tissues. These promising in vivo results underscore the potential of an adaptable and unidirectional IPD design in precisely targeting cancerous organs, suggesting a meaningful advance in light&#8208;based therapeutic technologies.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries Achieved by Synergistically Enhanced Screening Li+ Desolvation Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the basis of pore sieving effect toward Li+ desolvation, the intentionally&#8208;introduced polar electron&#8208;donated chemical groups on metal&#8211;organic frameworks is developed to further boost Li+ desolvation and Li0 diffusion kinetics under low temperature, achieving uniform lithium distribution without dendrite formation. As a result, the high capacity&#8208;retention ratio of 97% is stabilized under negative/positive ratio of 3.3 and lower temperature surroundings.








Abstract
Lithium metal anode is desired by high capacity and low potential toward higher energy density than commercial graphite anode. However, the low&#8208;temperature Li metal batteries suffer from dendrite formation and dead Li resulting from uneven Li behaviors of flux with huge desolvation/diffusion barriers, thus leading to short&#160;lifespan and safety concern. Herein, differing from electrolyte engineering, a strategy of delocalizing electrons with generating rich active sites to regulate Li+ desolvation/diffusion behaviors are demonstrated via decorating polar chemical groups on porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). As comprehensively indicated by theoretical simulations, electrochemical analysis, in situ spectroscopies, electron microscope, and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry, the sieving kinetics of desolvation is not merely relied on pore size morphology but also significantly affected by the &#9472;NH2 polar chemical groups,&#160;reducing energy barriers for realizing non&#8208;dendritic and smooth Li metal plating. Consequently, the optimal cells stabilize for&#160;long lifespan of 2000 h and higher average Coulombic efficiency, much better than the&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;art reports. Under a lower negative/positive ratio of 3.3, the full cells with NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 deliver a high capacity&#8208;retention of 97.0% at 0.33 C even under &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, showing the great potential of this kind of polar groups on boosting Li+ desolvation kinetics at room&#8208; and low&#8208;temperatures.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Induced in Situ Phase Separation and Percolation for Constructing Bi&#8208;Continuous Phase Hydrogel Electrodes With Motion&#8208;Insensitive Property</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a one&#8208;step strategy to fabricate bi&#8208;continuous phase hydrogels under mild conditions. The resulting hydrogel exhibits excellent conductivity, elasticity, strain insensitivity, and biocompatibility. The hydrogel&#8208;based electrode facilitates motion&#8208;artifact&#8208;free electrophysiological signal monitoring and enables wireless, multimodal data acquisition under dynamic conditions. This cutting&#8208;edge technology offers potent tools for healthcare and medical management.








Abstract
Conducting&#160;polymer hydrogels have gained attention in the bioelectronics field due to their unique combination of biocompatibility and customizable mechanical properties. However, achieving both excellent conductivity and mechanical strength in a hydrogel remains a significant challenge, primarily because of the inherent conflict between the hydrophobic nature of conducting polymers and the hydrophilic characteristics of hydrogels. To address this issue, this work proposes a simple one&#8208;step acid&#8208;induced approach that not only promotes the gelation of hydrophilic polymers but also facilitates the in situ phase separation of hydrophobic conducting polymers under mild conditions. This results in a distinctive bi&#8208;continuous phase structure with exceptional electrical property (906 mS cm&#8722;1) and mechanical performance (fracture strain of 1103%). The hydrogel forms robust percolating networks that maintain structural integrity under mechanical stress due to their entropic elasticity, providing remarkable strain insensitivity, low mechanical hysteresis, and an impressive resilience (95%). Electrodes fabricated from the conductive hydrogel exhibit stable and minimal interfacial contact impedance with skin (1&#8211;6 kilohms at 1&#8211;100&#160;Hz) and significantly lower noise power (4.9 &#181;V2). This work believes that the motion&#8208;insensitive characteristics and mechanical robustness of this hydrogel will enable efficient and reliable monitoring of biological signals, establishing a new benchmark in the bioelectronics.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Orbit&#8208;Locking Vectorial Metasurface Holography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a general multi&#8208;channel vectorial holography technique encoded by both the spin and orbital angular momentum using a minimalist, non&#8208;interleaved, geometry&#8208;phase metasurface. The approach not only substantially enhances the selectivity of the input light, exhibiting spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;locking behavior, but also expands the multiplexing capacity of the output optical field, opening new avenues for advanced light manipulation.








Abstract
Vectorial metasurface holography, allowing for independent control over the amplitude, phase, and polarization distribution of holographic images enabled by metasurfaces, plays a crucial role in the realm of optical display, optical, and quantum communications. However, previous research on vectorial metasurface holography has typically been restricted to single degree of freedom input and single channel output, thereby demonstrating a very limited modulation capacity. This work presents a novel method to achieve multi&#8208;channel vectorial metasurface holography by harnessing spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;locking vortex beams. In each channel, the optical vectorial field is encoded with a pair of total angular momentums (TAMs) featuring two orthogonal spin angular momentums (SAMs) independently locked with arbitrary orbital angular momentums (OAMs). The methodology relies on a modified Gerchberg&#8208;Saxton algorithm, enabling the encoding of various TAM channels within a single phase profile. Consequently, a pure geometry&#8208;phase metasurface with a non&#8208;interleaved approach can be used to support such multi&#8208;channel vectorial holography, achieving high selectivity of both SAM and OAM, and offering precise routing and manipulation of complex light channels. The work presents a paradigm shift in the field of holography, offering promising avenues for high&#8208;density optical information processing and future photonic device design.

         <title>Unveiling Charge Carrier Dynamics at Organic&#8211;Inorganic S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction Interfaces: Insights From Advanced EPR</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops TP/ZIS&#8208;10 S&#8208;scheme heterostructures, uncovers unique charge transfer dynamics via TR EPR, ISIXPS, and fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy, and provides novel insights into charge carrier dynamics at S&#8208;scheme heterojunction interfaces, paving the way for efficient and stable organic&#8211;inorganic S&#8208;scheme photocatalysts for green energy conversion.








Abstract
Understanding charge carrier transfer at heterojunction interfaces is critical for advancing solar energy conversion technologies. This study utilizes continuous wave (CW), pulse, and time&#8208;resolved (TR) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to explore the radical species formed at the TAPA (tris(4&#8722;aminophenyl)amine)&#8208;PDA (Terephthaldicarboxaldehyde)/ZnIn2S4 (TP/ZIS) heterojunction interface. CW and pulse EPR identify stable radical defects localized near the interface, accessible to water molecules. Time&#8208;resolved EPR reveals a photoinduced electron transfer from TP to ZIS, leading to the generation of spin&#8208;correlated radical pairs under light irradiation, signifying efficient charge carrier separation and spatial transfer within the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction. This electron transfer mechanism, confirmed through in situ X&#8211;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, suppresses undesirable carrier recombination, extending charge carrier lifetimes. These findings provide novel insights into the transport direction of charge carriers at the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction interface, offering valuable guidance for designing highly efficient and stable organic&#8211;inorganic heterojunction photocatalysts for solar energy applications.

         <title>Large Area Near&#8208;Field Thermophotovoltaics for Low Temperature Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;field thermophotovoltaics promise high output power from low temperature thermal sources, but demonstrating large area devices has proven challenging. Here a novel epitaxial co&#8208;designed emitter&#8208;cell device fabricated with scalable processes demonstrates 1.2 mW from a 460&#160;&#176;C heat source, a greater than 20&#8208;fold enhancement over the far&#8208;field. Modeling of various cell changes offers a pathway to even higher power.








Abstract
Thermophotovoltaics, devices that convert thermal infrared photons to electricity, offer a key pathway for a variety of critical renewable energy technologies including thermal energy storage, waste heat recovery, and direct solar&#8208;thermal power generation. However, conventional far&#8208;field devices struggle to generate reasonable powers at lower temperatures. Near&#8208;field thermophotovoltaics provide a pathway to substantially higher powers by leveraging photon tunneling effects. Here a large area near&#8208;field thermophotovoltaic device is presented, created with an epitaxial co&#8208;fabrication approach, that consists of a self&#8208;supported 0.28 cm2 emitter&#8208;cell pair with a 150&#160;nm gap. The device generates 1.22&#160;mW at 460&#160;&#176;C, a 25&#8208;fold increase over the same cell measured in a far&#8208;field configuration. Furthermore, the near&#8208;field device demonstrates short circuit current densities greater than the far&#8208;field photocurrent limit at all the temperatures tested, confirming the role of photon tunneling effects in the performance enhancement. Modeling suggests several practical directions for cell improvements and further increases in power density. These results highlight the promise of near&#8208;field thermophotovoltaics, especially for low temperature applications.

         <title>Advanced Ruthenium&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for NOx Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review offers an in&#8208;depth overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in the Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts for NOx reduction to NH3, covering the mechanism, design, and applications. Additionally, the review presents the primary challenges relevant to relatively high cost, complex reaction mechanism, and serious hydrogen evolution, as well as the critical perspectives on the fronter of this exciting research area.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is widely recognized as a crucial raw material for nitrogen&#8208;based fertilizer production and eco&#8208;friendly hydrogen&#8208;rich fuels. Currently, the Haber&#8211;Bosch process still dominates the worldwide industrial NH3 production, which consumes substantial energy and contributes to enormous CO2 emission. As an alternative NH3 synthesis route, electrocatalytic reduction of NOx species (NO3&#8722;, NO2&#8722;, and NO) to NH3 has gained considerable attention due to its advantages such as flexibility, low power consumption, sustainability, and environmental friendliness. This review timely summarizes an updated and critical survey of mechanism, design, and application of Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts for NOx reduction. First, the reason why the Ru&#8208;based catalysts are good choice for NOx reduction to NH3 is presented. Second, the reaction mechanism of NOx over Ru&#8208;based materials is succinctly summarized. Third, several typical in situ characterization techniques, theoretical calculations, and kinetics analysis are examined. Subsequently, the construction of each classification of the Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts according to the size of particles and compositions is critically reviewed. Apart from these, examples are given on the applications in the production of valuable chemicals and Zn&#8722;NOx batteries. Finally, this review concludes with a summary highlighting the main practical challenges relevant to selectivity and efficiency in the broad range of NOx concentrations and the high currents, as well as the critical perspectives on the fronter of this exciting research area.

         <title>Switchable Pancharatnam&#8211;Berry Phases in Heterogeneously Integrated THz Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an innovative structural design and integration scheme is proposed that utilizes vanadium dioxide, a phase&#8208;change material, to achieve thermally controlled dynamic PB phase control within the metasurface. By leveraging the material's properties, this can dynamically alter the optical orientation of individual elements of the metasurface and achieve temperature&#8208;dependent local phase modulation based on the geometric phase principle.








Abstract
The Pancharatnam&#8211;Berry (PB) phase has revolutionized the design of metasurfaces, offering a straightforward and robust method for controlling wavefronts of electromagnetic waves. However, traditional metasurfaces have fixed PB phases determined by the orientation of their individual elements. In this study, an innovative structural design and integration scheme is proposed that utilizes vanadium dioxide, a phase&#8208;change material, to achieve thermally controlled dynamic PB phase control within the metasurface. By leveraging the material's properties, this can dynamically alter the optical orientation of individual elements of the metasurface and achieve temperature&#8208;dependent local phase modulation based on the geometric phase principle. This approach, combined with advanced fabrication processing technology, paves the way for next&#8208;generation dynamic devices with customizable functions.

         <title>Electrical Spin State Manipulation in All&#8208;Magnet Heterojunctions Using a Ferromagnetic Spin Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrical manipulation of spins by spin Hall current from heavy metals facilitates the implementation of multifunctional spintronic devices. This work reports direct evidence of spin current generation in ferromagnets via observation of efficient current&#8208;induced switching of noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn in Mn3Sn/ferromagnet structure. The further realization of field&#8208;free switching suggests the ferromagnets could function as more versatile spin sources.








Abstract
The ability to electrically manipulate spin states in magnetic materials is essential for the advancement of energy&#8208;efficient spintronic device, which is typically achieved in systems composed of a spin source and a magnetic target, where the magnetic state of the target is altered by a charge current. While theories suggest that ferromagnets could function as more versatile spin sources, direct experimental studies involving only the spin source and target layers have been lacking. Here electrical manipulation of spin states in noncolinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn using ferromagnets (Ni, Fe, NiFe, CoFeB) as the spin sources is reported. Both field&#8208;free switching and switching with an assistive field are achieved in Mn3Sn/ferromagnet bilayers, where the switching polarity correlates with the sign of anomalous Hall effect of the ferromagnets. The experimental findings can be accounted for by the presence of spin currents arising from spin&#8208;dependent scattering within the ferromagnets. This finding provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of spin&#8208;conversion in ferromagnets, offering an alternative spin source for novel technological applications.

         <title>Highly Stretchable 3D Microelectrode Array for Noninvasive Functional Evaluation of Cardiac Spheroids and Midbrain Organoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stretchable 3D multielectrode array (sMEA) with protruding microelectrodes is presented, achieved through structural design of a non&#8208;stretching material and over&#8208;electrodeposition of PEDOT:PSS. sMEA enables tight contact with organoids despite exposure to buoyant force in medium, resulting in electrophysiological signals with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR). High SNR signals allow for non&#8208;invasive functional assessment of the organoids for drug screening.








Abstract
Organoids are 3D biological models that recapitulate the complex structures and functions of human organs. Despite the rapid growth in the generation of organoids, in vitro assay tools are still limited to 2D forms. Thus, a comprehensive and continuous functional evaluation of the electrogenic organoids remains a challenge. Here, a highly stretchable 3D multielectrode array (sMEA) with protruding microelectrodes is presented for functional evaluation of electrogenic organoids. The optimized serpentine structures with bridge structures cover the surface of the organoids conformally even in immersion. The protruding microelectrodes form a stable contact with the organoids and allow electrophysiological recordings with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR). sMEAs are fabricated in wafer&#8208;scale for repeatable, scalable, and mass production and packed into an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use, user&#8208;friendly, and robust microwell for fast dissemination of technology. The versatility of sMEA is validated by measuring electrophysiological signals from cardiac spheroids and midbrain organoids with a wide range of sizes from 500 to 1500&#160;&#181;m. Also, electrophysiological signals recorded with high SNR enable functional evaluation of the effects of drugs. The proposed sMEA with high SNR and user&#8208;friendly interface could be the key player in high&#8208;throughput drug screening, 3D spatiotemporal mapping of electrogenic organoids, and standardization of protocols for quality assessment.

         <title>Enhancing Membrane Materials for Efficient Li Recycling and Recovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article systematically explores the recent advances in the membrane processes for lithium cycling and recovery, offering the first correlation between these technologies and technology readiness levels, unveiling the fundamentals for the lithium separation, and providing insights into the future design of membrane materials from both academic and industrial perspectives.








Abstract
Rapid uptake of lithium&#8208;centric technology, e.g., electric vehicles and large&#8208;scale energy storage, is increasing the demand for efficient technologies for lithium extraction from aqueous sources. Among various lithium&#8208;extraction technologies, membrane processes hold great promise due to energy efficiency and flexible operation in a continuous process with potential commercial viability. However, membrane separators face challenges such as the extraction efficiency due to the limited selectivity toward lithium relative to other species. Low selectivity can be ascribed to the uncontrollable selective channels and inefficient exclusion functions. However, recent selectivity enhancements for other membrane applications, such as in gas separation and energy storage, suggest that this may also be possible for lithium extraction. This review article focuses on the innovations in the membrane chemistries based on rational design following separation principles and unveiling the theories behind enhanced selectivity. Furthermore, recent progress in membrane&#8208;based lithium extraction technologies is summarized with the emphasis on inorganic, organic, and composite materials. The challenges and opportunities for developing the next generation of selective membranes for lithium recovery are also pointed out.

         <title>Strategies for Controlling Emission Anisotropy in Lead Halide Perovskite Emitters for LED Outcoupling Enhancement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rise of lead halide perovskite semiconductors has enabled high&#8208;performance LEDs with internal quantum efficiencies approaching 100%. In order to further enhance the external quantum efficiencies limited by light outcoupling effects, in this account, the strategies for reducing energy dissipation through the substrate, waveguide, and evanescent modes, with a focus on manipulating the transition dipole moment orientation are reviewed.








Abstract
In the last decade, momentous progress in lead halide perovskite (LHP) light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) is witnessed as their external quantum efficiency (&#951;ext) has increased from 0.1 to more than 30%. Indeed, perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs), which can in principle reach 100% internal quantum efficiency as they are not limited by the spin&#8208;statistics, are reaching their full potential and approaching the theoretical limit in terms of device efficiency. However, &#8776;70% to 85% of total generated photons are trapped within the devices through the dissipation pathways of the substrate, waveguide, and evanescent modes. To this end, numerous extrinsic and intrinsic light&#8208;outcoupling strategies are studied to enhance light&#8208;outcoupling efficiency (&#951;out). At the outset, various external and internal light outcoupling techniques are reviewed with specific emphasis on emission anisotropy and its role on &#951;out. In particular, the device &#951;ext can be enhanced by up to 50%, taking advantage of the increased probability for photons outcoupled to air by effectively inducing horizontally oriented emission transition dipole moments (TDM) in the perovskite emitters. The role of the TDM orientation in PeLED performance and the factors allowing its rational manipulation are reviewed extensively. Furthermore, this account presents an in&#8208;depth discussion about the effects of the self&#8208;assembly of LHP colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) into superlattices on the NC emission anisotropy and optical properties.

         <title>A Neuronal Signal Sorting and Amplifying Nanosensor for EEG&#8208;Concordant Imaging&#8208;Guided Precision Epilepsy Ablation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neuronal signal sorting and amplifying nanosensor integrates real&#8208;time, dynamically reversible potassium ion (K&#8314;) fluorescence imaging (FI) with high&#8208;resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This enables electroencephalogram&#8208;concordant imaging of hidden epileptic foci and guides minimally invasive radiofrequency ablation on mice with drug&#8208;resistant focal epilepsy, resulting in sustained seizure control and improved cognitive outcomes.









Abstract
Surgery remains an essential treatment for managing drug&#8208;resistant focal epilepsy, but its accessibility and efficacy are limited in patients without distinct structural abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Potassium ion (K+), a critical marker for seizure&#8208;associated neuronal signaling, shows significant promise for designing sensors targeting hidden epileptic foci. However, existing sensors cannot cross the blood&#8208;brain barrier and lack the ability to specifically enrich and amplify K+ signals in the brain with high temporal and spatial resolution. Here, an intravenously administered neuronal signal sorting and amplifying nanosensor (NSAN) is reported that combines real&#8208;time dynamic reversible K+ fluorescence imaging with high&#8208;resolution structural MRI, enabling electroencephalogram&#8208;concordant imaging of MRI&#8208;negative epileptic foci. Guided by NSANs, minimally invasive surgery is successfully performed in both intrahippocampal kainic acid (KA) epilepsy model with foci confined to the ipsilateral hippocampus, and intraperitoneal KA model where foci are randomly distributed, resulting in sustained seizure control and cognitive improvement. These findings highlight the NSAN as a transformative tool for visualizing hidden epileptic foci, thereby broadening eligibility for minimally invasive and precision surgical intervention.

         <title>Metal Halide Perovskite LEDs for Visible Light Communication and Lasing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are expected to be key optoelectronics in next&#8208;generation technologies. Beyond traditional solid&#8208;state lighting and displays, the progress, ongoing challenges, and future perspectives for the applications of perovskite LEDs in visible light communication and lasing technologies are discussed.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites, known for their pure and tunable light emission, near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields, favorable charge transport properties, and excellent solution processability, have emerged as promising materials for large&#8208;area, high&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Over the past decade, significant advancements have been made in enhancing the efficiency, response speed, and operational stability of perovskite LEDs. These promising developments pave the way for a broad spectrum of applications extending beyond traditional solid&#8208;state lighting and displays to include visible light communication (VLC) and lasing applications. This perspective evaluates the current state of perovskite LEDs in those emerging areas, addresses the primary challenges currently impeding the development of perovskite&#8208;based VLC systems and laser diodes, and provides an optimistic outlook on the future realization of perovskite&#8208;based VLC and electrically pumped perovskite lasers.

         <title>Giant Ultrabroadband Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Engendered by Two&#8208;Photon Absorption in &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 for Chiral Terahertz Wave Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports giant ultrabroadband two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) driven bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 utilizing wavelength&#8208;tunable terahertz emission spectroscopy. Ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 outperforms standard terahertz emitters like p&#8208;InAs, enabling efficient chiral terahertz wave emission with tunable orientation and ellipticity. The work highlights TPA&#8208;induced BPVE in narrow&#8208;bandgap ferroelectrics supports high&#8208;performance BPVE devices and guides chiral THz wave design.








Abstract
Bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) can break the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit by leveraging the inherent asymmetry of crystal lattice without a junction. However, this effect is mainly confined to UV&#8211;vis spectrum due to the wide&#8208;bandgap nature of traditional ferroelectric materials, thereby limiting the exploration of the infrared light&#8208;driven efficient BPVE. Herein, giant two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) driven BPVE is uncovered from visible to infrared in ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 utilizing wavelength&#8208;tunable terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy. Remarkably, &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 exhibits exceptional THz emission efficiency in the infrared region, surpassing renowned THz emitters like p&#8208;InAs and achieving an efficiency approximately eight times the magnitude of standard ZnTe. The power exponent&#8208;type pump fluence and quadruple polarization features reveal a unique TPA&#8208;driven BPVE, corroborated by a fourth&#8208;order nonlinear oscillator model. Notably, TPA&#8208;engendered BPVE efficiency approaches 68% of that observed in the single&#8208;photon absorption process. Moreover, the TPA responses display clear polarization anisotropy, with considerably relative phase and amplitude driven by synchronous in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization, leading to chiral THz waves with high efficiency, tunable orientation, and controllable ellipticity. This work highlights the advantages of TPA&#8208;induced BPVE responses in narrow&#8208;bandgap ferroelectric semiconductors, enhancing spectral utilization efficiency, aiding high&#8208;performance devices based on BPVE, and guiding chiral THz wave design.

         <title>Self&#8208;Selective (220) Directional Grown Copper Current Collector Design for Cycling&#8208;Stable Anode&#8208;Less Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;selective, preferentially Li salt&#8208;adsorbing and inorganic interphase&#8208;catalyzing copper current collector (CuCC) design is developed by incorporating Li salt into CuCC fabrication process to self&#8208;select out its salt&#8208;philic facet growth. This self&#8208;selected Cu(220) facet&#8208;dominant CuCC exhibits high selectivity and catalyzation ability for Li salt adsorption, decomposition, and inorganic interphase formation over other facets, reducing the electrode degradation speed by 33&#8211;42%.









Abstract
Anode&#8208;less lithium metal batteries (ALLMB) are promising candidates for energy storage applications owing to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and safety characteristics. However, the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on anode copper current collector (CuCC) leads to poor reversibility of uneven lithium deposition/stripping. Though the well&#8208;known knowledge of lithium salt&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich SEI (iSEI) benefiting uniform lithium deposition, how to design a lithium salt&#8208;philic CuCC with undiscovered salt&#8208;philic facet that favors lithium salt adsorption and catalyzing salt decomposition into iSEI, remains unexplored yet. Here, a self&#8208;selective and iSEI&#8208;catalyzing CuCC design is developed by using lithium salt as surface&#8208;controlling agent in CuCC electrodeposition process, self&#8208;selecting out and guiding unidirectional Cu(220) facet growth as the most salt&#8208;philic facets of CuCC. This self&#8208;selected Cu(220) facet promotes the salt adsorption and formation of salt decomposition&#8208;derived iSEI in battery, thus improving the lithium plating/stripping coulombic efficiency from 99.25% to 99.50% (stable within 400 cycles), and the capacity decay rate of ALLMB is also reduced by 42.4% within 100 cycles. Practical mass&#8208;productivity of this self&#8208;selective CuCC for 350 Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch&#8208;cell fabrication is also demonstrated, providing a new self&#8208;selective current collector design strategy for improving selectivity and catalyzation of desired chemical reaction, important for high&#8208;selectivity electrochemical reaction system construction.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Targeted Catalytic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cancer immunotherapy holds significant promise for improving cancer treatment, yet the low response rate remains a substantial challenge. It is crucial to gain a deep understanding of tumor&#8208;targeted catalytic materials to enhance targeting precision and therapeutic outcomes. This review focuses on recent advances in these materials and their role in improving catalytic immunotherapy, paving the way for next&#8208;generation cancer therapy.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy holds significant promise for improving cancer treatment efficacy; however, the low response rate remains a considerable challenge. To overcome this limitation, advanced catalytic materials offer potential in augmenting catalytic immunotherapy by modulating the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) through precise biochemical reactions. Achieving optimal targeting precision and therapeutic efficacy necessitates a thorough understanding of the properties and underlying mechanisms of tumor&#8208;targeted catalytic materials. This review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of recent advancements in tumor&#8208;targeted catalytic materials and their critical role in enhancing catalytic immunotherapy.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Gold Nanoaggregates for NIR LED&#8208;Driven Sustained Mild Photothermal Therapy Achieving Complete Tumor Eradication and Immune Enhancement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustained mild photothermal therapy (smPTT) is presented, utilizing gold nanoparticle aggregates (AuNAs) with an impressive photothermal efficiency of up to 92.8%. This strategy employs low&#8208;power LED irradiation to achieve complete tumor eradication while enhancing safety and immune responses. The findings indicate that this approach has significant potential for improving cancer treatment outcomes and expanding the applicability of photothermal therapy.








Abstract
For millennia, humans have harnessed thermal energy to treat cancer. However, delivering energy to tumor tissues in traditional hyperthermia remains a significant challenge. Nanotechnology has revolutionized this approach, enabling nanomaterials to target tumors precisely and act as internal heat sources. Nanomaterial&#8208;based photothermal therapy employs nano&#8208;photothermal agents to absorb near&#8208;infrared light and convert it into heat, offering non&#8208;invasive, highly controllable, and specific treatment for solid tumors. Nonetheless, achieving complete tumor eradication, preventing recurrence, and ensuring safety continue to be major concerns. To address these issues, sustained mild photothermal therapy (smPTT) is proposed, utilizing gold nanoaggregates (AuNAs) with a high photothermal conversion efficiency (92.8%) in combination with a single irradiation of low&#8208;power (&#8764;0.1 W&#160;cm&#8722;2) sustained LED light. This method achieved complete tumor eradication in animal models, with no recurrence over long&#8208;term (&gt;180 days) monitoring. This strategy provides superior therapeutic effects compared to mild photothermal therapy and higher safety than high&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy. Additionally, it induces a strong immune response and immune memory, crucial for preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis. This novel approach to photothermal therapy may significantly impact clinical applications for shallow tumor treatment and offer new avenues for immunotherapy.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Capacitive Energy Storage Density at 150&#160;&#176;C Achieved in Polyetherimide Composite Films by Filler and Structure Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stacked structure design method of integrating inorganic fillers with high &#603;r, and PEI polymers with high breakdown strength is proposed. BNKT&#8208;BST dense ceramics are prepared by solid&#8208;phase reaction method, and BNKT&#8208;BST/PEI nanocomposites are prepared by casting and hot&#8208;pressing method, which resulted in nanocomposites with excellent energy storage properties at high temperatures.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics are crucial for electronic communications and industrial applications due to their high breakdown field strength (Eb), fast charge/discharge speed, and temperature stability. The upcoming electronic&#8208;electrical systems pose a significant challenge, necessitating polymeric dielectrics to exhibit exceptional thermal stability and energy storage capabilities at high temperatures. Here, ultra&#8208;high dielectric constant (&#603;r) and charge/discharge efficiency (&#951;) of 0.55Bi0.5(Na0.84K0.16)0.5TiO3&#8208;0.45(Bi0.1Sr0.85)TiO3 (BNKT&#8208;BST) ceramics are prepared by the solid&#8208;phase reaction method and added to polyetherimide (PEI) to form BNKT&#8208;BST/PEI nanocomposites with various structures. The findings indicate that the sandwich&#8208;structured BNKT&#8208;BST/PEI nanocomposite achieves the highest discharged energy density (Ud) of 7.7 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 with &#951; of 80.2% when the Eb is 650 MV&#160;m&#8722;1 at 150&#160;&#176;C. This is primarily due to the incorporation of BNKT&#8208;BST nanoparticles and the multilayer structure design, which significantly improves the composite's &#603;r and Eb. Additionally, the sandwich&#8208;structured composites show excellent cycling stability at 500 MV&#160;m&#8722;1 and 150&#160;&#176;C, with Ud of &#8776; 4.7 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and &#951; greater than 90%. The research presents nanocomposites with high energy storage density and excellent stability, crucial for the practical application of polymer dielectrics in high&#8208;temperature environments.

         <title>Hierarchically Promoted Light Harvesting and Management in Photothermal Solar Steam Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the critical role of multi&#8208;scale hierarchical structures, from molecular to macro levels, in optimizing light harvesting and photothermal efficiency in solar steam generation (SSG) systems. By tailoring materials and structures to enhance light absorption, manage thermal properties, and support effective water transport, these integrated designs advance solar&#8208;thermal desalination as a sustainable solution to water scarcity.








Abstract
Solar steam generation (SSG) presents a promising approach to addressing the global water crisis. Central to SSG is solar photothermal conversion that requires efficient light harvesting and management. Hierarchical structures with multi&#8208;scale light management are therefore crucial for SSG. At the molecular and sub&#8208;nanoscale levels, materials are fine&#8208;tuned for broadband light absorption. Advancing to the nano&#8208; and microscale, structures are tailored to enhance light harvesting through internal reflections, scattering, and diverse confinement effects. At the macroscopic level, light capture is optimized through rationally designed device geometries, configurations, and arrangements of solar absorber materials. While the performance of SSG relies on various factors including heat transport, physicochemical interactions at the water/air and material/water interfaces, salt dynamics, etc., efficient light capture and utilization holds a predominant role because sunlight is the sole energy source. This review focuses on the critical, yet often underestimated, role of hierarchical light harvesting/management at different dimensional scales in SSG. By correlating light management with the structure&#8208;property relationships, the recent advances in SSG are discussed, shedding light on the current challenges and possible future trends and opportunities in this domain.

Thin film Diamond Like Carbon (DLC) on roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll gravure printing cylinders offers superior conductive ink transfer to flexible substrates compared to chrome. It enables fine lines and intricate structures for flexible electronics and security applications. DLC supports high&#8208;volume production of flexible microelectronics and micro&#8208;scale battery components, providing a more sustainable alternative to rigid electronics and reducing the carbon footprint.








Abstract
Diamond&#8208;Like Carbon (DLC), a thin&#8208;film material, is emerging as a promising alternative for durable surfaces due to its eco&#8208;friendly application process. This study evaluated the use of thin&#8208;film DLC on the wafer surface of gravure cylinders for roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll printing of fine&#8208;line electrodes and microtext patterns, specifically for applications in flexible electronics and graphics security. Results suggested that using thin film DLC on the wafer surface allows reliable reproduction of isometric grids and line structures with widths of 15, 20, and 30 &#181;m, as well as solid electrodes. The uniform conformity of thin&#8208;film DLC on the wafer surface, featuring an engraved micron&#8208;size cell structure, demonstrates superior ink transfer onto flexible PET (polyethylene terephthalate) substrates. This results in increased electrode line width and reduced electrical resistance compared to chrome. Statistical analysis confirmed the reliability and repeatability of the findings. Visual analysis of lines and microtext also demonstrated the reliable print&#8208;reproducing capabilities of DLC&#8208;coated surfaces. Overall, these results suggest that thin&#8208;film DLC is a promising alternative for use as a protective layer on gravure wafer surfaces. It has the potential to produce high&#8208;quality, high&#8208;volume electronics, such as sensors, antennas, and batteries, for applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) and other sustainable technologies.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Resistance Photoluminescence Carbonized Polymer Dots Through Equilibrium Bi&#8208;Confinement Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, bi&#8208;confinement effects arising from a highly cross&#8208;linked polymer network and rigid Al&#8322;O&#8323; matrix are exploited to achieve ultra&#8208;stable carbonized polymer dots (CPDs). The obtained CPDs@Al2O3 composite demonstrates exceptional long&#8208;term stability in various solvents and high photoluminescence emission thermotolerance up to 500&#160;K for 150&#160;h, representing the best performance of carbon dots under harsh conditions reported to date.








Abstract
Carbon dots are emerging luminescent nanomaterials that have drawn considerable attention due to their abundance, environmental friendliness, and customizable optical properties. However, their susceptibility to temperature&#8208;induced vibrational exciton changes and the tendency to thermal quenching of emission have hindered their practical applications. Here, a method is reported for achieving high&#8208;temperature photoluminescence carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) through a bi&#8208;confinement approach that involves a highly cross&#8208;linked polymer network and a rigid Al2O3 matrix. As the temperature increased from 303 to 500&#160;K, the fluorescence and phosphorescence emission intensities of CPDs@Al2O3 remained virtually unchanged, with the emission duration exceeding 150&#160;h at 500&#160;K. Additionally, CPDs@Al2O3 composites with different degrees of carbonization exhibit dynamic excitation&#8208;dependent photoluminescence properties, which can be patterned for multiple information encryption application. This work provides a concept for designing stable and luminous CPDs under harsh conditions, thus expanding their potential application range.

         <title>Xolography for 3D Printing in Microgravity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Xolography can 3D print versatile plastic and hydrogel parts in microgravity and a variety of resins can be processed independent from viscosity and flow properties. Just like on Earth, complex geometries, smooth surfaces and feature resolution down to 20&#160;&#181;m can be achieved during 20&#160;s microgravity phases in a parabolic flight experiment.








Abstract
Xolography is a volumetric 3D printing technique utilizing intersecting light beams within a volume of photopolymer for a spatially controlled photopolymerization. Unlike layer&#8208;based methods, Xolography creates structures continuously within a closed photopolymer vat, eliminating the prevalent need for support structures and allowing full geometrical freedom at high printing speeds. The volumetric working principle does not rely on gravity, making Xolography an outstanding technology for additive manufacturing under microgravity conditions as illustrated in a set of experiments during a parabolic flight campaign. The microgravity environment obviates the need for rheology control of resins, enabling the use of low&#8208;viscosity formulations (e.g., 11&#160;mPa&#160;s) while maintaining the fast and precise 3D printing of acrylic polymer resins and hydrogels. Xolography's speed and reliability facilitate rapid iterations of a print task between Earth's gravity and microgravity conditions. This capability positions Xolography as an ideal tool for material research and manufacturing in space, offering significant cost and efficiency advantages over traditional methods.

         <title>Stretchable Multimodal Photonic Sensor for Wearable Multiparameter Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stretchable multimodal photonic sensor capable of simultaneously detecting and discriminating strain deformations, temperature, and sweat pH is developed for on&#8208;skin health monitoring. By integrating multiple sensing mechanisms in a single hydrogel&#8208;coated PDMS optical fiber (HPOF) at distinct wavelengths, the device achieves simultaneous monitoring of heartbeat, respiration, body temperature, and sweat pH of a person in real&#8208;time with negligible crosstalk.








Abstract
Stretchable sensors that can conformally interface with the skins for wearable and real&#8208;time monitoring of skin deformations, temperature, and sweat biomarkers offer critical insights for early disease prediction and diagnosis. Integration of multiple modalities in a single stretchable sensor to simultaneously detect these stimuli would provide a more comprehensive understanding of human physiology, which, however, has yet to be achieved. Here, this work reports, for the first time, a stretchable multimodal photonic sensor capable of simultaneously detecting and discriminating strain deformations, temperature, and sweat pH. The multimodal sensing abilities are enabled by realization of multiple sensing mechanisms in a hydrogel&#8208;coated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) optical fiber (HPOF), featured with high flexibility, stretchability, and biocompatibility. The integrated mechanisms are designed to operate at distinct wavelengths to facilitate stimuli decoupling and employ a ratiometric detection strategy for improved robustness and accuracy. To simplify sensor interrogation, spectrally&#8208;resolved multiband emissions are generated upon the excitation of a single&#8208;wavelength laser, utilizing upconversion luminescence (UCL) and radiative energy transfer (RET) processes. As proof of concept, this work demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneous monitoring of the heartbeat, respiration, body temperature, and sweat pH of a person in real&#8208;time, with only a single sensor.

         <title>Efficiency Boost in Through Space Charge Transfer Emitters: Insights from Spiro Lateral Rocking Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sterical aryl immobilizing groups are incorporated (phenyl and pyridine) at the C8 site of the rigid fluorene spacer. These immobilizing groups restrict both rotational and rocking motions. The completely confined conformation demonstrates enhanced TADF performance.








Abstract
Intramolecular through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer (TSCT) excited states have emerged as promising candidates for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. This study addresses the challenges in tuning excited state dynamics through conformational engineering, which significantly impacts exciton utilization. An effective strategy is presented to enhance the performance of TSCT&#8208;TADF molecules by restricting the lateral rocking of the spiro unit via immobilizing groups, which indirectly adjusts the conformations of the donor and acceptor subunits. This approach is successfully illustrated with two TSCT&#8208;TADF emitters, 8PhDM&#8208;B and 8PyDM&#8208;B, featuring sterical aryl phenyl and pyridine substitutions at the C8 site of a rigid spiro&#8208;fluorene bridge. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) utilizing these emitters demonstrated impressive maximum external quantum efficiencies of 33.1% and 31.0%, respectively. The findings underscore the importance of the rocking confined strategy in refining excited state dynamics, thereby providing valuable insights for the design of highly efficient OLED emitters.

         <title>Fully Transparent and Distortion&#8208;Free Monotonically Stretchable Substrate by Nanostructure Alignment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For achieving monotonic transparent, stretchable substrates with near&#8208;zero Poisson's ratio, this approach utilizes nanoscopic block copolymer alignment via shear&#8208;rolling. This alignment of nanostructures smaller than the wavelength of light yields a near&#8208;zero Poisson's ratio (&#8776;0.07), eliminating vertical contraction and maintaining distortion&#8208;free performance under uniform strain across the entire area even under 50% strain, with excellent optical properties.








Abstract
Stretchable devices, garnering increasing attention as next&#8208;generation form factors, have a crucial problem in that vertical contraction occurs during stretching, causing image distortion of stretchable displays and discomfort in skin&#8208;attached devices. Previous structural strategies to mitigate vertical contraction, such as auxetic reentrants and wrinkles, suffer from the drawback that their structure becomes visible during stretching. In this study, this issue is addressed by unidirectionally aligning nanoscopic cylinders within block copolymer elastomer films. Employing a shear&#8208;rolling process at high temperatures on thick films of polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;polyisobutylene&#8208;block&#8208;polystyrene thermoplastic elastomers, macroscopic mechanical anisotropy is achieved, resulting in completely transparent and monotonically stretchable substrates devoid of vertical or depth distortion during deformation. Significantly, the unidirectional orientation of high&#8208;modulus cylindrical nanostructures induces macroscopic mechanical anisotropy with a modulus ratio exceeding five times. While the Poisson's ratio of conventional elastic materials hovers around &#8776;0.5, this mechanical anisotropy minimizes vertical contraction, yielding a Poisson's ratio below 0.07. Moreover, owing to the negligible size of the nanocylinders compared to visible&#8208;light wavelengths, the substrate can be monotonically uniaxially stretched while maintaining high transmittance without introducing distortions, surface undulations, or haziness, resulting in distortion&#8208;free stretchable substrates.

Significantly, the unidirectional orientation of high-modulus cylindrical nanostructures induces macroscopic mechanical anisotropy with a modulus ratio exceeding five times. While the Poisson's ratio of conventional elastic materials hovers around &#8776;0.5, this mechanical anisotropy minimizes vertical contraction, yielding a Poisson's ratio below 0.07. Moreover, owing to the negligible size of the nanocylinders compared to visible-light wavelengths, the substrate can be monotonically uniaxially stretched while maintaining high transmittance without introducing distortions, surface undulations, or haziness, resulting in distortion-free stretchable substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A New Generation of Multimilliwatt&#8208;Class Colloidal Quantum&#8208;Dot Lasers at Full Colors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The full&#8208;color QD lasers relevant for practical implementations are achieved. These QD lasers feature the simultaneous metrics of low threshold, long operating duration, and multimilliwatt output power under quasi&#8208;steady&#8208;state pumping. To the best of the available knowledge, the multimilliwatt output power has never been realized in QD lasers before. These results open the door to practical QD lasers.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are attractive gain materials owing to the wide range of accessible colors. However, the existing QD lasers struggle to combine technologically relevant metrics of low threshold and long operating duration with considerable output powers. Here a new class of full&#8208;color QD lasers are reported, featuring low threshold, uninterrupted operation for dozens of hours, and multimilliwatt output under quasi&#8208;steady&#8208;state pumping, by coupling the high&#8208;gain QDs with a double&#8208;clad pumping scheme. Corroborated by the comprehensive transient spectroscopy and numerical simulation, it is demonstrated that the ternary QDs with specially designed fine nanostructure enable the low gain threshold, giant gain coefficient, long gain lifetime, and excellent resistance against intense photoexcitation. Meanwhile, the double&#8208;clad QD&#8208;fiber design allows for record&#8208;long light&#8208;gain interaction, high conversion efficiency, and sustained device operation. As such, the QD lasers with multimilliwatt output powers, unobserved in QD lasers to date, have been realized. Further, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application for generating vortex beams with various topological charges is demonstrated. This work represents significant progress toward practical lasers based on QDs.

         <title>Highly Efficient Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids via Electrocatalytic C&#8208;N Coupling Reaction Over an Atomically Dispersed Iron Loaded Defective TiO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient electrocatalytic synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids with a high glyoxylic acid conversion of &#8776;100% and a glycine selectivity of 80.2% is achieved with an atomically dispersed Fe loaded defective TiO2 monolithic electrocatalyst. This work provides an efficient electrocatalyst for the C&#8208;N coupling synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids.








Abstract
The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids via the electrocatalytic C&#8208;N coupling attracted extensive attention owing to the mild reaction conditions, controllable reaction parameters, and atom economy. However, the &#945;&#8208;amino acid yield remains unsatisfying. Herein, the efficient electrocatalytic synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids is achieved with an atomically dispersed Fe loaded defective TiO2 monolithic electrocatalyst (adFe&#8208;TiOx/Ti). The desired electrocatalyst composition for the hydrogenation of oxime is screened. The prepared adFe&#8208;TiOx/Ti exhibited a high glyoxylic acid conversion of &#8776;100% and a glycine selectivity of 80.2%. The electrochemical experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that atomically dispersed Fe (adFe) sites and oxygen vacancies (OVs) enhanced the adsorption of glyoxylic acid (GA), glyoxylic oxime (GO), and nitrate (NO3&#8722;). adFe sites further promote the step of H2NO* &#8594; H2NOH* in the conversion of NO3&#8722; to hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and the step of NH&#8208;CH2&#8208;COOH* &#8594; NH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;COOH* in the reduction of GO to glycine. The coupling pathway and the critical intermediate are revealed by synchrotron radiation Fourier transform infrared (SR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopy and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS). Additionally, six other &#945;&#8208;amino acids are successfully synthesized by the adFe&#8208;TiOx/Ti, showcasing its versatility in the electrosynthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids. This work provides an efficient electrocatalyst for the C&#8208;N coupling synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids.

         <title>Layered Deep&#8208;UV Optical Crystal KZn&#8322;BO&#8323;Br&#8322; as a High&#8208;&#954; Dielectric for 2D Electronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces AZBX (AZn&#8322;BO&#8323;X&#8322;) as a quasi&#8208;vdW layered dielectric for 2D semiconductor devices, offering a wide bandgap (&#8776;5.6 eV) and high dielectric constant (&#954;&#160;=&#160;13.5). KZBB/MoS&#8322; FETs demonstrate excellent performance, including steep subthreshold swing, high on/off ratio, minimal hysteresis, and low leakage, highlighting AZBX's potential for advanced 2D electronics.









Abstract
The development of dielectrics with atomic planes and van der Waals (vdW) interfaces is essential for enhancing the performance of 2D devices. However, vdW dielectrics often have smaller bandgaps compared to traditional 3D dielectrics, limiting their options. This study introduces AZBX (AZn&#8322;BO&#8323;X&#8322;, where A&#160;=&#160;K or Rb, X&#160;=&#160;Cl or Br), a nonlinear deep&#8208;ultraviolet optical crystal, as a quasi&#8208;vdW layered dielectric ideal for 2D electronic devices. Focusing on KZBB, it's excellent dielectric properties, including a wide bandgap, high dielectric constant (high&#8208;&#954;), and smooth interfaces are demonstrated. When used as the top gate dielectric in a KZBB/MoS&#8322; field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) with MoS&#8322; channels and graphene contacts, the device exhibits outstanding performance, with a steep subthreshold swing (&#8776; 73&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1), high on/off ratio (&#8776; 10&#8311;), negligible hysteresis (0&#8211;8 mV), and stable, low leakage current (&#8776;10&#8315;&#8311; A&#160;cm&#8722;2) before breakdown. This work expands the 2D material and dielectric landscape and highlights the strong potential of AZBX as high&#8208;performance dielectrics.

         <title>Thermal Annealing for High Performance and Memory Behavior in n&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal annealing of the n&#8208;type mixed conductor has a profound effect on its crystallinity, enhancing electronic mobility and decreasing water uptake during electrochemical charging. This new microstructure imparts an &#8220;ionic memory&#8221; behavior to the material. Leveraging the polymer's sensitivity to light, this work demonstrates the first NIR light&#8208;induced conductance modulation of a mixed conductor in an aqueous electrolyte.








Abstract
N&#8208;type organic mixed ionic electronic conductors (n&#8208;OMIECs) struggle to match the performance of p&#8208;type counterparts, particularly in bioelectronics' flagship device, the organic electrochemical transistor. Enhancing n&#8208;type transistor performance typically necessitates the synthesis of new materials. More sustainable post&#8208;synthetic treatments, known to improve organic devices in dry and oxygen&#8208;free conditions, are not applied to n&#8208;OMIECs. This study introduces thermal annealing to enhance n&#8208;OMIECs' electron mobility without sacrificing their ability to take up ionic charges. Annealing increases the crystallinity of p(gNDI&#8208;gT2), the first designed n&#8208;OMIEC, enhancing its transistor performance to compete with new&#8208;generation NDI&#8208;based materials. Annealing reduces passive and in operando electrolyte uptake without compromising the device threshold voltage, keeping the device power demand low. The microstructure obtained by annealing, combined with the film's strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and reduced water swelling, enables the creation of a device that retains photocurrent generated upon frequency&#8208;dependent light training. This leads to a microscale, water&#8208;compatible memory device that emulates the learning process of biological neurons triggered by light. This simple device can be implemented in artificial neural networks and face recognition platforms and achieve vector&#8208;matrix multiplication when fabricated in an array form, showcasing the potential for innovative applications in bioelectronics.

         <title>High Defect Tolerance Breaking the Design Limitation of Full&#8208;Spectrum Multimodal Luminescence Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A grossite&#8208;type fast ionic conductor CaGa4O7, with a high defect tolerance structure, is used to develop single&#8208;component multimodal luminescence materials. Almost all luminescent modes and full&#8208;spectrum emissions are realized by doping this single host. A series of dynamic anti&#8208;counterfeiting devices and digital information encryption technology with temporal and spatial resolution are proposed to show the visualized optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting application.








Abstract
With the development of optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting and the increasing demand for high&#8208;level information encryption, multimodal luminescence (MML) materials attract much attention. However, the discovery of these multifunctional materials is very accidental, and the versatile host suitable for developing such materials remains unclear. Here, a grossite&#8208;type fast ionic conductor CaGa4O7, characterized by layered and tunnel structure with excellent defect tolerance, is found to meet the needs of various luminescent processes. Almost all luminescent modes, including down/up&#8208;conversion luminescence (DCL/UCL), long persistent luminescence (LPL), mechanoluminescence (ML), and X&#8208;ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL), are realized in this single host. Full&#8208;spectrum (from violet to near&#8208;infrared) photoluminescence and ML as well as multicolor XEOL are achieved by simply changing the doped luminescent center. A series of anti&#8208;counterfeiting devices, including the quasi&#8208;dynamic display of famous paintings, digital information encryption, and multi&#8208;color handwritten signatures, are designed to show the encryption of information in temporal and spatial dimensions. This study clarifies the importance of defect tolerance of the host for the development of MML materials, and provides a unique insight into the cross&#8208;field applications of special functional materials, which is a new strategy to accelerate the development of novel MML materials.

         <title>Surface Defects Control Bulk Carrier Densities in Polycrystalline Pb&#8208;Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping, the controlled addition of imperfections or impurities to a material, is crucial for semiconductors. This study shows that for&#160;Halide Perovskites, which have (very) low (intrinsic) defect densities because of&#160;effective self&#8208;healing and defect tolerance,&#160;the title's statement holds in an unprecedented fashion.








Abstract
The (opto)electronic behavior of semiconductors depends on their (quasi&#8208;)free electronic carrier densities. These are regulated by semiconductor doping, i.e., controlled &#8220;electronic contamination&#8221;. For metal halide perovskites (HaPs), the functional materials in several device types, which already challenge some of the understanding of semiconductor properties, this study shows that doping type, density and properties derived from these, are to a first approximation controlled via their surfaces. This effect, relevant to all semiconductors, and already found for some, is very evident for lead (Pb)&#8208;HaPs because of their intrinsically low electrically active bulk and surface defect densities. Volume carrier densities for most polycrystalline Pb&#8208;HaP films (&lt;1&#160;&#181;m grain diameter) are below those resulting from even &lt; 0.1% of surface sites being electrically active defects. This implies and is consistent with interfacial defects controlling HaP devices in multi&#8208;layered structures with most of the action at the two HaP interfaces. Surface and interface passivation effects on bulk electrical properties are relevant to all semiconductors and are crucial for developing those used today. However, because bulk dopant introduction in HaPs at controlled ppm levels for electronic&#8208;relevant carrier densities is so difficult, passivation effects are vastly more critical and dominate, to first approximation, their optoelectronic characteristics in devices.

         <title>Microenvironment Self&#8208;Adaptive Nanomedicine Promotes Spinal Cord Repair by Suppressing Inflammation Cascade and Neural Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microenvironment self&#8208;adaptive nanomedicine (RHNP&#8208;Cur) is capable of consistently crossing the blood spinal cord barrier and selectively targeting inflammatory cells and neural cells based on different stages of spinal cord injury through changes of surface structure and targeted peptide modification, promoting spinal cord repair by suppressing inflammation cascade and neural apoptosis.








Abstract
Despite various biomaterial&#8208;based strategies are tried in spinal cord injury (SCI), developing safe and effective microinvasive pharmacotherapy strategies is still an unmet clinical need. Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanomedicine has emerged as a promising non&#8208;invasion technology, which enhances drug delivery and promotes functional recovery following SCI. Considering the multiple progressive pathological events and the blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) associating SCI, a microenvironment self&#8208;adaptive nanoparticle (custom&#8208;designed with rabies virus glycoprotein 29&#8208;RVG29 and hyaluronic acid&#8208;HA, RHNP) capable of consistently crossing the BSCB and selectively targeting inflammatory cells and neural cells based on different stages of SCI are developed. The data indicated that RHNP can effectively traverse the BSCB through RVG29, and adaptively modulate cellular internalization by selectively exposing either HA or RVG29 through diselenide bonds, depending on pathological reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals. Furthermore, curcumin is loaded into RHNP (RHNP&#8208;Cur) to improve motor function and coordination of hind&#8208;limbs in a traumatic SCI mouse model. This study finds that RHNP&#8208;Cur exhibited inhibitory effects on the inflammatory cascade originating from M1 microglia/macrophages and neurotoxic astrocytes, and protected neural cells from inflammation&#8208;induced apoptosis during nerve regeneration. Collectively, the work provides a microenvironment self&#8208;adaptive nanomedicine which enables efficient microinvasive treatment of SCI.

         <title>Ether&#8208;Modified Nonflammable Phosphate Enabling Anion&#8208;Rich Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ether&#8208;modified nonflammable phosphate, DMEP, is designed to enhance the miscibility of high&#8208;concentration phosphate&#8208;based electrolytes with diluent. The DMEP&#8208;based electrolyte features a cation&#8208;anion aggregate&#8208;dominated solvation structure, which promotes the formation of LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphases, enabling long&#8208;term cycling stability in 4.7&#160;V high&#8208;voltage LiNi0.8Co0.10Mn0.10O2 ||Li pouch cells with a low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.33.








Abstract
Phosphate&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCE) feature high flame retardant and satisfactory cathodic stability for lithium metal batteries. However, stable cycling of those electrolytes at ultra&#8208;high upper cut&#8208;off voltages for long&#8208;term stability remains challenging. Herein, an ether&#8208;modified phosphate, diethyl (2&#8208;methoxy ethoxy) methylphosphonate (DMEP), is designed for high&#8208;voltage applications. The ether modification enhances the stability of the Li+&#8208;DMEP&#8208;FSI&#8722; coordination structure, promoting the formation of cation&#8208;anion aggregates (AGG) dominated solvation structure, which favors the generation of LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase layers compared to triethyl phosphate (TEP)&#8208;based LHCE. Consequently, cathode degradation, including transition&#8208;metal dissolution and electrode cracking, is well&#8208;suppressed. The LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)||Li full cells using DMEP&#8208;based LHCEs show more than 90.7% capacity retention at an ultrahigh upper cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.7 V after 100 cycles. Notably, DMEP&#8208;LHCE exhibits enhanced safety than that of TEP&#8208;LHCE, suggesting its versatility and potential for next&#8208;generation lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Nanoengineering&#8208;Enhanced Capillary Cooling Achieves Sustained Thermal Protection for Ultra&#8208;High Heat Flux and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research explores novel advancements in capillary cooling schemes for ultra&#8208;high heat flux and temperature. Micromodel experiment helps provide visualized evidence for evaporation&#8208;driven mechanisms behind capillary flow phenomenon in porous media. Nanoengineering significantly improves thermal protection capacity of capillary cooling. Results show that nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling holds significant potential as a reliable and sustained thermal protection scheme in the future.








Abstract
Extreme thermal conditions with heat flux densities exceeding 1 MW m&#8722;2 or temperatures reaching up to 1000 &#176;C are prevalent in various situations. However, thermal protection ability depends on specialized materials or is currently limited with existing cooling schemes. Herein, an innovative cooling scheme that relies on evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow, enhanced by nanoengineering&#8208;designed porous structures with common materials, is proposed. Experimentally&#8208;obtained capillary flow cooling curve identifies critical heat flux corresponding to evaporation&#8208;driven flow stage, where coolants cool the surface and subsequent vapor impedes heat transfer from thermal boundaries. Nanoengineering provides opportunities for enhanced capillary flow, which proves to endow bronze, TC4 (titanium alloy, Ti&#8208;6Al&#8208;4V), and Al2O3 with thermal protection ability 50&#8211;180% higher than that without nanoengineering&#8208;designed. The authors&#8217; scheme achieves critical heat flux up to 2.0&#8211;3.1 MW m&#8722;2 and performs thermal dissipation capacity almost twice higher than inherent latent heat of coolant. Further, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, this scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;heat&#8208;flux environments and paves the way for development of lightweight, long&#8208;lasting, and large&#8208;scale solutions for thermal protection.

         <title>Nucleus&#8208;Targeting Photosensitizers Enhance Neutrophil Extracellular Traps for Efficient Eradication of Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleus&#8208;targeting photosensitizer, NCP, with strong ROS generation and DNA&#8208;binding capabilities has been developed for efficient neutrophil&#8208;mediated antibacterial therapy. NCP utilize the intrinsic NET&#8208;associated antibacterial mechanism to achieve precise eradication of bacteria, providing a novel strategy to reinforce host immune defense against multi&#8208;resistant bacterial wound infections.








Abstract
Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are web&#8208;like complexes of DNA and proteins that are extruded by activated neutrophils and play critical roles as major components of the innate immune response against pathogen invasion. However, some microbes have developed strategies to evade NET attacks, leading to impaired immune defenses and persistent infections. In this study, an engineered neutrophil strategy for enhancing the antibacterial activity of NETs is developed. A nucleus&#8208;targeting photosensitizer (NCP) with strong reactive oxygen species production and a strong DNA&#8208;binding capacity is synthesized. NCP&#8208;loaded neutrophils are subsequently constructed via direct incubation of NCP with neutrophils, and the NCP is closely inserted into the nucleus DNA. Upon activation by bacteria&#8208;related toxins, NCP&#8208;coupled NETs can be released rapidly, actively trapping bacteria and providing a high local concentration of NCP around them. Both in vitro and in vivo results revealed that NCP&#8208;coupled NETs can effectively eradicate various multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria and biofilms through photodynamic therapy, overcome bacterial immune evasion, and promote tissue recovery from severe wound infections. This design can significantly strengthen NET function, providing a non&#8208;antibiotic alternative platform for treating bacterial infectious diseases.

         <title>Full van der Waals Ambipolar Ferroelectric Configurable Optical Hetero&#8208;Synapses for In&#8208;Sensor Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper proposes an optical synapse based on van der Waals heterojunction. Based on this device, an optical reservoir neural network and a visible light communication system were developed, which successfully imitated the signal preprocessing and data transmission process of the human visual system for color images. This provides new ideas for the development of intelligent imaging systems.








Abstract
The rapid development of visual neuromorphic hardware can be attributed to their ability to capture, store and process optical signals from the environment. The main limitation of existing visual neuromorphic hardware is that the realization of complex functions is premised on the increase of manufacturing cost, hardware volume and energy consumption. In this study, we demonstrated an optical synaptic device based on a three&#8208;terminal van der Waals (vdW) heterojunction that can realize the sensing functions of light wavelength and intensity as well as short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term synaptic plasticity. In the image recognition task, we constructed an optical reservoir neural network (ORNN) and a visible light communication system (VLC) composed of this optical synaptic device. The ORNN has a recognition rate of up to 84.9% for 50 000 color images in 10 categories in the CIFAR&#8208;10 color image dataset, and the VLC system can achieve high&#8208;speed transmission with an ultra&#8208;low power consumption of only 0.4 nW. This work shows that through reasonable design, vdW heterojunction structures have great application potential in low&#8208;power multifunctional fusion application tasks such as visual bionics.

         <title>Sensitive Self&#8208;Driven Single&#8208;Component Organic Photodetector Based on Vapor&#8208;Deposited Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully thermally evaporated single&#8208;component organic photodetector is demonstrated with high photoresponsivity at zero bias, resulting in a specific detectivity of 1 &#183; 1013&#160;Jones based on noise measurements. Ultrafast charge generation within one&#160;picosecond is observed in the neat photoactive material, which is attributed to the strong electronic coupling of the molecular exciton and charge&#8208;transfer states in the small molecule.








Abstract
Typically, organic solar cells (OSCs) and photodetectors (OPDs) comprise an electron donating and accepting material to facilitate efficient charge carrier generation. This approach has proven successful in achieving high&#8208;performance devices but has several drawbacks for upscaling and stability. This study presents a fully vacuum&#8208;deposited single&#8208;component OPD, employing the neat oligothiophene derivative DCV2&#8208;5T in the photoactive layer. Free charge carriers are generated with an internal quantum efficiency of 20 % at zero bias. By optimizing the device structure, a very low dark current of 3.4 &#183; 10&#8722;11&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.1&#160;V is achieved, comparable to the dark current of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art bulk heterojunction OPDs. This optimization results in specific detectivities of 1&#183; 1013&#160;Jones (based on noise measurements), accompanied by a fast photoresponse (f&#8208;3dB = 200&#160;kHz) and a broad linear dynamic range (&gt;&#160;150&#160;dB). Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy unveils that charge carriers are already formed at very short time scales (&lt;&#160;1&#160;ps). The surprisingly efficient bulk charge generation mechanism is attributed to a strong electronic coupling of the molecular exciton and charge transfer states. This work demonstrates the very high performance of single&#8208;component OPDs and proves that this novel device design is a successful strategy for highly efficient, morphological stable and easily manufacturable devices.

         <title>Hierarchical Nanostructures as Acoustically Manipulatable Multifunctional Agents in Dynamic Fluid Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flower&#8208;like hierarchical nanostructure microparticles can be trapped by focused ultrasound and manipulated within high&#8208;velocity dynamic fluid flow. The wide range of design versatility, substantial surface area, and biocompatibility enable such microparticles to function as acoustically manipulatable medical imaging contrast agents and microrobots.








Abstract
Acoustic waves provide a biocompatible and deep&#8208;tissue&#8208;penetrating tool suitable for contactless manipulation in in vivo environments. Despite the prevalence of dynamic fluids within the body, previous studies have primarily focused on static fluids, and manipulatable agents in dynamic fluids are limited to gaseous core&#8208;shell particles. However, these gas&#8208;filled particles face challenges in fast&#8208;flow manipulation, complex setups, design versatility, and practical medical imaging, underscoring the need for effective alternatives. In this study, flower&#8208;like hierarchical nanostructures (HNS) into microparticles (MPs) are incorporated, and demonstrated that various materials fabricated as HNS&#8208;MPs exhibit effective and reproducible acoustic trapping within high&#8208;velocity fluid flows. Through simulations, it is validated that the HNS&#8208;MPs are drawn to the focal point by acoustic streaming and form a trap through secondary acoustic streaming at the tips of the nanosheets comprising the HNS&#8208;MPs. Furthermore, the wide range of materials and modification options for HNS, combined with their high surface area and biocompatibility, enable them to serve as acoustically manipulatable multimodal imaging contrast agents and microrobots. They can perform intravascular multi&#8208;trap maneuvering with real&#8208;time imaging, purification of wastewater flow, and highly&#8208;loaded drug delivery. Given the diverse HNS materials developed to date, this study extends their applications to acoustofluidic and biomedical fields.

         <title>Engineering Radiocatalytic Nanoliposomes with Hydrophobic Gold Nanoclusters for Radiotherapy Enhancement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoliposomes containing hydrophobic gold nanoclusters are engineered, characterized, and evaluated for their radiocatalytic properties for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. These nanoliposomes exhibit promising radiotherapy&#8208;enhancing properties, potential for radiotherapy&#8208;controlled drug delivery, and improved chemoradiotherapy outcomes on 3D pancreatic microtumors. The nanoliposomes exhibit excellent tumor accumulation and also identify further innovations to pave the way toward more effective chemoradiotherapy strategies.








Abstract
Chemoradiation therapy is on the forefront of pancreatic cancer care, and there is a continued effort to improve its safety and efficacy. Liposomes are widely used to improve chemotherapy safety, and may accurately deliver high&#8208;Z element&#8208; radiocatalytic nanomaterials to cancer tissues. In this study, the interaction between X&#8208;rays and long&#8208;circulating nanoliposome formulations loaded with gold nanoclusters is explored in the context of oxaliplatin chemotherapy for desmoplastic pancreatic cancer. Hydrophobic gold nanoclusters stabilized with dodecanethiol (AuDDT) are efficiently incorporated in nanoliposomal bilayers. AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes significantly augmented radiation&#8208;induced &#8226;OH production, which is most effective with monochromatic X&#8208;rays at energies that exceed the K&#8208;shell electron binding energy of Au (81.7&#160;keV). Cargo release assays reveal that AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes can permeabilize lipid bilayers in an X&#8208;ray dose&#8208; and formulation&#8208;dependent manner. The radiocatalytic effect of AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes significantly augments radiotherapy and oxaliplatin&#8208;chemoradiotherapy outcomes in 3D pancreatic microtumors. The PEGylated AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes display high tumor accumulation in an orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer, showing promise for nanoliposomes as carriers for radiocatalytic nanomaterials. Altogether, compelling proof for chemo&#8208;radiation dose&#8208;enhancement using AuDDT&#8208;nanoliposomes is presented. Further improving the nanoliposomal loading of high&#8208;Z elements will advance the safety, efficacy, and translatability of such chemoradiation dose&#8208;enhancement approaches.

         <title>Viscoelastic High&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Hyaluronic Acid Hydrogels Support Rapid Glioblastoma Cell Invasion with Leader&#8211;Follower Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glioblastoma spheroids invade faster in stress&#8208;relaxing, high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (HMW) hyaluronic acid hydrogels than in more elastic&#8208;like, low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight counterparts. The long HMW chains create entanglement&#8208;based crosslinks capable of viscous dissipation that cells rearrange to facilitate invasion. While invading, cells leave a trail of hyaluronidase&#8208;2 (HYAL2) in their wake to prime a path for the advancement of follower cells and thus rapid invasion.








Abstract
Hyaluronic acid (HA), the primary component of brain extracellular matrix, is increasingly used to model neuropathological processes, including glioblastoma (GBM) tumor invasion. While elastic hydrogels based on crosslinked low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (LMW) HA are widely exploited for this purpose and have proven valuable for discovery and screening, brain tissue is both viscoelastic and rich in high&#8208;MW (HMW) HA, and it remains unclear how these differences influence invasion. To address this question, hydrogels comprised of either HMW (1.5 MDa) or LMW (60 kDa) HA are introduced, characterized, and applied in GBM invasion studies. Unlike LMW HA hydrogels, HMW HA hydrogels relax stresses quickly, to a similar extent as brain tissue, and to a greater extent than many conventional HA&#8208;based scaffolds. GBM cells implanted within HMW HA hydrogels invade much more rapidly than in their LMW HA counterparts and exhibit distinct leader&#8211;follower dynamics. Leader cells adopt dendritic morphologies similar to invasive GBM cells observed in vivo. Transcriptomic, pharmacologic, and imaging studies suggest that leader cells exploit hyaluronidase, an enzyme strongly enriched in human GBMs, to prime a path for followers. This study offers new insight into how HA viscoelastic properties drive invasion and argues for the use of highly stress&#8208;relaxing materials to model GBM.

         <title>Using a Supramolecular Monomer Formulation Approach to Engineer Modular, Dynamic Microgels, and Composite Macrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microgels with engineerable properties are created using supramolecular monomers. The inherent modularity offers versatility, allowing inclusion of functionalities, e.g. dyes and cell adhesive additives, providing control over microgel composition. Integrated into robust and dynamic macrogels, microgels act as modular micro&#8208;building blocks, introducing multi&#8208;compartmentalization and reinforcing mechanical properties. This modular control spans across the nano, micro, and macro length scale.








Abstract
Microgels show advantages over bulk hydrogels due to convenient control over microgel size and composition, and the ability to use microgels to modularly construct larger hierarchical scaffold hydrogel materials. Here, supramolecular chemistry is used to formulate supramolecular polymer, dynamic microgels solely held together by non&#8208;covalent interactions. Four&#8208;fold hydrogen bonding ureido&#8208;pyrimidinone (UPy) monomers with different functionalities are applied to precisely tune microgel properties in a modular way, via variations in monomer concentration, bifunctional crosslinker ratio, and the incorporation of supramolecular dyes and peptides. Functionalization with a bioactive supramolecular cell&#8208;adhesive peptide induced selectivity of cells toward the bioactive microgels over non&#8208;active, non&#8208;functionalized versions. Importantly, the supramolecular microgels can also be applied as microscale building blocks into supramolecular bulk macrogels with tunable dynamic behavior: a robust and weak macrogel, where the micro&#8208; and macrogels are composed of similar molecular building blocks. In a robust macrogel, microgels act as modular micro&#8208;building blocks, introducing multi&#8208;compartmentalization, while in a weak macrogel, microgels reinforce and enhance mechanical properties. This work demonstrates the potential to modularly engineer higher&#8208;length&#8208;scale structures using small molecule supramolecular monomers, wherein microgels serve as versatile and modular micro&#8208;building units.

The &#8220;stem cell catcher&#8221; system, inspired by gold prospectors in the game &#8220;Gold Miner,&#8221; is a tFNA&#8208;based structure embedded in a hyaluronic acid hydrogel for in vivo recruitment of stem cells in bone injuries. It mimics the process of mining for gold, targeting and capturing cellular gold necessary for craniofacial bone regeneration in challenging microenvironments.








Abstract
Cell&#8208;surface engineering holds great promise in boosting endogenous stem cell attraction for tissue regeneration. However, challenges such as cellular internalization of ligand and the dynamic nature of cell membranes often complicate ligand&#8211;receptor interactions. The aim of this study is to harness the innovative potential of programmable tetrahedral framework nucleic acid (tFNA) to enable precise, tunable ligand&#8211;receptor interactions, thereby improving stem cell recruitment efficiency. This approach involves experimental screening and theoretical analysis using dissipative particle dynamics. The results demonstrate that altering the flexibility and topology of ligands on tFNA changes their cellular internalization and membrane binding efficiency. Furthermore, optimizing the distribution of the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)&#8208;binding aptamer 19S (Apt19S) on the tFNA enhances the stem cell capture efficiency. Following successful in vitro MSC capture, Apt19S&#8208;modified tFNA is chemically linked to a hyaluronic acid hydrogel, forming an efficient &#8220;stem cell catcher&#8221; system. Subsequent in vivo experiments demonstrate that this system effectively promotes early stem cell recruitment and accelerates bone regeneration in different bone healing scenarios, including cranial and maxillary defects.

         <title>Engineering Higher&#8208;Order Topological Confinement via Acoustic Non&#8208;Hermitian Textures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors develop a non&#8208;Hermitian second&#8208;order topological insulator by incorporating electro&#8208;thermoacoustic gain and loss in a cavity&#8208;based sonic lattice. Controlled via electrically biased carbon nanotube films, they engineer unconventional interface and corner&#8208;confining topologies through precise manipulation of gain and loss textures. This work may open new avenues for studying non&#8208;Hermitian topological physics in classical wave systems and designing versatile functional devices.









Abstract
Higher&#8208;order topological insulators are a newly unveiled category of topological materials, distinguished by their exceptional characteristics absent in conventional topological insulators, e.g., 1D hinge states, or zero&#8208;dimensional corner states, for instance. Adding attenuating or amplifying components manifest even richer and more intricate non&#8208;Hermitian topological properties. While losses, for the most part, come for free, decorating topological systems with the gain counterpart poses significant challenges. Here, a non&#8208;Hermitian second&#8208;order topological insulator (SOTI) is constructed for a sonic demonstration, by bestowing a cavity&#8208;based lattice both with electro&#8208;thermoacoustic gain and loss. The inner cavity walls are decorated with electrically biased carbon nanotube films to be able to manipulate spatially and in strength, a non&#8208;Hermitian response at will. These measurements demonstrate that this flexibility allows us to design highly unconventional interface and corner confining topologies by decisively engineering gain and loss textures within the unit cell. It is foreseen that the advances may enable new avenues for energy harvesting and fundamental understanding in condensed matter and classical topological&#160;physics.

         <title>Programmable Robotic Shape Shifting and Color Morphing Dynamics Through Magneto&#8208;Mechano&#8208;Chromic Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a design strategy for smart soft robots, which borrows the idea of how chameleons transform their body color during locomotion in the wild. The proposed soft magneto&#8208;mechano&#8208;chromic (SoMMeC) robots redefine robotic functionality through fast, dynamic, and durable appearance modulation, making robotic systems more versatile, adaptive, and suitable for unexplored integrative functions.








Abstract
Recreating natural organisms&#8217; dynamic shape&#8208;morphing and adaptive color&#8208;changing capabilities in a compact structure poses significant challenges but unlocks unprecedented hybridized robotic&#8208;visual applications. Overcoming programmability and predictability obstacles is key to achieving real&#8208;time, responsive changes in appearance and functionality, enhancing robot&#8208;environment&#8208;user interactions in ways previously unattainable. Herein, a Soft Magneto&#8208;Mechano&#8208;Chromic (SoMMeC) structure comprising a magnetic actuating and a synthetic photonic film, mirroring the intricate color&#8208;tuning mechanism of chameleons is devised. A model combining numerical simulation and a strain&#8208;dependent color evolution map enables precise predictions and controllable shape&#8208;color alterations across various geometrical and magnetization profiles. The SoMMeC exhibits rapid (0.1s), broad (full&#8208;visible spectrum), tether&#8208;free (remote magnetic manipulation), and programmable (model&#8208;guided control) color transformations, surpassing traditional limitations with its real&#8208;time response, broad and omnidirectional coloration for enhanced visibility, and robustness against external disturbances. The SoMMeC translates into dynamic advertising iridescence, adaptive camouflage, self&#8208;sensing, and multi&#8208;level encryption, and transcends traditional robotics by seamlessly blending dynamic movement with nuanced visual changes. It opens up a spectrum of applications that redefine robotic functionality through dynamic appearance modulation, making robotic systems more versatile, adaptive, and suitable for unexplored integrative functions.

         <title>Synthesis of SrZnOSe Crystals with Low Phonon Energy for Enhancing Near&#8208;Infrared Mechanoluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of lanthanide&#8208;doped SrZnOSe crystals has been developed for the self&#8208;sustained generation of near&#8208;infrared light under mechanical excitation. Due to the low phonon energy of the selenide hosts, the SrZnOSe crystals can generate bright near&#8208;infrared emission by external forces for transmitting encrypted optical signals through tissues (up to 8&#160;mm thick).








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light is promising for bioimaging and information technology due to its high penetration ability and resistance to interference with environmental radiation. Here, a new class of lanthanide&#8208;doped SrZnOSe crystals are developed for the self&#8208;sustainable generation of NIR emissions under mechanical excitation. It is shown that the SrZnOSe crystals render &#8776;5&#8208;fold stronger NIR emissions than the well&#8208;established CaZnOS due to the low phonon energies of the selenide host, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. The potential utility of the crystals is demonstrated by integration with a mouthguard, which can generate bright NIR emissions by bite force to transmit encrypted optical signals through thick tissues (up to 8&#160;mm) in ambient environments. The findings provide a powerful addition to the toolbox of self&#8208;recovery mechanoluminescent materials and open new possibilities for applied research.

         <title>Programmable Artificial Skins Accomplish Antiscar Healing with Multiple Appendage Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel regeneration&#8208;directing artificial skin (RDAS) system is introduced, which is constructed from DNA supramolecular hydrogels. This multi&#8208;layered RDAS effectively mimics natural skin matrices with high fidelity, thereby creating a supportive environment conducive to wound healing. It also precisely modulates the regenerative activities of repair cells throughout the healing process. Ultimately, the RDAS facilitates rapid&#160;scarless healing and promotes the in situ regeneration of multiple functional skin appendages in damaged skin.








Abstract
Functional appendage regeneration is essential for skin rehabilitation, but it has always failed by current existing healing approaches, owing to their inefficacy in preventing disfiguring scars. In this study, a novel regeneration&#8208;directing artificial skin (RDAS) system is presented, which is based on the rational design of multi&#8208;layered hydrogels that closely mimic natural skin matrices. By leveraging the programmability and architectural rigidity of DNA components, without the need for exogenous cell transplantation, such RDAS effectively minimizes tissue fibrosis by accurately guiding the regenerative process in wound fibroblasts, enabling rapid scarless wound repair, restoration of dermal function, and successful in situ regeneration of multiple appendages, such as hair follicles (HFs), sebaceous glands (SGs), and sweat glands (SwGs). Therefore, the RDAS offers a cell&#8208;free antiscarring therapeutic strategy for regenerative wound healing, resulting in improved outcomes. This innovative approach holds great potential for future clinical applications and burn rehabilitation.

This study explores composition&#8208;structure&#8208;performance relationships in high&#8208;entropy La0.8Sr0.2MnxCoyFezO3&#177;&#120749; perovskite oxides for oxygen electrodes in Solid Oxide Cells. Using six high&#8208;throughput experimental techniques and machine learning, Fe&#8208;rich oxides are identified as optimal. The model yields an unambiguous statistical correlation between the distortion of the oxygen sublattice and the highest electrochemical performances and oxygen kinetics.








Abstract
Perovskite oxides form a large family of materials with applications across various fields, owing to their structural and chemical flexibility. Efficient exploration of this extensive compositional space is now achievable through automated high&#8208;throughput experimentation combined with machine learning. In this study, we investigate the composition&#8211;structure&#8211;performance relationships of high&#8208;entropy La0.8Sr0.2MnxCoyFezO3&#177;&#120749; perovskite oxides (0 &lt; x, y, z &lt;1; x+y+z&#8776;1) for application as oxygen electrodes in Solid Oxide Cells. Following the deposition of a continuous compositional map using thin&#8208;film combinatorial pulsed laser deposition, compositional, structural, and performance properties are characterized using six different techniques with mapping capabilities. Random forests effectively model electrochemical performance, consistently identifying Fe&#8208;rich oxides as optimal compounds with the lowest area&#8208;specific resistance values for oxygen electrodes at 700 &#176;C. Additionally, the models identify a statistical correlation between oxygen sublattice distortion&#8212;derived from spectral analysis of Raman&#8208;active modes&#8212;and enhanced performance.

         <title>Voxel Interface Control in Multimaterial Extrusion 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfaces are vital in natural and synthetic systems, enhancing performance and functionality, but are difficult to control in manufacturing. Voxel&#8208;Interface 3D Printing (VI3DP) is introduced, enabling precise control of voxel&#8208;to&#8208;voxel interfaces in extrusion 3D&#8208;printed objects. With interface thicknesses significantly smaller than voxel size, VI3DP unlocks applications in data encoding, mechanisms, bio&#8208;inspired composites, and capacitive touch sensors, among others.








Abstract
Interfaces are crucial in natural and engineered systems, dictating essential biological, ecological, and technological properties that augment performance, functionality, and user experience. Yet, achieving precise interfacial control poses significant challenges in both conventional and additive manufacturing, where scalability constraints impede the controlled deposition of quasi&#8208;2D layers within 3D objects. This paper introduces Voxel&#8208;Interface 3D Printing (VI3DP), which enables comprehensive control over extruded voxel interfaces irrespective of the printhead diameter that conventionally dictates feature size. Various optical, mechanical, and electrical functionalizations, attaining interface thicknesses up to three orders of magnitude smaller than the voxel size are reported. Notable applications include encoding data in soft matter through fluorescent interfaces, creating tight fits and movable mechanisms through non&#8208;adhesive interfaces, fabricating bio&#8208;inspired composites with tailored failure modes, and developing a single filament capacitive touch sensor. VI3DP opens new avenues for enhanced functionality and efficiency across multiple fields, including biomedical technology, electronics, optics, and&#160;nanotechnology.

         <title>Intrinsic Out&#8208;Of&#8208;Plane and In&#8208;Plane Ferroelectricity in 2D AgCrS2 with High Curie Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D AgCrS2 with superior ferroelectricity and high Curie temperature are synthesized in large&#8208;scale via chemical vapor deposition growth. The AgCrS2 nanosheet possesses a non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure which endows it with prominent out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane ferroelectric properties, and thus realizing the ferroelectric memory application in AgCrS2 devices. This work opens new prospects for exploring 2D ferroelectrics and accompanying various ferroelectric functional devices.








Abstract
2D ferroelectric materials have attracted extensive research interest due to potential applications in nonvolatile memory, nanoelectronics and optoelectronics. However, the available 2D ferroelectric materials are scarce and most of them are limited by the uncontrollable preparation. Herein, a novel 2D ferroelectric material AgCrS2 is reported that are controllably synthesized in large&#8208;scale via salt&#8208;assist chemical vapor deposition growth. By tuning the growth temperature from 800 to 900&#160;&#176;C, the thickness of AgCrS2 nanosheets can be precisely modulated from 2.1 to 40&#160;nm. Structural and nonlinear optical characterizations demonstrate that AgCrS2 nanosheet crystallizes in a non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure with high crystallinity and remarkable air stability. As a result, AgCrS2 of various thicknesses display robust ferroelectric polarization in both in&#8208;plane (IP) and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OOP)&#160;directions with strong intercorrelation and high ferroelectric phase transition temperature (682 K). Theoretical calculations suggest that the ferroelectricity in AgCrS2 originates from the displacement of Ag atoms in AgS4 tetrahedrons, which changes the dipole moment alignment. Moreover, ferroelectric switching is demonstrated in both lateral and vertical AgCrS2 devices, which exhibit exotic nonvolatile memory behavior with distinct high and low resistance states. This study expands the scope of 2D ferroelectric materials and facilitates the ferroelectric&#8208;based nonvolatile memory applications.

         <title>Modulating Fibrotic Mechanical Microenvironment for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is exacerbated by injurious mechanical forces that destabilize the pulmonary mechanical microenvironment homeostasis. The ZDFPR NPs effectively regulate this disordered mechanical microenvironment by remodeling alveolar epithelia to alleviate mechanical tension in AEC IIs, and disrupting malignant interactions between myofibroblast contractility and ECM stiffness during mechanotransduction, thereby improving the therapeutic effects for IPF.








Abstract
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is exacerbated by injurious mechanical forces that destabilize the pulmonary mechanical microenvironment homeostasis, leading to alveolar dysfunction and exacerbating disease severity. However, given the inherent mechanosensitivity of fibrotic lungs, where type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC IIs) are subjected to persistent stretching and overactivated myofibroblasts experience malignant interactions during mechanotransduction, it becomes imperative to develop effective strategies to modulate the pulmonary mechanical microenvironment. Herein, cyclo (RGDfC) peptide&#8208;decorated zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 nanoparticles (named ZDFPR NPs) are constructed to target and repair the aberrant mechanical force levels in pathological lungs. Specifically, reduces mechanical tension in AEC IIs by pH&#8208;responsive ZDFPR NPs that release zinc ions and 7, 8&#8208;dihydroxyflavone to promote alveolar repair and differentiation. Meanwhile, malignant interactions between myofibroblast contractility and extracellular matrix stiffness during mechanotransduction are disrupted by the fasudil inhibition ROCK signaling pathway. The results show that ZDFPR NPs successfully restored pulmonary mechanical homeostasis and terminated the fibrosis process in bleomycin&#8208;induced fibrotic mice. This study not only presents a promising strategy for modulating pulmonary mechanical microenvironment but also pioneers a novel avenue for IPF treatment.

Abstract
Developing high&#8208;quality wide bandgap (WBG) perovskites with &#8776;1.7&#160;eV bandgap (Eg) is critical to couple with silicon and create efficient silicon/perovskite tandem devices. The sufferings of large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) loss and unstable power output under operation continuously highlight the criticality to fully develop high&#8208;quality WBG perovskite films. In this study, rubidium and thiocyanate as additive regulators in WBG perovskites are incorporated, significantly reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination, ion&#8208;migration, and phase segregation. The optimized 1.66 eV Eg perovskite solar cells achieved state&#8208;of&#8208;art 1.3&#160;V VOC (0.36&#160;V deficit), and delivered a stabilized power conversion efficiency of 24.3%, along with good device stability (20% degradation (T80) after over 994&#160;h of operation under 1 sun at &#8776;65&#176;C). When integrated with a flat front side silicon cell, silicon/perovskite two&#8208;terminal tandem device (30% efficient) is obtained with a 1.97&#160;V VOC, and T90 operational lifetime of more than 600&#160;h at room temperature.

         <title>High Performance and Colorful Polymer Thermoelectrics with Imprinted Porous Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer films featuring highly ordered periodic porous structures not only demonstrate exceptional thermoelectric figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit, reaching up to 0.52, but also exhibit captivating structural colors and remarkable stretchability.








Abstract
The rapid development of the Internet of Things and wearable electronics has generated growing interest in creating high&#8208;performance and visually striking polymer thermoelectric (TE) devices. However, existing polymer TE materials have yet to fully meet these diverse demands. In this study, imprinted porous polymer films are introduced that exhibit both high TE performance and a spectrum of structural colors. The porous architecture not only preserves excellent charge transport properties but also significantly enhances phonon&#8208;like scattering, resulting in a more than 50% reduction in thermal conductivity for the PDPPSe&#8208;12 film. This leads to a 170% increase in the figure of merit (ZT), achieving a peak value of 0.52 at 363&#160;K. Furthermore, the highly ordered porous structure imparts the PDPPSe&#8208;12 films with both a wide range of structural colors and remarkable stretchability, making them ideal for wearable TE generators. This approach is widely applicable to various polymeric systems, offering a novel strategy for advancing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art plastic TE materials through microstructural engineering.

         <title>Ultrafast Charge and Exciton Diffusion in Monolayer Films of 9&#8208;Armchair Graphene Nanoribbons</title>

         <dc:description>Schematic representation of 9&#8208;armchair graphene nanoribbons subjected to a pump pulse, which generates charge carriers. The spatial and temporal dynamics of these carriers are investigated using a probe pulse with variable time delay &#916;t and a controllable spatial offset.








Abstract
Determining the electronic transport properties of graphene nanoribbons is crucial for assessing their suitability for applications. So far, this has been highly challenging both through experimental and theoretical approaches. This is particularly the case for graphene nanoribbons that are prepared by chemical vapor deposition, which is a scalable and industry&#8208;compatible bottom&#8208;up growth method that results in closely packed arrays of ribbons with relatively short lengths of a few tens of nanometers. In this study, the experimental technique of spatiotemporal microscopy is applied to study monolayer films of 9&#8208;armchair graphene nanoribbons prepared using this growth method, and combined with linear&#8208;scaling quantum transport calculations of arrays of thousands of nanoribbons. Both approaches directly resolve electronic spreading in space and time through diffusion and give an initial diffusivity approaching 200 cm2 s&#8722;1 during the first picosecond after photoexcitation. This corresponds to a mobility up to 550 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The quasi&#8208;free carriers then form excitons, which spread with a diffusivity of tens of cm2 s&#8722;1. The results indicate that this relatively large charge carrier mobility is the result of electronic transport not being hindered by defects nor inter&#8208;ribbon hopping. This confirms their suitability for applications that require efficient electronic&#160;transport.

         <title>4.6&#160;V Moisture&#8208;Tolerant Electrolytes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique salt lithium cyano(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiCTFSI) provides an opportunity to develop advanced electrolytes with distinctive physical and chemical properties, outperforming the conventional LiPF6 and lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) salts under various operating conditions, paving the way for extreme batteries and offering a promising direction for future high&#8208;energy, cost&#8208;effective lithium&#8208;ion batteries.









Abstract
Commercial LiPF6&#8208;based electrolytes face limitations in oxidation stability (4.2 V) and water tolerance (10 ppm). While replacing LiPF6 with lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) improves water tolerance, it induces Al current collector corrosion above 3.7 V vs. Li/Li+. To address this, lithium cyano(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiCTFSI) is proposed here as a non&#8208;corrosive, moisture&#8208;tolerant alternative. The 2.0 M LiCTFSI/propylene carbonate (PC)&#8208;fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) (7:3 by volume) electrolyte enables LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathodes to reach 210 mAh g&#8722;1 (2.8&#8208;4.6 V) with a cycle life of 500. Full cells with NCM811||graphite (2.0 mAh cm&#8722;2) show 77.8% capacity retention after 500 cycles. Even with 2000 ppm moisture in the electrolyte, full cells maintain high cycling stability, reducing the need for costly dry rooms. The electrolyte&#8217;s low freezing point and high thermal stability enable the operation from &#8208;20 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C, delivering 168 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8208;20 &#176;C and retaining 94% capacity after 100 cycles at 60 &#176;C. In contrast, cells with commercial LiPF6 electrolyte deliver 71 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8208;20&#176;C and retain 52.7% after 100 cycles at 60 &#176;C. This novel salt offers a cost&#8208;effective solution for developing robust, high&#8208;performance batteries suitable for extreme conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrahigh Elastic Energy Storage in Nanocrystalline Alloys with Martensite Nanodomains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;level nanostructure featuring martensite nanodomains embedded in a ferroelastic nanocrystalline matrix is utilized for high&#8208;performance elastic energy storage. The synergy of grain boundary strengthening and nucleation&#8208;free reversible transformation enables these alloys to achieve an ultrahigh elastic energy density (&gt;40 MJ m&#8722;3) with ultrahigh efficiency (&gt;93%). Moreover, these properties are maintained at the microscale, demonstrating exceptional durability with over two million cycles.








Abstract
Elastic materials that store and release elastic energy play pivotal roles in both macro and micro mechanical systems. Uniting high elastic energy density and efficiency is crucial for emerging technologies such as artificial muscles, hopping robots, and unmanned aerial vehicle catapults, yet it remains a significant challenge. Here, a nanocrystalline structure embedded with elliptical martensite nanodomains in ferroelastic alloys was&#160;utilized to enable high yield strength, large recoverable strain, and low energy dissipation simultaneously. As a result, the designed Ti&#8211;Ni&#8211;V alloys demonstrate ultrahigh energy density (&gt;40 MJ m&#8722;3) with ultrahigh efficiency (&gt;93%) and exceptional durability. This concept, which combines nano&#8208;sized embryos to minimize energy dissipation of psuedo&#8208;elasticity and employs a fine&#8208;grained structure to enhance yield strength, can be applied to other ferroelastic materials. Furthermore, it holds promise for the development of phase transformation&#8208;involved functionalities such as high&#8208;performance dielectric energy storage, ultralow&#8208;hysteresis magnetostrain, and high&#8208;efficiency solid&#8208;state caloric&#160;cooling.

&lt;p&gt;A dual-level nanostructure featuring martensite nanodomains embedded in a ferroelastic nanocrystalline matrix is utilized for high-performance elastic energy storage. The synergy of grain boundary strengthening and nucleation-free reversible transformation enables these alloys to achieve an ultrahigh elastic energy density (&amp;gt;40 MJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) with ultrahigh efficiency (&amp;gt;93%). Moreover, these properties are maintained at the microscale, demonstrating exceptional durability with over two million cycles.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency, Prevascularization&#8208;Free Macroencapsulation System for Subcutaneous Transplantation of Pancreatic Islets for Enhanced Diabetes Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;efficiency, prevascularization&#8208;free macroencapsulation system for the subcutaneous transplantation of pancreatic islets is developed. This novel system demonstrates excellent long&#8208;term blood glucose control at the subcutaneous site, even with the transplantation of &#8776;250 IEQ of islets. Furthermore, the system enables the local delivery of antifibrotic drugs, indicating its high applicability for islet xenotransplantation.








Abstract
Pancreatic islet macroencapsulation systems for subcutaneous transplantation have garnered significant attention as a therapy for Type I diabetes due to their minimal invasiveness and low complication rates. However, the low vascular density of subcutaneous tissue threatens the long&#8208;term survival of islets. To address this issue, prevascularized systems are introduced but various challenges remain, including system complexity and vascular&#8208;cell immunogenicity. Here, a novel prevasculature&#8208;free macroencapsulation system designed as a multilayer sheet, which ensures sufficient mass transport even in regions with sparse vasculature, is presented. Islets are localized in top/bottom micro&#8208;shell layers (&#8776;300&#160;&#181;m thick) to maximize proximity to the surrounding host vasculature. These sheets, fabricated via bioprinting using rat islets and alginate&#8208;based bio&#8208;ink, double islet viability and optimize islet density, improving insulin secretion function by 240%. The subcutaneous transplantation of small islet masses (&#8776;250 islet equivalent) into diabetic nude mice enable rapid (&lt;1 day) recovery of blood glucose, which remain stable for &gt;120 days. Additionally, antifibrotic drug&#8208;loaded multilayer sheets facilitate blood glucose regulation by rat islets at the subcutaneous sites of diabetic immunocompetent mice for &gt;35 days. Thus, this macroencapsulation system can advance the treatment of Type I diabetes and is also effective for islet xenotransplantation in subcutaneous tissue.

         <title>Ru&#8208;Incorporation&#8208;Induced Phase Transition in Co Nanoparticles for Low&#8208;Concentration Nitric Oxide Electroreduction to Ammonia at Low Potential</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic low&#8208;concentration NO conversion can effectively alleviate the artificially destroyed N&#8208;cycle balance. RuCo alloy nanoparticles in the hexagonal close&#8208;packed phase are synthesized and demonstrated as an electrocatalyst for efficient NO electroreduction. It exhibits a record&#8208;high Faraday efficiency of 99.2% and an NH3 yield of 77.76&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 at a low potential. With this RuCo electrocatalyst, a Zn&#8208;NO battery is assembled to simultaneously achieve NO removal, NH3 synthesis, and power output.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitric oxide (NO) to ammonia (NH3) represents a potential solution for improving the disrupted nitrogen cycle balance. Unfortunately, designing efficient electrocatalysts for NO reduction reaction (NORR) remains a notable challenge, especially at low concentrations. Herein, a displacement&#8208;alloying strategy is reported to successfully induce the phase transition of Co nanoparticles supported on carbon nanosheets from face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) to hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) structure through Ru incorporation. The obtained RuCo alloy with hcp phase structure (hcp&#8208;RuCo) exhibits apparent NORR activity with a record&#8208;high Faraday efficiency of 99.2% and an NH3 yield of 77.76&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.1&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode at a NO concentration of 1&#160;vol %, surpassing Co nanoparticles with fcc phase structure and most reported catalysts. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the excellent NORR activity of hcp&#8208;RuCo can be attributed to the optimized electronic structure of Co site and lowered energy barrier of the potential rate&#8208;determining step through phase transition. Furthermore, the assembled Zn&#8208;NO battery using hcp&#8208;RuCo as the cathode achieves a power density of 2.33&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and an NH3 yield of 45.94&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1. This work provides a promising research perspective for low&#8208;concentration NO conversion.

         <title>All&#8208;In&#8208;One Epoxy/MXene Nanocomposites with Bead&#8208;Type Polymeric Imidazole Latent Curing Agent for Enhancing Storage Stability and Flame Retardancy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The all&#8208;in&#8208;one epoxy/MXene nanocomposite system, comprising epoxy resin, polymeric imidazole latent curing agent beads (PILCAB), and surface&#8208;functionalized Ti3C2Tx MXene, exhibits excellent storage stability, improved flame retardancy, and enhanced mechanical strength, due to the homogeneous dispersibility, synergistic charring capability of MXene and bismaleimide (BMI), and the catalytic effect of the MXene flakes.








Abstract
Developing a single&#8208;component epoxy system is challenging but crucial for advanced thermoset applications. Unfortunately, conventional latent curing agents using chemical or physical passivation do not provide satisfactory storage stability and the necessary property requirements. Here, it is demonstrated that all&#8208;in&#8208;one epoxy/MXene nanocomposite system, comprising epoxy resin, polymeric imidazole latent curing agent beads (PILCAB), and Ti3C2Tx MXene, exhibits excellent storage stability, improved flame retardancy, and enhanced mechanical strength. PILCABs, prepared through a Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) crosslinking reaction between furan groups of poly(imidazolyl methacrylate)&#8208;random poly (furfuryl methacrylate) (PIm&#8208;r&#8208;PFu) copolymer and bismaleimide (BMI), exhibit excellent storage stability, as stable as under 60 &#176;C storage due to the imidazole reactivity being suppressed synergistically by both physical and chemical passivation mechanisms. Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes, surface&#8208;functionalized with alkylated 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine, exhibit excellent compatibility with the epoxy matrix. Consequently, the enhanced storage stability, flame retardancy, and mechanical strength of the all&#8208;in&#8208;one epoxy/MXene nanocomposite are attributed to the strong DA bond formation in latent curing agent, efficient charring capability of MXene and BMI, and the catalytic effect of the MXene. This study opens new avenues for designing and developing single&#8208;component epoxy systems that satisfy demanding requirements, including storage stability, mechanical strength, and flame retardancy, which are essential for practical applications.

N&#8208;doped MXene&#8208;encapsulated vanadium oxide hollow spheres (VOx@N&#8208;MXene HSs) that enable reversible Na+ storage through multidirectional pathways and ample vacancies are developed here. Machine learning simulations indicate increased pore density within the amorphous VOx structure and highlight atomic&#8208;scale transformations during cycling. These findings advance the design of amorphous electrodes, contributing to the development of next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.








Abstract
Sodium ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) address the high power and energy requirements in energy storage devices but face significant challenges arising from the slow kinetics and cycling instability of the anode side. Introducing atomic disorder and employing structural engineering in anode materials proves to be effective strategies for achieving rapid charge storage. Here, it is demonstrated that N&#8208;doped MXene encapsulated amorphous vanadium oxide hollow spheres (VOx@N&#8208;MXene HSs) offer multidirectional open pathways and sufficient vacancies, enabling reversible and fast Na+ insertion/extraction. Machine learning potentials, coupled with molecular simulation techniques, confirm the presence of more abundant pores within the amorphous vanadium oxide (VOx) structure. The simulation of the charging/discharging process elucidates the authentic reaction path and structural evolutions of the VOx@N&#8208;MXene HSs, providing sufficient insight into the atomic&#8208;scale mechanisms associated with these structural superiorities. The full SIHCs devices demonstrate a high energy density of 198.3 Wh kg&#8722;1, along with a long&#8208;term cycling lifespan of 8000 cycles. This study offers valuable strategies into the intricate design and exploration of amorphous electrodes, contributing to the advancement of next&#8208;generation electrochemical energy devices.

         <title>A DNAzyme&#8208;Based Nanohybrid for Ultrasound and Enzyme Dual&#8208;Controlled mRNA Regulation and Combined Tumor Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled DNAzyme nanohybrid is developed for ultrasound&#8208;controlled, enzyme&#8208;activatable mRNA regulation and combined tumor treatment. This system enables ultrasound&#8208;enhanced endosomal escape and specific enzyme activation of DNAzyme function, thereby improving efficacy and cell&#8208;type specificity in target gene silencing and combinational tumor therapy.








Abstract
Despite the significant potential of RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes for gene regulation, their application is limited by low therapeutic efficacy and lack of cell&#8208;specific control. Here, a DNAzyme&#8208;based nanohybrid designed for ultrasound (US)&#8208;controlled, enzyme&#8208;activatable mRNA regulation is presented, enabling tumor cell&#8208;selective combination therapy. The nanohybrid is constructed by coordination&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly of an enzymatically&#8208;triggerable therapeutic DNAzyme (En&#8208;Dz) and natural sonosensitizer hemoglobin (Hb). Controlled US exposure induces reactive oxygen species generation from Hb units, which not only facilitates efficient endosomal escape of En&#8208;Dz, but also promotes the translocation of specific enzyme from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby enhancing gene regulation efficacy. Notably, the enzyme&#8208;triggered, spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled activation of En&#8208;Dz's catalytic activity results in enhanced cancer&#8208;cell selectivity in the therapeutic treatment. Furthermore, the combination of enzyme&#8208;activated mRNA regulation and sonodynamic therapy significantly enhances anti&#8208;tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. This work highlights the potential of integrating a sonodynamic strategy to overcome the current limitations of DNAzyme&#8208;based gene regulators, providing a spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled approach for precise tumor treatment.

         <title>Enabling 2D Electron Gas with High Room&#8208;Temperature Electron Mobility Exceeding 100&#160;cm2 Vs&#8722;1 at a Perovskite Oxide Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, using a combination of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art modes in molecular beam epitaxy, the controlled creation of a 2D electron gas at the epitaxial interface between perovskite oxides BaSnO3 and LaInO3 is demonstrated. The enhanced room&#8208;temperature electron mobility values are up to 119 cm2 Vs&#8722;1&#8212;the highest room&#8208;temperature value reported so far for a perovskite oxide 2D electron gas.








Abstract
In perovskite oxide heterostructures, bulk functional properties coexist with emergent physical phenomena at epitaxial interfaces. Notably, charge transfer at the interface between two insulating oxide layers can lead to the formation of a 2D electron gas (2DEG) with possible applications in, e.g., high&#8208;electron&#8208;mobility transistors and ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors. So far, the realization of oxide 2DEGs is, however, largely limited to the interface between the single&#8208;crystal substrate and epitaxial film, preventing their deliberate placement inside a larger device architecture. Additionally, the substrate&#8208;limited quality of perovskite oxide interfaces hampers room&#8208;temperature (RT) 2DEG performance due to notoriously low electron mobility. In this work, the controlled creation of an interfacial 2DEG at the epitaxial interface between perovskite oxides BaSnO3 and LaInO3 is demonstrated with enhanced RT electron mobility values up to 119 cm2 Vs&#8722;1&#8212;the highest RT value reported so far for a perovskite oxide 2DEG. Using a combination of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art deposition modes during oxide molecular beam epitaxy, this approach opens up another degree of freedom in optimization and in situ control of the interface between two epitaxial oxide layers away from the substrate interface. Thus this approach is expected to apply to the general class of perovskite oxide 2DEG systems and to enable their improved compatibility with novel device concepts and integration across materials&#160;platforms.

         <title>Lateral Phase Heterojunction for Perovskite Microoptoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perovskite lateral phase heterojunction (LPH) polycrystalline film is first demonstrated by a developed contact&#8208;diffusion lithography (CDL) for the fabrication of microscale perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (micro&#8208;PeLEDs). Based on the &#945;/&#948;&#8208;formamidiniumPbI3 (FAPbI3) LPH film with high&#8208;resolution patterns and superior radiative performance, a record&#8208;efficiency near&#8208;infrared micro&#8208;PeLED device is achieved to validate the versatile applications of LPHs in perovskite microoptoelectronics and photonics.









Abstract
Perovskite heterojunction engineering is the prerequisite but still a deficiency in the fabrication of micro&#8208;optoelectronic devices, where the present top&#8208;down or bottom&#8208;up techniques mainly focus on preparing the vertical heterojunction stacks. Perovskite lateral heterojunction structures generally rely on epitaxial growth, which cannot meet the demands of mass production of micro&#8208;devices. Here, a contact diffusion lithography technique is proposed to demonstrate a perovskite lateral phase heterojunction (LPH) polycrystalline film by ion&#8208;driven local phase transition. Under the guidance of thermodynamic simulations, methylamine contact and migration collectively promote in situ formation of &#945;&#8208;phase formamidine&#8208;based perovskite patterns surrounded by &#948;&#8208;phase polymorphs. Spontaneous type&#8208;I heterojunction alignment between &#945;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;phases establishes energy funnels in the LPH film to facilitate carrier utilization and radiative recombination. The wide&#8208;bandgap &#948;&#8208;phase also serves as the coplanar isolator to achieve local anti&#8208;leakage for device integration. Based on the bright and stable LPH pattern layer, the near&#8208;infrared microscale perovskite light&#8208;emitting diode (micro&#8208;PeLED) with impressive device performance is achieved by following conventional device fabrication protocol. The proposed LPH enriches the perovskite heterojunction family, creates a new optoelectronic processing platform, and advances its versatile applications in micro&#8208;optoelectronics and photonics.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Proton Channels Constructed via Hierarchical Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors present proton nanochannels prepared by hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of cyclic peptides with transfer rates closely matching those of natural protein channels while maintaining transport over microns. Proton density is controlled by a counter ion doping effect. The span of proton transport allows for their use in energy solutions, biomedicine, and bioelectronics.









Abstract
The quest to understand and mimic proton translocation mechanisms in natural channels has driven the development of peptide&#8208;based artificial channels facilitating efficient proton transport across nanometric membranes. It is demonstrated here that hierarchical peptide self&#8208;assembly can form micrometers&#8208;long proton nanochannels. The fourfold symmetrical peptide design leverages intermolecular aromatic interactions to align self&#8208;assembled cyclic peptide nanotubes, creating hydrophilic nanochannels between them. Titratable amino acid sidechains are positioned adjacent to each other within the channels, enabling the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded chains upon hydration, and facilitating efficient proton transport. Moreover, these chains are enriched with protons and water molecules by interacting with immobile counter ions introduced into the channels, increasing proton flow density and rate. This system maintains proton transfer rates closely resembling those in natural protein channels over micrometer distances. The functional behavior of these inherently recyclable and biocompatible systems opens the door for their exploitation in diverse applications in energy storage and conversion, biomedicine, and bioelectronics.

&lt;p&gt;The authors present proton nanochannels prepared by hierarchical self-assembly of cyclic peptides with transfer rates closely matching those of natural protein channels while maintaining transport over microns. Proton density is controlled by a counter ion doping effect. The span of proton transport allows for their use in energy solutions, biomedicine, and bioelectronics.

         <title>Impact of Dilute DIO Additive on Local Microstructure of Fluorinated, pNDI&#8208;Based Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of PBDBT: N2200&#8208;based all&#8208;polymer solar cells can be enhanced by processing with dilute diiodooctane solvent additive. This study reveals the microstructural mechanisms that drive charge transport enhancements in these solar cells by combining X&#8208;ray techniques with electron microscopy. Ultimately, the study finds that processing with dilute diiodooctane promotes efficient vertical charge transport pathways while preserving donor&#8211;acceptor interfacial connectivity.








Abstract
The performance of all&#8208;polymer solar cells is often enhanced by incorporating solvent additives during solution processing. In particular, blends based on the model all&#8208;polymer system PBDBT:N2200 have been shown to have increased short&#8208;circuit current and fill factor when processed with dilute diiodooctane (DIO). However, the morphological mechanism that drives the increase in performance is often not well understood due to limitations in common characterization techniques. In this study, it is shown that a combination of X&#8208;ray techniques with cryogenic high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis can provide a quantitative and spatially resolved picture of polymer chain orientation and alignment in all&#8208;polymer blends. It is found that DIO induces vertical phase separation in PBDBT&#8208;2F:F&#8208;N2200 and increases donor crystallite thickness in the pi&#8208;stacking direction leading to an acceptor&#8208;rich film surface. However, it is also shown that DIO does not disrupt the formation of face&#8208;on donor&#8211;acceptor interfaces. These findings suggest that dilute DIO primarily affects crystalline domain formation in single component regions as opposed to mixed regions; thus, dilute DIO can impact vertical charge transport pathways without sacrificing donor&#8211;acceptor interfacial connectivity.

         <title>Inhibiting Mitochondrial Damage for Efficient Treatment of Cerebral Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury Through Sequential Targeting Nanomedicine of Neuronal Mitochondria in Affected Brain Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript synthesized a nanomaterial (MHT) with strong antioxidant properties that can sequentially target the mitochondria of CIRI brain tissue neurons (a&#8211;c). After sublingual intravenous injection, MHT uses its high affinity for damaged vascular matrix proteins and mitochondrial membrane protein Tom20 to sequentially target neuronal mitochondria, effectively reducing neuronal death by efficiently clearing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and eliminating the inflammatory storm(d).








Abstract
Oxidative stress, predominantly from neuronal mitochondrial damage and the resultant cytokine storm, is central to cerebral ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (CIRI). However, delivering drugs to neuronal mitochondria remains challenging due to the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB), which impedes drug entry into affected brain tissues. This study introduces an innovative tannic acid (TA) and melanin&#8208;modified heteropolyacid nanomedicine (MHT), which highly specifically eliminates the neuronal mitochondrial reactive oxygen radicals burst to efficiently reduce neuronal mitochondrial damage through a strategically designed sequential targeting strategy from affected brain tissue to neuronal mitochondria. TA endows MHT with sequential targeting ability by binding to matrix proteins exposed to the damaged BBB and mitochondrial outer membrane proteins of neurons, while melanin significantly enhances the antioxidant capacity of MHT. Consequently, MHT effectively inhibits neuronal apoptosis by protecting mitochondria and reversing the inflammatory immune environment through the deactivation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8211;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway. MHT demonstrated a strong therapeutic effect on CIRI, with an ultralow dose (2 mg&#160;kg&#8722;1) proving effective in reversing the condition. This work not only introduces a new avenue to significantly reduce CIRI through sequential targeting therapy but also offers a new paradigm for treating other ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury diseases.

         <title>In Situ Reversible and Robust Mechano&#8208;Responsive Ultralong Phosphorescence of Polyurethane Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;situ, sensitive, and rapidly reversible mechano&#8208;responsive (MR) phosphorescence from a doped polyurethane (PU) elastomer has been achieved from the reversible MR polymer chain orientation and hydrogen bonding interactions among the system. Based on their MR afterglow, these PU materials have demonstrated various applications without interruption of background, including micro&#8208;crack detection, material damage prediction, limb movement monitoring, and information encryption.








Abstract
Though mechano&#8208;responsive luminescent materials obtained much attention, most of their responses are non&#8208;reversible, let alone in situ reversible. Here, the study presents a new strategy to push through this limitation for their applications, which relies on the reversible mechano&#8208;responsive (MR) hydrogen bonding interactions and polymer chain orientation among a doped polyurethane (PU) elastomer. The radiative and nonradiative transitions inside these phosphorescent triphenylene&#8208;based aromatic secondary amines (TpNP and TpNPO) doped in the PU matrix can be accordingly modulated by these MR variations, including the PU chains orientation and the interactions between emitters and PU, respectively. Surprisingly, the intensities, quantum yields, and even lifetimes of their ultralong phosphorescence correlate well with the stress of PU, showing triple mechano&#8208;enhancement with a small threshold value of 7.9&#160;MPa. Importantly, these in situ and rapidly reversible MR phosphorescences possess excellent repeatability, which is still displayed even after &gt;500 cycles of loading/unloading. Based on such a robust and highly sensitive MR afterglow, these PU materials have been demonstrated applications with no interruption of background in several fields, including micro&#8208;crack detection, material damage prediction, limb movement monitoring, and information encryption. This work provides new insights for developing innovative ultralong phosphorescence materials with improved luminescence and reversible mechano&#8208;responsive behavior.

         <title>A General Approach for Metal Nanoparticle Encapsulation Within Porous Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust nanocasting approach is demonstrated to synthesize encapsulated nanoparticles in metal oxides. First, colloidal nanoparticles are encapsulated in a porous polymer matrix. Then, metal oxide precursor is infiltrated, and materials are calcined to form a porous metal oxide network. Various combinations of nanoparticles encapsulated in metal oxide materials can be synthesized, and their surface area and porosity can be tuned using this method.








Abstract
Encapsulation of metal nanoparticles within oxide materials has been shown as an effective strategy to improve activity, selectivity, and stability in several catalytic applications. Several approaches have been proposed to encapsulate nanoparticles, such as forming core&#8208;shell structures, growing ordered structures (zeolites or metal&#8208;organic frameworks) on nanoparticles, or directly depositing support materials on nanoparticles. Here, a general nanocasting method is demonstrated that can produce diverse encapsulated metal@oxide structures with different compositions (Pt, Pd, Rh) and multiple types of oxides (Al2O3, Al2O3&#8208;CeO2, ZrO2, ZnZrOx, In2O3, Mn2O3, TiO2) while controlling the size and dispersion of nanoparticles and the porous structure of the oxide. Metal@polymer structures are first prepared, and then the oxide precursor is infiltrated into such structures and the resulting material is calcined to form the metal@oxide structures. Most Pt@oxides catalysts show similar catalytic activity, demonstrating the availability of surface Pt sites in the encapsulated structures. However, the Pt@Mn2O3 sample showed much higher CO oxidation activity, while also being stable under aging conditions. This work demonstrated a robust nanocasting method to synthesize metal@oxide structures, which can be utilized in catalysis to finely tune metal&#8208;oxide interfaces.

         <title>Designing Impact Resistance and Robustness into Slippery Lubricant Infused Porous Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slippery lubricant infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) are presented which seek to address the lubricant drainage issue that impairs such surfaces. The strong lubricant retention achieved enables the SLIPS to maintain their slipperiness under high&#8208;speed liquid impact and other dynamic/flow conditions. These findings should widen the practical applications of SLIPS.








Abstract
Slippery lubricant infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) have the potential to address daunting challenges such as undesirable surface fouling/biofouling, icing, etc. However, the depletion of lubricants hampers their practical utility. As a solution, here a rational strategy is introduced that operates synergistically in three parts. First, ultra&#8208;high capillary pressure is exploited from the reticular structure of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with sub&#8208;nanometer pores. Second, the need for geometric compatibility is demonstrated; the lubricant chain diameter must be smaller than the MOF pore to enable lubricant chain intercalation. Lastly, the MOF pore chemistry is tailored to achieve a strong intermolecular interaction for any given MOF/lubricant combination. The strategy is investigated through experiments and quantum/molecular simulations, which show that the approach helps lock the intercalated lubricant chains inside the MOF pores and forms a non&#8208;conventional supramolecular structure. The resulting SLIPS (including those with fluorine&#8208;free chemistry) not only show typical low wetting hysteresis, friction, and ice adhesion but are uniquely resistant to more stringent tests such as continuous dripping and sliding of water droplets (up to 50&#160;hrs), repeated impacts of high&#8208;speed water jets (liquid impact Weber number &gt;&#160;4&#160;&#215;&#160;104) and prevent bacterial biofilm formation even in dynamic flow conditions. The findings may widen the practical applications of SLIPS.

         <title>An Antagonistic Photovoltaic Memristor for Bioinspired Active Contrast Adaptation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired optoelectronic memristor incorporating two antagonistic photovoltaic junctions can autonomously adjust its response to varying light stimuli, enabling the amplification of shadows and inhibition of highlight saturation. The memristor arrays are capable of capturing a high&#8208;contrast scene up to 94 dB with a faster active adaptation speed (less than 1.2 s) than that of biological systems.








Abstract
Machine vision systems that consist of cameras and image&#8208;processing components for visual inspection and identification tasks play a critical role in various intelligent applications, including pilotless vehicles and surveillance systems. However, current systems usually possess a limited dynamic range and fixed photoresponsivity, restricting their capability of gaining high&#8208;fidelity images when encoding a high&#8208;contrast scene. Here, it is shown that a photovoltaic memristor incorporating two antagonistic photovoltaic junctions can autonomously adjust its response to varying light stimuli, enabling the amplification of shadows and inhibition of highlight saturation. Due to the dynamic photodoping effect at the p&#8208;n junction with an asymmetrical profile, the photocurrent polarities of the antagonistic memristor can be changed as the light intensity increases. The light&#8208;intensity&#8208;dependent switchable photovoltaic behaviors match Weber's law where photosensitivity is inversely proportional to the light stimuli. An 11&#160;&#215;&#160;11 memristor array is used to detect a high&#8208;contrast scene with light intensities ranging from 1 to 5&#160;&#215;&#160;104 &#181;W cm&#8722;2, achieving a similar active contrast adaptation performance compared with the human visual systems (less than 1.2 s at 94 dB). This work paves the way for innovative neuromorphic device designs and may lead to the development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art active visual adaptation photosensors.

         <title>Hydronium&#8208;Crosslinked Inorganic Hydrogel Comprised of 1D Lepidocrocite Titanate Nanofilaments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently discovered, 1D lepidocrocite titanate nanofilaments (1DL) represent a highly scalable &#8220;truly 1D&#8221; material, featuring a cross&#8208;section 2&#160;x&#160;2 TiO6 octahedra thick. Given its extreme dimensionality, 1DL can be considered a TiO&#8208;based analog to polymeric strands and possesses unique self&#8208;assembly properties. Ion exchange with hydronium produces a crosslinked network of the first ever 1&#8208;D titanate&#8208;based, robust, biocompatible hydrogel.








Abstract
When a few drops of acid (hydrochloric, acrylic, propionic, acetic, or formic) are added to a colloid comprised of 1D lepidocrocite titanate nanofilaments (1DLs)&#8211;2 &#215; 2 TiO6 octahedra in cross&#8208;section&#8211;a hydrogel forms, in many cases, within seconds. The 1DL synthesis process requires the reaction between titanium diboride with tetramethylammonium (TMA+), hydroxide. Using quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the mass percent of TMA+ after synthesis is determined to be &#8776; 13.1&#160;&#177;&#160;0.1%. The TMA+ is completely removed from the gels after 2 water soak cycles, resulting in the first completely inorganic, TiO2&#8208;based hydrogels. Ion exchanging the TMA+ with hydronium results in gels with relatively strong hydrogen bonds. The hydrogels' compression strengths increased linearly with 1DL colloid concentration. At a 1DL concentration of 45&#160;g&#160;L&#8722;1, the compressive strength, at 80% deformation when acrylic acid is used, is &#8776;325&#160;kPa. The strengths are &#8776; 50% greater after the TMA+ is removed. The removal of all residual organic components in the hydrogels, including TMA+, is confirmed by qNMR, Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and TGA/DSC. The 1DL phase is retained after gelation, TMA+ removal, and 80% compression.

         <title>A Frustrated Antipolar Phase Analogous to Classical Spin Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
EuAl12O19 crystals realize an electric analogue to one of the famous models of frustrated magnetism: the Ising triangular lattice antiferromagnet. Electric dipoles on a triangular lattice preferentially align antiparallel to their neighbors yet fail to form any long&#8208;range order, even at the lowest temperatures. The resulting frustrated antipolar phase is analogous to classical spin liquids.








Abstract
The study of magnetic frustration in classical spin systems is motivated by the prediction and discovery of classical spin liquid states. These uncommon magnetic phases are characterized by a massive degeneracy of their ground state implying a finite magnetic entropy at zero temperature. While the classical spin liquid state is originally predicted in the Ising triangular lattice antiferromagnet in 1950, this state has never been experimentally observed in any triangular magnets. The discovery of an electric analogue of classical spin liquids on a triangular lattice of uniaxial electric dipoles in EuAl12O19 is reported here. This new type of frustrated antipolar phase is characterized by a highly&#8208;degenerate state at low temperature implying an absence of long&#8208;range antiferroelectric order, despite short&#8208;range antipolar correlations. Its dynamics are governed by a thermally activated process, slowing down upon cooling toward a complete freezing at zero&#160;temperature.

A suitable solvent system of passivator can maximize the passivation effect, further improving the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This work proposes a ternary solvent system of 4&#8208;MeO&#8208;PEAI, which can inhibit the solvent&#8208;induced additional defects and achieve a sufficient passivated perovskite surface simultaneously. The resulting PSCs achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.05%, and the devices can maintain 95.23% and 95.68% of their initial PCE after 2000&#160;h storage in ambient air and 800&#160;h light&#8208;soaking in N2&#8208;glovebox.








Abstract
Surface passivation is a vital approach to improve the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), in which the passivator solvent is an inevitable but easy&#8208;ignored factor on passivation effects. Herein, a universal ternary solvent system of surface passivators is proposed through comprehensively considering the solubility and selective perovskite dissolution of the solvent to maximize the passivation effect. Tetrahydrothiophene 1&#8208;oxide (THTO) is selected as the passivation promoter by comparing the binding energy with perovskite and the ability to distort the perovskite lattice among various aprotic polar solvent molecules, which can facilitate the passivator's reaction with perovskite and achieve sufficient passivation on perovskite surface. Besides, chlorobenzene (CB) is used as the diluting agent to minimize the amount of isopropanol (IPA), inhibiting the additional solvent&#8208;induced defects. As a result, the planar PSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.05%, (certificated 25.66%). Besides, the unencapsulated devices exhibit enhanced stability, which can maintain 95.23% and 95.68% of their initial PCE after 2000&#160;h of storage in ambient air and 800&#160;h of light&#8208;soaking in N2&#8208;glovebox. Moreover, this ternary solvent system also exhibits a well applicability and reliability in different passivator such as PEAI, BAI, and so on.

         <title>Thresholding Computing with Heterogeneous Integration of Memristive Kernel with Metal&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Semiconductor Capacitor for Temporal Data Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an integrated thresholding kernel with two Pt/HfO2/TiN (PHT) memristors and Ni/HfO2/n&#8208;Si (NHS) metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor capacitor (2M1MOS) for precise thresholding in time&#8208;series data. This kernel system demonstrates an improved detection scheme in ECG analysis and achieved high accuracy in spoken digit classification, utilizing the capacitive thresholding to enhance memristive event detection ability for bio&#8208;indicator applications.








Abstract
Precise event detection within time&#8208;series data is increasingly critical, particularly in noisy environments. Reservoir computing, a robust computing method widely utilized with memristive devices, is efficient in processing temporal signals. However, it typically lacks intrinsic thresholding mechanisms essential for precise event detection. This study introduces a new approach by integrating two Pt/HfO2/TiN (PHT) memristors and one Ni/HfO2/n&#8208;Si (NHS)&#160;metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor capacitor (2M1MOS) to implement a tunable thresholding function. The current&#8208;voltage nonlinearity of memristors combined with the capacitance&#8208;voltage nonlinearity of the capacitor forms the basis of the 2M1MOS kernel system. The proposed kernel hardware effectively records feature&#8208;specified information of the input signal onto the memristors through capacitive thresholding. In electrocardiogram analysis, the memristive response exhibited a more than ten&#8208;fold difference between arrhythmia and normal beats. In isolated spoken digit classification, the kernel achieved an error rate of only 0.7% by tuning thresholds for various time&#8208;specific conditions. The kernel is also applied to biometric authentication by extracting personal features using various threshold times, presenting more complex and multifaceted uses of heartbeats and voice data as bio&#8208;indicators. These demonstrations highlight the potential of thresholding computing in a memristive framework with heterogeneous integration.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Sensitivity Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Landslide Surface Deformation via Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for monitoring surface deformation of landslides via triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) is proposed. By utilizing an ultra&#8208;low&#8208;speed triboelectric displacement sensor (US&#8208;TDS) to build the monitoring and early warning system, achieving highly sensitive real&#8208;time monitoring of surface deformation displacement and speed under ultra&#8208;low&#8208;speed conditions. This work provides a feasible solution for the scientific monitoring of the latent processes of landslides.








Abstract
Monitoring surface deformation is crucial for the early warning of landslides, facilitating timely preventive measures. Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) demonstrates great potential for self&#8208;powered distributed monitoring in remote and power&#8208;scarce landslide areas. However, landslides deform typically at a rate of a few millimeters per day (mm d&#8722;1), making it challenging for TENG to directly monitor the deformation process. Herein, a method for monitoring surface deformation of landslides by constructing an ultra&#8208;low&#8208;speed triboelectric displacement sensor (US&#8208;TDS) is reported. Utilizing a force storage&#8208;release device and an accelerator, the US&#8208;TDS can produce obvious sensing signals at a linear input speed of 4.32&#160;mm d&#8722;1. The coefficient of determination (R2) for the fitting curve of the pulse signals within the speed range of 21.6 to 129.6&#160;mm d&#8722;1 reaches 0.999. Moreover, US&#8208;TDS can detect deformation displacement as small as 0.0382&#160;mm. The stability of US&#8208;TDS displacement measurements is confirmed at a speed of 108&#160;mm d&#8722;1, with relative errors under 1%. Ultimately, a real&#8208;time monitoring and early warning system for landslide surface deformation is constructed and verified through a combination of indoor simulations and outdoor experiments. This work provides a feasible solution for the scientific monitoring and early warning of the landslide development.

         <title>A Versatile Microporous Design toward Toughened yet Softened Self&#8208;Healing Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A closed microporous design is demonstrated to transform soft and weak into soft yet ultra&#8208;tough self&#8208;healing materials. This approach not only achieves unprecedented improvements in crack propagation resistance and centimeter&#8208;scale fractocohesive lengths, but also enhances mechanical softness while preserving self&#8208;healing kinetics, which is crucial for fully exploiting the potential of soft yet tough self&#8208;healing materials in stretchable electronics.








Abstract
Realizing the full potential of self&#8208;healing materials in stretchable electronics necessitates not only low modulus to enable high adaptivity, but also high toughness to resist crack propagation. However, existing toughening strategies for soft self&#8208;healing materials have only modestly improves mechanical dissipation near the crack tip (&#1043;D), and invariably compromise the material's inherent softness and autonomous healing capabilities. Here, a synthetic microporous architecture is demonstrated that unprecedently toughens and softens self&#8208;healing materials without impacting their intrinsic self&#8208;healing kinetics. This microporous structure spreads energy dissipation across the entire material through a bran&#8208;new dissipative mode of adaptable crack movement (&#1043;A), which substantially increases the fracture toughness by 31.6 times, from 3.19 to 100.86 kJ m&#8722;2, and the fractocohesive length by 20.7 times, from 0.59 mm to 12.24 mm. This combination of unprecedented fracture toughness (100.86 kJ m&#8722;2) and centimeter&#8208;scale fractocohesive length (1.23 cm) surpasses all previous records for synthetic soft self&#8208;healing materials and even exceeds those of light alloys. Coupled with significantly enhanced softness (0.43 MPa) and nearly perfect autonomous self&#8208;healing efficiency (&#8776;100%), this robust material is ideal for constructing durable kirigami electronics for wearable devices.

         <title>Single Atom Engineered Antibiotics Overcome Bacterial Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single atoms of manganese, tightly bonded to nitrogen&#8208;doped carboxylated graphene, exhibit potent antibacterial properties and bypass bacterial resistance development, even after thirty bacterial generations. Antibacterial activity is observed against both Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, as well as in in&#8208;vivo models, while the material is nontoxic to human cells.








Abstract
The outbreak of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria, or &#8220;superbugs&#8221;, poses a global public health hazard due to their resilience against the most effective last&#8208;line antibiotics. Identifying potent antibacterial agents capable of evading bacterial resistance mechanisms represents the ultimate defense strategy. This study shows that &#8211;the otherwise essential micronutrient&#8211; manganese turns into a broad&#8208;spectrum potent antibiotic when coordinated with a carboxylated nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene. This antibiotic material (termed NGA&#8208;Mn) not only inhibits the growth of a wide spectrum of multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria but also heals wounds infected by bacteria in vivo and, most importantly, effectively evades bacterial resistance development. NGA&#8208;Mn exhibits up to 25&#8208;fold higher cytocompatibility to human cells than its minimum bacterial inhibitory concentration, demonstrating its potential as a next&#8208;generation antibacterial agent. Experimental findings suggest that NGA&#8208;Mn acts on the outer side of the bacterial cell membrane via a multimolecular collective binding, blocking vital functions in both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. The results underscore the potential of single&#8208;atom engineering toward potent antibiotics, offering simultaneously a long&#8208;sought solution for evading drug resistance development while being cytocompatible to human cells.

         <title>Kirigami&#8208;Inspired Three&#8208;Dimensional Metamaterials with Programmable Isotropic and Orthotropic Thermal Expansion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of 3D metamaterials capable of programmable negative/zero/positive thermal expansion (NTE/ZTE/PTE) is developed based on the one&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom kirigami polyhedrons. An ultra&#8208;wide range of CTEs from &#8722;2354.3 to 3006.7 ppm/&#176;C is achieved in isotropic metamaterials. Furthermore, orthotropic metamaterials, where each of three directions can be assigned with an independently programmed NTE, ZTE, or PTE, are realized for the first time.








Abstract
Mechanical metamaterials with specifically designed cells can provide unusual thermal expansion properties for diverse applications. Limited by very few available cell topologies and complicated non&#8208;linear structural deformation, most existing thermal expansion metamaterials can only achieve orthogonally isotropic negative/zero/positive thermal expansion (NTE/ZTE/PTE) within a mild range, especially the 3D ones. Here, based on one&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom kirigami polyhedrons proposed with a kinematic design strategy, a family of 3D isotropic and orthotropic metamaterials capable of programmable NTE, PTE, and even ZTE over ultra&#8208;wide range is developed. Incorporating bi&#8208;material strips as creases for isotropic polyhedrons, NTE and PTE metamaterials with coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) ranging from &#8722;2354.3 to 3006.7&#160;ppm/&#176;C are designed and programmed by the theoretical model. Meanwhile, isotropic ZTE metamaterials are constructed by either homogeneous tessellation of ZTE cells or hybrid tessellation of NTE and PTE cells. Furthermore, by allowing distinct geometric parameters in the three orthogonal directions of the kirigami polyhedrons while preserving the kinematic motion, orthotropic metamaterials, in which each of the three directions can be assigned with an independently programmed NTE, ZTE, or PTE, are also achieved. This study paves a novel pathway for the development of thermal expansion metamaterials with potential applications for space optical systems, MEMS, and so on.

         <title>Clinical Validation of Face&#8208;Fit Surface&#8208;Lighting Micro Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Mask for Skin Anti&#8208;Aging Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a flexible, wearable light&#8208;emitting device for skin anti&#8208;aging. The mask, based on a 3D origami structure, achieves conformal contact with the face, maximizing phototherapeutic effects. Notably, improvements in the elasticity of deep skin were 340% greater compared to a conventional LED mask. The blister&#8208;actuated laser&#8208;induced transfer achieves a 99.61% yield for microLEDs at a rate of 50 chips per second, enabling mass production.








Abstract
Photobiomodulation therapy based on micro light&#8208;emitting diodes (&#181;LEDs) holds remarkable potential for the beauty industry. Here, a cosmetically effective face&#8208;fit surface&#8208;lighting &#181;LED mask for skin anti&#8208;aging is introduced. The face&#8208;conformable mask enables deep tissue treatment through proximal light irradiation, with a 3D origami structure capable of adapting to complex facial contours with closed adherence. A blister&#8208;assisted laser transfer achieves rapid and accurate &#181;LEDs transfer at a high throughput of 50 chips per second, facilitating a mass&#8208;producible and large&#8208;area process. Finally, clinical trials demonstrate significant improvements in elasticity, sagging, and wrinkles across six facial areas, with a maximum enhancement of 340% in deep skin elasticity of the perioral area compared to the conventional LED mask group.

         <title>Force&#8208;Induced Ultraviolet C Luminescence of Pr3+&#8208;Doped Sr2P2O7 for X&#8208;Ray Dosimetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon stimulation of force, Sr2P2O7:Pr3+ emits trap&#8208;controlled UVC mechanoluminescence with the peak wavelength at 230&#160;nm. The UVC mechanoluminescence can be used for X&#8208;ray dosimetry.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescent materials have broad application prospects in advanced displays, stress imaging, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting owing to their ability to convert mechanical stimuli into light. However, most previous studies have focused on the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions. Although natural ultraviolet C (UVC) light is nearly absent on the Earth's surface, it plays an important role in many fields. Therefore, the development of smart materials capable of emitting UVC mechanoluminescence (ML) and expanding the application scenarios of UVC ML are significant but challenging. Here the ML property of Sr2P2O7:Pr3+ is examined, which stems from the 5d&#8594;4f transition of Pr3+ and is located over the UVC region. The peak wavelength of the UVC ML of Sr2P2O7:Pr3+ is &#8776;230&#160;nm, which is, to the best of this knowledge, the shortest ML wavelength reported to date. It is further demonstrated that the UVC ML of Sr2P2O7:Pr3+ is associated with trapped charge carriers and can be conveniently regulated by adjusting the X&#8208;ray excitation time. Relying on this unique characteristic, the potential of the UVC ML of Sr2P2O7:Pr3+ as an indicator of the X&#8208;ray radiation dose is demonstrated. This study enriches the family of mechanoluminescent materials and expands the available wavelength of ML to the UVC region.

Neuron&#8208;inspired flexible phase change materials (PCMs) are fabricated via a self&#8208;assembly strategy, demonstrating high photothermal conversion efficiency and excellent thermal cycle stability. Due to the ultrasensitive humidity responsiveness, the flexible materials are directly utilized as sensors for human respiratory monitoring, which shows great potential for moisture electric generators (MEGs).








Abstract
The global energy crisis and climate change pose unprecedented challenges. Wearable devices with personal thermoregulation and energy harvesting hold great promise for achieving energy savings and human thermal comfort. Here, inspired by neurons, a novel phase change material (PCM) is reported for efficient energy harvesting and respiratory monitoring via a self&#8208;assembly strategy. The use of gum arabic (GA) enabled the encapsulation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the targeted distribution of carboxylated multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (cMWCNTs) simultaneously in poly (ethylene vinyl acetate) (EVA) matrix. The material exhibits an outstanding toughness value of 14.88&#160;MJ m&#8722;3 and high elongation at a break of 565.67%, exhibiting remarkable flexibility. The material with sufficient melting enthalpy (71.11 J g&#8722;1) demonstrates high photothermal conversion efficiency (95.27%) under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation (105&#160;mW cm&#8722;2). In addition, due to the synergistic effect of GA and PEG, especially the formation of microdome structures on the surface, the material demonstrates ultrasensitive humidity responsiveness for respiratory monitoring with high precision, excellent repeatability, and fast response/recovery time (50.4/50.5&#160;ms). Notably, it shows great potential for moisture&#8208;electric generators (MEGs) with the function of non&#8208;contact sensing. This material opens the path toward next&#8208;generation wearable devices in energy conversion and health monitoring.

         <title>The Combination of a Donor&#8211;Acceptor TADF and a MR&#8208;TADF Emitting Core Results in Outstanding Electroluminescence Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ToC illustrates the molecular structure of DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT2 along with a brief overview of the performance of the corresponding OLED. The green and blue&#8208;colored moieties represent the MR&#8208;TADF emitting core and the pendant D&#8211;A TADF shield, respectively.








Abstract
Here the utility and potential of an emitter design are demonstrated, consisting of a narrowband&#8208;emitting multiresonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) core that is decorated with a suitably higher energy donor&#8208;acceptor TADF moiety. Not only does this D&#8211;A TADF group offer additional channels for triplet exciton harvesting and confers faster reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) kinetics but it also acts as a steric shield, insulating the emissive MR&#8208;TADF core from aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. Two emitters, DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT1 and DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT2, demonstrate enhanced photophysical properties leading to outstanding performance of the organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT2, containing a D&#8211;A TADF moiety, has a faster kRISC (1.1&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1) and higher photoluminescence quantum yield (&#934;PL: 97%) compared to DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT1 (0.2&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1, &#934;PL: 90%), which contains a D&#8211;A moiety that itself is not TADF. The sensitizer&#8208;free OLEDs with DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT2 achieve a record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 40.2% and showed milder efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE1000 of 20.7%) compared to the DtCzBN&#8208;CNBT1&#8208;based devices (EQEmax of 37.1% and EQE1000 of 11.9%).

         <title>Evolution of Nitrogen&#8208;Coordinated Metal Single Atoms Toward Single&#8208;Atom Alloys on MgH&#8322; as Efficient and Stable Hydrogen Spillover Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transformation of nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal single atoms (M&#8211;N&#8211;C) into single&#8208;atom alloys (SAA) are revealed during the catalysis of hydrogen spillover on MgH&#8322;. High&#8208;valence Ni in the NiN&#8324; sites is reduced, leaves the NiN&#8324; coordination, and diffuses into the surface lattice of Mg, forming a Ni&#8321;&#8210;Mg SAA. This Ni&#8321;&#8210;Mg SAA exhibits superior activity and stability compared to NiN&#8324; and most other known Ni&#8208;based catalysts for hydrogen storage reactions.








Abstract
M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts with nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal single&#8208;atom active sites have demonstrated high activity for hydrogen storage materials, but their stability in this application remains uncertain. This study addresses this issue by using nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) molecules on MgH&#8322; particles as a model system. It is found that the N&#8208;coordinated high&#8208;valence Ni single atoms in the NiN&#8324; active site are unstable in the reducing environment of hydrogen storage, spontaneously evolving into zero&#8208;valence Ni, forming a Ni&#8321;&#8208;Mg single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA). The Ni&#8321;&#8208;Mg SAA exhibits remarkable stability in catalyzing Mg hydrogen storage reactions. Furthermore, it demonstrates comprehensive catalytic activity for each step of hydrogen absorption and desorption from Mg, surpassing the efficiency of the NiN&#8324; active site, especially in the critical steps of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation. Overall, the catalytic performance of Ni&#8321;&#8208;Mg SAA is superior to most known nickel&#8208;based catalysts. This evolutionary process is also observed in FePc, CoPc, and tetraphenylporphyrin nickel (Ni&#8208;TPP), suggesting that this reducing transformation is a universal phenomenon for MN&#8324;&#8208;type active sites in hydrogen storage catalysis.

         <title>Interstitial Oxygen Acts as Electronic Buffer Stabilizing High&#8208;Entropy Alloys for Trifunctional Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cr element with strong oxygen affinity can introduce oxygen atoms into the high&#8208;entropy alloy system. Interstitial oxygen acts as an electronic buffer making the binding energy of other metal elements move to a higher level and increasing vacancy formation energies of metal active sites leading to super stability.








Abstract
Understanding the effect of elements&#8217; oxygen affinity is essential for comprehending high&#8208;entropy alloys&#8217; (HEAs) complete properties. However, the origin of HEAs' oxygen&#8208;containing structure and stability remains poorly understood, primarily due to their diverse components, hindering synthesis and analysis. Herein, the O&#8208;doping HEAs (HEA&#8208;O) have demonstrated outstanding performance and stability in electrolyzed water and Zinc&#8211;air batteries which can be reassembled after being stable for more than 1600&#160;h when the zinc consumption is over. The experiment and DFT simulation demonstrate that Cr with strong oxygen affinity can introduce more oxygen into the system of HEAs. Consequently, interstitial oxygens act as electronic buffers making the binding energy of other metal elements move to a higher level. Additionally, O&#8208;doping lowers the d&#8208;band center promoting electrochemical activity and increasing vacancy formation energies of metal active sites leading to super stability. The study provides significant insights into the design and comprehension of interstitial oxygen&#8208;doped HEAs.

         <title>Single&#8208;Nanometer Spinel with Precise Cation Distribution for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unveils an aggregation&#8208;driven mechanism for synthesizing spinel oxides via hot injection that enables single&#8208;nanometer (1.2 nm) spinel. The resulting single&#8208;nanometer CoMn2O4 exhibits precise cation distribution with maximal octahedral Mn occupancy to form highly active catalytic centers, leading to superior electrocatalytic activity. This advancement offers a novel way for specifically engineering spinel structures and elucidating crucial structure&#8211;property relationships.








Abstract
Designing spinel nanocrystals (NCs) with tailored structural composition and cation distribution is crucial for superior catalytic performance but remarkably challenging due to their intricate nature. Here, an aggregation growth restricted hot&#8208;injection method is presented by meticulously investigating the fundamental nucleation and aggregation&#8208;driven growth kinetics governing spinel NC formation to address this challenge. Through controlled collision probability of nuclei during growth, this approach enables the synthesis of spinel NCs with unprecedented, single nanometer (1.2&#160;nm). Single&#8208;nanometer CoMn2O4 spinel via this method exhibits a highly tailored structure with a maximized population of highly active octahedral Mn atoms, thereby optimizing oxygen intermediate adsorption during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Consequently, it exhibits a remarkable half&#8208;wave potential of 0.88&#160;V in ORR and leads to a superior power density (170.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) in zinc&#8211;air battery, outperforming commercial Pt/C and most reported spinel oxides, revealing a clear structure&#8211;property relationship. This structure design strategy is readily adaptable for the precise synthesis and engineering of various spinel structures, opening new avenues for developing advanced electrocatalysts and energy storage materials.

         <title>Bifunctional Fluorocarbon Electrode Additive Lowers the Salt Dependence of Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional fluorocarbon electrode additive (BFEA) is proposed to construct solid electrolyte interphase independent of aqueous electrolyte. The LiF from reduction of BFEA suppresses hydrogen evolution, increasing coulombic efficiency while the carbon byproduct lowers battery polarization, improving round&#8208;trip efficiency. The unique advantages of BFEA make it highly compatible with aqueous batteries and promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications.








Abstract
The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a crucial role in extending the life of aqueous batteries. The traditional anion&#8208;derived SEI formation in aqueous electrolytes highly depends on high&#8208;concentrated organic fluorinating salts, resulting in low forming efficiency and long&#8208;term consumption. In response, this study proposes a bifunctional fluorocarbon electrode additive (BFEA) that enables electrochemical pre&#8208;reduction instead of TFSI anion to form the LiF&#8208;rich SEI and in situ produce conductive graphite inside the anode before the lithiation. The BFEA lowers the salt dependence of aqueous electrolytes, enabling the inorganic LiCl electrolyte to work first, but also successfully achieves a high SEI formation efficiency in the relatively low 10&#160;m LiTFSI without mass transfer concerns, suppressing the parasitic hydrogen evolution from 11.24 to 4.35&#160;nmol min&#8722;1. Besides, BFEA strengthens the intrinsic superiority of Li storage reaction by lowering battery polarization resulting from the in situ production of graphite, promoting charge transfer of electrode kinetics. Compared with the control group, the demonstrated Ah&#8208;level pouch cell employing BFEA exhibits better cycle stability above 300 cycles with higher capacity retention of 78.2% and the lower decay of the round&#8208;trip efficiency (&#9651;RTE = 2%), benefiting for maintaining the high efficiency and reducing heat accumulation in large&#8208;scale electric energy storage.

         <title>Strong, Spontaneous, and Self&#8208;Healing Poly(Ionic Liquid) Elastomer Underwater Adhesive with Borate Ester Dynamic Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Borate ester dynamically crosslinked poly(ionic liquid) elastomer adhesives (PIEA) are prepared. The dissociation of the borate ester in water leads to a spontaneous increase in the adhesion strength of PIEA from almost no adhesion to 314 kPa after 12 h without any external preloading, providing promising applications for the development of novel underwater smart adhesives.








Abstract
Adhesion in aqueous environments is often hindered by the water layer on the surface of the substrate due to the water sensitivity of the adhesive, greatly limiting the application environment. Here, a borate ester dynamically crosslinked poly(ionic liquid) elastomer adhesive (PIEA) with high strength, toughness, self&#8208;healing abilities, and ionic conductivity is synthesized by copolymerizing hydrophobic ionic liquid monomer ([HPVIm][TFSI]) and 2&#8208;methoxyethyl acrylate (MEA). The adhesion strength of PIEA can increase spontaneously from almost no adhesion to 314 kPa after 12 h without any external preloading due to the dissociation of the borate ester in water, leading to noncovalent interactions between the hydroxyl groups of PIEA and the substrate. Additionally, PIEA can be developed for soft sensors or ion electrodes to enable underwater detection and communication. This strategy offers broad application potential for the development of novel underwater smart adhesives.

         <title>Engineering Strain&#8208;Defects to Enhance Enzymatic Therapy and Induce Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain&#8208;defect engineering is used to design a hollow MMSR&#8208;pS&#8208;PEG nanozyme by modifying MnMoOx with poly (ethylene glycol) grafted phosphorylated serine and loading sorafenib. The oxygen defects induce excellent catalase&#8208;like&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;like catalytic activities, ensuring the disruption of the internal redox balance in tumor cells. Sorafenib restrains the system xc&#8722; and synergistically interacts with GSH depletion to induce ferroptosis.








Abstract
The effect of mimetic enzyme catalysis is often limited by insufficient activity and a single therapy is not sufficient to meet the application requirements. In this study, a multifunctional nanozyme, MMSR&#8208;pS&#8208;PEG, is designed and fabricated by modifying poly (ethylene glycol) grafted phosphorylated serine (pS&#8208;PEG) on mesoporous hollow MnMoOx spheres, followed by loading sorafenib (SRF) into the pores. Strain engineering&#8208;induced oxygen defects endow the nanozyme with enhanced dual&#8208;enzymatic activity to mimic catalase and oxidase&#8208;like activities, which catalyze the conversion of endogenous H2O2 into oxygen and subsequently into superoxide ions in the acidic tumor microenvironment. Moreover, as an n&#8208;type semiconductor, MnMoOx generates reactive oxygen species by separating electrons and holes upon ultrasonic irradiation and simultaneously deplete glutathione by holes, thereby further augmenting its catalytic effect. As a ferroptosis inducer, SRF restrains the system xc&#8722; and indirectly inhibits glutathione synthesis, synergistically interacting with the nanozyme to stimulate ferroptosis by promoting lipid peroxidation and accumulation and the downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4. These results provide valuable insights into the design of enzymatic therapy with high performance and highlight a promising approach for the synergism of ferroptosis and enzymatic tumor therapy.

         <title>Multiple Defect&#8208;Induced High&#8208;Resolution Near&#8208;Infrared Mechanoluminescent Materials for Non&#8208;Destructive Detection of Blood Glucose and Lipids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical co&#8208;substitution method of [Si4++Mg2+] &#8594; [Ga3++Ga3+] is used to achieve continuous defect distribution. Combined with Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the impact of different defect types on electronic structure is discussed in detail, and the potential application of broadband NIR ML in non&#8208;destructive detection technology is explored.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML) materials, known for their ability to convert mechanical energy into light, are increasingly recognized for their potential applications, such as in intelligent stress sensing, in vivo bioimaging, and stress non&#8208;destructive monitoring. However, the low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) and narrow&#8208;band emission of single&#8208;defect&#8208;induced ML materials usually limit their biological&#8208;related practical applications. Here, these limitations will be addressed by modulating the microstructure evolution in Y3Ga3MgSiO12:Cr3+ through the [Si4++Mg2+] &#8594; [Ga3++Ga3+] chemical substitution strategy. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals the defect types and dynamic charge migration processes. In addition, Y3Ga3MgSiO12: Cr3+ with continuously distributed &#8220;shallow&#8208;deep&#8221; defects (0.68&#8211;1.61&#160;eV) can avoid persistent luminescence (PersL) and bright&#8208;field environment interference. Herein, such high SNR near&#8208;infrared broadband ML emission may provide a reliable way for high&#8208;quality biological non&#8208;destructive sensing and detection. Finally, benefiting from the different absorption of ML signals in glucose/lipid, one may find a novel non&#8208;invasive blood glucose/lipid testing technology in patients.

In addition, Y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;MgSiO&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;: Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; with continuously distributed &#8220;shallow-deep&#8221; defects (0.68&#8211;1.61&#160;eV) can avoid persistent luminescence (PersL) and bright-field environment interference. Herein, such high SNR near-infrared broadband ML emission may provide a reliable way for high-quality biological non-destructive sensing and detection. Finally, benefiting from the different absorption of ML signals in glucose/lipid, one may find a novel non-invasive blood glucose/lipid testing technology in patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Responsive Polar Vortices in All&#8208;Ferroelectric Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polar vortex formation is shown in all&#8208;ferroelectric (PbTiO3)n/(PbxSr1&#8722;xTiO3)n heterostructures wherein the in&#8208;plane polarization of PbxSr1&#8722;xTiO3 provides the required boundary conditions. These superlattices show superior piezoelectric and ferroelectric responses as the polarization in all layers can freely rotate to the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction. In the plane, the layers exhibit strong coupling during switching and show multistate switching when heterostructured with ferroelectric&#8208;dielectric blocks.








Abstract
The discovery of polar vortices and skyrmions in ferroelectric&#8208;dielectric superlattices [such as (PbTiO3)n/(SrTiO3)n] has ushered in an era of novel dipolar topologies and corresponding emergent phenomena. The key to creating such emergent features has generally been considered to be related to counterpoising strongly polar and non&#8208;polar materials thus creating the appropriate boundary conditions. This limits the utility these materials can have, however, by rendering (effectively) half of the structure unresponsive to applied stimuli. Here, using advanced thin&#8208;film deposition and an array of characterization and simulation approaches, polar vortices are realized in all&#8208;ferroelectric trilayers, multilayers, and superlattices built from the fundamental building block of (PbTiO3)n/(PbxSr1&#8722;xTiO3)n wherein in&#8208;plane ferroelectric polarization in the PbxSr1&#8722;xTiO3 provides the appropriate boundary conditions. These superlattices exhibit substantially enhanced electromechanical and ferroelectric responses in the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction that arise from the ability of the polarization in both layers to rotate to the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction under field. In the in&#8208;plane direction, the layers are found to be strongly coupled during switching and when heterostructured with ferroelectric&#8208;dielectric building blocks, it is possible to produce multistate switching. This approach expands the realm of systems supporting emergent dipolar texture formation and does so with entirely ferroelectric materials thus greatly improving their responses.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Layered Oxide Cathode Materials with Moderated Interlayer Spacing and Enhanced Kinetics for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy doping strategy is employed to improve structure stability and enhance reaction kinetics of the layered oxide cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The homogeneous stress distribution, moderated interlayer spacing, and suppressed John&#8211;Teller effect of the high&#8208;entropy cathode materials contribute to the improved cycling stability and rate performance.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) with low cost and environmentally friendly features have recently attracted significant attention for renewable energy storage. Sodium layer oxides stand out as a type of promising cathode material for SIBs owing to their high capacity, good rate performance, and high compatibility for manufacturing. However, the poor cycling stability of layer oxide cathodes due to structure distortion greatly impacts their practical applications. Herein, a high entropy doped Cu, Fe, and Mn&#8208;based layered oxide (HE&#8208;CFMO), Na0.95Li0.05Mg0.05Cu0.20Fe0.22Mn0.35Ti0.13O2 for high&#8208;performance SIBs, is designed. The HE&#8208;CFMO cathode possesses high&#8208;entropy transition metal (TM) layers with a homogeneous stress distribution, providing a moderated interlayer spacing to maintain the structure stability and enhance Na+ ion diffusion. In addition, Li doping in TM layers increases the Mn valence state, which effectively suppresses John&#8211;Teller effect, thus stabilizing the layered structure during cycling. Furthermore, the use of nontoxic and low&#8208;cost raw materials benefits future commercialization and reduces the risk of environmental pollution. As a result, the HE&#8208;CFMO cathode exhibits a super cycling performance with a 95% capacity retention after 300 cycles. This work provides a promising strategy to improve the structure stability and reaction kinetics of cathode materials for SIBs.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Cell RNA Sequencing Guided Multienzymatic Hydrogel Design for Self&#8208;Regenerative Repair in Diabetic Mandibular Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing technology, the crucial role of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in suppressing the repolarization of proinflammatory macrophages to anti&#8208;inflammatory macrophages within the diabetic microenvironment is revealed. Consequently, a multienzymatic hydrogel equipped with dual ROS and NO&#8208;scavenging capabilities is meticulously designed, enabling the mandible to regain its self&#8208;regenerative capacity in the diabetic microenvironment.








Abstract
Conventional bone tissue engineering materials struggle to reinstate physiological bone remodeling in a diabetic context, primarily due to the compromised repolarization of proinflammatory macrophages to anti&#8208;inflammatory macrophages. Here, leveraging single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) technology, the pivotal role of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) is unveiled in impeding macrophage repolarization during physiological bone remodeling amidst diabetes. Guided by scRNA&#8208;seq analysis, we engineer a multienzymatic bone tissue engineering hydrogel scaffold (MEBTHS) composed is engineered of methylpropenylated gelatin hydrogel integrated with ruthenium nanozymes, possessing both Ru0 and Ru4+ components. This design facilitates efficient NO elimination via Ru0 while simultaneously exhibiting ROS scavenging properties through Ru4+. Consequently, MEBTHS orchestrates macrophage reprogramming by neutralizing ROS and reversing NO&#8208;mediated mitochondrial metabolism, thereby rejuvenating bone marrow&#8208;derived mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells within diabetic mandibular defects, producing newly formed bone with quality comparable to that of normal bone. The scRNA&#8208;seq guided multienzymatic hydrogel design fosters the restoration of self&#8208;regenerative repair, marking a significant advancement in bone tissue engineering.

         <title>Azatriangulene&#8208;Based Conductive C&#9552;C Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Near&#8208;Infrared Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Knoevenagel condensation of an electron&#8208;rich azatriangulenetricarbaldehyde with arenediacetonitriles produces 2D &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers as crystalline porous Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs). The donor&#8211;acceptor interactions in these polymers lead to a low optical bandgap (1.6&#160;eV) and near&#8208;infrared emission (&gt;750 nm). p&#8208;Doping with magic blue increases the electrical conductivity of the COFs by 8 orders of magnitude, reaching the value of 0.65&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Two near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive &#960;&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) pTANG1 and pTANG2 are synthesized using Knoevenagel condensation of trioxaazatriangulenetricarbaldehyde (TATANG) with benzene&#8208; and biphenyldiacetonitriles, respectively. The morphology of the COFs is affected by the size of TATANG precursor crystals. Donor&#8211;acceptor interactions in these COFs result in small bandgaps (&#8776;1.6&#160;eV) and NIR emission (&#955;max = 789 nm for pTANG1). pTANG1 can absorb up to 9 molecules of water per unit cell, which is accompanied by a marked quenching of the NIR emission, suggesting applications as humidity sensors. p&#8208;Doping with magic blue significantly increases the electrical conductivities of the COFs by up to 8 orders of magnitude, with the room temperature conductivity of pTANG1 reaching 0.65&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, the highest among reported C&#9552;C linked COFs. 1H NMR relaxometry, temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence spectroscopy, and DFT calculations reveal that the higher rigidity of the shorter phenylene linker is responsible for the more extended conjugation (red&#8208;shifted emission, higher electrical conductivity) of pTANG1 compared to pTANG2.

&lt;p&gt;Knoevenagel condensation of an electron-rich azatriangulenetricarbaldehyde with arenediacetonitriles produces 2D &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-conjugated polymers as crystalline porous Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs). The donor&#8211;acceptor interactions in these polymers lead to a low optical bandgap (1.6&#160;eV) and near-infrared emission (&amp;gt;750 nm). &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-Doping with magic blue increases the electrical conductivity of the COFs by 8 orders of magnitude, reaching the value of 0.65&#160;S&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

2D Ferroelectric Memory
In article number 2407655, Hua Xu and coworkers present a novel 2D ferroelectric material AgCrS2 synthesized by chemical vapor deposition growth. The 2D AgCrS2 crystal displays robust ferroelectric polarization in both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane directions with strong intercorrelation and high Curie temperature (682 K). Consequently, the 2D AgCrS2 crystal is successfully utilized to construct ferroelectric memory device, demonstrating significant potential for advancing the development of future artificial intelligence (AI).

Acoustic Manipulation
Flower&#8208;like hierarchical nanostructure microparticles, composed of 2D nanosheets, can be trapped by focused ultrasound and maneuvered against blood flow. Their unique nanostructure enables efficient trapping of microparticles in high&#8208;velocity fluid environments, while the large surface area and biocompatibility make them ideal as acoustically manipulatable agents for medical imaging and microrobotics applications. More details can be found in article number 2404514 by Daniel Razansky, Metin Sitti, and co&#8208;workers.

Endogenous Stem Cell Recruitment
Using the precise programmability of tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNA), Yunfeng Lin, Taoran Tian, and co&#8208;workers introduce a novel strategy for endogenous stem cell enrichment. This strategy employs the MSC&#8208;targeting aptamer Apt19S, optimizing its distribution and topology on tFNA to address challenges like cellular internalization and low affinity, thereby improving MSC binding and capture efficiency. This acellular, regenerative platform holds great potential for various clinical applications in tissue regeneration. More details can be found in article number 2406118.

Multi&#8208;Drug Resistance
Single atoms of manganese, tightly bonded to carboxylated nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene, exhibit potent antibacterial properties against both Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Targeting the biomolecules of the outer bacterial membrane, the new &#8220;single&#8208;atom&#8221; engineered antibiotic effectively bypasses the development of bacterial resistance and heals infected wounds in vivo, while remaining non&#8208;toxic to human cells.

         <title>All&#8208;Aqueous Embedded 3D Printing for Freeform Fabrication of Biomimetic 3D Constructs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores recent progress in freeform fabrication of 3D biomimetic constructs via all&#8208;aqueous embedded 3D printing. The fundamental properties of all&#8208;aqueous system, the key influences on printing stability and shape fidelity of biomimetic constructs as well as biomimetic applications are thoroughly discussed, offering insights and future research directions in this field.








Abstract
All&#8208;aqueous embedded 3D printing, which involves extruding inks in an aqueous bath, has emerged as a transformative platform for the freeform fabrication of 3D constructs with precise control. The use of a supporting bath not only enables the printing of arbitrarily designed 3D constructs but also broadens ink selection for various soft matters, advancing the wide application of this technology. This review focuses on recent progress in the freeform preparation of 3D constructs using all&#8208;aqueous embedded 3D printing. It begins by discussing the significance of ultralow interfacial tension in all&#8208;liquid embedded printing and highlights the fundamental concepts and properties of all&#8208;aqueous system. The review then introduces recent advances in all&#8208;aqueous embedded 3D printing and clarifies the key factors affecting printing stability and shape fidelity, aiming to guide expansion and assessment of emerging printing systems used for various representative applications. Furthermore, it proposes the potential scope and applications of this technology, including in vitro models, cytomimetic microreactors, and soft ionic electronics. Finally, the review discusses the challenges facing current all&#8208;aqueous embedded 3D printing and offers future perspectives on possible improvements and developments.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the integration of omics technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, with nanomedicine for cancer therapy. Leveraging advanced next&#8208;generation sequencing techniques, it explores how these synergistic approaches enhance diagnostic accuracy, optimize therapeutic strategies, and assess nanomedicine&#8208;mediated biological responses, offering insights into future development in personalized cancer therapy.








Abstract
Cancer nanomedicine has emerged as a promising approach to overcome the limitations of conventional cancer therapies, offering enhanced efficacy and safety in cancer management. However, the inherent heterogeneity of tumors presents increasing challenges for the application of cancer nanomedicine in both diagnosis and treatment. This heterogeneity necessitates the integration of advanced and high&#8208;throughput analytical techniques to tailor nanomedicine strategies to individual tumor profiles. Omics technologies, encompassing genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and more, provide unparalleled insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cancer. By dissecting tumor heterogeneity across multiple levels, these technologies offer robust support for the development of personalized and precise cancer nanomedicine strategies. In this review, the principles, techniques, and applications of key omics technologies are summarized. Especially, the synergistic integration of omics and nanomedicine in cancer therapy is explored, focusing on enhanced diagnostic accuracy, optimized therapeutic strategies and the assessment of nanomedicine&#8208;mediated biological responses. Moreover, this review addresses current challenges and outlines future directions in the field of omics&#8208;enhanced nanomedicine. By offering valuable insights and guidance, this review aims to advance the integration of omics with nanomedicine, ultimately driving improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for cancer.

         <title>Charge Generation and Enhancement of Key Components of Triboelectric Nanogenerators: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review classifies and summarizes innovative approaches to enhance the charge density of charge generation, charge trapping, and charge collection layers. The milestone of high charge density TENG is reviewed based on material selection and innovative mechanisms.








Abstract
The past decade has witnessed remarkable progress in high&#8208;performance Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) with the design and synthesis of functional dielectric materials, the exploration of novel dynamic charge transport mechanisms, and the innovative design of architecture, making it one of the most crucial technologies for energy harvesting. High output charge density is fundamental for TENG to expand its application scope and accelerate industrialization; it depends on the dynamic equilibrium of charge generation, trapping, de&#8208;trapping, and migration within its core components. Here, this review classifies and summarizes innovative approaches to enhance the charge density of the charge generation, charge trapping, and charge collection layers. The milestone of high charge density TENG is reviewed based on material selection and innovative mechanisms. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art principles and techniques for generating high charge density and suppressing charge decay are discussed and highlighted in detail, and the distinct charge transport mechanisms, the technologies of advanced materials preparation, and the effective charge excitation strategy are emphatically introduced. Lastly, the bottleneck and future research priorities for boosting the output charge density are summarized. A summary of these cutting&#8208;edge developments intends to provide readers with a deep understanding of the future design of high&#8208;output TENG.

         <title>Engineering of Single&#8208;Atomic Sites for Electro&#8208; and Photo&#8208;Catalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically discusses recent advancements in metal and nonmetal single&#8208;atom sites for the electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;synthesis of H2O2 via the 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction and water oxidation reaction pathways. Comprehensive discussions cover the influence of local physicochemical environments on the electronic structures and catalytic behaviors of isolated sites, the atomic catalytic mechanisms underlying these pathways for H2O2 production, and recent applications of H2O2 in advanced chemical transformations.








Abstract
Direct electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;synthesis of H2O2 through the 2e&#8722; O2 reduction reaction (ORR) and H2O oxidation reaction (WOR) offer promising alternatives for on&#8208;demand and on&#8208;site production of this chemical. Exploring robust and selective active sites is crucial for enhancing H2O2 production through these pathways. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), featuring isolated active sites on supports, possess attractive properties for promoting catalysis and unraveling catalytic mechanisms. This review first systematically summarizes significant advancements in atomic engineering of both metal and nonmetal single&#8208;atom sites for electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;catalytic 2e&#8722; ORR to H2O2, as well as the dynamic behaviors of active sites during catalytic processes. Next, the progress of single&#8208;atom sites in H2O2 production through 2e&#8722; WOR is overviewed. The effects of the local physicochemical environments on the electronic structures and catalytic behaviors of isolated sites, along with the atomic catalytic mechanism involved in these H2O2 production pathways, are discussed in detail. This work also discusses the recent applications of H2O2 in advanced chemical transformations. Finally, a perspective on the development of single&#8208;atom catalysis is highlighted, aiming to provide insights into future research on SACs for electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;synthesis of H2O2 and other advanced catalytic applications.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Reconstruction of Catalyst in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;situ reconstruction of the catalyst may lead to an uncontrollable catalytic process. This review summarizes the strategies for achieving targeted reconstruction via various methods, such as structural design, composition engineering, electrolyte selection, and control of electrocatalytic conditions for optimal catalytic performance in electrocatalysis. In addition, the challenging issues and perspectives are given for rationally designing pre&#8208;catalysts.








Abstract
Reconstruction of catalysts is now well recognized as a common phenomenon in electrocatalysis. As the reconstructed structure may promote or hamper the electrochemical performance, how to achieve the designed active surface for highly enhanced catalytic activity through the reconstruction needs to be carefully investigated. In this review, the genesis and electrochemical effects of reconstruction in various electrochemical catalytic processes, such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) are first described. Then, the strategies for optimizing the reconstruction, such as valence states control, active phase retention, phase evolution engineering, and surface poisoning prevention are comprehensively discussed. Finally, the general rules of reconstruction optimization are summarized and give perspectives for future study. It is believed that the review shall provide deep insights into electrocatalytic mechanisms and guide the design of pre&#8208;catalysts with highly improved activity.

         <title>Atom Probe Tomography: a Local Probe for Chemical Bonds in Solids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 50, December 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metallic, covalent, and metavalent solids can clearly be distinguished based on their bond bond&#8208;breaking behavior, i.e. their probability of multiple events (PME) and probability of molecular ions (PMI) values. These findings open new avenues in understanding and designing advanced materials since they allow quantification of bonds in solids on a nanometer scale.








Abstract
Atom probe tomography is frequently employed to characterize the elemental distribution in solids with atomic resolution. Here the potential of this technique to locally probe chemical bonds is reviewed and discussed. Two processes characterize the bond rupture in laser&#8208;assisted field emission, the probability of molecular ions (PMI), i.e., the probability that molecular ions are evaporated instead of single (atomic) ions, and the probability of multiple events (PME), i.e., the correlated field&#8208;evaporation of more than a single fragment upon laser&#8208; or voltage pulse excitation. Here it is demonstrated that one can clearly distinguish solids with metallic, covalent, and metavalent bonds based on their bond rupture, i.e., their PME and PMI values. These findings open new avenues in understanding and designing advanced materials, since they allow a quantification of bonds in solids on a nanometer scale, as will be shown for several examples. These possibilities would even justify calling the present approach bonding probe tomography (BPT).

         <title>2D Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for New Generation Flexible Multicolor Electrochromic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D conductive conjugated MOFs (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are introduced as a novel class of multicolor electrochromic materials with significant potential for the next&#8208;generation flexible electrochromic devices (FMEDs). This perspective provides new insights into the coloring mechanisms and presents strategies for optimizing device performance, highlighting potential multidisciplinary applications in camera lenses, camouflage, displays, and wearable electronics.








Abstract
There has been considerable interest in 2D conductive conjugated MOFs (2D c&#8208;MOFs) for their potential applications in sensors, opto&#8208;electronics, catalysis, and energy storage, owing to their ultra&#8208;high specific surface area, relatively high electrical conductivity, and tunable pore channel sizes for ion/charge diffusion/adsorption. The unique advantages brought by systematic tunings in the metal nodes and organic ligands enable the creation of highly accessible and remarkable structures with diverse chemical and physical behaviors. While the 2D c&#8208;MOFs are being explored for the rapid widening spectrum of applications, in this work, the great potential of multicolor transitions and functional properties of these 2D c&#8208;MOFs are examined for the new generation of flexible multicolor electrochromic devices (FMEDs). Despite the rather limited and yet steady progress that has been made so far, 2D c&#8208;MOFs offer great opportunities in addressing the monotonous color switching, undesirable stability, as well as the sluggish kinetics of electron/ion transportation, which are typically encountered by the conventional electrochromic materials. Together with the main challenges that are being faced, this perspective provides a timely re&#8208;visit to the expected transition in the near future from the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration to the eventual industrial&#8208;scale implementation of 2D c&#8208;MOFs in the new generation FEMDs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been considerable interest in 2D conductive conjugated MOFs (2D c-MOFs) for their potential applications in sensors, opto-electronics, catalysis, and energy storage, owing to their ultra-high specific surface area, relatively high electrical conductivity, and tunable pore channel sizes for ion/charge diffusion/adsorption. The unique advantages brought by systematic tunings in the metal nodes and organic ligands enable the creation of highly accessible and remarkable structures with diverse chemical and physical behaviors. While the 2D c-MOFs are being explored for the rapid widening spectrum of applications, in this work, the great potential of multicolor transitions and functional properties of these 2D c-MOFs are examined for the new generation of flexible multicolor electrochromic devices (FMEDs). Despite the rather limited and yet steady progress that has been made so far, 2D c-MOFs offer great opportunities in addressing the monotonous color switching, undesirable stability, as well as the sluggish kinetics of electron/ion transportation, which are typically encountered by the conventional electrochromic materials. Together with the main challenges that are being faced, this perspective provides a timely re-visit to the expected transition in the near future from the proof-of-concept demonstration to the eventual industrial-scale implementation of 2D c-MOFs in the new generation FEMDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Gate&#8208;Tunable Hot&#8208;Carrier Photocurrent from Perovskite Multiple Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot carrier devices with low&#8208;dimensional semiconductor heterostructures are promising for enhancing photon&#8208;to&#8208;current conversion beyond the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit. This study presents a 2D Van der Waals heterostructure device made of 2D perovskite quantum wells and few&#8208;layer MoS&#8322;. The device shows efficient gate&#8208;tunable hot&#8208;hole photocurrent and high external quantum efficiency.








Abstract
Hot&#8208;carrier relaxation above the bandgap results in significant energy losses, making the extraction of hot carriers a critical challenge for efficient hot&#8208;carrier photocurrent generation in devices. In this study, we observe long&#8208;lived hot carriers in the metal&#8208;halide perovskite multiple quantum wells, (BA)2(MA)n&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (n = 3), and demonstrate effective hot&#8208;hole photocurrent generation using 2D&#160;MoS&#8322; as an extraction layer. A high external quantum efficiency of short&#8208;circuit hot&#8208;carrier photocurrent of up to 35.4% is achieved. Further enhancement in photocurrent efficiency and open&#8208;circuit photovoltage is achieved when a gate electric field is applied, resulting in an external quantum efficiency of up to 61.9%. Evidence of hot&#8208;hole extraction is validated through operando transient reflection measurements on the working devices, with studies that depend on wavelength, carrier density, and gate voltage. DFT calculations on the heterostructure devices under different bias voltages further elucidate the mechanism of hot&#8208;hole extraction enhancement. These findings underscore the potential of perovskite multiple quantum wells as long&#8208;lived hot&#8208;carrier generators and highlight the role of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors as efficient hot&#8208;carrier extraction electrodes for low&#8208;power optoelectronics.

         <title>3D Heterogeneous Sensing System for Multimode Parrallel Signal No&#8208;Spatiotemporal Misalignment Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>A homo&#8208;spatiotemporal multisensory parallel transmission system (HMPTs) is reported that expanded to realize multisignal no&#8208;spatiotemporal misalignment recognition and efficient parallel transmission (4 times) via 3D vertical integration of four sensors.

Abstract
The spatiotemporal error caused by planar tiled structure design and the waste of communication resources brought on by the transmission of a single channel are two challenges facing the development of multifunctional intelligent sensors with high&#8208;density integration. A homo&#8208;spatiotemporal multisensory parallel transmission system (HMPTs) is expanded to realize multisignal no&#8208;spatiotemporal misalignment recognition and efficient parallel transmission. First, this system optimizes the distribution of multifunctional sensors, completes the 3D vertical heterogeneous layout of four sensors, and achieves material multi&#8208;information detection at a single place with no&#8208;spatiotemporal deviation. Additionally, the system couples and transmittes multiple sensory signals, delivering a fourfold increase in transmission efficiency and one&#8208;third of the power consumption compared to a single&#8208;channel transmission system. Finally, this system is used for the recognition of mixed materials, and human&#8208;computer interaction to realize the assignment of materials in VR, demonstrating the great accuracy and transmission efficiency of HMPTs as well as its feasibility in practical application. This is an a priori effort to enhance machine perception accuracy, improve signal transmission effectiveness, and advance human&#8208;machine&#8208;object triadic integration.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Free Inorganic&#8208;Based Films for Thermoelectric Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate&#8208;free inorganic&#8208;based thermoelectric thin films demonstrate excellent adaptability to curved surfaces and deliver high output performance, making them a promising solution for thermal management and energy harvesting in portable electronics. This review summarizes their fabrication methods, strategies for property enhancement, and applications in power generation and cooling, while highlighting remaining challenges and proposing directions for future research.








Abstract
The development of highly integrated electronic components and the Internet of Things demands efficient thermal management and uninterrupted energy harvesting, which provides exciting opportunities for thermoelectric (TE) technology since it allows direct conversion between electricity and thermal energy. The improved output performance of TE devices has traditionally been driven by advancements in inorganic materials. Recently, there has been growing interest in studying substrate&#8208;free inorganic&#8208;based TE thin films because they provide improved adherence to curved surfaces and offer a more compact size compared to the corresponding rigid form of these materials. This review begins by summarizing various methods for fabricating freestanding inorganic&#8208;based TE films, including leveraging the intrinsic plasticity of certain materials, exfoliating layered&#8208;structure materials, using sacrificial substrates, and creating composites with flexible components such as polymers and carbon&#8208;based materials. A key challenge in achieving high device performance is determining how to maintain the favorable TE properties of inorganic materials. This can be addressed through strategies such as high inorganic content loading, multicomponent engineering, and interfacial structure design. The review also discusses the applications of substrate&#8208;free inorganic&#8208;based TE devices in both power generation and solid&#8208;state cooling. Finally, it outlines current challenges and proposes potential research directions to further advance the field.

         <title>Dynamic Modulation of Afterglow Emission in Polymeric Phosphors via Inverse Opal Photonic Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust method is presented for dynamically tuning the afterglow of polymeric phosphors by incorporating a supporting layer of inverse opal photonic structures. These findings provide valuable insights into the physical modulation of afterglow in polymeric phosphors and position the resulting Janus film for potential applications in biosensing and information storage.








Abstract
Tuning the afterglow of polymeric phosphors is critical for advancing their use in optical data storage and display technologies. Despite advancements in polymer matrix design and dopant engineering, achieving dynamic control over afterglow intensity remains a significant challenge. In this study, a novel approach is introduced for dynamically tuning the afterglow of polymeric phosphors by integrating them into an inverse opal photonic structure. By precisely aligning the photonic stopband of the inverse opal structure with the afterglow band of the polymer film, a remarkable 15&#8208;fold enhancement in afterglow intensity is achieved. This enhancement is tunable, decreasing from 15 to 1.2 by infiltrating the photonic structure with media of varying refractive indices ranging from 1.00 (air) to 1.37 (ethyl acetate). The tunability arises from reducing the mismatch between the stopband and the afterglow band, as the weighted refractive index shifts between 1.15 and 1.40. Additionally, the inverse opal photonic structure induces angle&#8208;dependent structural colors in the Janus polymeric phosphors, modulated by the refractive index of the infiltrating media. This integration of dynamically tunable afterglow with angle&#8208;dependent structural coloration unlocks new potential for advanced optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Rigidity&#8208;Flexibility Regulation and Hard&#8208;Soft Donor Combination: Dual Strategies in Covalent Organic Frameworks Construction for Actinides/lanthanides Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual strategy for the design of covalent organic frameworks integrates molecular rigidity&#8211;flexibility regulation with hard&#8211;soft atom incorporation. The synthesized DAPhen&#8208;COF achieves over 95% removal of Np(V), Pu(IV), and Am(III), with a separation factor exceeding 5000 for Np/Gd. This study marks the first application of covalent organic frameworks in separating various transuraniums from lanthanides.








Abstract
Separating actinides from lanthanides is essential for managing nuclear waste and promoting sustainable nuclear energy development. The recycling of transuranium elements (TRUs: Np, Pu, Am) is also significant for various nuclear technology applications. In this study, a dual strategy is introduced to designing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that skillfully combines molecular rigidity with flexibility, integrating both hard and soft donor atoms in the synthesis of monomers. This results in a specialized COF that efficiently and selectively captures TRUs from acidic aqueous solutions. By utilizing the topological arrangement of rigid ligands to influence the twisting and stretching of flexible ligands, coordination environment featuring nitrogen and oxygen is created, which enhances the separation of transuranium in various oxidation states over lanthanides. In 0.5&#160;m HNO3 solution, the as&#8208;synthesized DAPhen&#8208;COF achieves removal rates of 99.1% for Np(V) and 95.8% for Pu(IV). For Am(III), the removal rate reaches 98.6% in 0.01&#160;m HNO3. DAPhen&#8208;COF exhibits remarkable selectivity for Np(V), with a separation factor of over 5000 for Np/Gd, outperforming other solid&#8208;phase materials. This research provides a comprehensive investigation into the design and synthesis of COFs for actinide capture, marking the first application of COFs in the separation of various TRUs over lanthanides.

The synthesized DAPhen-COF achieves over 95% removal of Np(V), Pu(IV), and Am(III), with a separation factor exceeding 5000 for Np/Gd. This study marks the first application of covalent organic frameworks in separating various transuraniums from lanthanides.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separating actinides from lanthanides is essential for managing nuclear waste and promoting sustainable nuclear energy development. The recycling of transuranium elements (TRUs: Np, Pu, Am) is also significant for various nuclear technology applications. In this study, a dual strategy is introduced to designing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that skillfully combines molecular rigidity with flexibility, integrating both hard and soft donor atoms in the synthesis of monomers. This results in a specialized COF that efficiently and selectively captures TRUs from acidic aqueous solutions. By utilizing the topological arrangement of rigid ligands to influence the twisting and stretching of flexible ligands, coordination environment featuring nitrogen and oxygen is created, which enhances the separation of transuranium in various oxidation states over lanthanides. In 0.5&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solution, the as-synthesized DAPhen-COF achieves removal rates of 99.1% for Np(V) and 95.8% for Pu(IV). For Am(III), the removal rate reaches 98.6% in 0.01&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. DAPhen-COF exhibits remarkable selectivity for Np(V), with a separation factor of over 5000 for Np/Gd, outperforming other solid-phase materials. This research provides a comprehensive investigation into the design and synthesis of COFs for actinide capture, marking the first application of COFs in the separation of various TRUs over lanthanides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanism of Hot&#8208;Carrier Photoluminescence in Sn&#8208;Based Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic illustrating the two dominant processes in tin&#8208;iodide perovskites at the band edge: 1) Filling of carriers at the band edge extrema as they cool. 2) Cooling of carriers emitting a longitudinal optical (LO) phonon. The inset shows the dephasing of a longitudinal optical phonon studied by impulsive vibrational spectroscopy in this work.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have shown exceptionally slow hot&#8208;carrier cooling, which has been attributed to various physical mechanisms without reaching a consensus. Here, experiment and theory are combined to unveil the carrier cooling process in formamidinium (FA) and caesium (Cs) tin triiodide thin films. Through impulsive vibrational spectroscopy and molecular dynamics, much shorter phonon dephasing times of the hybrid perovskite, which accounts for the larger blueshift in the photoluminescence seen at high excitation density for FASnI3 compared to CsSnI3 is reported. Density functional theory investigations reveal that the largest contribution to the blueshift is accounted by a giant, dynamic band&#8208;filling effect in Sn&#8208;based perovskites, which in turn can explain the cooling disparity with the Pb&#8208;based counterparts. Several years after the first experimental observations, here a deeper understanding of the cooling mechanism of these materials is provided. Design principles for hot&#8208;carrier materials, which may be useful for future implementations of hot&#8208;carrier solar cells are further provided.

         <title>Amylopectin&#8208;based Hydrogel Probes for Brain&#8208;machine Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research represents a significant scientific breakthrough in the design of neural probes for brain monitoring, neural circuit modulation, and the development of brain disease therapies. When neuromodulation and neural signal monitoring are performed directly in the primary motor cortex of stroke&#8208;affected rats, it significantly reduces the brain infarct area, promotes synaptic reorganization, and restores motor functions and balance.









Abstract
Implantable neural probes hold promise for acquiring brain data, modulating neural circuits, and treating various brain disorders. However, traditional implantable probes face significant challenges in practical applications, such as balancing sensitivity with biocompatibility and the difficulties of in situ neural information monitoring and neuromodulation. To address these challenges, this study developed an implantable hydrogel probe capable of recording neural signals, modulating neural circuits, and treating stroke. Amylopectin is integrated into the hydrogels, which can induce reorientation of the poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) chain and create compliant interfaces with brain tissues, enhancing both sensitivity and biocompatibility. The hydrogel probe shows the capability of continuously recording deep brain signals for 8 weeks. The hydrogel probe is effectively utilized to study deep brain signals associated with various physiological activities. Neuromodulation and neural signal monitoring are performed directly in the primary motor cortex of rats, enabling control over their limb behaviors through evoked signals. When applied to the primary motor cortex of stroke&#8208;affected rats, neuromodulation significantly reduced the brain infarct area, promoted synaptic reorganization, and restored motor functions and balance. This research represents a significant scientific breakthrough in the design of neural probes for brain monitoring, neural circuit modulation, and the development of brain disease therapies.

         <title>Mechanical&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Driven Pseudo&#8208;Conductive Channels Along Dielectric Heterojunction Interfaces for Mechanoelectric Energy Conversion and Transmission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comparison of conventional mechano&#8208;electric devices and mechanical stimuli&#8208;driven pseudo&#8208;conductive (MSPC) devices, illustrating the behavior of charge carriers and dipoles responding to mechanical stimulation and under energy band diagrams. MSPC devices exploit charge accumulation at dielectric junctions to establish in&#8208;plane pathways for mobility, enabling robust electrical signal transmission across long distances without conductive materials, which is not achievable with conventional devices.








Abstract
Mechanoelectric energy conversion holds promise for energy conversion and transmission devices, yet conventional configurations rely on large&#8208;area conductive materials in active regions, limiting architectural design for cutting&#8208;edge devices. Here, a rational strategy is reported to create mechanical stimuli&#8208;driven pseudo&#8208;conductive (MSPC) channels entirely from dielectric materials, eliminating the need for electrodes in active regions. An in&#8208;depth investigation of MSPC channel formation mechanism at dielectric interfaces is conducted, employing energy band analyses. Following the mechanical stimuli&#8208;driven charging process, MSPC device effectively transmits electrical signals over 42&#160;mm, achieving remarkable 512% enhancement compared to its pristine state. Control devices with non&#8208;continuous dielectric configurations highlight the impact of heterojunction interfaces on MSPC channels. A resistor&#8211;capacitor charging test reveals up to 49% reduction in voltage change rate, indicating a substantial decrease in electrical impedance along the MSPC channel. Furthermore, MSPC devices demonstrate information transmission capabilities, such as sequences of bits or letters, utilizing solely dielectric configurations. This study paves the way to reduce conductive materials of wearable electronics, biomedical implants, and IoT technologies, overcoming significant challenges such as potential electrical shortages, design inflexibility, limited manufacturing scalability, and maintenance issues.

         <title>Conjugation Chemistry Markedly Impacts Toxicity and Biodistribution of Targeted Nanoparticles, Mediated by Complement Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugation chemistries are a critical technology in nanomedicine, enabling precise functionalization of nanoparticle surfaces (e.g., via attachment of targeting moieties). This work investigates how conjugation chemistry impacts nanoparticle&#8208;induced complement activation. The results demonstrate that modern conjugation chemistries, although bio&#8208;orthogonal, are not innocuous and must be chosen with opsonins like complement in mind.









Abstract
Conjugation chemistries are a major enabling technology for the development of drug delivery systems, from antibody&#8208;drug conjugates to antibody&#8208;targeted lipid nanoparticles inspired by the success of the COVID&#8208;19 vaccine. However, here it is shown that for antibody&#8208;targeted nanoparticles, the most popular conjugation chemistries directly participate in the activation of the complement cascade of plasma proteins. Their activation of complement leads to large changes in the biodistribution of nanoparticles (up to 140&#8208;fold increased uptake into phagocytes of the lungs) and multiple toxicities, including a 50% drop in platelet count. It is founded that the mechanism of complement activation varies dramatically between different conjugation chemistries. Dibenzocyclooctyne, a commonly used click&#8208;chemistry, caused aggregation of conjugated antibodies, but only on the surface of nanoparticles (not in bulk solution). By contrast, thiol&#8208;maleimide chemistry do not activate complement via its effects on antibodies, but rather because free maleimide bonded to albumin in plasma, and clustered albumin is then attacked by complement. Using these mechanistic insights, solutions are engineered that reduced the activation of complement for each class of conjugation chemistry. These results highlight that while conjugation chemistry is essential for the future of nanomedicine, it is not innocuous and must be designed with opsonins like complement in mind.

&lt;p&gt;Conjugation chemistries are a major enabling technology for the development of drug delivery systems, from antibody-drug conjugates to antibody-targeted lipid nanoparticles inspired by the success of the COVID-19 vaccine. However, here it is shown that for antibody-targeted nanoparticles, the most popular conjugation chemistries directly participate in the activation of the complement cascade of plasma proteins. Their activation of complement leads to large changes in the biodistribution of nanoparticles (up to 140-fold increased uptake into phagocytes of the lungs) and multiple toxicities, including a 50% drop in platelet count. It is founded that the mechanism of complement activation varies dramatically between different conjugation chemistries. Dibenzocyclooctyne, a commonly used click-chemistry, caused aggregation of conjugated antibodies, but only on the surface of nanoparticles (not in bulk solution). By contrast, thiol-maleimide chemistry do not activate complement via its effects on antibodies, but rather because free maleimide bonded to albumin in plasma, and clustered albumin is then attacked by complement. Using these mechanistic insights, solutions are engineered that reduced the activation of complement for each class of conjugation chemistry. These results highlight that while conjugation chemistry is essential for the future of nanomedicine, it is not innocuous and must be designed with opsonins like complement in mind.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiton&#8208;Inspired Composites Synergizing Strength and Toughness Through Sinusoidal Interlocking Interfaces for Protective Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiton Lepidozona coreanica wisely uses the sinusoidal interlocking interface to make up for the short board of the cross&#8208;lamellar structures. Inspired by this, a chiton&#8208;inspired composite integrating cross&#8208;lamellar architecture and sinusoidal interlocking interface is proposed. The chiton&#8208;inspired composite has the high strength and toughness under quasi&#8208;static and impact loads, and has promising application prospects in the field of protection.








Abstract
Introducing biological structures into materials design is expected to develop strong and tough structural materials. However, multiple interfaces are introduced simultaneously. They are always the weakest part of load transfer, becoming a critical vulnerability and failure&#8208;prone area. Here, it is the first found that the chiton achieves superior mechanical properties just by incorporating a unique sinusoidal interlocking interface into cross&#8208;lamellar architecture. These special interlocking interfaces make the chiton shell achieve damage delocalization and increase the resistance to crack initiation and propagation. Meanwhile, this &#8220;pre&#8208;engineered&#8221; path significantly increases the travel path of the cracks and balances the strength and toughness under quasi&#8208;static and impact loading. Inspired by this, a novel chiton&#8208;inspired composite is proposed. Through coupling the cross&#8208;lamellar structures and sinusoidal interlocking interfaces, its strength and toughness are increased by 88% and 107% under quasi&#8208;static loading, as well as by 17.8% and 52.4% under impact loading, respectively. These unusual interfaces make up the weak point of cross&#8208;lamellar structures and provide insights into the longer evolution of structural materials.

         <title>Regulating Charge Separation Via Periodic Array Nanostructures for Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a plasmonic photocatalyst with an ordered Au nanoparticle array on SrTiO3, enhancing surface plasmon resonance (SPR) intensity while maintaining constant resonant energy due to surface lattice resonance. This balance improves charge separation and increases local charge density at active sites, boosting water oxidation activity sevenfold. These results demonstrate a promising strategy for optimizing SPR characteristics to enhance photocatalytic performance on plasmonic platforms, opening avenues for more efficient energy conversion applications.








Abstract
Plasmonic resonance intensity in metallic nanostructures plays a crucial role in charge generation and separation, directly affecting plasmon&#8208;induced photocatalytic activity. Engineering strategies to enhance plasmonic effects involve designing specific nanostructures, such as triangular nanoplates with sharp corners or dimer nanostructures with hot spots. However, these approaches often lead to a trade&#8208;off between enhanced plasmonic intensity and resonance energy, which ultimately determines local charge density and photocatalytic performance. Here, inspired by theoretical predications, it is shown that a flexibly controlled plasmonic photocatalyst, consisting of an ordered array of Au nanoparticles on a SrTiO3 surface, exhibits an enhanced surface plasmon resonance (SPR) intensity while maintaining a constant SPR resonant energy, due to the presence of surface lattice resonance. This trade&#8208;off results in improved charge separation efficiency and an increase in local charge density at catalytically active sites, as verified by theoretical simulations, surface photovoltage microscopy, and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. Moreover, the optimized periodic photocatalyst shows a 7&#8208;fold increase in water oxidation activity over disordered nanostructures. This work provides a novel approach for balancing the intensity and energy of SPR, which will contribute to optimizing photocatalytic activity on plasmonic platforms.

         <title>Topological Transformation and Dimensional Reduction in Multicomponent Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel synthetic approach to multicomponent MOFs by &#8220;standing on the shoulder of&#8221; a well&#8208;established one based on the new understanding on the self&#8208;assembly process. By making use of various chemical interactions during the self&#8208;assembly process, the structural transformation can be modulated from ternary 3D&#160;structures to quaternary 2D structures.








Abstract
Multicomponent MOFs have offered a wide range of opportunities to harness new properties. However, the synthesis of multicomponent MOFs remains challenging. This work demonstrates the synthesis of a family of multicomponent MOFs by topological transformation from well&#8208;established multicomponent partitioned acs (pacs) structures. Such transformation is based on the new understanding on the self&#8208;assembly process of pacs MOFs. A key to this understanding is that pacs structures, topologically regarded as the introduction of a pore&#8208;partitioning ligand into MOF&#8208;235/MIL&#8208;88 type framework, are likely to be formed in a layer&#8208;pillar&#8208;layer fashion in practical reactions. As the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction between layers and other chemical interactions during the self&#8208;assembly process are recognized, the structural transformation can be modulated from 3D pacs structures to 2D interrupted pacs structures (denoted i&#8208;pacs). It is especially noteworthy that such dimensional reduction is first observed in metal&#8208;organic frameworks and the i&#8208;pacs MOFs contain four structural modules and up to five components, which have the highest complexity among 2D MOFs. Interestingly, the i&#8208;pacs MOFs have significantly enhanced performance for CO2/N2 separation in comparison with pacs MOFs.

         <title>Functionalized Nanozyme Microcapsules Targeting Deafness Prevention via Mitochondrial Homeostasis Remodeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized nanozyme microcapsules are established to protect cisplatin&#8208;induced hearing loss via mitochondrial homeostasis remodeling. The synergy between the manganese porphyrin and polymer dots results in excellent antioxidant properties. The developed microcapsules reprogram the energy supply mechanism and inhibit the oligomerization of BAX in mitochondria to prevent the leakage of mitochondrial DNA and cytochrome c.








Abstract
Mitochondrial dysfunction, which is the primary mechanism underlying cisplatin&#8208;induced hearing loss, can potentially be mitigated by modulating the redox balance and reprogramming the energy metabolism to remodel mitochondrial homeostasis. Herein, N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine&#8211;derived carbonized polymer dots (NAC CPDs) are embedded into manganese porphyrin&#8211;doped metal&#8211;organic frameworks and encapsulated using a polydopamine (PDA) coating and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel to afford functionalized nanozyme microcapsules. Owing to their injectability and adhesion properties, these microcapsules exhibit the advantages of prolonged retention in the middle ear and sustained release in the inner ear. The synergy between the manganese porphyrin and polymer dots results in excellent antioxidant properties. The developed nanozymes activate the PI3K&#8208;AKT pathway, reprogramming the energy supply mechanism, and inhibiting the oligomerization of BAX in mitochondria to prevent the leakage of mitochondrial DNA and cytochrome c. Therapeutic efficacy and related mechanisms are validated in vivo. Thus, this study on mitochondrial homeostasis remodeling by nanozyme microcapsules opens a new chapter in the treatment of hearing loss.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Nano&#8208;Regulator Unleashes Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunity by Overcoming Dendritic Cell Tolerance and T Cell Exhaustion in Tumor&#8208;Draining Lymph Nodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel nano&#8208;regulator (DNR) engineered to reprogram dendritic cells (DCs) within tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs), significantly enhancing anti&#8208;tumor immunity. The DNR employs a dual TLR activation strategy, simultaneously mitigating immune checkpoint suppression. This targeted approach directly addresses DC tolerance and T cell exhaustion, effectively restoring robust anti&#8208;tumor responses.








Abstract
Lymph nodes are crucial immune foci as the primary target for cancer immunotherapy. However, the anti&#8208;tumor functions of tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are critically suppressed by tumors. Here, a novel spatiotemporal nano&#8208;regulator is presented, designed to modulate the dendritic cells (DCs) in TDLNs, establishing a supportive niche for immune surveillance. The DC&#8208;mediated nano&#8208;regulator (DNR) is established by the self&#8208;assembly of an imidazoquinoline (IMDQ) prodrug, inhibitory immune checkpoint (ICP) siRNA, and mannan (a TLR4 agonist). This unique design leverages the spatiotemporal activation of TLR4 and TLR7/8, thereby optimizing DC maturation and cytokine production. This further promotes efficient T cell priming. Simultaneously, the ICP&#8208;targeting siRNA mitigates the tolerogenic effects induced by tumor&#8208;derived factors and TLR activation, preventing T cell exhaustion. In essence, DNR facilitates potent remodeling of TDLNs and the tumor microenvironment, activating the anti&#8208;tumor immunity cascade. When combined with vaccines, DNR greatly promotes tumor regression and the establishment of long&#8208;term immunological memory.

         <title>Suspending Light&#8208;Absorbing Nanoparticles in Silica Aerogel Enables Numerous Superblacks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Numerous superblacks are fabricated via generally suspending individual light&#8208;absorbing nanoparticles in man&#8208;made solid smoke.








Abstract
Current strategies for constructing sparse nanostructures for fabricating superblacks are only suitable for a few light&#8208;absorbing materials, severely limiting their applications. Herein, ultra&#8208;low reflective silica aerogels with ultra&#8208;high light transparency are used as solid smokes to individually or simultaneously suspend at least 100 species of light&#8208;absorbing nanoparticles with a volume fraction as low as 0.005%, for creating &gt; 100 superblacks in practice and one billion superblacks in theory if taken permutation and combination among these 0D, 1D, or 2D nanoparticles into account. Depending on the composition of suspended nanoparticles and the structure of solid smoke, the resulting mechanically robust superblacks with supplementary properties including magnetism, full&#8208;spectrum absorption, high thermal stability, and excellent mechanical strength, are first observed. The wide choice of metallic or semiconductive LNs allows as&#8208;made superblacks to glitter in different catalytic reactions, and the resulting superblacks have been on&#8208;demand modified for endowing the self&#8208;cleaning performance in some contaminable environments. Benefiting from the superblack feature and porous network, these superblack monoliths have shown high&#8208;efficiency solar&#8208;heat conversion in some emerging light harvesting and managing fields. This powerful synthetic strategy for superblacks is expected to inspire researchers to conduct in&#8208;depth investigations on super&#8208;black optics, functional materials, etc.

         <title>An Efficient Biosynthetic System for Developing Functional Silk Fibroin&#8208;Based Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a novel silk gland biosynthetic system for efficient expression and large&#8208;scale production of exogenous protein with bioactivity in silk fibers of transgenic silkworms, realizing cost&#8208;effective fabrications of fluorescent and antibacterial silk fibroin biomaterials, and providing an opportunity for genetic functionalization of silk fibroin to broaden the utility of this biomaterial for a range of potential applications.








Abstract
Long historical evolution and domestication endow silkworms with the super ability to synthesize and secrete massive silk proteins using silk glands. The major component of this secretion consists of silk fibroin, considered a promising biomaterial for tissue repairs and engineering. To further expand the utility of this unique protein, there is a continuing need for silk fibroin functionalization. Here, a highly&#8208;efficient Fib&#8208;HEXP biosynthetic system is established to synthesize massive recombinant RFP in silk fibers using transgenic silkworms, which accounts for &#8776;7.86% of silk mass and achieves fabrication of fluorescent silk fibroin (SF) biomaterials. The universality of the Fib&#8208;HEXP system is validated by genetic engineering glucose oxidase (GOx) functionalized silk fibers for fabricating GOx&#8208;SF hydrogels with antimicrobial activity to promote healing of infected diabetic wounds in mouse through the enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reaction of glucose to gluconic acid and H2O2. These findings demonstrate that the Fib&#8208;HEXP system provides an opportunity for genetic functionalization of SF to broaden the utility of this biomaterial for a range of potential applications.

         <title>Proton Storage Chemistry in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Inorganic Batteries with Moderate Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances regarding the proton storage chemistry in aqueous zinc&#8208;inorganic batteries with moderate electrolytes are systematically reviewed, and the four proton storage reaction patterns, the proton storage, and transport processes are well refined. The characterization techniques of proton storage are carefully introduced. Especially, the four structural engineering of proton storage modulation are highlighted.








Abstract
The proton (H+) has been proved to be another important energy storage ion besides Zn2+ in aqueous zinc&#8208;inorganic batteries with moderate electrolytes. H+ storage usually possesses better thermodynamics and reaction kinetics than Zn2+, and is found to be an important addition for Zn2+ storage. Thus, understanding, characterizing, and modulating H+ storage in inorganic cathode materials is particularly important. In this review, recent advances regarding the proton storage chemistry in aqueous zinc&#8208;inorganic batteries with moderate electrolytes are systematically reviewed. First, the four proton storage reaction patterns of H+ insertion, H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion, H+&#8208;dependent conversion, and H+&#8208;dependent dissolution/deposition reaction are explicitly presented. Meanwhile, the proton storage processes of multi&#8208;sites and multi&#8208;steps, and the Hopping and Grotthuss proton transport mechanisms are carefully introduced. Second, the characterization techniques of proton storage are systematically classified into four types of electrochemical characterization techniques of batteries, structural characterization techniques of inorganic cathodes, pH characterization technique of electrolyte, and quantitative analysis technologies of H+ storage contribution. Third, the structural engineering of proton storage modulation is preliminarily refined to be interlayer engineering, doping engineering, defect engineering, composite engineering, and other engineering. Finally, the emerging challenges and perspectives about future directions of proton storage chemistry are proposed.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Yet Strong Actuator Materials with Muscle&#8208;Like Diastole and Contraction via Multilevel Relaxations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanical robust and healable actuator material with muscle&#8208;like diastole and contraction abilities is fabricated by orientational alignment of dendritic polyphenol&#8208;modified nano&#8208;assembles in eutectogels. The anisotropic hierarchical micro&#8208;nanostructures assembled by supramolecular interaction endow obtained artificial muscle with high output actuation and robust mechanical properties, exceeding typical natural muscles, which pave&#160;the way for advancements in next&#8208;generation intelligent robotics.








Abstract
Skeletal muscles represent a role model in soft robotics featuring agile locomotion and incredible mechanical robustness. However, existing actuators lack an optimal combination of actuation parameters (including actuation modes, work capacity, mechanical strength, and damage repair) to rival biological tissues. Here, a biomimetic structural design strategy via multilevel relaxations (&#945;/&#946;/&#947;/&#948;&#8208;relaxation) modulation is proposed for mechanical robust and healable actuator materials with muscle&#8208;like diastole and contraction abilities by orientational alignment of dendritic polyphenol&#8208;modified nano&#8208;assembles in eutectogels. The anisotropic hierarchical micro&#8208;nanostructures assembled by supramolecular interaction mimic the relative slippage of actin filaments and myosin in muscles, ensuring bistable actuation through rapid thermal &#945;&#8208;relaxation and expansion. Furthermore, kinetically active secondary &#946;/&#947;/&#948;&#8208;relaxation at reconfigurable interfaces can conquer the limited self&#8208;healing ability of fixed&#8208;orientation polymeric chains. The obtained artificial muscle exhibits high output actuation, robust mechanical properties (tensile strength of 33.5&#160;MPa), and desired functional, mechanical self&#8208;healing efficiency (89.7%), exceeding typical natural muscles in living systems. The bionic micro&#8208;nano design strategy achieves bottom&#8208;up cooperative relaxation modulation to integrate all&#8208;round performance of natural muscles, which paves the way for substantial advancements in next&#8208;generation intelligent robotics.

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zn&#8208;SPAN Batteries with Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;life of Zn&#8208;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) battery is developed by a tandem catalytic electrolyte containing water and tetraglyme (G4) with iodine (I2) additives. The G4&#8211;I2 synergy activates efficient I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox couple in SPAN, reducing activation energy, and accelerating Zn&#8208;ion kinetics. Additionally, it stabilizes the Zn anode by forming an organic&#8211;inorganic interphase that inducing the generation of the predominant (002) plane.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;sulfur batteries are a high&#8208;capacity and cost&#8208;effective energy storage technology. However, the performance is plagued by the dissolution of intermediate polysulfides formed during conversion. Here, this issue is addressed by developing aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8208;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries using tandem catalytic systems, containing water and tetraglyme (G4) with iodine (I2) additives. Mechanistic study and experiments reveal that the fully conjugated molecular configurations circumvent the formation of soluble polysulfides and enable reversible co&#8208;storage of H+/Zn2+ with multiple redox&#8208;active centers. The reduced I2 by G4 activates I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox couple in SPAN, reducing activation energy, and accelerating Zn&#8208;ion transfer kinetics. Additionally, it stabilizes the Zn anode by forming an organic&#8211;inorganic interphase that induces the generation of the predominant (002) plane. The as&#8208;assembled Zn&#8208;SPAN batteries exhibit excellent performances, with a high capacity of 1260.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, a high&#8208;rate performance (409.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1), and a long cycling stability (81.8% capacity remained over 800 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1). This work takes a crucial step forward in organosulfur compounds accompanied by multi&#8208;electron transfer for the high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A Novel Matrix&#8208;Free Hyperfluorescent System Based on Anti&#8208;Quenching TADF Host for High Color Purity MR&#8208;TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an advanced design concept for matrix&#8208;free hyperfluorescent systems, utilizing anti&#8208;quenching TADF materials as hosts to overcome aggregation&#8208;induced challenges in traditional MR&#8208;TADF emitters by regulating the energy transfer process. Importantly, this strategy avoids complex chemical modifications of MR&#8208;TADF emitters, making them universal and low&#8208;cost, which will greatly promote the commercialization of hyperfluorescent OLEDs.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on hyperfluorescent system have attracted widespread attention due to their ability to simultaneously achieve improvements in efficiency, lifetime, and color purity by combining the advantages of high exciton utilization sensitizers and high&#8208;color purity emitters. Traditional hyperfluorescent systems typically involve three or four components and are severely sensitive to the doping concentration (&#8776;0.5 wt%) of a terminal emitter, which inevitably causes high costs and difficulties in reproducibility. Here, a novel design concept for a matrix&#8208;free hyperfluorescent (MFHF) system that employs a combination of an anti&#8208;quenching TADF host and a high color purity MR&#8208;TADF emitter is proposed. This strategy allows traditional concentration&#8208;sensitive MR&#8208;TADF emitters to significantly improve exciton utilization and reduce exciton lifetime at high doping levels, without the need for complex molecular modifications. The OLEDs with binary emissive layer achieve pure&#8208;green emission, a maximum external quantum efficiency of over 30%, and a high maximum power efficiency of 145&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1. The approach offers a straightforward and universal method to achieve anti&#8208;quenching matrix&#8208;free hyperfluorescent OLEDs with high color purity, making them promising for commercial applications in low&#8208;cost ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition (UHD) displays.

         <title>Precise Cell Type Electrical Stimulation Therapy Via Force&#8208;electric Hydrogel Microspheres for Cartilage Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrated that injectable force&#8208;electric hydrogel microspheres generate sustained electrical stimulation under pressure, actively inducing the aggregation of specific cell types. At the microscale, this process facilitates precise regulation of calcium ion influx, guiding the differentiation fate of targeted cells. Overall, this piezoelectric hydrogel offers a novel method for the precise repair of cartilage injuries.








Abstract
Electrical stimulation enhances cellular activity, promoting tissue regeneration and repair. However, specific cells and maintaining a stable energy supply are challenges for precise cell electrical stimulation therapy. Here, force&#8208;electric conversion hydrogel microspheres (Piezo@CR MPs) is devloped to induce specific stem cell aggregation and promote chondrogenic differentiation through localized electrical stimulation. These MPs contain barium titanate (BT) nanoparticles embedded in hyaluronic acid methacrylate hydrogel MPs, with a polydopamine (pDA) coating bound to stem cell recruitment peptides (CR) via &#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation and electrostatic forces. Piezo@CR MPs convert pressure (ultrasound) into electrical stimulation, directing BMSCs for colonization and chondrogenesis. In vitro, directionally migrated stem cells almost covered the Piezo@CR MP surface, generating up to 451&#160;mV of electrical output that enhanced chondrogenic differentiation. In a rabbit osteochondral defect model, Piezo@CR MPs promoted cartilage regeneration, nearly resembling native cartilage. In a rat osteoarthritis model, they reduced cartilage degeneration and improved behavioral outcomes. Additionally, Piezo@CR MPs promoted cartilage regeneration by driving the influx of extracellular calcium and activating the p38 mitogen&#8208;activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In conclusion, Piezo@CR MPs offer a new approach for precise cell type electrical stimulation therapy in treating of cartilage injuries and degeneration.

         <title>Dimethylamine Bismuth Iodide: A Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Enabling Ultra&#8208;Sensitive UVC Photodetection with Low Operating Voltage and High Detectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable lead&#8208;free perovskite, dimethylamine bismuth iodide (DMABI), demonstrates exceptional UVC photodetection. The device exhibits ultralow dark current, high on/off ratio, superior detectivity, and low operating voltage. With high responsivity and external quantum efficiency, DMABI emerges as a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost deep UV photodetectors, outperforming existing materials in key performance metrics.








Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors (PDs) are essential for various applications, but traditional materials face challenges in cost, fabrication, and performance. This study introduces dimethylamine bismuth iodide (DMABI) as a promising lead&#8208;free perovskite for UV PDs, particularly in the UVC region. DMABI demonstrates exceptional device parameters, including an ultralow dark current of 0.12 pA at 0.05&#160;V, a high on/off ratio of 7.1 &#215; 104, and a peak detectivity of 3.18 &#215; 1013 Jones. The unique structure of DMABI, with isolated octahedral units, ensures minimal connectivity, significantly reducing dark current. When exposed to high&#8208;energy UV light, carriers gain sufficient energy to hop between octahedrally coordinated bismuth centres, resulting in substantial photocurrent. The small size of the organic cation facilitates efficient charge transfer, contributing to high responsivity (1.46 A&#160;W&#8722;1) and external quantum efficiency (up to 717%).

     alt="Dimethylamine Bismuth Iodide: A Lead-Free Perovskite Enabling Ultra-Sensitive UVC Photodetection with Low Operating Voltage and High Detectivity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stable lead-free perovskite, dimethylamine bismuth iodide (DMABI), demonstrates exceptional UVC photodetection. The device exhibits ultralow dark current, high on/off ratio, superior detectivity, and low operating voltage. With high responsivity and external quantum efficiency, DMABI emerges as a promising candidate for high-performance, low-cost deep UV photodetectors, outperforming existing materials in key performance metrics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors (PDs) are essential for various applications, but traditional materials face challenges in cost, fabrication, and performance. This study introduces dimethylamine bismuth iodide (DMABI) as a promising lead-free perovskite for UV PDs, particularly in the UVC region. DMABI demonstrates exceptional device parameters, including an ultralow dark current of 0.12 pA at 0.05&#160;V, a high on/off ratio of 7.1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and a peak detectivity of 3.18 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones. The unique structure of DMABI, with isolated octahedral units, ensures minimal connectivity, significantly reducing dark current. When exposed to high-energy UV light, carriers gain sufficient energy to hop between octahedrally coordinated bismuth centres, resulting in substantial photocurrent. The small size of the organic cation facilitates efficient charge transfer, contributing to high responsivity (1.46 A&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and external quantum efficiency (up to 717%). These results establish DMABI as a superior, low-cost candidate for UV photodetection, addressing limitations of existing materials. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms driving these characteristics and highlights potential for future advancements in UV PD technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Charge Carrier Density in Organic Semiconductors Modulates the Effective Capacitance: A Unified View of Electrolyte Gated Organic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A framework for electrolyte gated organic transistors (EGOTs) that unifies electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistors (EGOFETs) with organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is proposed. The effective capacitance that drives the device response arises from in series capacitances of device interfaces and the chemical capacitance of the organic semiconductor. The model predicts the shape of the transfer curve of EGOTs (p&#8208;/n&#8208;type and ambipolar).








Abstract
A framework for electrolyte&#8208;gated organic transistors (EGOTs) that unifies the view of interfacial capacitive coupling of electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistors (EGOFETs) with the volumetric capacitive coupling in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is proposed. The EGOT effective capacitance arises from in&#8208;series capacitances of the electrolyte/gate electrode and electrolyte/channel interfaces, and the chemical capacitance of the organic semiconductor channel whose weight with respect to the interfacial capacitance is modulated by the charge carrier density, hence by the gate voltage. The expression for chemical capacitance is derived from the DOS of the organic semiconductor, which it is assumed to exhibit exponential energy disorder in the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. The analytical expression of the EGOT current is assessed on experimental data and shown to accurately predict the shape of the whole transfer curve of an EGOT thus allowing to extract accurate values for the switch&#8208;on voltage and the interfacial transconductance, without assumptions on specific response regime and, in OECT, without invoking the volumetric capacitance. Interestingly, the EGOT model recovers EGOFET and OECT as limit cases and, in the latter case, explicitly represents the volumetric capacitance in terms of the energy disorder and the bandgap of the organic semiconductor.

         <title>Scanning Acousto&#8208;Optoelectric Spectroscopy on a Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Monolayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining time&#8208;resolved optical spectroscopy and surface acoustic waves provide a powerful tool for investigating charge carrier dynamics in 2D materials. When interacting with the 2D semiconductor WSe2, dynamic acoustic Poole&#8211;Frenkel activation of traps enhances the optical emission efficiency. The sub&#8208;nanosecond modulation of the optical signal serves as a sensitive local probe of defects and charge carrier trapping sites.








Abstract
The charge carrier dynamics are investigated by surface acoustic waves (SAWs) inside a WSe2 monolayer on LiNbO3 by scanning acousto&#8208;optoelectric spectroscopy. A strong enhancement of the PL emission intensity is observed almost over the entire area of the flake. This enhancement increases with increasing amplitude of the wave and is especially strong at or in the vicinity to defects. The latter is attributed to the SAW&#8208;driven Poole&#8211;Frenkel activation of trapped charge carriers bound to trapping sites at these defects. In addition, the PL intensity exhibit clear periodic modulations at the SAW's frequency&#160;fSAW and at 2 fSAW. These modulations are clear and unambiguous fingerprints of spatio&#8208;temporal carrier dynamics driven by the SAW. These occur on sub&#8208;nanosecond timescales which are found in good agreement with calculated exciton dissociation times. Mapping and analyzing both effects, this study shows that scanning acousto&#8208;electric spectroscopy provides a highly sensitive and local contact&#8208;free probe which uncovers distinct local features not resolved by conventional quasi&#8208;static photoluminescence techniques. The method is ideally suited to study carrier transport in 2D and other types of nanoscale materials and to reveal dynamic exciton modulation, and carrier localization and activation dynamics in the technologically important megahertz to gigahertz frequency range.

         <title>Selective Control of Electric Charge of Weyl Fermions in Pyrochlore Iridates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Previous studies about Weyl fermions have mostly focused on the magnetic charges, while the electric charges are rarely explored. This work reports an intriguing linear scaling relationship between the anomalous Hall conductivity and Hall carrier density in strained Nd2Ir2O7 thin films, which points to the essential role of correlation between magnetic and electric charges in Weyl fermions.








Abstract
Weyl fermions can exhibit exotic phenomena due to their magnetic charge in momentum space, while Weyl nodes are usually located away from Fermi energy, which forms electron or hole pockets as the electric charges. Previous studies have mostly focused on the magnetic charge, however, the electric charges are rarely explored. Here, the intriguing Hall responses arising from the interplay between magnetic and electric charges of Weyl fermions in pyrochlore iridates are reported. Explicitly, unexpected linear scaling is observed between the anomalous Hall conductivity and Hall carrier density in strained Nd2Ir2O7 thin films, and its slope shows a sign change approaching the N&#233;el temperature of Nd. Theoretical calculations unveil that the cluster magnetic multipoles induce local energy inversion of Weyl nodes, which alters the electric charge of Weyl fermions and accounts for the observed nontrivial Hall responses. Moreover, the correlation between the magnetic and electric charges is further probed by voltage&#8208;controlled hydrogenation, which leads to the suppression of the anomalous Hall effect through electron filling. This work not only reveals the essential role of the both magnetic and electric charges of Weyl fermions, but also demonstrates the hydrogenation as an effective tuning knob in exploring correlated topological properties.

         <title>Measurement of Enhanced Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling Strength for Donor&#8208;Bound Electron Spins in Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant enhancement in spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) within multi&#8208;donor silicon quantum dots is demonstrated, showing SOC strengths up to 40 &#181;eV, surpassing previous benchmarks by two orders of magnitude. This advancement paves the way for precise all&#8208;electrical control of donor&#8208;bound spins and improved coupling to superconducting resonators, marking a crucial step forward in quantum computing.








Abstract
While traditionally considered a deleterious effect in quantum dot spin qubits, the spin&#8208;orbit interaction is recently being revisited as it allows for rapid coherent control by on&#8208;chip AC electric fields. For electrons in bulk silicon, spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) is intrinsically weak, however, it can be enhanced at surfaces and interfaces, or through atomic placement. Here it is showed that the strength of the spin&#8208;orbit coupling can be locally enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude in the manybody wave functions of multi&#8208;donor quantum dots compared to a single donor, reaching strengths so far only reported for holes or two&#8208;donor system with certain symmetry. These findings may provide a pathway toward all&#8208;electrical control of donor&#8208;bound spins in silicon using electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR).

         <title>Atomic Dispersed Co on NC@Cu Core&#8208;Shells for Solar Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;shell photocatalyst comprising atomic&#8208;dispersed Co and plasmonic Cu nanoparticles is developed for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production from seawater. This photocatalyst achieves strong synergy between the reaction environment, broad light absorption, plasmonic electric field, and active atomic sites, thereby enabling optimal seawater hydrogen production through redox reactions.








Abstract
With freshwater resources becoming increasingly scarce, the photocatalytic seawater splitting for hydrogen production has garnered widespread attention. In this study, a novel photocatalyst consisting of a Cu core coated is introduced with N&#8208;doped C and decorated with single Co atoms (Co&#8208;NC@Cu) for solar to hydrogen production from seawater. This catalyst, without using noble metals or sacrificial agents, demonstrates superior hydrogen production effficiency of 9080 &#181;molg&#8722;1h&#8722;1, i.e., 4.78% solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency, and exceptional long&#8208;term stability, operating over 340&#160;h continuously. The superior performance is attributed to several key factors. First, the focus&#8208;light induced photothermal effect enhances redox reaction capabilities, while the salt&#8208;ions enabled charge polarization around catalyst surfaces extends charge carrier lifetime. Furthermore, the Co&#9472;NC@Cu exhibits excellent broad light absorption, promoting photoexcited charge production. Theoretical calculations reveal that Co&#9472;NC acts as the active site, showing low energy barriers for reduction reactions. Additionally, the formation of a strong surface electric field from the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Cu nanoparticles further reduces energy barriers for redox reactions, improving seawater splitting activity. This work provides valuable insights into intergrating the reaction environment, broad solar absorption, LSPR, and active single atoms into a core&#8208;shell photocatalyst design for efficient and robust solar&#8208;driven seawater splitting.

         <title>A Strategy Involving Microporous Microneedles Integrated with CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Macrophages for Scar Management by Regulating Fibrotic Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;macrophages (CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms) capable of targeting DPP4+ fibroblasts and modulating ECs subtype within the scar microenvironment are engineered to effectively prevent scarring. Hydrogel microporous microneedles (mMNs) are employed to deliver CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms, which can effectively alleviate scar. The study demonstrates that mMNs attached to CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms may exert vital influences on skin scarring, providing a promising approach for treating posttraumatic scarring.








Abstract
Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) positive fibroblasts play a pivotal role in scar development following skin injury. Heterogeneous vascular endothelial cells (ECs) within scarred areas retain the capacity to drive tissue regeneration and repair. Simultaneously, TREM2 macrophages play a crucial role in the progression and resolution of fibrosis by engaging in mutual regulation with ECs. However, effective strategies to inhibit scar formation through multi&#8208;factor regulation of the scar microenvironment remain a challenge. Here, CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;macrophages (CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms) capable of targeting DPP4+ fibroblasts and modulating ECs subtype within the scar microenvironment are engineered to effectively prevent scarring. Hydrogel microporous microneedles (mMNs) are employed to deliver CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms, which can effectively alleviate scar. Single&#8208;cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) analysis reveals that CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms can modify ECs fibrotic phenotype and regulate fibrosis by suppressing the profibrotic gene leucine&#8208;rich&#8208;alpha&#8208;2&#8208;glycoprotein 1 (Lrg1). In vitro experiments further demonstrate that CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms improve the scar microenvironment by phagocytosing DPP4+ fibroblasts and suppressing TGF&#946; secretion. This, in turn, inhibits the phenotypic conversion of LRG1 ECs and provides multifactorial way of alleviating scars. This study uncovers the evidence that mMNs attached to CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms may exert vital influences on skin scarring through the regulation of the skin scar microenvironment, providing a promising approach for treating posttraumatic scarring.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Healing, Flowable, Yet Solid Electrolyte Suppresses Li&#8208;Metal Morphological Instabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries encounter challenges including dendrite penetration, electrode&#8211;electrolyte delamination, and void/crack formation. Here, by deploying a novel composite electrolyte system comprising nonconstrained ceramics within dynamic polymers, self&#8208;healing capability, flowability, and solid properties are successfully integrated into one material. Utilizing this electrolyte, the Li0&#8208;NMC811 full cell demonstrates stable operation at high current density (5 mA cm&#8722;2) for 1100 cycles.








Abstract
Lithium metal (Li0) solid&#8208;state batteries encounter implementation challenges due to dendrite formation, side reactions, and movement of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface in cycling. Notably, voids and cracks formed during battery fabrication/operation are hot spots for failure. Here, a self&#8208;healing, flowable yet solid electrolyte composed of mobile ceramic crystals embedded in a reconfigurable polymer network is reported. This electrolyte can auto&#8208;repair voids and cracks through a two&#8208;step self&#8208;healing process that occurs at a fast rate of 5.6&#160;&#181;m h&#8722;1. A dynamical phase diagram is generated, showing the material can switch between liquid and solid forms in response to external strain rates. The flowability of the electrolyte allows it to accommodate the electrode volume change during Li0 stripping. Simultaneously, the electrolyte maintains a solid form with high tensile strength (0.28&#160;MPa), facilitating the regulation of mossy Li0 deposition. The chemistries and kinetics are studied by operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray and in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Solid&#8208;state NMR reveals a dual&#8208;phase ion conduction pathway and rapid Li+ diffusion through the stable polymer&#8208;ceramic interphase. This designed electrolyte exhibits extended cycling life in Li0&#8211;Li0 cells, reaching 12&#160;000 h at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 5000 h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, owing to its high critical current density of 9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the Li0&#8211;LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) full cell demonstrates stable cycling at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 1100 cycles, retaining 88% of its capacity, even under near&#8208;zero stack pressure conditions.

         <title>Pulling the Rug Out from Under: Biomechanical Microenvironment Remodeling for Induction of Hepatic Stellate Cell Quiescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In HSCs, PPNH&#8208;LQs trigger ascorbic acid oxidation and LOXL2 expression inhibition (Gear I). These effects impair processes of collagen I hydroxylation and enzyme&#8208;mediated crosslinking, leading to the impeded deposition and crosslinking of collagen I (Gear II). Consequently, the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment can be remodeled and subsequently induce HSC quiescence, which facilitates the reversal of hepatic fibrosis (Gear III).








Abstract
Hepatic fibrosis progresses concomitantly with a variety of biomechanical alternations, especially increased liver stiffness. These biomechanical alterations have long been considered as pathological consequences. Recently, growing evidence proposes that these alternations result in the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment, which drives the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Here, an inorganic ascorbic acid&#8208;oxidase (AAO) mimicking nanozyme loaded with liquiritigenin (LQ) is developed to trigger remodeling of the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment. The AAO mimicking nanozyme is able to consume intracellular ascorbic acid, thereby impeding collagen I deposition by reducing its availability. Simultaneously, LQ inhibits the transcription of lysyl oxidase like 2 (LOXL2), thus impeding collagen I crosslinking. Through its synergistic activities, the prepared nanosystem efficiently restores the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment to a near&#8208;normal physiological condition, promoting the quiescence of HSCs and regression of fibrosis. This strategy of remodeling the fibrotic biomechanical microenvironment, akin to &#8220;pulling the rug out from under&#8221;, effectively treats hepatic fibrosis in mice, thereby highlighting the importance of tissue biomechanics and providing a potential approach to improve hepatic fibrosis treatment.

         <title>3D Soft Architectures for Stretchable Thermoelectric Wearables with Electrical Self&#8208;Healing and Damage Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;printed soft multifunctional composites enhance thermoelectric energy conversion by 70%. These stretchable thermoelectric generators exhibit exceptional structural robustness and damage tolerance, with 230% stretchability and functionality maintained even after being damaged by sharp objects and strained for thousands of cycles. Their 3D architecture also enables sufficient energy harvesting from body heat to power LEDs and wearable sensors at room temperature.








Abstract
Flexible thermoelectric devices (TEDs) exhibit adaptability to curved surfaces, holding significant potential for small&#8208;scale power generation and thermal management. However, they often compromise stretchability, energy conversion, or robustness, thus limiting their applications. Here, the implementation of 3D soft architectures, multifunctional composites, self&#8208;healing liquid metal conductors, and rigid semiconductors is introduced to overcome these challenges. These TEDs are extremely stretchable, functioning at strain levels as high as 230%. Their unique design, verified through multiphysics simulations, results in a considerably high power density of 115.4&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8315;2 at a low&#8208;temperature gradient of 10&#160;&#176;C. This is achieved through 3D printing multifunctional elastomers and examining the effects of three distinct thermal insulation infill ratios (0%, 12%, and 100%) on thermoelectric energy conversion and structural integrity. The engineered structure is lighter and effectively maintains the temperature gradient across the thermoelectric semiconductors, thereby resulting in higher output voltage and improved heating and cooling performance. Furthermore, these thermoelectric generators show remarkable damage tolerance, remaining fully functional even after multiple punctures and 2000 stretching cycles at 50% strain. When integrated with a 3D&#8208;printed heatsink, they can power wearable sensors, charge batteries, and illuminate LEDs by scavenging body heat at room temperature, demonstrating their application as self&#8208;sustainable electronics.

         <title>Triggering Reversible Intercalation&#8208;Conversion Combined Chemistry for High&#8208;Energy&#8211;Density Lithium Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing both intercalation and conversion mechanisms within a single phase represents an optimal approach for achieving high energy density in cathode materials. For the purposes of reversible operation and achieving a high redox voltage, the amorphization process is proposed as a strategic design method for cathode materials. The influence of amorphization on electrode materials is meticulously confirmed in thermodynamics and kinetics.








Abstract
Combining intercalation and conversion reactions maximizes the utilization of redox&#8208;active elements in electrodes, providing a means for overcoming the current capacity ceiling. However, integrating both mechanisms within a single electrode material presents significant challenges owing to their contrasting structural requirements. Intercalation requires a well&#8208;defined host structure for efficient lithium&#8208;ion diffusion, whereas conversion reactions entail structural reorganization, which can undermine intercalation capabilities. Based on the previous study that successfully demonstrated reversible intercalation&#8211;conversion chemistry in amorphous LiFeSO4F, this study aims to provide an in&#8208;depth understanding on how this can be enabled. Experimental and theoretical investigations of a model system based on tavorite&#8208;structured LiFeSO4F revealed that amorphization governs the activation and reversibility of the combined reactions. Enhanced reversibility is achieved through the facile migration of transition metals within the amorphous matrix. Unexpectedly, it is found that amorphization also narrowed the voltage gap between the intercalation and conversion reactions. This voltage&#8208;gap reduction is explained by the thermodynamic metastability of the amorphous phase. The applicability of the approach to other intercalation hosts is further demonstrated, showing that amorphization enables reversible intercalation and conversion. These findings suggest a new strategy that leverages the full potential of intercalation and conversion reactions, introducing new avenues for cathode design.

         <title>Unlocking Intracellular Protein Delivery by Harnessing Polymersomes Synthesized at Microliter Volumes using Photo&#8208;PISA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient intracellular delivery of therapeutic proteins is challenging due to poor cell membrane permeation and endolysosomal entrapment. An oxygen tolerant Photo&#8208;PISA process is reported for the microliter&#8208;scale synthesis of polymersomes that deliver proteins into the cytosol and activate antigen&#8208;presenting cells. This high throughput approach is a highly promising strategy for the screening of early&#8208;stage therapeutic proteins and vaccine antigen candidates.








Abstract
Efficient delivery of therapeutic proteins and vaccine antigens to intracellular targets is challenging due to generally poor cell membrane permeation and endolysosomal entrapment causing degradation. Herein, these challenges are addressed by developing an oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoinitiated polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (Photo&#8208;PISA) process, allowing for the microliter&#8208;scale (10&#160;&#181;L) synthesis of protein&#8208;loaded polymersomes directly in 1536&#8208;well plates. High&#8208;resolution techniques capable of analysis at a single particle level are employed to analyze protein encapsulation and release mechanisms. Using confocal microscopy and super&#8208;resolution stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) imaging, their ability to deliver proteins into the cytosol following endosomal escape is subsequently visualized. Lastly, the adaptability of these polymersomes is exploited to encapsulate and deliver a prototype vaccine antigen, demonstrating its ability to activate antigen&#8208;presenting cells and support antigen cross&#8208;presentation for applications in subunit vaccines and cancer immunotherapy. This combination of ultralow volume synthesis and efficient intracellular delivery holds significant promise for unlocking the high throughput screening of a broad range of otherwise cost&#8208;prohibitive or early&#8208;stage therapeutic protein and vaccine antigen candidates that can be difficult to obtain in large quantities. The versatility of this platform for rapid screening of intracellular protein delivery can result in significant advancements across the fields of nanomedicine and biomedical engineering.

         <title>Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte in Li&#8208;Mediated Nitrogen Reduction for Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates LHCE (localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte) as an effective electrolyte engineering strategy to enhance the efficiency of the Li&#8208;NRR process.








Abstract
The lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction reaction (Li&#8208;NRR) is a promising green alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for ammonia synthesis. The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for high efficiency and stability, as it regulates reactant diffusion and suppresses side reactions. The SEI properties are greatly influenced by the Li+ ion solvation structure, which is controllable through electrolyte engineering. Although anion&#8208;derived SEI enhances selectivity and stability, it has typically been engineered using high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (HCEs), which face mass transfer, viscosity, and cost issues. In this study, a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) in the Li&#8208;NRR is first introduced, enabling the formation of anion&#8208;derived SEI in a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LCE) by enhancing the Li&#8211;anion coordination using an antisolvent. Among various antisolvents, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE) achieves the highest ammonia Faradaic efficiency (73.6 &#177; 2.5%), more than double that of the LCE (34.3 &#177; 2.8%) and exceeding the HCE (56.0 &#177; 2.8%). Systematic calculations and experimental analyses show that the LHCE exhibits anion&#8208;rich solvation structures and forms&#160;thin, inorganic SEI. Moreover, the LHCE has advantages of low viscosity and high N2 solubility, which facilitate mass transport. This study suggests the application of LHCE as an effective electrolyte engineering strategy to enhance the Li&#8208;NRR efficiency.

High&#8208;performance silk fibers, with their eco&#8208;friendly degradability and renewability, have long captivated researchers as an alternative to synthetic fibers. Spider dragline silk, renowned for its exceptional strength (&gt;1 GPa), has an extremely low yield, hindering its widespread use. While domesticated silkworms (Bombyx mori) can produce silk fibers industrially, their moderate strength (&#8776;0.5 GPa) pales in comparison to the formidable spider dragline silk. In this study, naturally produced strong silkworm silk fibers are reported with a tensile strength of &#8776;1.2 GPa achieved through combining feeding carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to silkworms and in situ forced reeling for alignment. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the interaction between the CNTs and silk fibroin, while the forced reeling process aligns these reinforcing fillers and the silk fibroin &#946;&#8208;sheet nanocrystals along the fiber axis. Structural analysis reveals a significant enhancement in the content and alignment of &#946;&#8208;sheet nanocrystals within the silk fibers, accounting for their superior mechanical properties, including tensile strength of &#8776;1.2 GPa and Young's modulus of 24.4 GPa, surpassing various types of silkworm silk and spider silk. This advancement addresses the historical trade&#8208;off between the strength and scalability of silk, potentially paving the way for eco&#8208;friendly, biodegradable, and renewable alternatives to synthetic fibers in a variety of applications.

&lt;p&gt;A natural silkworm silk exhibiting strength of &#8776;1.2 GPa, on par with spider silk, has been developed through the integration of carbon nanotube feeding and in situ forced reeling. This method significantly enhances the &#946;-sheet nanocrystal content and alignment within silk, resulting in notable mechanical improvements. This work presents a scalable and eco-friendly approach for producing high-strength natural fibers.

         <title>Efficient Electroluminescence from Organic Fluorophore&#8208;Containing Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In light&#8208;emitting diodes using an organic fluorophore&#8208;containing 2D perovskite as the emitter, carrier transport, and exciton formation take place in the metal halide sheets. Then, the bright triplet excitons formed in the metal halide sheets are transferred to singlet states of the organic fluorophores. With these processes, efficient electroluminescence is observed from the organic fluorophores inside the perovskite.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional perovskites containing an organic fluorophore can be a unique emitter for light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of fluorophore&#8208;containing perovskite LEDs reported thus far are still very low. In this study, these are able to boost the EQE to &#8776;10% by choosing an organic fluorophore with appropriate energy levels for the perovskite structure organization. In the fluorophore&#8208;containing perovskite LEDs, carrier transport and exciton formation take place in the perovskite's metal halide framework, thereby avoiding the direct formation of nonradiative triplet excitons on the organic fluorophores. Subsequently, the bright triplet excitons formed in the metal halide framework are transferred to form the radiative singlet states of the organic fluorophores, leading to efficient electroluminescence (EL) from the organic fluorophores regularly dispersed inside the perovskite structure. Unexpectedly higher light&#8208;outcoupling efficiency, which is caused by the light scattering in the polycrystalline perovskite layer, will be another reason for efficient EL. These findings will contribute toward the fabrication of LED&#8208;based products with high performance at a low cost.

         <title>Highly Reversible Zn Anode Design Through Oriented ZnO(002) Facets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnO(002) lattice plane with low lattice mismatch to Zn(002) endows fast ion diffusion, high Coulombic efficiency, and uniform Zn deposition, while ZnO(100) plane tends to exacerbate dendrite growth and provoke unwanted side reactions compared to bare Zn. Therefore, ZnO(002) protection layer on Zn realizes more stable performance for Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The practical implementation of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries presents formidable hurdles, including uncontrolled dendrite growth, water&#8208;induced side reactions, suboptimal Zn metal utilization, and intricate Zn anode manufacturing. Here, large&#8208;scale construction of a highly oriented ZnO(002) lattice plane on Zn anode (ZnO(002)@Zn) with thermodynamic inertia and kinetic zincophilicity is designed to address such problems. Both theoretical calculations and experiment results elucidate that the ZnO(002)@Zn possesses high Zn chemical affinity, hydrogen evolution reaction suppression, and dendrite&#8208;free deposition ability due to the abundant lattice oxygen species in ZnO(002) and its low lattice mismatch with Zn(002). These features synergistically promote ion transport and enable homogeneous Zn deposition. Consequently, the ZnO(002)@Zn anode displays a stable and prolonged cycling lifespan exceeding 500&#160;h even under a larger depth of discharge (85.6%) and realizes an impressive average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7%. Moreover, its efficacy is also evident in V2O5&#8208;cathode coin cells and pouch cells with not only high discharge capacity but also exceptional cycling stability. This integrated approach presents a promising avenue for addressing the challenges associated with Zn metal anodes, thereby advancing the prospects of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery technologies.

         <title>Efficient and Ultrastable Seawater Electrolysis at Industrial Current Density with Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction and Dual Cl&#8722;&#8208;Repelling Layers</title>

Introducing a novel Os&#8208;Ni4Mo/MoO2 micropillar catalyst with strong metal&#8208;support interaction, this work presents a high&#8208;performance bifunctional electrocatalyst for seawater electrolysis. It highlights the innovative dual Cl&#8722;&#8208;repelling layer to suppress chloride oxidation, significantly enhancing stability and catalytic activity, representing a revolutionary advancement in catalyst development for seawater electrolysis.








Abstract
Direct seawater electrolysis is emerging as a promising renewable energy technology for large&#8208;scale hydrogen generation. The development of Os&#8208;Ni4Mo/MoO2 micropillar arrays with strong metal&#8208;support interaction (MSI) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for seawater electrolysis is reported. The micropillar structure enhances electron and mass transfer, extending catalytic reaction steps and improving seawater electrolysis efficiency. Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the strong MSI between Os and Ni4Mo/MoO2 optimizes the surface electronic structure of the catalyst, reducing the reaction barrier and thereby improving catalytic activity. Importantly, for the first time, a dual Cl&#8722; repelling layer is constructed by electrostatic force to safeguard active sites against Cl&#8722; attack during seawater oxidation. This includes a strong Os&#9472;Cl adsorption and an in situ&#8208;formed MoO42&#8722; layer. As a result, the Os&#8208;Ni4Mo/MoO2 catalyst exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 113 and 336&#160;mV to reach 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for HER and OER in natural seawater from the South China Sea (without purification, with 1&#160;m KOH added). Notably, it demonstrates superior stability, degrading only 0.37 &#181;V h&#8722;1 after 2500 h of seawater oxidation, significantly surpassing the technical target of 1.0 &#181;V h&#8722;1 set by the United States Department of Energy.

         <title>Boolean Computation in Single&#8208;Transistor Neuron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates an in situ reconfigurable &#8220;computing neuron&#8221; prototype with wafer&#8208;scale fabrication distinguished from a widespread collapsed integrator artificial neuron. The ambipolar nature can be further adapted to construct highly efficient soft&#8208;XOR&#8208;based neural networks.








Abstract
Brain neurons exhibit far more sophisticated and powerful information&#8208;processing capabilities than the simple integrators commonly modeled in neuromorphic computing. A biological neuron can in fact efficiently perform Boolean algebra, including linear nonseparable operations. Traditional logic circuits require more than a dozen transistors combined as NOT, AND, and OR gates to implement XOR. Lacking biological competency, artificial neural networks require multilayered solutions to exercise XOR operation. Here, it is shown that a single&#8208;transistor neuron, harnessing the intrinsic ambipolarity of graphene and ionic filamentary dynamics, can enable in situ reconfigurable multiple Boolean operations from linear separable to linear nonseparable in an ultra&#8208;compact design. By leveraging the spatiotemporal integration of inputs, bio&#8208;realistic spiking&#8208;dependent Boolean computation is fully realized, rivaling the efficiency of a human brain. Furthermore, a soft&#8208;XOR&#8208;based neural network via algorithm&#8208;hardware co&#8208;design, showcasing substantial performance improvement, is demonstrated. These results demonstrate how the artificial neuron, in the ultra&#8208;compact form of a single transistor, may function as a powerful platform for Boolean operations. These findings are anticipated to be a starting point for implementing more sophisticated computations at the individual transistor neuron level, leading to super&#8208;scalable neural networks for resource&#8208;efficient brain&#8208;inspired information processing.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain neurons exhibit far more sophisticated and powerful information-processing capabilities than the simple integrators commonly modeled in neuromorphic computing. A biological neuron can in fact efficiently perform Boolean algebra, including linear nonseparable operations. Traditional logic circuits require more than a dozen transistors combined as NOT, AND, and OR gates to implement XOR. Lacking biological competency, artificial neural networks require multilayered solutions to exercise XOR operation. Here, it is shown that a single-transistor neuron, harnessing the intrinsic ambipolarity of graphene and ionic filamentary dynamics, can enable in situ reconfigurable multiple Boolean operations from linear separable to linear nonseparable in an ultra-compact design. By leveraging the spatiotemporal integration of inputs, bio-realistic spiking-dependent Boolean computation is fully realized, rivaling the efficiency of a human brain. Furthermore, a soft-XOR-based neural network via algorithm-hardware co-design, showcasing substantial performance improvement, is demonstrated. These results demonstrate how the artificial neuron, in the ultra-compact form of a single transistor, may function as a powerful platform for Boolean operations. These findings are anticipated to be a starting point for implementing more sophisticated computations at the individual transistor neuron level, leading to super-scalable neural networks for resource-efficient brain-inspired information processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Responsive Magnetic Particle Imaging Tracer: Overcoming &#8220;Always&#8208;On&#8221; Limitation, Eliminating Interference, and Ensuring Safety in Adaptive Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This responsive MPI tracer for subtraction&#8208;enhanced MPI imaging, accurate molecular imaging, and environment&#8208;adaptive therapy, offers the potential to maximize therapeutic outcomes and minimize side effects. This technique effectively eliminates interference signals originating from non&#8208;specific liver uptake.








Abstract
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) has emerged as a novel technology utilizing superparamagnetic nanoparticles as tracers, essential for disease diagnosis and treatment guidance in preclinical animal models. Unlike other modalities, MPI provides high sensitivity, deep tissue penetration, and no signal attenuation. However, existing MPI tracers suffer from &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; signals, which complicate organ&#8208;specific imaging and hinder accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a responsive MPI tracer using pH&#8208;responsive PdFe alloy particles coated with a gatekeeper polymer. This tracer exhibits pH&#8208;sensitive Fe release and modulation of the MPI signal, enabling selective imaging with a higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and intratumoral pH quantification. Notably, this responsive tracer facilitates subtraction&#8208;enhanced MPI imaging, effectively eliminating interference from liver uptake and expanding the scope of abdominal imaging. Additionally, the tracer employs a dual&#8208;function mechanism for adaptive cancer therapy, combining pH&#8208;switchable enzyme&#8208;like catalysis with dual&#8208;key co&#8208;activation of ROS generation, and Pd skeleton that scavenges free radicals to minimize Fe&#8208;related toxicity. This advancement promises to significantly expand MPI's applicability in diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring, marking a leap forward in imaging technology.

         <title>A Metalgel with Liquid Metal Continuum Immobilized in Polymer Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a new liquid metal&#8208;polymer gel material termed &#8220;metalgel&#8221;. The 92.40% vol interconnected liquid metal expands throughout the whole volume of 3D polymer networks with polymer domain size down to nanometer scale. Liquid metal is stably immobilized in metalgel via electrostatic interactions. Metalgel exhibits ultrahigh electrical conductivity (up to 3.18 &#215; 106 S&#183;m&#8722;1) and tissue&#8208;like softness (Young's modulus as low as 70 kPa).








Abstract
Gels are formed by fluids that expand throughout the whole volume of 3D polymer networks. To unlock unprecedented properties, exploring new fluids immobilized in polymer networks is crucial. Here, a new liquid metal&#8208;polymer gel material termed &#8220;metalgel&#8221; is introduced via fluid replacement strategy, featuring 92.40%&#160;vol liquid metal fluid as a continuum immobilized by interconnected nanoscale polymer network. The unique structure endows metalgel with high electrical conductivity (up to 3.18&#160;&#215;&#160;106 S&#183;m&#8210;1), tissue&#8208;like softness (Young's modulus as low as 70&#160;kPa), and low gas permeability (4.50&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8210;22&#160;m2&#183;s&#8210;1&#183;Pa&#8210;1). Besides, metalgel demonstrates electrical stability under extreme deformations, such as being run over by a 4.5&#8208;metric&#8208;tonne truck, and maintains its integrity in various environments for up to 180 days. The immobilization of high&#8208;volume&#8208;fraction liquid metal fluid is realized by electrostatic interactions is further revealed. Potential applications for metalgel are diverse and include soft electromagnetic shielding, hermetic sealing, and stimulating/sensing electrodes in implantable bioelectronics, underscoring its broad applicability.

         <title>Instantaneous Tiltmeter Triggered by Dynamic Wetting Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic motion of liquid metal in a wheat awn modeled microchannel induces high precision tiltmeter, which realizes surface topography scanning after being equipped with three dimensions platform.








Abstract
A novel instantaneous tiltmeter with dynamic and static monitoring functions is reported that is based on liquid metal dynamic wetting behavior in a bio&#8208;fabricated anisotropic microchannel. The proposed system achieves instantaneous tiltmeter functionality, offering a broad detection range (&#8722;90&#176;&#8211;90&#176;) with high precision (0.05&#176;), a rapid reaction time (0.11 s), and enhanced durability. Moreover, a seamless integration has enabled water wave detection, language programming, and human limb monitoring. Especially, the integration of tiltmeter and a 3D motion platform results in a surface structure scanning system capable of effectively performing large area (&gt;200 cm2) and height difference scanning functions. This innovative approach holds great potential for transformative changes in the fields of advanced manufacturing, flexible robotics, and the flexible sensing, further facilitating widespread adoption.

Cross&#8208;linked poly(ether&#8208;urethane) solid&#8208;state electrolytes covalently interconnected with amino&#8208;modified Zr&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs and poly(ethylene glycol) provides a high&#8208;speed transmission of Li+ ions. The ether/ketonic&#8208;oxygen and Lewis&#8208;acid sites contribute to a high ionic conductivity (5.7 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1) and Li+ transference number (0.84). A 1.5 Ah pouch cell with an areal capacity of &#8776;4 mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 delivers a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density of 446&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Utilizing solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) in high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;metal batteries is a promising strategy for achieving high energy density and safety. However, the SPEs face the challenges such as undesirable mechanical strength, low ionic conductivity and incompatible high&#8208;voltage interface. Here, a novel crosslinked poly(ether&#8208;urethane)&#8208;based SPE with a molecular cross&#8208;linked structure is fabricated to create high&#8208;throughput Li+ transport pathway. The amino&#8208;modified Zr&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (ZrMOF) are introduced as multisite cross&#8208;linking nodes and polymer chain extenders. The abundant ether/ketonic&#8208;oxygen and Lewis acid sites in the SPE achieve high Li+ conductivity (5.7 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C) and Li+ transference number (0.84). The interpenetrating cross&#8208;linked structure of SPE with robust mechanical strength results in a record cycle life of 8000&#160;h in Li||Li symmetric cell. The high structural stability of ZrMOF and abundant electron&#8208;withdrawing urethane/ureido groups in the SPE with high oxidation potential (5.1&#160;V) enables a discharge capacity of 182 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.3 C over 500 cycles in a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||Li cell. Remarkably, a high energy density of 446&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in a 1.5&#8208;Ah pouch cell is obtained with high loading cathode (&#8776;4 mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), demonstrating a great prospect of the current SPE for practical application in solid&#8208;state, high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;metal batteries.

The high structural stability of ZrMOF and abundant electron-withdrawing urethane/ureido groups in the SPE with high oxidation potential (5.1&#160;V) enables a discharge capacity of 182 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.3 C over 500 cycles in a LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||Li cell. Remarkably, a high energy density of 446&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in a 1.5-Ah pouch cell is obtained with high loading cathode (&#8776;4 mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), demonstrating a great prospect of the current SPE for practical application in solid-state, high-voltage Li-metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Semiconductor Device Enabling Optoelectronic Detection and Neuromorphic Processing with Extended Spectral Responsivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance dual&#8208;mode device is developed using a PbS/Si hybrid heterojunction with an ultra&#8208;thin Al2O3 passivation layer, enabling both optoelectronic detection and neuromorphic operation. In mode 1, it achieves ultra&#8208;wide spectral response and reproduces high&#8208;quality 256&#160;&#215;&#160;256 pixel images. In mode 2, it acts as a neuromorphic device, achieving 96.5% accuracy in classifying standard digits.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance semiconductor devices capable of multiple functions are pivotal in meeting the challenges of miniaturization and integration in advanced technologies. Despite the inherent difficulties of incorporating dual functionality within a single device, a high&#8208;performance, dual&#8208;mode device is reported. This device integrates an ultra&#8208;thin Al2O3 passivation layer with a PbS/Si hybrid heterojunction, which can simultaneously enable optoelectronic detection and neuromorphic operation. In mode 1, the device efficiently separates photo&#8208;generated electron&#8208;hole pairs, exhibiting an ultra&#8208;wide spectral response from ultraviolet (265&#160;nm) to near&#8208;infrared (1650&#160;nm) wavelengths. It also reproduces high&#8208;quality images of 256&#160;&#215;&#160;256 pixels, achieving a Q&#8208;value as low as 0.00437&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a light intensity of 8.58&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2. Meanwhile, when in mode 2, the as&#8208;assembled device with typical persistent photoconductivity (PPC) behavior can act as a neuromorphic device, which can achieve 96.5% accuracy in classifying standard digits underscoring its efficacy in temporal information processing. It is believed that the present dual&#8208;function devices potentially advance the multifunctionality and miniaturization of chips for intelligence applications.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Mediated Organic Neurohybrid Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic artificial synapse interacts with non&#8208;electroactive neurotransmitters present in the central nervous system by exploiting key electroactive species (i.e., H2O2) produced by neurotransmitter&#8208;specific enzymatic reactions as synaptic modulator in an electrochemical neruomorphic organic device. This enzyme&#8208;mediated neurohybrid synapse can mimic biological learning&#8208;forgetting processes, showing a faster learning phase once previously learned information is forgotten compared to the initial learning stage.








Abstract
The development of organic artificial synapses that exhibit biomimicry features also may enable a more seamless integration of neuroelectronic devices in the nervous system, allowing artificial neuromodulation to be perceived as natural behavior by neuronal cells. Nevertheless, the capability to interact with both electroactive and non&#8208;electroactive neurotransmitters remains a challenge since state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices mainly rely on the oxidation of electroactive species. Here, the study proposes an organic artificial synapse engineered to enable interaction with non&#8208;electroactive species present in the central nervous system. By integrating a conductive polymeric film functionalized with platinum nanoparticles, the device can catalyze the oxidation of electroactive molecules (i.e., H2O2) resulting from neurotransmitter&#8208;specific enzymatic reactions following an enzymatic functionalization, therefore exhibiting neuromorphic functions driven by non&#8208;electroactive neurotransmitters. The creation of devices that can interact with or monitor these neurotransmitters can be seen as a significant step toward innovative technologies to expand the understanding of the mechanisms underlying neurological disorders and the development of novel, more effective treatments for them.

         <title>Peripheral Substitution Engineering of MR&#8208;TADF Emitters Embedded With B&#8210;N Covalent Bond Towards Efficient BT.2020 Blue Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a novel B&#8211;N embedded framework, a peripheral substitution engineering has been proposed to afford ultrapure blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters, revealing a record&#8208;high EQE of 20.3%, a narrow FWHM of 20&#160;nm and CIE coordinates of (0.152, 0.046) that align with the BT.2020 blue standard.








Abstract
Compared with the classical boron/nitrogen (B/N) doped ones, multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters embedded with B&#8211;N covalent bond behave a significantly blue&#8208;shifted narrowband TADF, and thus show a greater potential in ultrapure blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). As a proof of concept, herein a peripheral substitution engineering is demonstrated based on such a B&#8210;N embedded parent core. The simple approach is found to ensure easy synthesis via a one&#8208;pot lithium&#8208;free borylation&#8208;annulation, manipulate the excited states through different electronic coupling between core and substituent, and introduce the steric hindrance to minimize the unwanted spectral broadening. Impressively, ultrapure blue OLEDs are realized to give a high external quantum efficiency of 20.3% together with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.152, 0.046). The performance is well competent with those of B/N doped MR&#8208;TADF emitters, clearly highlighting that the B&#8210;N embedded framework is a novel promising paradigm towards efficient BT.2020 blue standard.

         <title>A High&#8208;Voltage n&#8208;type Organic Cathode Materials Enabled by Tetraalkylammonium Complexing Agents for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;voltage n&#8208;type organic electrode material featuring hexacyano&#8208;substituted cyclopropane dianion (CpCN62&#8211;) is reported. By leveraging the common&#8208;ion effect of tetrabutylammonium (TBA) cation in the electrolyte, the TBA salt of CpCN62&#8211; exhibits reversible two&#8208;electron redox process at 1.43 V discharge potential with stable long&#8208;term cycling, underscoring its potential as a high&#8208;performance and sustainable organic cathode material.








Abstract
Tetrabutylammonium (TBA) salt of hexacyano&#8208;substituted cyclopropane dianion (Cp(CN)62&#8722;) is prepared through a facile two&#8208;step synthetic protocol from commercially available materials and fully characterized as a high&#8208;voltage n&#8208;type organic cathode in rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). The addition of tetrabutylammonium triflate (TBAOTf)&#160;to the electrolyte mitigates dissolution issues, leading to enhanced cycling stability. Remarkably, the Cp(CN)62&#8722; cathode demonstrates a high discharge voltage of 1.43&#160;V in AZIBs and retains 85% of its capacity after 1000 cycles at a high loading of 10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and a cycling rate of 10C. These results, combined with spectroscopic analyses, elucidate a reversible two&#8208;electron redox process of Cp(CN)62&#8722; facilitated by the insertion/de&#8208;insertion of TBA cation. These findings underscore the potential of Cp(CN)62&#8722; as a conversion&#8208;based n&#8208;type cathode in energy storage applications.

         <title>Internal Capsulation Via Self&#8208;Cross&#8208;linking and &#960;&#8208;Effects Achieves Highly Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an internal encapsulation strategy utilizing the synergistic effect of in situ cross&#8208;linking and &#960;&#8208;effects, achieving an upgrade of the protective layer from linear to mesh&#8208;like coverage. The internal encapsulated device exhibits an enhanced efficiency of 25.31 % and noticeably improved stability.








Abstract
Pursuing high stability becomes the core challenge in realizing the widespread application of perovskite solar cells (PerSCs). Here, a practical internal&#8208;capsulation strategy is proposed by introducing cross&#8208;linkable methacrylate analogs upon the perovskite layer, hindering ion migration and preventing lead leakage to achieve stable PerSCs. Butyl methacrylate (UMA) and benzyl methacrylate (BMA) can chemically interact with the perovskite layer, especially for the BMA dimer with significant &#960;&#8208;interactions among the hanging benzene rings. Such configuration facilitated more compact coordination, thereby restoring the Fermi level of perovskite to a defect&#8208;free state and reducing carrier recombination losses. Moreover, by integrating the self&#8208;cross&#8208;linking and intermolecular &#960;&#8208;effect, the application of BMA upgraded the internal capsulation from linear protection to a compact mesh&#8208;like scale. Consequently, the application of BMA not only boosted the efficiency to 25.31% but also greatly enhanced the stability of the perovskite layer, especially for water resistance and preventing lead linkage. The internal capsulation strategy upgrading from linear to mesh&#8208;like marked an innovative direction in protecting the perovskite layer, paving the way for more sustainable PerSCs in further application.

         <title>Eradication of Large Tumors by Nanoscale Drug Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale self&#8208;assemblies constructed from Ce6 and mitoxantrone through hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction, and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking achieve photodynamic, photothermal, chemotherapy, and subsequently immunotherapy, under a single laser irradiation, to eradicate large tumors and prevent recurrence in various tumor models. The easy preparation, simple treatment process, and excellent therapeutic effect make this formulation a promising potential for clinical translation.








Abstract
Most patients with cancer are first diagnosed at an advanced disease stage, when tumors are already large and/or metastases are present. This circumstance has a negative impact on the prognosis and therapeutic effect of anticancer drugs. In this study, it is demonstrated that photosensitizer chlorin e6 and the photochemotherapy drug mitoxantrone self&#8208;assemble into relatively stable nanoassemblies (CM NAs) through hydrogen&#8208;bonding effect, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and hydrophobic interactions. Administration of CM NAs in combination with 660&#160;nm laser irradiation shows chemotherapeutic, photothermal, and photodynamic effects, causing tumor cell apoptosis and pyroptosis and enabling noninvasive tumor ablation without compromising the surrounding normal tissue. More importantly, treatment with CM NAs increases tumor immunogenicity, leading to a strong and long&#8208;term antitumor immune response that eradicates large tumors and provides long&#8208;term protection against tumor recurrence on various tumor models.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Lifetime Probe for Detecting Intramolecular Noncovalent Interaction in Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular noncovalent interactions boost the device performance in the optoelectronic field, but cannot be directly detected in organic semiconductor films thus far. Spin lifetime as a probe to detect intramolecular noncovalent interaction is innovatively used since it can influence the spin&#8208;orbit coupling strength and thus modulate the spin lifetime. This work will significantly advance the interdisciplinary research of organic spintronics and electronics.








Abstract
Intramolecular noncovalent interaction (INCI), a crucial strategy for effectively enhancing molecular planarity and extending &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization in organic semiconductors (OSCs), has played an increasingly important role in optoelectronic applications. However, though the INCI formation is regularly considered to improve the device performance by literature, there is no feasible approach to directly and reliably characterizing its formation in practical&#8208;OSC films thus far. Here in this study, by theoretical analysis and calculation, the generation of INCIs in OSCs is found, normally consisting of relatively heavy elements, such as O&#183;&#183;&#183;Se, O&#183;&#183;&#183;S, N&#183;&#183;&#183;S interactions, etc., can induce enhanced strength of spin&#8208;orbit coupling, the primary factor dominating spin lifetime in OSCs. Based on this newly discovered theory, spin lifetime is creatively employed as a probe for sensitively detecting INCIs in OSC films via spin valves or field&#8208;induced electron paramagnetic resonance, respectively. This study will highly promote academic and applicable developments of the cross&#8208;cutting frontier research field between organic spintronics and electronics.

         <title>Supramolecular Polymer Additives as Repairable Reinforcements for Dynamic Covalent Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an innovative non&#8208;covalent reinforcement strategy for dynamic covalent networks (DCNs) using a supramolecular additive (S&#8208;T) that can depolymerize and reform on demand. Acting as both compatibilizer and filler, S&#8208;T improves mechanical properties while providing a tool to control processability, thus offering an alternative to traditional non&#8208;repairable reinforcements. 








Abstract
Employing rigid (in)organic materials as reinforcement for dynamic covalent networks (DCNs) is an effective approach to develop high&#8208;performance materials. Yet, recycling of these materials after failure often necessitates inefficient chemical reprocessing or inevitably alters their performance due to unrepairable inert components. Here, a non&#8208;covalent reinforcement strategy is presented by introducing a supramolecular additive to a DCN that can reversibly depolymerize and reform on demand, therefore acting as an adaptive and repairable reinforcement. The strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions in the supramolecular polymer of triazine&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tribenzenecarboxamide (S&#8208;T) strengthen the DCN at room temperature, while its non&#8208;covalent nature allows for easy one&#8208;pot reprocessing at high temperatures. Depending on wether S&#8208;T is covalently bond to the DCN or not, it can play either the role of compatibilizer or filler, providing a synthetic tool to control the relaxation dynamics, reprocessability and mechanical properties. Moreover, the S&#8208;T reinforcement can be chemically recovered with high yield and purity, showcasing the recyclability of the composite. This conceptually novel supramolecular reinforcement strategy with temperature&#8208;controlled dynamics highlights the potential of supramolecular polymer additives to replace conventional unrepairable reinforcements.

A novel host&#8208;guest system, wherein TPP&#8208;4C&#8208;BI is doped into TPP&#8208;4C&#8208;Cz crystals, is experimentally shown to enhance room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence quantum yields 10&#8208;fold. Groundbreaking visualization of typically undetectable guest molecules is achieved for the first time within the host crystal structure. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals a unique &#8220;sergeant&#8208;and&#8208;soldier&#8221; effect, where the guest molecules control the conformations of the host, significantly influencing crystal packing. This system also exhibits efficient triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer from host to guest, promoting improved radiative decay.








Abstract
Host&#8208;guest systems have emerged as an efficient strategy for promoting organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). Despite the advantages of doping guest molecules into a host matrix, the complexity of these systems and the lack of techniques to visualize host&#8208;guest interactions at the molecular scale pose significant challenges in understanding the underlying mechanisms. Here, a novel host&#8208;guest RTP system is developed by incorporating low concentrations (1&#8211;10 mol%) of TPP&#8208;4C&#8208;BI (guest) into crystalline TPP&#8208;4C&#8208;Cz (host). Utilizing structural isomerism, the guest molecules are regularly incorporated into the host crystal lattice, resulting in phosphorescence quantum yields almost ten times higher than the pure compounds. The system enabled resolution of the molecular packing of the single crystal through X&#8208;ray diffraction, providing unprecedented visualization of host&#8208;guest interactions. A &#8220;sergeant&#8208;and&#8208;soldier&#8221; effect, where the minority dopant molecules (sergeants) significantly influence the packing arrangement of the host molecules (soldiers), enhances RTP is identified. Further analyses revealed that due to the host molecule's inefficient phosphorescence pathway, its long&#8208;lived dark triplets are channeled to the guest via triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer (TTET), allowing the excited energy to radiatively decay more efficiently. These insights advance the understanding of RTP mechanisms and offer practical implications for designing high&#8208;efficiency phosphorescent materials.

This study presents VO&#8322;&#8208;based photothermoelectric near&#8208;infrared photodetectors showing electrode&#8208;dependent and tunable super&#8208;linear photoresponse with ultralow modulation bias. The device demonstrates an exceptional photocurrent on/off ratio and high detectivity. The electrode dependence, driven by the polarity difference in the Seebeck coefficient, is also elucidated. It is ideal for intensity&#8208;selective near&#8208;sensor processing and night vision pattern reorganization even with noisy inputs, making it a low&#8208;power and integrative technology for future smart edge sensors.








Abstract
Brain&#8208;like intelligence is ushering humanity into an era of the Internet of Perceptions (IoP), where the vast amounts of data generated by numerous sensing nodes pose significant challenges to transmission bandwidth and computing hardware. A recently proposed near&#8208;sensor computing architecture offers an effective solution to reduce data processing delays and energy consumption. However, a pressing need remains for innovative hardware with multifunctional near&#8208;sensor image processing capabilities. In this work, Mott material (vanadium dioxide)&#8208;based photothermoelectric near&#8208;infrared photodetectors are developed that exhibit electrode&#8208;dependent and tunable super&#8208;linear photoresponse (exponent &#945; &gt; 33) with ultralow modulation bias. These devices demonstrate an opto&#8208;thermo&#8208;electro&#8208;coupled phase transition, resulting in a large photocurrent on/off ratio (&gt;105), high responsivity (&#8776;500 A W&#8722;1), and well detectivity (&#8776;3.9&#160;&#215; 1012 Jones), all while maintaining rapid response speeds (&#964;r = 2 &#181;s and &#964;d = 5 &#181;s) under the bias of 1&#160;V. This electrode&#8208;dependent super&#8208;linear response is found to arise from the electron doping effect determined by the polarity of the Seebeck coefficient. Furthermore, the work showcases intensity&#8208;selective near&#8208;sensor processing and night vision pattern reorganization, even with noisy inputs. This work paves the way for developing near&#8208;sensor devices with potential applications in medical image preprocessing, flexible electronics, and intelligent edge sensing.

Through the meticulous design of a type&#8208;I heterojunction with a single&#8208;side barrier on the valence band and near&#8208;zero offset on the conduction band, the Sb2Te3/WSe2 heterojunction achieves the best&#8208;reported combined performance in light and gas detection. This enabled the development of the first visual&#8208;olfactory dual&#8208;mode sensor, boosting recognition accuracy of electric and fuel&#8208;powered vehicles from &#8776;50% to &#8776;96%.








Abstract
The design and fabrication of materials that can concurrently respond to light and gas within the dual&#8208;modal recognition domain present a significant challenge due to contradictory structural requirements. This innovative strategy introduces a type&#8208;I heterojunction, combining the properties of Sb2Te3 and WSe2 nanosheets, to overcome these obstacles. The heterojunction is prepared through a precise stacking approach to create a single&#8208;side barrier on the valence band and a near&#8208;zero offset on the conduction band. The resulting Sb2Te3/WSe2 heterojunction demonstrates unparalleled performance, showcasing the best integrated photoelectric and gas sensing performance in a single device to date. Based on the above features, the heterojunction successfully integrates visual and olfactory sensing performance, achieving the first biomimetic visual&#8208;olfactory dual&#8208;mode recognition in a single device. This simulation increased the accuracy of distinguishing electric and fuel&#8208;powered cars from &#8776;50% to &#8776;96%. This work introduces a novel approach to creating efficient, self&#8208;powered sensing materials, paving the way for next&#8208;generation biomimetic dual&#8208;model devices with broad applications in environmental protection, medical care, and other fields.

         <title>Plasmonic Supramolecular Nanozyme&#8208;Based Bio&#8208;Cockleburs for Synergistic Therapy of Infected Diabetic Wounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of the plasmonic&#8208;enhanced nanozyme catalysis and self&#8208;cascade reaction strategy is employed to construct a bimetallic nanozyme&#8208;based biomimetic nano&#8208;cocklebur (GNR@CeO2@GNPs) for diabetic wound healing. Experimental results demonstrate that this promising approach maximizes the utilization of endogenous hyperglycemia and oxidative stress for downregulating hyperglycemia, non&#8208;antibiotic antibacterial, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and accelerating skin regeneration.








Abstract
Diabetic wounds are a major devastating complication of diabetes due to hyperglycemia, bacterial invasion, and persistent inflammation, and the current antibiotic treatments can lead to the emergence of multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria. Herein, a bimetallic nanozyme&#8208;based biomimetic bio&#8208;cocklebur (GNR@CeO2@GNPs) is designed and synthesized for diabetic wound management by depositing spiky ceria (CeO2) shells and gold nanoparticles (GNPs) on a gold nanorod (GNR) nanoantenna. The plasmonic&#8208;enhanced nanozyme catalysis and self&#8208;cascade reaction properties simultaneously boost the two&#8208;step enzyme&#8208;mimicking catalytic activity of GNR@CeO2@GNPs, leading to a significant improvement in overall therapeutic efficacy rather than mere additive effects. Under the glucose activation and 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, GNR@CeO2@GNPs material captures photons and promotes the transfer of hot electrons from GNR and GNPs into CeO2, realizing a &#8220;butterfly effect&#8221; of consuming local glucose, overcoming the limited antibacterial efficiency of an individual PTT modality, and providing substantial reactive oxygen species. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate the material's exceptional antibacterial and antibiofilm properties against Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, which can reduce inflammation, promote collagen deposition, and facilitate angiogenesis, thereby accelerating wound healing. This study provides a promising new strategy to develop plasmonic&#8208;enhanced nanozymes with a catalytic cascade mode for the antibiotic&#8208;free synergistic treatment of infected diabetic wounds.

         <title>Light&#8208;Operated Diverse Logic Gates Enabled by Modulating Time&#8208;Dependent Fluorescence of Dissipative Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;fueled dissipative self&#8208;assembly systems with variable optical signals are achieved to realize diverse logic gates by modulating time&#8208;dependent fluorescence variations of the loaded fluorophores. It develops diverse light&#8208;operated logic gates, incorporating AND, and XOR operations, by utilizing the on/off irradiation wavelength of photoreaction and fluorescence excitation wavelength as optical inputs, while monitoring time&#8208;dependent changes in fluorescence as outputs.








Abstract
Light&#8208;fueled dissipative self&#8208;assembly possesses enormous potential in the field of optical information due to controllable time&#8208;dependent optical signals, but remains a great challenge for constructing intelligent light&#8208;operated logic circuits due to the limited availability of optical signal inputs and outputs. Herein, a series of light&#8208;fueled dissipative self&#8208;assembly systems with variable optical signals are reported to realize diverse logic gates by modulating time&#8208;dependent fluorescence variations of the loaded fluorophores. Three kinds of alkyl trimethylammonium homologs are employed to co&#8208;assemble with a merocyanine&#8208;based photoinduced amphiphile separately to construct a series of dissipative self&#8208;assemblies, showing unexpectedly different fluorescence control behaviors of loaded fluorophores during light irradiation and thermal relaxation processes. The opposite monotonicity of time&#8208;dependent emission intensity is achieved just by changing the excitation wavelength. Furthermore, by varying the types of trimethylammoniums and excitation wavelengths, a robust logic system is accomplished, integrating AND, XNOR, and XOR functions, which provides an effective pathway for advancing information transmission applications.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Nanotheranostics with a Switchable Irradiation Mode for Immunogenic Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents new insights into a multifunctional drug delivery system (NPRBOXA) with a sequentially switching irradiation mode for cancer theranostics. NPRBOXA enables a combination of sonodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy for tumor treatment. The versatile design of NPRBOXA holds promise for advancing precision oncology through enhanced therapeutic efficacy and imaging guidance.








Abstract
Nanotheranostics, which integrate diagnostic and therapeutic functionalities, offer significant potential for tumor treatment. However, current nanotheranostic systems typically involve multiple molecules, each providing a singular diagnostic or therapeutic function, leading to challenges such as complex structural composition, poor targeting efficiency, lack of spatiotemporal control, and dependence on a single therapeutic modality. This study introduces NPRBOXA, a nanoparticle functionalized with surface&#8208;bound cRGD for targeted delivery to &#945;v&#946;3/&#945;v&#946;5 receptors on tumor cells, achieving theranostic integration by sequentially switching its irradiation modes. Under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, NPRBOXA emits NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, which aids in identifying the nanoparticle's location and fluorescence intensity, thereby determining the optimal treatment window. Following this, the irradiation mode switches to ultrasound irradiation at the optimal treatment window. Ultrasound irradiation induces NPRBOXA to generate reactive oxygen species, promoting the reduction of OXA&#8208;IV to OXA&#8208;II, which in turn triggers immunogenic cell death. This mechanism enables a combination of sonodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy for tumor treatment. The versatile design of NPRBOXA holds promise for advancing precision oncology through enhanced therapeutic efficacy and real&#8208;time imaging guidance.

         <title>Reconfigurable Visible Light&#8208;Driven Liquid Crystalline Network Showing Off&#8208;Equilibrium Motions Enabled by Mesogen&#8208;Grafted Donor&#8211;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts</title>

         <dc:description>
Liquid crystalline network (LCN)&#8208;based actuators grafted with Donor&#8211;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts (DASAs) are fabricated. The LCN&#8208;DASAs films present synergistic effects and interactions of photochemical and photothermal effects under visible light. Furthermore, multiple applications of films including information encryptions, off&#8208;equilibrium motions grippers, and reconfigurable deformations are achieved.








Abstract
Liquid crystalline network (LCN)&#8211;based soft actuators have opened up great opportunities to fabricate emerging and intriguing smart materials, serving as potential building blocks for intelligent soft robotics. Endowing LCN actuators with complex responsive behaviors to enhance their intelligence is both challenging and highly demanded. Herein, Donor&#8211;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts (DASAs) molecules with rod&#8208;like mesogen and the polymerizable group are judiciously designed and synthesized, which is strong&#8208;colored at linear form and de&#8208;coloration at cyclic form after visible light. In the colored state, the DASA presents a striking photothermal effect that is capable of driving the motions of LCN film. Upon visible light irradiation, the DASA becomes colorless, making the diminishing photothermal effect. The light&#8208;gated switching of the photothermal effect renders the LCN films to be reconfigurable and perform off&#8208;equilibrium motions. The varying glass transition temperature of LCN matrix endowing tunable isomerization rates of DASAs and the equilibrium balance of photo&#8208; and thermal&#8208;isomerization at different temperatures in LCN&#8208;P&#8208;DASA film mainly guiding the off&#8208;equilibrium or stable motions, providing high adjustability of the novel visible light&#8208;driven LCN actuators. The multiply modulated LCN&#8208;P&#8208;DASA film holds great potential in constructing complex visible light&#8208;driven soft actuators based on the synergetic effect and interactions of photochemical and photothermal effects.

         <title>2D Titanium Carbide MXene and Single&#8208;Molecule Fluorescence: Distance&#8208;Dependent Nonradiative Energy Transfer and Leaflet&#8208;Resolved Dye Sensing in Lipid Bilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXenes' distance&#8208;dependent energy transfer properties are examined using single&#8208;molecule fluorescence microscopy and DNA origami nanopositioners. The findings reveal MXenes as short&#8208;distance spectroscopic nanorulers, achieving 50% energy transfer efficiency at 2.7&#160;nm with a cubic power law dependency. Single&#8208;molecule leaflet&#8208;resolved dye sensing of lipid bilayers are demonstrated with MXene energy transfer due to MXenes&#8217; sensitivity at the interface.








Abstract
Despite their growing popularity, many fundamental properties and applications of MXene materials remain underexplored. Here, the nonradiative energy transfer properties of 2D titanium carbide MXene are investigated&#160;and their application in single&#8208;molecule biosensing is explored for the first time. DNA origami positioners are used for single dye placement immobilized by a specific chemistry based on glycine&#8208;MXene interactions, allowing precise control of their orientation on the surface. Each DNA origami structure carries a single dye molecule at predetermined heights. Single&#8208;molecule fluorescence confocal microscopy reveals that energy transfer of an organic emitter (ATTO 542) on transparent thin films made of spincast Ti3C2Tx flakes follows a cubic distance dependence, where 50% of energy transfer efficiency is reached at 2.7&#160;nm (d0). MXenes are applied as short&#8208;distance spectroscopic nanorulers, determining z distances of dye&#8208;labeled supported lipid bilayers fused on MXene's hydrophilic surface. Hydration layer (2.1&#160;nm) and lipid bilayer thickness (4.5&#160;nm) values that agree with the literature are obtained. These results highlight titanium carbide MXenes as promising substrates for single&#8208;molecule biosensing of ultrathin assemblies, owing to their sensitivity near the interface, a distance regime that is typically inaccessible to other energy transfer tools.

Abstract
Recently, YbCd2Sb2&#8208;based Zintl compounds have been widely investigated owing to their extraordinary thermoelectric (TE) performance. However, its p orbitals of anions that determined the valence band structure are split due to crystal field splitting that provides a good platform for band manipulation by doping/alloying and, more importantly, the YbCd2Sb2&#8208;based device has yet to be reported. In this work, single&#8208;phase YbCd1.5Zn0.5Sb2 is successfully obtained through precise chemical composition control. Then, YbMg2Sb2&#8208;alloying increases the cationic vacancy defect formation energy and further optimizes carrier concentration. Moreover, the band structure of YbCd1.5Zn0.5Sb2 is subtly manipulated, and the underlying mechanism is experimentally explored. Combined with the reduced lattice thermal conductivity, a high peak ZT value of &#8764;1.43 at 700&#160;K is obtained for YbCd1.425Zn0.475Mg0.1Sb2. Subsequently, choosing Fe90Sb10 as the diffusion barrier layer and adopting the transient liquid phase bonding technique, for the first time, it is demonstrated that YbCd2Sb2/Mg3(Sb, Bi)2 TE module with an ultrahigh conversion efficiency of &#8776;9.0% at a heat difference of 430&#160;K. More importantly, this module displays good thermal stability. This work paves the way for YbCd2Sb2 materials and devices in mid&#8208;temperature heat recovery.

         <title>AI&#8208;Driven Electrolyte Additive Selection to Boost Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theoretical model driven by physical and chemical knowledge is proposed, summarizing descriptors and training sets through computational simulation combined with extensive literature. By integrating machine learning prediction and artificial intelligence clustering, electrolyte additives are screened and designed for Zn&#8208;ion batteries to achieve higher stability. Experimental verification confirms the practical applicability of this approach.








Abstract
In tackling the stability challenge of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) for large&#8208;scale energy storage, the adoption of electrolyte additive emerges as a practical solution. Unlike current trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods for selecting electrolyte additives, a data&#8208;driven strategy is proposed using theoretically computed surface free energy as a stability descriptor, benchmarked against experimental results. Numerous additives are calculated from existing literature, forming a database for machine learning (ML) training. Importantly, this ML model relies solely on experimental values, effectively addressing the challenge of large solvent molecule models that are difficult to handle with quantum chemistry computation. The interpretable linear regression algorithm identifies the number of heavy atoms in the additive molecule and the liquid surface tension as key factors. Artificial intelligence (AI) clustering categorizes additive molecules, identifying regions with the most significant impact on enhancing battery stability. Experimental verification successfully confirms the exceptional performance of 1,2,3&#8208;butanetriol and acetone in the optimal region. This integrated methodology, combining theoretical models, data&#8208;driven ML, and experimental validation, provides insights into the rational design of battery electrolyte additives.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Polarized PdCu&#8211;Fe3O4 In&#8208;Plane Heterostructures with Tandem Catalytic Mechanism for Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nanosheet assemblies composed of spin&#8208;polarized PdCu&#8211;Fe3O4 in&#8208;plane heterostructures are precisely synthesized via a liquid&#8208;phase short&#8208;range atomic diffusion strategy. A multi&#8208;site tandem mechanism is revealed on the deliberate&#8208;engineered heterostructures &#9472;O2 molecules are initially activated and cleaved on Fe sites to form O* and OH*, which are then transferred to Pd sites for the following proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps.








Abstract
Alloying has significantly upgraded the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of Pd&#8208;based catalysts through regulating the thermodynamics of oxygenated intermediates. However, the unsatisfactory activation ability of Pd&#8208;based alloys toward O2 molecules limits further improvement of ORR kinetics. Herein, the precise synthesis of nanosheet assemblies of spin&#8208;polarized PdCu&#8211;Fe3O4 in&#8208;plane heterostructures for drastically activating O2 molecules and boosting ORR kinetics is reported. It is demonstrated that the deliberate&#8208;engineered in&#8208;plane heterostructures not only tailor the d&#8208;band center of Pd sites with weakened adsorption of oxygenated intermediates but also endow electrophilic Fe sites with strong ability to activate O2 molecules, which make PdCu&#8211;Fe3O4 in&#8208;plane heterostructures exhibit the highest ORR specific activity among the state&#8208;of&#8208;art Pd&#8208;based catalysts so far. In situ electrochemical spectroscopy and theoretical investigations reveal a tandem catalytic mechanism on PdCu&#8211;Fe3O4&#9472;Fe sites that initially activate molecular O2 and generate oxygenated intermediates being transferred to Pd sites to finish the subsequent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps.

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cell Modules by Mediated Vapor Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vapor&#8208;to&#8208;solid deposition of high&#8208;quality large&#8208;area perovskite films is developed via a new process based on a 2D intermediated phase. Efficiencies of 21.1% and 20.1% are achieved for perovskite modules with active areas of 12.5 and 48.0 cm2, respectively.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) can enable renewable electricity generation at low levelized costs, subject to the invention of an economically feasible technology for their large&#8208;scale fabrication, like vapor deposition. This approach is effective for the fabrication of small area (&lt;1 cm2) PSCs, but its scale&#8208;up to produce high&#8208;efficiency larger area modules has been limited by a severe imbalance between the vapor&#8208;solid reaction kinetics and the mass&#8208;transport of the volatile ammonium salt precursor. In this study, an amidine&#8208;based low&#8208;dimensional perovskite is introduced as an intermediate of the solid&#8208;vapor reaction to help resolve this limitation. This improves reaction pathway produces unique vertically monolithic grains with no detectable horizontal boundaries, which is used to produce 1.0 cm2 PSCs with an efficiency of 22.1%, as well as 12.5 and 48 cm2 modules delivering 21.1% and 20.1% efficiency, respectively. The modules retain &#8776;85% of their initial performance after 900 h of continuous operation (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 protocol) and &#8776;100% after 2800 h of storage in an ambient environment (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1 protocol).

Abstract
Crafting semiconducting heterojunctions represents an effective route to enhance photocatalysis by improving interfacial charge separation and transport. However, lattice mismatch (&#948;) between different semiconductors can significantly hinder charge dynamics. Here, meticulous lattice tailoring is reported to create a covalent heterointerface with a built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF), imparting markedly improved hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) photosynthesis. Specifically, an In2S3/CdS heterojunction with a coherent heterointerface, characterized by covalent In&#9472;S&#9472;Cd bridge and exceptionally low lattice mismatch of 0.27%, and a BIEF from In2S3 to CdS, is rationally designed. This heterojunction entails rapid charge separation and transfer, achieving an outstanding H2O2 production rate of 2.09 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 without the need for scavengers and oxygen bubbling, and a high apparent quantum efficiency of 17.73% at 400 nm. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that this Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction facilitates the adsorption of *O2 and the generation of *OOH intermediates during the 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction, associated with a low Gibbs free energy. This study underscores the significance of fine&#8208;tuning interfacial lattices and integrating BIEF to accelerate photocatalysis. The simple yet robust strategy can be conveniently leveraged to enhance device performance in optoelectronics, electrocatalysis, photoelectrocatalysis, and sensing.

         <title>3D Bioprinting of Liquid High&#8208;Cell&#8208;Proportion Bioinks in Liquid Granular Bath</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
There are challenges for extrusion 3D bioprinting in simultaneously satisfying the requirements of high&#8208;cell&#8208;activity, high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion, and low&#8208;viscosity bioinks, which allows the establishment of improved cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell communication and enhanced biological. Here, liquid high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion GelMA are found to be printed in liquid granular through ink&#8208;bath electrostatic interaction, that is, liquid&#8208;in&#8208;liquid 3D bioprinting (LL3DBP).








Abstract
Embedded 3D bioprinting techniques have emerged as a powerful method to fabricate 3D engineered constructs&#160;using low strength bioinks; however, there are challenges in simultaneously satisfying the requirements of high&#8208;cell&#8208;activity, high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion, and low&#8208;viscosity bioinks. In particular, the printing capacity of embedded 3D bioprinting is limited as two main challenges: spreading and diffusion, especially for liquid, high&#8208;cell&#8208;activity bioinks that can facilitate high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion. Here, a liquid&#8208;in&#8208;liquid 3D bioprinting (LL3DBP) strategy is developed, which used a liquid granular bath to prevent the spreading of liquid bioinks during 3D printing, and electrostatic interaction between the liquid bioinks and liquid granular baths is found to effectively prevent the diffusion of liquid bioinks. As an example, the printing of positively charged 5% w/v gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) in a liquid granular bath prepared with negatively charged &#954;&#8208;carrageenan is proved to be achievable. By LL3DBP, printing capacity is greatly advanced and bioinks with over 90% v/v cell can be printed, and printed structures with high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion exhibit excellent bioactivity.

         <title>In Situ Molecular Reconfiguration of Pyrene Redox&#8208;Active Molecules for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Organic Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural evolution of organic electrolysis is revealed at the molecular level in a flow battery and decreases the electrosynthesis yield of isomers and dimers with low electrochemical activity by more than one order of magnitude through pyrene precursor structure regulation. The molecular reconfigured pyrene&#8208;based catholytes achieved a high electrolyte utilization, electron concentration, and recordable cell performance without obvious capacity decay.








Abstract
Aqueous organic flow batteries (AOFBs) hold great potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage, however, scalable, green, and economical synthetic methods for stable organic redox&#8208;active molecules (ORAMs) are still required for their practical applications. Herein, pyrene&#8208;based ORAMs are obtained via an in situ organic electrolysis strategy in a flow cell. It is revealed that the water attacking pyrenes restructured molecules to produce a variety of isomers and dimers during the electrolysis, which can be modulated by regulating the local electron cloud density and steric hindrance of pyrene precursors. As a result, the molecularly reconfigured pyrene&#8208;based catholytes, even without any further purification, achieved a high electrolyte utilization of &#8776;96% and volumetric capacity above 50&#160;Ah&#160;L&#8722;1. Inspiringly, remarkable cell stability with almost no capacity decay for &#8776;70 days is achieved, benefiting from the robust aromatic structure of the pyrene cores. The insights into the in situ electrosynthesis of pyrene&#8208;based ORAMs provided in the work will provide guidance for designing ultra&#8208;stable ORAMs for AOFB applications.

         <title>Molecular Reconfiguration of Disordered Tellurium Oxide Transistors with Biomimetic Spectral Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconfigurable transistors and neuromorphic devices are realized through surface processes on disordered tellurium oxides. The enhanced surface interactions effectively regulate carrier concentration in the channel, leading to logic functions and biomimetic wavelength selectivity. This molecular reconfiguration strategy increases the integration level of circuits and significantly promotes the development of next&#8208;generation multifunctional electronic devices.








Abstract
Reconfigurable devices with field&#8208;effect transistor features and neuromorphic behaviors are promising for enhancing data processing capability and reducing power consumption in next&#8208;generation semiconductor platforms. However, commonly used 2D materials for reconfigurable devices require additional modulation terminals and suffer from complex and stringent operating rules to obtain specific functionalities. Here, a p&#8208;type disordered tellurium oxide is introduced that realizes dual&#8208;mode reconfigurability as a logic transistor and a neuromorphic device. Due to the disordered film surface, the enhanced adsorption of oxygen molecules and laser&#8208;induced desorption concurrently regulate the carrier concentration in the channel. The device exhibits high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type characteristics with a field&#8208;effect hole mobility of 10.02 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an Ion/Ioff ratio exceeding 106 in the transistor mode. As a neuromorphic device, the vision system exhibits biomimetic bee vision, explicitly responding to the blue&#8208;to&#8208;ultraviolet light. Finally, in&#8208;sensor denoising and invisible image recognition in static and dynamic scenarios are achieved.

         <title>Balancing Potassiophilicity and Catalytic Activity of Artificial Interface Layer for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium/Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon layer with a locally ordered structure has been developed as an artificial interface to achieve a balance between K affinity and catalytic activity, which can significantly enhance the cycle life of potassium metal batteries, achieving an impressive life of 2000 h at 0.5 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a capacity of 0.5 mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Potassium metal batteries (PMBs), with high energy density and low cost, are considered a promising option for grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems. However, challenges such as the uneven nucleation of K and instability of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer result in dendrite growth and poor cyclic performance, limiting practical application. To address them, constructing an artificial interface layer with rich defects can enhance the potassium affinity and promote the uniform nucleation of potassium, yet this can also catalyze electrolyte to decompose, leading to unstable SEI formation and poor cycle stability. Herein, a carbon layer with a locally ordered structure (SC&#8208;1600) is constructed as the artificial interface to achieve a balance between K affinity and catalytic activity. This optimized design allows for the uniform nucleation of potassium metal and the formation of a dense SEI layer. SC&#8208;1600@K symmetric cell can operate for 2000&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a capacity of 0.5 mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, and the developed full cell shows a high capacity retention of 78% after 1500 cycles at 1 A&#160;g&#8722;1.

     alt="Balancing Potassiophilicity and Catalytic Activity of Artificial Interface Layer for Dendrite-Free Sodium/Potassium Metal Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A carbon layer with a locally ordered structure has been developed as an artificial interface to achieve a balance between K affinity and catalytic activity, which can significantly enhance the cycle life of potassium metal batteries, achieving an impressive life of 2000 h at 0.5 mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a capacity of 0.5 mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potassium metal batteries (PMBs), with high energy density and low cost, are considered a promising option for grid-scale energy storage systems. However, challenges such as the uneven nucleation of K and instability of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer result in dendrite growth and poor cyclic performance, limiting practical application. To address them, constructing an artificial interface layer with rich defects can enhance the potassium affinity and promote the uniform nucleation of potassium, yet this can also catalyze electrolyte to decompose, leading to unstable SEI formation and poor cycle stability. Herein, a carbon layer with a locally ordered structure (SC-1600) is constructed as the artificial interface to achieve a balance between K affinity and catalytic activity. This optimized design allows for the uniform nucleation of potassium metal and the formation of a dense SEI layer. SC-1600@K symmetric cell can operate for 2000&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a capacity of 0.5 mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the developed full cell shows a high capacity retention of 78% after 1500 cycles at 1 A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Besides, SC-1600@Na effectively extend the life of sodium metal batteries. This work provides a new insight for the construction of efficient K metal artificial interface layer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intrinsic Narrowband Blue Phosphorescent Materials and Their Applications in 3D Printed Self&#8208;monitoring Microfluidic Chips</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to achieve intrinsic narrowband blue phosphorescent materials is demonstrated. When doping guest molecules into hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA)&#8208;acrylic acid (AA) polymer matrix, narrowband phosphorescence with the full width at half maximum of 36 nm is achieved. 3D printed structures based on 2O&#8208;Cphpz@HEA&#8208;AA are also fabricated, expanding potential applications for self&#8208;monitoring the trajectories of droplet by optical methods.








Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials, especially with narrowband emission properties, exhibit great potential for applications in display and sensing, but have been seldom reported. Herein, a rare example of the intrinsic narrowband blue RTP material is fabricated and reported. A series of indolo[3,2,1&#8208;kl]phenothiazine derivatives, named Cphpz, 1O&#8208;Cphpz, and 2O&#8208;Cphpz, are designed and synthesized. Due to their relatively rigid structures, these three compounds showed deep blue narrowband emissions ranging from 396 to 434&#160;nm with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 31, 26, and 31&#160;nm, respectively. To the delight, compound 2O&#8208;Cphpz displayed intrinsic narrowband blue RTP at 448 nm with FWHM of 36 nm and a long&#8208;lived lifetime of 1.08 s in hydroxyethyl acrylate and acrylic acid matrix. Photophysical studies, single crystal analyses, and TD&#8208;DFT calculations are performed to elucidate further the relationships between molecular structures and the narrowband blue RTP properties. Meanwhile, because the narrowband blue RTP is highly sensitive to humidity, a visualizing droplet path optical microfluidic chip is efficiently fabricated through the digital light processing 3D printing.This work provides a rare example and a reliable strategy to realize narrowband blue RTP and further expand their applications in self&#8208;monitoring 3D printed structures.

         <title>Embedding Reverse Electron Transfer Between Stably Bare Cu Nanoparticles and Cation&#8208;Vacancy CuWO4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An embedded cation&#8208;vacancy metal&#8208;oxide interface is developed to induce the reverse strong metal&#8208;support interactions in Cu NPs, which inhibits its surface oxidation in ambient air, high&#8208;temperature agglomeration, and CO poisoning adsorption. In contrast to the Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood mechanism observed in the deposited Cu NPs, the exsolved electron&#8208;enriched Cu NPs with anion oxygen protective layers follow the Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanism during CO oxidation.








Abstract
Cu nanoparticles (NPs) have attracted widespread attention in electronics, energy, and catalysis. However, conventionally synthesized Cu NPs face some challenges such as surface passivation and agglomeration in applications, which impairs their functionalities in the physicochemical properties. Here, the issues above by engineering an embedded interface of stably bare Cu NPs on the cation&#8208;vacancy CuWO4 support is addressed, which induces the strong metal&#8208;support interactions and reverse electron transfer. Various atomic&#8208;scale analyses directly demonstrate the unique electronic structure of the embedded Cu NPs with negative charge and anion oxygen protective layer, which mitigates the typical degradation pathways such as oxidation in ambient air, high&#8208;temperature agglomeration, and CO poisoning adsorption. Kinetics and in situ spectroscopic studies unveil that the embedded electron&#8208;enriched Cu NPs follow the typical Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanism in CO oxidation, contrasting the Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood mechanism on the traditional Cu NPs. This mechanistic shift is driven by the Coulombic repulsion in anion oxygen layer, enabling its direct reaction with gaseous CO to form the easily desorbed monodentate carbonate.

         <title>Functional Carbon Springs Enabled Dynamic Tunable Microwave Absorption and Thermal Insulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional carbon spring (FCS) aerogels possess dynamic tunable microwave absorption and excellent thermal insulation due to their unique lamellar multi&#8208;arch microstructure. This design resolves the current conflict in co&#8208;optimizing these functions, providing the best &#8220;electromagnetic&#8208;thermal&#8221; dual protection known.









Abstract
Electromagnetic (EM) wave pollution and thermal damage pose serious hazards to delicate instruments. Functional aerogels offer a promising solution by mitigating EM interference and isolating heat. However, most of these materials struggle to balance thermal protection with microwave absorption (MA) efficiency due to a previously unidentified conflict between the optimizing strategies of the two properties. Herein, this study reports a solution involving the design of a carbon&#8208;based aerogel called functional carbon spring (FCS). Its unique long&#8208;range lamellar multi&#8208;arch microstructure enables tunable MA performance and excellent thermal insulation capability. Adjusting compression strain from 0% to 50%, the adjustable effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) spans up to 13.4&#160;GHz, covering 84% of the measured frequency spectrum. Notably, at 75% strain, the EAB drops to 0&#160;GHz, demonstrating a novel &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; switchability for MA performance. Its ultralow vertical thermal conductivity (12.7&#160;mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) and unique anisotropic heat transfer mechanism endow FCS with superior thermal protection effectiveness. Numerical simulations demonstrate that FCS outperforms common honeycomb structures and isotropic porous aerogels in thermal management. Furthermore, an &#8220;electromagnetic&#8208;thermal&#8221; dual&#8208;protection material database is established, which intuitively demonstrates the superiority of the solution. This work contributes to the advancement of multifunctional MA materials with significant potential for practical applications.

         <title>Dynamic Lock&#8208;And&#8208;Release Mechanism Enables Reduced &#916;G at Low Temperatures for High&#8208;Performance Polyanionic Cathode in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;adaptive coordination field regulation (SACFR) strategy, underpinned by a dynamic lock&#8208;and&#8208;release (DLR) mechanism, is proposed for the first time to dynamically regulate the coordination field of reactant ions. This dynamic regulation improves reaction kinetics and reduces &#916;G at low temperatures, enabling the efficient synthesis of high&#8208;performance, high&#8208;crystalline Na3V2O2(PO4)2F cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature synthesis of polyanionic cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries is highly desirable but often plagued by prolonged reaction times and suboptimal crystallinity. To address these challenges, a novel self&#8208;adaptive coordination field regulation (SACFR) strategy based on a dynamic lock&#8208;and&#8208;release (DLR) mechanism is introduced. Specifically, urea is used as a DLR carrier during synthesis, which dynamically &#8220;locks&#8221; and &#8220;releases&#8221; vanadium ions for controlled release, simultaneously &#8220;locking&#8221; H+ ions to enhance phosphate group release, thereby creating a self&#8208;adaptive coordination field that can intelligently respond to real&#8208;time demands of the reaction system. This dynamic coordination behavior contributes to both an improvement in reaction kinetics and a significant reduction in Gibbs free energy change (&#916;G). As a result, the kinetic efficiency and thermodynamic spontaneity of the reaction are greatly enhanced, enabling the efficient synthesis of high&#8208;crystalline Na3V2O2(PO4)2F (NVOPF) at 90 &#176;C within just 3 hours. The as&#8208;prepared NVOPF cathode exhibits exceptional rate performance and ultra&#8208;stable cycling stability across a broad temperature range. Furthermore, the successful kilogram&#8208;scale synthesis underscores the practical potential of the innovative strategy. This work pioneers the regulation of coordination field chemistry for polyanionic cathode synthesis, providing transformative insights into material design.

Specifically, urea is used as a DLR carrier during synthesis, which dynamically &#8220;locks&#8221; and &#8220;releases&#8221; vanadium ions for controlled release, simultaneously &#8220;locking&#8221; H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions to enhance phosphate group release, thereby creating a self-adaptive coordination field that can intelligently respond to real-time demands of the reaction system. This dynamic coordination behavior contributes to both an improvement in reaction kinetics and a significant reduction in Gibbs free energy change (&lt;i&gt;&#916;G&lt;/i&gt;). As a result, the kinetic efficiency and thermodynamic spontaneity of the reaction are greatly enhanced, enabling the efficient synthesis of high-crystalline Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F (NVOPF) at 90 &#176;C within just 3 hours. The as-prepared NVOPF cathode exhibits exceptional rate performance and ultra-stable cycling stability across a broad temperature range. Furthermore, the successful kilogram-scale synthesis underscores the practical potential of the innovative strategy. This work pioneers the regulation of coordination field chemistry for polyanionic cathode synthesis, providing transformative insights into material design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionized Phenanthroline Derivatives Suppressing Interface Chemical Interactions with Active Layer for High&#8208;efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Exceptional Device Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel alcohol&#8208;soluble phenanthroline derivative, tbp&#8208;PhenBr, is innovatively designed and synthesized as cathode interlayer material, which can effectively suppress interface chemical interactions with the non&#8208;fullerene active layer for high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells with exceptional device stability.








Abstract
The contact interface between the charge transport interlayer and the active layer is crucial for the non&#8208;fullerene organic solar cells (NF OSCs) to achieve high efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. In this study, two novel phenanthroline (Phen) derivatives, tbp&#8208;Phen and tbp&#8208;PhenBr, are developed as efficient cathode interfacial materials (CIMs). The larger steric hindrance substituents and the ionization of nitrogen atoms on the Phen framework jointly enable the tbp&#8208;PhenBr CIM with a stable film morphology and immensely suppress the detrimental interface chemical interactions with the NF active layer. Consequently, tbp&#8208;PhenBr&#8208;based OSC achieves a higher efficiency (PCE&#160;=&#160;16.34%) than bathocuproine (BCP)&#8208;based control device (PCE&#160;=&#160;13.70%) using PM6:Y6 as the active layer. More importantly, the tbp&#8208;PhenBr&#8208;based device maintains 80% of its initial efficiency (T80) for 3264 h in dark conditions and 220 h after being heated at 85&#160;&#176;C, significantly outperforming the BCP&#8208;based device. The tbp&#8208;PhenBr CIM also shows broad applicability across various binary and ternary active layer systems, affording a notable PCE of 19.49%. Additionally, the tbp&#8208;PhenBr CIM can be processed via a thermal evaporation technique and the prepared devices exhibit high reproducibility. This work provides innovative insights into the molecular design of the CIMs for stable and efficient NF OSCs.

         <title>An Energy&#8208;Adjustable, Deformable, and Packable Wireless Charging Fiber Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated wireless charging fiber supercapacitor developed by only one fiber features with adjustable size (2&#8211;20&#160;cm diameter circle), arbitrary shape and controllable wireless charging energy (0.003&#8211;313&#160;mW power), exhibiting extraordinary energy density at 1004 &#181;Wh cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Wireless charging energy storage devices eliminate bulky wires of wearable electronics. However, rigid shape and specific charging energy restrict their applications in space&#8208;limited portable electronics. Herein, an all&#8208;carbon fiber supercapacitor is presented that features shape&#8208;adjustable, packable, and energy&#8208;controllable wireless charging functions. With the unique on&#8208;dimensional circuit structure, the maximum energy transfer efficiency from the electrical energy received by the wireless charging unit to the output energy of the fiber supercapacitor can reach up to &#8776;60.8%, and meanwhile this integrated fiber device exhibits an outstanding area capacity of 803 mF cm&#8722;2 and energy density of 1004 &#181;Wh cm&#8722;2, superior to most of the fiber supercapacitors. Moreover, this unique device can endure significant deformation in shape of circles ranging from 2 to 20&#160;cm diameter, and can be packed into narrow spaces, such as smart bracelet and disk&#8208;shaped pet global positioning system (GPS). By altering the device shape, the wireless charging current, voltage, and power can be adjusted in the range of 0.5&#8211;20&#160;mA, 1.4&#8211;15.5&#160;V, and 0.003&#8211;313&#160;mW, accommodating the energy requirements for nearly all existing micro&#8208;electronics. This work offers unprecedented opportunities for packable, space&#8208;confined and energy harvesting controllable wearable electronics.

         <title>Enhancing the Filler Utilization of Composite Gel Electrolytes via In Situ Solution&#8208;Processable Method for Sustainable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processable method is developed to fabricate composite gel electrolytes with high filler utilization. Uniform distributed UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 fillers enhance its mechanical toughness, ionic conductivity, and cation transference number, and stabilize the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. This strategy enables the sodium&#8208;ion batteries to achieve excellent cycling and wide&#8208;temperature performance.








Abstract
The composite gel electrolyte (CGE), which combines the advantages of inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes and solid polymer electrolytes, is regarded as the ultimate candidate for constructing batteries with high safety and superior electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface contact. However, the ubiquitous agglomeration of nanofillers results in low filler utilization, which seriously reduces structural uniformity and ion transport efficiency, thus restricting the development of consistent and durable batteries. Herein, a solution&#8208;processable method to in situ construct CGE with high filler utilization is introduced. The homogeneous metal&#8211;organic framework fillers contribute to uniform ionic and electronic filed distribution, realizing a stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Consequently, the CGE with high filler utilization achieves an ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 10&#160;000 cycles with a capacity retention of 80.2%. This work provides guidance for constructing high&#8208;performance CGEs in electrochemical energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Amorphous to Crystalline Transition in Nanoimprinted Sol&#8211;Gel Titanium Oxide Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wafer&#8208;scale manufacturing platform is introduced for crystalline TiO2 metasurfaces. Anatase or rutile metalenses are fabricated via thermal nanoimprint lithography and sintering. The high refractive index enhances conversion efficiency and numerical aperture. These metalenses demonstrate diffraction&#8208;limited focusing and imaging capabilities, showcasing the potential of crystalline TiO2 in advanced flat optics for improved performance in various applications.








Abstract
Crystalline titanium dioxide (TiO2) (anatase and rutile) possesses a higher refractive index than amorphous TiO2 and near&#8208;zero absorption in the visible region, making them an ideal material for visible metasurfaces. However, fabrication limitations hinder their implementation into flat optics. In this work, a wafer&#8208;scale manufacturing platform is proposed for crystalline TiO2 metasurfaces. Sol&#8211;gel TiO2 is developed as a printable material in which its material phase can be precisely controlled to produce amorphous, anatase, or rutile, depending on the crystallization temperature. Therefore, anatase or rutile metalenses can be fabricated on a wafer scale using thermal nanoimprint lithography and sintering process. The high refractive index of the crystalline TiO2 contributes to the enhanced conversion efficiency of the fabricated metalenses. The fabricated metalenses exhibit diffraction&#8208;limited focusing and imaging capabilities, comparable to the theoretically ideal lenses.

         <title>Spatially&#8208;Resolved Organoid Transfection by Porous Silicon&#8208;Mediated Optoporation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise control over gene delivery in 3D can refine tissue models providing insights into the complex, multicellular processes underlying development, degeneration, and disease progression. This work presents an optoporation strategy based on light&#8208;responsive porous silicon nanoparticles for the spatially&#8208;resolved transfection of organoids.








Abstract
Engineering the spatial organisation of organotypic cultures is pivotal for refining tissue models that are useful for gaining deeper insights into complex, non&#8208;cell autonomous processes. These advanced models are key to improving the understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms and therapeutic strategies. Controlling gene regulation through spatially&#8208;resolved delivery of nucleic acids provides an attractive approach to produce such tissue models. An emerging strategy for spatially&#8208;resolved transfection uses photosensitizing nanoparticles coupled with laser pulses to optoporate cells in culture and locally mediate gene delivery. However, localized optoporation in 3D systems remains challenging. Here we propose a solution to this longstanding hurdle, demonstrating that porous silicon nanoparticles are a safe and bioresorbable photosensitising nanomaterial capable of spatially&#8208;resolved transfection of mRNA in MCF&#8208;7 organoids by near&#8208;infrared two&#8208;photon optoporation. Functionalization with an azobenzene&#8211;lysine photo&#8208;switchable moiety enhances the transfection efficiency of the nanoparticles up to 84% in a 2D cell system. Moreover, the nanoparticles enable spatially selective mRNA transfection to MCF&#8208;7 spheroids, demonstrating targeted &#160;gene delivery in complex 3D cellular environments. The approach for spatially&#8208;resolved 3D optoporation offers a way forward for the design of tailored spheroids and organoids by spatially selective nucleic acids delivery.

         <title>Optimization of Charge Extraction and Interconnecting Layers for Highly Efficient Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells with High Fill Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developshighly efficient perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (POTSC) via the simultaneous optimization of quaternary organic BHJ blend, and reduction of optical and electrical losses of interconnecting layers via self&#8208;assembly monolayer. The resultant POTSCs achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.56% (certified: 24.65%), with a record fill factor (FF) of 83.62% of all types of perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells (TSCs) till now.








Abstract
Perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (POTSCs) have garnered significant attention due to their potential for achieving high photovoltaic (PV) performance. However, the reported power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and fill factors (FFs) are still subpar due to the challenges associated with charge extraction in the organic bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) and significant energy losses in the interconnecting layers (ICLs). Here, a quaternary organic BHJ blend is developed to enhance the charge extraction in the organic subcell, contributing to an increased FF of &#8805;78% under 1 sun illumination and even more under lower illumination intensities. Meanwhile, energy losses in the ICLs are reduced via the incorporation of a self&#8208;assembly monolayer (SAM), (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz), in organic BHJ to form a MoOx/SAM interface and the thorough control of the MoOx thickness to suppress parasitic absorption. The resultant POTSCs achieve a remarkable PCE of 25.56% (certified: 24.65%), with a record FF of 83.62%, which is among the highest PCEs of POTSCs and the highest FF of all types of perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells (TSCs) till now. This work proves the optimization of charge extraction and ICLs are effective strategies to promote the performance of POTSCs to surpass other solution&#8208;processed perovskite&#8208;based TSCs in the near future.

         <title>Ultrafast Synthesis of MXenes in Minutes via Low&#8208;Temperature Molten Salt Etching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXenes, including Ti3C2Tx, V4C3Tx, Nb4C3Tx, Mo2TiC2Tx, and Mo2CTx, can be rapidly synthesized via the low&#8208;temperature (130&#8211;195&#160;&#176;C) NH4HF2 molten salt etching process from their corresponding MAX phases in just 5&#8211;40&#160;min. This low&#8208;temperature molten salt etching method is easy to scale up and can yield more than 100&#160;g MXene in a single reaction.








Abstract
Developing green and efficient preparation strategies is a persistent pursuit in the field of 2D transition metal nitrides and/or carbides (MXenes). Traditional etching methods, such as HF&#8208;based or high&#8208;temperature Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;molten&#8208;salt etching route, require harsher etching conditions and exhibit lower preparation efficiency with limited scalability, severely constraining their commercial production and practical application. Here, an ultrafast low&#8208;temperature molten salt (LTMS) etching method is presented for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of diverse MXenes within minutes by employing NH4HF2 as the etchant. The increased thermal motion and improved diffusion of molten NH4HF2 molecules significantly expedite the etching process of MAX phases, thus achieving the preparation of Ti3C2Tx MXene in just 5&#160;minutes. The universality of the LTMS method renders it a valuable approach for the rapid synthesis of various MXenes, including V4C3Tx, Nb4C3Tx, Mo2TiC2Tx, and Mo2CTx. The LTMS method is easy to scale up and can yield more than 100&#160;g Ti3C2Tx in a single reaction. The obtained LTMS&#8208;MXene exhibits excellent electrochemical performance for supercapacitors, evidently proving the effectiveness of the LTMS method. This work provides an ultrafast, universal, and scalable LTMS etching method for the large&#8208;scale commercial production of MXenes.

         <title>Iodide Management and Oriented Crystallization Modulation for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Air Processed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>

A bottom&#8208;up, all&#8208;in&#8208;one modification strategy is proposed by introducing a multisite antioxidant ergothioneine (EGT) at the buried interface to manage iodide ions and manipulate crystallization dynamics. The EGT&#8208;optimization firmly anchors I&#8722; and inhibits their oxidation to I2. The optimized all&#8208;air processed device achieves a remarkable PCE of 25.13%, which is among the highest values reported for devices fabricated in air.








Abstract
Halide&#8208;related defects at the buried interface not only cause nonradiative recombination, but also seriously impair the long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a bottom&#8208;up, all&#8208;in&#8208;one modification strategy is proposed by introducing a multisite antioxidant ergothioneine (EGT) at the buried interface to manage iodide ions and manipulate crystallization dynamics. The findings demonstrate that EGT not only passivates uncoordinated Sn4+/Pb2+ defects, but also firmly anchors iodide ions and inhibits their oxidation to I2. Additionally, the modification by EGT enhances the oriented crystallization of perovskite, improves the carrier dynamics, and releases residual stresses. Consequently, the optimized all&#8208;air processed device (Rb0.02(FA0.95Cs0.05)0.98PbI2.91Br0.03Cl0.06) achieves a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.13%, which is among the highest values reported for devices fabricated in air, along with ultrahigh open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.191&#160;V and fill factor (FF) of 84.9%. The optimized device without encapsulation exhibits strong humidity, thermal, and operational stability under ISOS protocol. Specifically, the initial efficiency of the device is retained at 90.12% after 1512 h of thermal ageing at 65&#160;&#176;C and 90.14% after 930 h of continuous maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under simulated AM1.5 illumination.

Consequently, the optimized all-air processed device (Rb&lt;sub&gt;0.02&lt;/sub&gt;(FA&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;0.98&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;2.91&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;0.03&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;0.06&lt;/sub&gt;) achieves a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.13%, which is among the highest values reported for devices fabricated in air, along with ultrahigh open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;) of 1.191&#160;V and fill factor (FF) of 84.9%. The optimized device without encapsulation exhibits strong humidity, thermal, and operational stability under ISOS protocol. Specifically, the initial efficiency of the device is retained at 90.12% after 1512 h of thermal ageing at 65&#160;&#176;C and 90.14% after 930 h of continuous maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under simulated AM1.5 illumination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NIR&#8208;Actuated Ferroptosis Nanomotor for Enhanced Tumor Penetration and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;driven ROS self&#8208;supplying Z@P&#8208;F nanomotor with efficient lysosome escape and enhanced tumor penetration is successfully developed for synergistic tumor CDT/PTT. By releasing Fe2+ and H2O2 under NIR irradiation and acidic TME, Z@P&#8208;F nanomotors continuously generate large amounts of lipid ROS in the tumor and deplete intracellular GSH, thus facilitating Fe2+&#8208;mediated ferroptosis and eventually achieving effective tumor eradication.








Abstract
Ferroptosis nano&#8208;inducers have drawn considerable attention in the treatment of malignant tumors. However, low intratumoral hydrogen peroxide level and complex biological barriers hinder the ability of nanomedicines to generate sufficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) and achieve tumor penetration. Here a near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;driven ROS self&#8208;supplying nanomotor is successfully designed for synergistic tumor chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). Janus nanomotor is created by the asymmetrical modification of polydopamine (PDA) with zinc peroxide (ZnO2) and subsequent ferrous ion (Fe2+) chelation via the polyphenol groups from the PDA, here refer as ZnO2@PDA&#8208;Fe (Z@P&#8208;F). ZnO2 is capable of slowly releasing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into an acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) providing sufficient ingredients for the Fenton reaction necessary for ferroptosis. Upon NIR laser irradiation, the loaded Fe2+ is released and a thermal gradient is simultaneously formed owing to the asymmetric PDA coating, thus endowing the nanomotor with self&#8208;thermophoresis based enhanced diffusion for subsequent lysosomal escape and tumor penetration. Therefore, the release of ferrous ions (Fe2+), self&#8208;supplied H2O2, and self&#8208;thermophoresis of nanomotors with NIR actuation further improve the synergistic CDT/PTT efficacy, showing great potential for active tumor therapy.

         <title>Construction of COF/COF Organic S&#8208;Scheme Heterostructure for Enhanced Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of organic COF/COF heterojunction with an S&#8208;scheme charge transfer pathway is designed for enhanced photocatalytic overall water splitting without sacrificial agents, and the record high visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 and O2 evolution rates achieved for COF&#8208;316/Pt@TpBpy&#8208;COF.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as a new type of photocatalysts have shown unique advantages in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution, while the reported overall water&#8208;splitting systems are still very rare among various COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Herein, two COFs are integrated to construct a type of organic S&#8208;scheme heterojunction for improved overall water splitting. In this system, TpBpy&#8208;COF and COF&#8208;316 serve as H2&#8208; and O2&#8208;evolving components, respectively, which are combined through &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction between conjugated aromatic rings. By introducing ultra&#8208;small Pt nanoparticles (NPs) into the pores of the TpBpy&#8208;COF nanosheets (NS), the resultant COF&#8208;316/Pt@TpBpy&#8208;COF NS heterostructure achieves extremely high H2 and O2 evolution rates of 220.4 and 110.2&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, respectively, under visible light irradiation (&#955; &#8805; 420&#160;nm). The results of transient absorption spectra (TAS) and photoelectronic measurements indicate that the organic heterojunction interface notably facilitates the separation and transfer of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. Further, theoretical calculations and in situ experiments confirm the spontaneous formation of the COF/COF heterojunction interface and the active sites for overall water splitting.

         <title>Boosting the Quantum Efficiency of Ionic Carbon Nitrides in Photocatalytic H2O2 Evolution via Controllable n &#8594; &#960;* Electronic Transition Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable activation of n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition is presented to boost the photocatalytic H2O2 evolution in ionic carbon nitrides through the simultaneous introduction of structural distortions and defect sites. The best catalyst (2%Ox&#8208;KPHI) shows an apparent quantum yield of 41% at 410&#160;nm without the need for any cocatalysts, outperforming most previously reported carbon nitride&#8208;based photocatalysts.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a crucial chemical used in numerous industrial applications, yet its manufacturing relies on the energy&#8208;demanding anthraquinone process. Solar&#8208;driven synthesis of H2O2 is gaining traction as a promising research area, providing a sustainable method for its production. Herein, a controllable activation of n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition is presented to boost the photocatalytic H2O2 evolution in ionic carbon nitrides. This enhancement is achieved through the simultaneous introduction of structural distortions and defect sites (&#9472;C &#8801; N groups and N vacancies) into the KPHI framework. The optimal catalyst (2%Ox&#8208;KPHI) reached an apparent quantum yield of 41% at 410&#160;nm without the need for any cocatalysts, outperforming most previously reported carbon nitride&#8208;based photocatalysts. Extensive experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations confirm that a corrugated configuration and the presence of defects significantly broaden the light absorption profile, improve carrier separation and migration, promote O2 adsorption, and lower the energy barriers for H2O2 desorption. Transient absorption spectroscopy indicates that the enhanced photocatalytic performance of 2%Ox&#8208;KPHI is largely attributed to the preferential migration of electrons at defect sites over extended timescales, following the diffusion of geminate carriers across the PHI sheets.

CAT&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Macrophages
A roller, equipped with needle tires and loaded with CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms, traversed this road. CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms appear like graceful angels, clearing away DPP4+ fibroblasts and regulating the fibrotic phenotype of vascular endothelial cells. The &#8220;scarred road&#8221; undergoes a transformation into smooth and flat road following compaction by a roller. More details can be found in article number 2406153 by Wen Zeng and co&#8208;workers.

Self&#8208;Thermophoretic Nanomotor
Self&#8208;thermophoresis confers Z@P&#8208;F nanomotors motility to achieve enhanced deep tumor penetration and therapy. By releasing massive Fe2+ and H2O2, Z@P&#8208;F nanomotors continuously generate ROS in the tumor, thus eventually achieving effective tumor ferroptosis. More details can be found in article number 2412227 by Yingfeng Tu, Fei Peng, Hao Tian, and co&#8208;workers.

3D Bioprinting of Liquid High&#8208;Cell&#8208;Proportion Bioinks
In extrusion&#8208;based bioprinting, bioinks have long been subject to trade&#8208;offs between physicochemical properties and biological outcomes. Due to insufficient viscosity, liquid bioinks have been considered unprintable. In article number 2412127, Lei Shao, Yong He, Xueping Wang and co&#8208;workers developed a liquid granular bath that enables embedded 3D bioprinting of liquid, high&#8208;cell&#8208;proportion bioinks to address this challenge.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Additive manufacturing (AM) has become an integral part of industry to manufacture complex parts with a shorter turnaround time. Metal thin&#8208;walled structures are ubiquitous in many of these parts. This review aims to discuss the structure design of additively manufactured metal thin walls and the impact that thin walls have on the geometrical accuracy, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the part.

Metal thin&#8208;walled structures are ubiquitous in various industrial applications and fabricating them through additive manufacturing (AM) enables intricate thin&#8208;wall geometries with no assembly required. However, additively manufactured metal thin walls suffer from increased heat accumulation and reduced structural stability, making it difficult to print geometrically accurate thin walls with minimal distortion and defects. Thin&#8208;walled structures also experience different thermal histories and solidification conditions compared to bulk structures, leading to drastic differences in the microstructure and mechanical properties. In this review article, the AM processing of metal thin&#8208;walled structures will be introduced. An in&#8208;depth discussion on the design strategies of additively manufactured metal thin walls will be presented regarding the restrictions imposed by the AM technology, the integration of thin walls in lightweight structures, and novel design ideation through topology optimization. The effects that the thin wall design has on the geometrical accuracy, microstructure, and mechanical properties will then be elucidated. The utilization of AM for fabricating metal thin walls across various industries will also be summarized. Finally, this review article will close on some perspectives and future work on the AM of metal thin&#8208;walled structures.

         <title>Boosting Light&#8722;Matter Interactions in Plasmonic Nanogaps</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmonic nanogap systems enhance optical processes via antenna or cavity plasmon modes, which are influenced by gap morphology. Emitters such as self&#8208;assembled monolayer molecules, quantum dots, and 2D materials couple within the nanogaps. The resulting enhanced optical processes include Raman scattering, infrared absorption, nonlinear optics, photoluminescence, strong coupling, electroluminescence, and photochemistry.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanogaps in strongly coupled metal nanostructures can confine light to nanoscale regions, leading to huge electric field enhancement. This unique capability makes plasmonic nanogaps powerful platforms for boosting light&#8211;matter interactions, thereby enabling the rapid development of novel phenomena and applications. This review traces the progress of nanogap systems characterized by well&#8208;defined morphologies, controllable optical responses, and a focus on achieving extreme performance. The properties of plasmonic gap modes in far&#8208;field resonance and near&#8208;field enhancement are explored and a detailed comparative analysis of nanogap fabrication techniques down to sub&#8208;nanometer scales is provided, including bottom&#8208;up, top&#8208;down, and their combined approaches. Additionally, recent advancements and applications across various frontier research areas are highlighted, including surface&#8208;enhanced spectroscopy, plasmon&#8208;exciton strong coupling, nonlinear optics, optoelectronic devices, and other applications beyond photonics. Finally, the challenges and promising emerging directions in the field are discussed, such as light&#8208;driven atomic effects, molecular optomechanics, and alternative new materials.

         <title>Multifunctional Strategies of Advanced Electrocatalysts for Efficient Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides an in&#8208;depth exploration of engineering modification strategies for catalytic materials and their promising applications in C&#9472;N coupling for urea electrosynthesis. Additionally, it highlights the significance of integrating diverse modification strategies to improve the efficiency of C&#9472;N coupling in urea synthesis. Finally, the review evaluates the potential challenges and opportunities that catalytic materials for C&#9472;N coupling may encounter in the path toward future commercialization.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of nitrogenous species (such as N2, NO, NO2&#8722;, and NO3&#8722;) for urea synthesis under ambient conditions has been extensively studied due to their potential to realize carbon/nitrogen neutrality and mitigate environmental pollution, as well as provide a means to store renewable electricity generated from intermittent sources such as wind and solar power. However, the sluggish reaction kinetics and the scarcity of active sites on electrocatalysts have significantly hindered the advancement of their practical applications. Multifunctional engineering of electrocatalysts has been rationally designed and investigated to adjust their electronic structures, increase the density of active sites, and optimize the binding energies to enhance electrocatalytic performance. Here, surface engineering, defect engineering, doping engineering, and heterostructure engineering strategies for efficient nitrogen electro&#8208;reduction are comprehensively summarized. The role of each element in engineered electrocatalysts is elucidated at the atomic level, revealing the intrinsic active site, and understanding the relationship between atomic structure and catalytic performance. This review highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress of electrocatalytic reactions of waste nitrogenous species into urea. Moreover, this review outlines the challenges and opportunities for urea synthesis and aims to facilitate further research into the development of advanced electrocatalysts for a sustainable future.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Based Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a key green energy oxidant with growing interest. This review examines non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR), aiming to optimize H2O2 production through active site regulation, heterometallic effects, oxygen vacancy engineering, and local electronic environment. It suggests a future research direction for more advanced catalyst design.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a high&#8208;value chemical widely used in electronics, textiles, paper bleaching, medical disinfection, and wastewater treatment. Traditional production methods, such as the anthraquinone oxidation process and direct synthesis, require high energy consumption, and involve risks from toxic substances and explosions. Researchers are now exploring photochemical, electrochemical, and photoelectrochemical synthesis methods to reduce energy use and pollution. This review focuses on the 2&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) for the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2, and discusses how catalyst active sites influence O2 adsorption. Strategies to enhance H2O2 selectivity by regulating these sites are presented. Catalysts require strong O2 adsorption to initiate reactions and weak *OOH adsorption to promote H2O2 formation. The review also covers advances in single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), multi&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts, and highlights non&#8208;noble metal oxides, especially perovskite oxides, for their versatile structures and potential in 2e&#8722; ORR. The potential of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects to enhance catalyst performance is also discussed. In conclusion, emphasis is placed on optimizing catalyst structures through theoretical and experimental methods to achieve efficient and selective H2O2 production, aiming for sustainable and commercial applications.

Abstract
Advanced epidermal electronic devices, capable of real&#8208;time monitoring of physical, physiological, and biochemical signals and administering appropriate therapeutics, are revolutionizing personalized healthcare technology. However, conventional portable electronic devices are predominantly constructed from impermeable and rigid materials, which thus leads to the mechanical and biochemical disparities between the devices and human tissues, resulting in skin irritation, tissue damage, compromised signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR), and limited operational lifespans. To address these limitations, a new generation of wearable on&#8208;skin electronics built on stretchable and porous substrates has emerged. These substrates offer significant advantages including breathability, conformability, biocompatibility, and mechanical robustness, thus providing solutions for the aforementioned challenges. However, given their diverse nature and varying application scenarios, the careful selection and engineering of suitable substrates is paramount when developing high&#8208;performance on&#8208;skin electronics tailored to specific applications. This comprehensive review begins with an overview of various stretchable porous substrates, specifically focusing on their fundamental design principles, fabrication processes, and practical applications. Subsequently, a concise comparison of various methods is offered to fabricate epidermal electronics by applying these porous substrates. Following these, the latest advancements and applications of these electronics are highlighted. Finally, the current challenges are summarized and potential future directions in this dynamic field are explored.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Focusing on chiral inorganic nanomaterials (CINMs), this review elucidates how advanced TEM techniques facilitate precise qualitative analysis of CINMs, including chiral atomic&#8208;level features, 0D, 1D, and 2D nanocrystals, and assemblies. It also highlights quantitative methods for determining chirality, such as 3D electron tomography, and discusses the evolution of chiral structures as monitored by the ex situ and in situ TEM technologies.








Abstract
Chiral inorganic nanomaterials (CINMs) have garnered significant interest due to their exceptional optical, electronic, and catalytic properties, offering promising advancements in energy conversion, data storage, catalysis, and biomedicine. While traditional optical spectrophotometers reveal the chiroptical performance of CINMs on an ensemble level, the direct structural visualization for the qualitative and quantitative discernment of their chiral features has become increasingly distinct with the advancements of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The need for reasonable and high&#8208;standard discrimination requirements of CINMs has driven the progress of chirality&#8208;based TEM technologies. Therefore, this review in the good season takes the initiative to summarize the current advancements in TEM technologies for CINMs characterization, emphasizing a qualitative analysis of chiral atomic&#8208;level features, 0D, 1D, and 2D nanocrystals, and assembled nanomaterials. Then, the quantitative methods for determining chirality is also highlighted, such as 3D electron tomography, and further address the evolution of chiral structures monitored by the Ex&#8208;situ and In&#8208;situ TEM technologies. By providing a roadmap for the current challenges and proposing future advancements in TEM technologies for the qualitative, quantitative, and real&#8208;time analysis of CINMs, it can drive innovations in the field of chiral nanomaterials as well as the development of TEM technologies.

         <title>Sensing Interfaces Engineering for Organic Thin Film Transistors&#8208;Based Biosensors: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 49, December 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs)&#8208;based biosensors are fascinating due to their properties of low cost, label&#8208;free, and inherent signal amplification. The review provides a comprehensive and timely review of optimization in sensing interface engineering, and how efficient immobilization of biological sensing probes on sensing interfaces can contribute to the development of high&#8208;performance OTFTs&#8208;based biosensors.








Abstract
Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) enable rapid and label&#8208;free high&#8208;sensitivity detection of target analytes due to their low cost, large&#8208;area processing, biocompatibility, and inherent signal amplification. At the same time, the freedom of synthesis, tailorability, and functionalization of organic semiconductor materials and their ability to be combined with flexible substrates make them one of the ideal platforms for biosensing. However, OTFTs&#8208;based biosensors still face significant challenges, such as unexpected surface adsorption, disordered conformation, inhomogeneous graft density, and flexibility of probe molecules that biological sensing probes would face during immobilization. In this review, efficient immobilization strategies based on OTFTs biological sensing probes developed in the last 5 years are highlighted. First, the biosensors are classified according to their sensing interface. Second, a comprehensive discussion of the types of biological sensing probes is presented. Third, three commonly used methods for immobilizing biological sensing probes and their challenges are briefly described. Finally, the applications of OTFTs&#8208;based biosensors for liquid phase detection are summarized. This review provides a comprehensive and timely review of optimization in sensing interface engineering so that efficient immobilization of biological sensing probes with sensing interfaces will contribute to the development of high&#8208;performance OTFTs&#8208;based biosensors.
