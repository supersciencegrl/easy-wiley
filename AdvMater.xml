         <title>Photothermally Powered 3D Microgels Mechanically Regulate Mesenchymal Stem Cells Under Anisotropic Force</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photothermally powered microgel is designed to mechanically train mesenchymal stem cells using spatially patterned exogenous forces in three&#8208;dimensional (3D)&#160;workspaces. When microgels are activated selectively via photothermal actuation, locally confined tens of nN forces are exerted on cells, triggering osteogenic differentiation in encapsulated cells.








Abstract
Exogenous forces significantly influence mammalian cell behavior, yet current strategies fail to resolve signaling processes between individual cells under conditions that accurately mimic the native microenvironment. This work presents a new cell culture technology capable of applying spatially patterned exogenous forces on individual cells within multicellular clusters encased in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hydrogel matrices. Photothermally powered 3D microgels containing stem cells and integrated force generators are engineered to investigate intercellular communication under anisotropic forces with excellent spatial resolution (&#8776;1 &#181;m). Varying force patterns, such as uniform compression versus spatially heterogeneous tension, are achieved in 3D by relying on the synergistic effect of plasmonic gold nanorods and thermally responsive co&#8208;polymers under light actuation. The microgels generate 17&#8211;34 nN force locally, which activates mechanically sensitive ion channels in encapsulated cells stimulated with isotropically applied compression and spatially heterogeneous tension in 3D in a selective manner. Spatially patterned exogenous forces trigger F&#8208;actin remodeling, nuclear translocation of Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP) and Runt&#8208;related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2)&#160;in encapsulated cells following cyclic stimulation. Sustained application of exogenous forces over three days is sufficient to regulate stem cell fate toward osteogenesis. This technology allows combinatorial studies of biomolecular and biophysical cues in 3D, making it suitable for applications in mechanobiology and bioengineering.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Based Vat Photopolymerization of Ceramics and Metals with Low Shrinkages via Repeated Infusion Precipitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an in situ precipitation strategy for the hydrogel&#8208;based vat photopolymerization of architected ceramics and metals with reduced shrinkages and improved densities. Repeated infusion&#8208;precipitation significantly increases metal loading within the hydrogels, which improves part quality after thermal conversion. This strategy offers a versatile platform for&#160;the fabrication of&#160;advanced structural and functional materials and next&#8208;generation 3D&#8208;architected devices.








Abstract
Vat photopolymerization (VP) is a powerful tool for the fabrication of architected ceramic and metal structures. However, conventional methods of ceramic/metal VP, such as with the use of slurries or organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid resins, have challenges with viscosities, light&#8208;scattering, and limited material compositions. Recently, the use of metal&#8208;salt solutions has emerged as a promising approach for the VP of ceramics and metals. While versatile and accessible, the process is accompanied by a significant amount of shrinkage, which causes warping, porosity, and structural damage. Here, a versatile method is presented for fabricating dense architected ceramics and metals with low conversion linear shrinkages. Central to this method is a post&#8208;fabrication repeated infusion&#8208;coprecipitation process that progressively&#160;increases the metal loading in the 3D &#8220;blank&#8221; hydrogels. Thermal treatment of these high metal content hydrogels then converts them into ceramic or metal architectures. To demonstrate the versatility of this approach, a variety of 3D ceramic and metal structures with shrinkages as low as 20% while maintaining densities &gt;80% is fabricated. This infusion&#8208;precipitation&#8208;based process thus enables the VP of high&#8208;quality ceramics and metals, which is necessary for the fabrication of advanced architected materials and devices.

         <title>Thermoresponsive Hydrogel with Thermal Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally plastic hydrogels (TP&#8208;gels) encode thermal history via temperature&#8208;dependent polymer&#8211;water miscibility; elastic networks store memory, and elasticity&#8208;constrained demixing actuates opacity. Unlike conventional thermoresponsive gels with a fixed critical temperature (Tc), TP&#8208;gels modulate Tc through thermal training, delivering programmable, equilibrium&#8208;driven phase behavior and swelling&#8208;history&#8208;dependent transitions.








Abstract
Thermal plasticity&#8212;the capacity to dynamically reconfigure material properties in response to thermal history&#8212;is a hallmark of biological systems that remains elusive in synthetic hydrogels. Inspired by coral symbiont acclimatization, thermally plastic hydrogels (TP&#8208;gels) based on polyvinyl butyral are reported, which emulate biological thermal memory through a bioinspired feedback loop: thermoresponsive equilibrium swelling encodes thermal history, while elastic network constraints translate this memory into programmable phase transition thresholds (Tc). By exploiting temperature&#8208;dependent polymer&#8208;water miscibility, TP&#8208;gels achieve multi&#8208;stable states through adaptive swelling, enabling reversible opacity transitions with Tc shifts of 3&#8211;7&#160;&#176;C per thermal training cycle. Crucially, elasticity&#8208;mediated suppression of spinodal decomposition stabilizes metastable states during thermal encoding, preventing premature phase separation. This plasticity is leveraged for cryptographic applications, demonstrating sequential information decryption via thermal trajectory programming&#8212;where spatially resolved&#160;Tc&#160;gradients serve as thermodynamic keys. This work establishes a paradigm for materials with embodied environmental intelligence, bridging the divide between biological adaptability and synthetic systems through thermodynamic metastability engineering.

         <title>Increasing Aromaticity in Selenium&#8208;Embedded Hetero Ring Enables Stable Narrowband Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitter for Long&#8208;Lifetime Pure&#8208;Green OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing aromaticity in a series of selenium&#8208;embedded hetero rings stabilizes the emitter while exploits the advantages of heavy atoms effect, which results in narrowband pure&#8208;green OLEDs with high efficiency, reduced roll&#8208;off and long device lifetime.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) that simultaneously achieve narrowband emission, superior efficiency, and extended operational stability remains a significant challenge for thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials. Herein, a novel molecular architecture is reported that strategically integrates selenium (Se) into a rigid pentagonal aromatic sextet (dibenzoselenophene, DBSe) within a multi&#8208;resonance (MR) framework, addressing the intrinsic limitations of hexagonal Se&#8208;MR systems. The developed molecule DBSe&#8208;BN exhibits a rapid reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rate in the order of 106 s&#8722;1 and narrow emission bandwidth of 21&#160;nm, providing persuasive guarantee for high&#8208;performance pure&#8208;green emission. Notably, the DBSe&#8208;BN&#8208;based OLEDs demonstrate exceptional performance, including a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 38.8%, suppressed efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE1000 = 33.7%), and pure&#8208;green emission, characterized by Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.18, 0.73). The devices exhibit remarkable operational stability, with greatly prolonged lifetime (LT50) of 1341&#160;h based on binary&#8208;emitting system and 5310&#160;h based on the ternary device, at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. This work presents a feasible strategy for gathering high&#8208;performance MR&#8208;TADF emitters, achieving a multi&#8208;dimensional balanced OLED with enhanced FWHM, CIE, EQE, roll&#8208;off and lifetime promoted by Se&#8208;embedded aromatic sextet.

A simple and scalable kneading method using a roller machine is developed to fabricate a biodegradable and highly stretchable starch&#8208;based hydrogel featuring a multi&#8208;bond network structure for durable and multifunctional wearable electronics. The reversible crosslinking from hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, along with MXene nanosheets acting as stress&#8208;transfer centers, endow the hydrogel&#8208;based sensor with high sensitivity, broad sensing range, and excellent durability, allowing accurate detection of physiological signals.








Abstract
With the rapid advancement of hydrogel&#8208;based flexible electronics, multifunctional hydrogels with an emphasis on environmental sustainability have attracted growing attention. In this work, a starch&#8208;based hydrogel featuring a multi&#8208;bond network structure&#8212;composed of amylopectin, polyvinyl alcohol, borax, and MXene nanosheets&#8212;is prepared via a simple, scalable kneading method using a roller machine. The reversible crosslinking from hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, along with MXene nanosheets acting as stress&#8208;transfer centers, endow the hydrogel with exceptional stretchability (&#8764;6151%), high electrical conductivity, fast self&#8208;healing, and strong adhesion. The resulting capacitive sensor exhibits high sensitivity (gauge factor = 1.1), a broad sensing range (up to 300%), and excellent durability, allowing accurate detection of physiological signals. It also enables Morse code&#8208;based encryption of letters, numbers, and punctuation, highlighting its potential in wearable and secure communication technologies. Notably, the hydrogel biodegrades in natural soil within 20 days, addressing electronic waste concerns. This study presents a recyclable, high&#8208;performance hydrogel with broad application prospects in flexible electronics, healthcare monitoring, and assistive communication.

         <title>Multimodal Nanoregulator Rescues Impaired Neurovascular Units to Attenuate Secondary Injury Following Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recognition of the multifaceted nature of traumatic brain injury (TBI), a multimodal nanotherapeutic platform that simultaneously targets multiple key pathological processes involved in neurovascular unit disruption, attenuating secondary brain injury and enhancing cognitive outcomes is developed.








Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) triggers complex neurovascular unit (NVU) damage via ischemia, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and persistent immune activation, contributing to long&#8208;term neurological deficits. However, effective NVU repair remains challenging due to the multifactorial nature of secondary injury. Here, a novel multimodal nanotherapeutic platform designed to concurrently target multiple key pathological events underlying NVU disruption is presented. This nanodrug integrates ultrasmall cerium oxide nanoparticles and IRAK&#8208;4 siRNA within a ROS&#8208;responsive poly(1,4&#8208;phenyleneacetone dimethylene thioketal) (PPADT) matrix, cloaked with neutrophil membranes for inflammation homing. At the injury lesion, the responsive nature enables on&#8208;demand drug release, eliciting synergistic therapeutic actions. Specifically, the cerium nanodots catalyze ROS scavenging and oxygen generation, alleviating oxidative stress and hypoxia to facilitate blood&#8211;brain barrier restoration, pericyte repair, and improved cerebral perfusion. Simultaneously, IRAK&#8208;4 siRNA downregulates pro&#8208;inflammatory signaling and reprograms microglia toward an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. In a murine TBI model, the nanotherapy promotes vascular repair, reduces brain edema, attenuates neuroinflammation, and preserves neuronal integrity. Additionally, treatment ameliorates sleep spindle loss, reduces epileptiform activity, and significantly improves cognitive performance in learning and memory tasks. This work highlights a multipronged therapeutic strategy capable of restoring NVU homeostasis and mitigating secondary brain injury, offering great promise for advancing TBI treatment.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Preparation of Ethyl Cellulose Films with Asymmetric Graded Pores for Low Dielectric Printing Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Niu et&#160;al. present a one&#8208;step preparation method for ethyl cellulose asymmetric porous films with dense skins based on the dry phase inversion technique and breath figure phenomenon. The entire pore&#8208;forming process is completed using only ethanol and water. The porous film's relative permittivity can be significantly reduced to 2.02 (6 GHz) and is suitable for Sub&#8208;6GHz printing radio frequency substrate.








Abstract
The innovation of communication technology and the proliferation of the Internet of Things have propelled the exploitation and application of mid&#8208;to&#8208;low end and disposable radio frequency devices, alongside the development of low dielectric materials. Traditional petroleum&#8208;based low dielectric substrates, led by polyimide, present several challenges, including higher cost, non&#8208;renewability, difficulty in disposal and recycling, rendering them unsuitable for disposable applications. In this study, the asymmetric ethyl cellulose (EC) porous film with dense skins is prepared in one step by the evaporation process of EC/ethanol/H2O solution. The synergistic pore&#8208;forming mechanism of the dry phase inversion technique and breath figure&#160;phenomenon is proposed based on EC pore morphology. The relative permittivity of the asymmetric EC porous film is 2.02 &#177; 0.03 (6&#160;GHz), demonstrating satisfactory dielectric stability, printing adaptability, and bending ability. The EC in discarded printed antennas and remnants from the film&#8208;making process can be separated and recovered through a simple dissolution and centrifugation process. The green and simple preparation process, extremely low manufacturing cost, excellent recyclability, and potential roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll process adaptability make asymmetric EC porous film highly competitive in the mid&#8208;to&#8208;low end and disposable centimetre wave radio frequency device substrate fields.

         <title>Advances in Intelligent Nano&#8208;Micro&#8208;Scale Sensors and Actuators: Moving toward Self&#8208;Sustained Edge AI Microsystems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a system&#8208;level synthesis of advances enabling next&#8208;generation Edge&#8208;AI microsystems: transduction materials and mechanisms, hybrid photonic&#8211;MEMS platforms, rigid and stretchable devices, in/near&#8208;sensor computing, and tribo/piezo energy harvesting. Integrating photonics&#8208;enabled sensing and AI across edge and cloud will yield autonomous, human&#8208;centric systems and energy&#8208;aware AIoT, including digital&#8208;human twins and city sensing commons across healthcare, industry, and smart cities.








Abstract
Over recent decades, nano&#8208;micro&#8208;scale sensors and actuators have evolved from discrete microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) components. As demand for maintenance&#8208;free systems grew, developments emphasized integrating energy harvesting into sensing platforms and deploying self&#8208;powered sensors that utilize piezoelectric and triboelectric transducers. Such co&#8208;localization enabled self&#8208;sustained Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things (IoT) deployments, supporting continuous operation without external power and improving network autonomy and scalability. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) at the sensor edge has further transformed these platforms into intelligent AI&#8208;of&#8208;Things (AIoT) systems, enabling multimodal analytics, adaptive decision&#8208;making, and immersive human&#8211;machine interaction. Concurrently, advances in photonics&#8212;including mid&#8208;infrared, terahertz, and near&#8208;infrared technologies&#8212;have produced sensitive molecular and chemical sensors with improved selectivity and spectral resolution. These advances have also yielded photonic integrated circuits capable of ultrafast in&#8208;sensor computation and real&#8208;time Bayesian photonic neural inference, delivering sophisticated edge&#8208;AI processing with low latency and power consumption. Hybrid systems that combine flexible wearable electronics with integrated photonic platforms have emerged, allowing direct transduction and interpretation of mechanical and physiological signals from flexible sensors via photonic chips. Progress in materials, packaging, and system co&#8208;design underpins reliability and operation in harsh environments. Together, these advances foreshadow highly integrated, self&#8208;sustained edge&#8208;AI microsystems that embody perpetual, real&#8208;time intelligence and seamless user&#8211;environment interaction.

         <title>Bi&#8208;Functional Topospecific Nanoparticles to Promote Immune&#8208;Tumor Cell Engagement as A New Immunotherapeutic Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Janus&#8208;engineered nanoplatform (J&#8208;pHLIP&#8208;PD1), featuring separate tumor&#8208; and immune&#8208;targeting faces, bridges melanoma cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes using toposelective pHLIP and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 presentation. This strategy elicits robust antitumor responses, promotes immunogenic tumor cell death, suppresses lung metastasis in vivo, and provides a modular, safer alternative for versatile immune engagement in cancer therapy.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a promising alternative approach, enabling the body's immune system to fight cancer. Cytotoxic T cells play a pivotal role in recognizing and eliminating tumor cells, and their effectiveness relies on establishing a physical interaction and efficient communication with cancer cells. However, this communication is often disrupted by immune escape mechanisms, allowing cancer progression. A versatile nanoplatform is developed to restore cellular connection using Janus mesoporous silica&#8208;Au nanoparticle (J&#8208;pHLIP&#8208;PD1), including specific binding sites on opposite faces for simultaneous binding to cancer cells and immune cells. The two differential surfaces on the nanoparticle allow orthogonal functionalization with the anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody that interacts with the PD&#8208;1 receptor in cytotoxic T cells on the gold face and the pH Low Insertion Peptide (pHLIP), which undergoes specific insertion into the tumor cell membrane on the silica face. J&#8208;pHLIP&#8208;PD1 nanoparticles effectively bind the surface of tumor cells and capture T cells, facilitating the formation of immune synapse&#8208;like structures that lead to reduced cancer cell viability in vitro, associated with immunogenic cell death signatures. The therapeutic potential of J&#8208;pHLIP&#8208;PD1 is also demonstrated in an in vivo metastatic melanoma model, where treatment with J&#8208;pHLIP&#8208;PD1 produces a significant decrease in metastatic burden and increases T cell presence. The Janus nanosystem represents an attractive platform that expands the toolbox of immune&#8208;engaging strategies, offering a flexible alternative to conventional immunotherapies that link immune and tumor cells, restoring cell&#8211;cell communication for cancer elimination.

         <title>Achieving Electrode Smoothing by Controlling the Nucleation Phase of Metal Deposition Through Polymer&#8208;Substrate Binding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals how polyethylene oxide (PEO) facilitates smooth electrode deposition using in situ experiments and simulations. PEO does not bind to Zn or Zn2+ to control growth but adsorbs on Cu, tuning Zn/Cu/electrolyte interfacial energy. This promotes the nucleation of flat&#8208;lying Zn (002) platelets and confines Zn electrodeposition to a narrow region near the interface.








Abstract
Polymer additives [like polyethylene oxide (PEO)] are widely used for smooth electrode deposition in aqueous zinc and many other battery systems. However, the precise mechanism by which they regulate morphology and suppress dendrite formation remains unclear. In this study, the knowledge gap is addressed by using in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy to directly observe the interfacial evolution during Zn electrodeposition and polymer adsorption on Cu substrates in the presence of varying concentrations of ZnSO4 and PEO. Contrary to previous literature assumptions, which emphasize the binding to the growing Zn crystal surfaces or Zn2+ ions, the results demonstrate that PEO smooths Zn films by promoting nucleation of (002)&#8208;oriented Zn platelets through interactions with the Cu substrate. Density functional theory simulations support this finding by showing that PEO adsorption on Cu modifies the interfacial energy of Zn/Cu/electrolyte interfaces, favoring the stabilization of Zn (002) on the Cu substrate, as well as confines Zn electrodeposition to a narrow near&#8208;surface region. These findings elucidate a novel design principle for electrode smoothing, emphasizing the importance of substrate selection paired with polymer additives that exhibit an attractive interaction with the substrate but minimal interaction with growing crystals, offering a mechanistic perspective for improved battery performance.

         <title>Magnetic Microrobot With Drilling&#8208;Sensing Dual Functionality for Targeted Biopsy of Deep&#8208;Seated Tracheal Microlesions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional microrobot with gold nanospikes enables magnetic navigation, lesion sampling, and AI&#8208;enhanced SERS&#8208;based tissue analysis for targeted biopsy of deep&#8208;seated tracheal microlesions. This integrated micro&#8208;robotic approach represents an accurate, noninvasive, and rapid biopsy technology, providing proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept solution to renovate current clinical workflows for early lung cancer diagnosis.








Abstract
Biopsy remains gold standard for definitive diagnosis of numerous diseases, yet conventional approaches confront inherent limitations encompassing procedural invasiveness, limited spatial resolution, poor deep&#8208;tissue accessibility, and complicated post&#8208;operative histopathology examinations. Herein, a multifunctional magnetically actuated microrobotic platform for targeted biopsy of deep&#8208;seated micro&#8208;lesion in lung for potential use of early lung cancer diagnosis is reported. This conical helix&#8208;structured microrobot features controllable gold nanospike decoration at its tip, integrating dual functionality in drilling&#8208;enabled tissue sampling and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) biosensing. Utilizing real&#8208;time tracheoscopy and fluoroscopy guidance, this platform achieves magnetic navigation through saline&#8208;filled bronchi to target lesions, followed by on&#8208;demand sampling and retrieval, whose feasibility is systematically verified through ex vivo porcine lung models and in vivo rabbit trials. The collected biomarker and tissue samples can be rapidly recognized and quantified based on SERS spectroscopy. Moreover, through establishing a convolutional neural network&#8208;based deep learning model, it is succeed to distinguish between the healthy and various cancerous lung tissues from clinical patients, achieving a recognition accuracy of over 94.3% within just 3&#160;min. Therefore, this work represents a microrobot&#8208;based biopsy techniques for noninvasive and precise sampling in lung with diagnosis capability of early&#8208;stage lung cancer, offering substantial improvements over conventional biopsy methods.

         <title>Synergistic Catalysis of Pt&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy Clusters Coupled with Super&#8208;Hydrophilic CeO2 Enables Efficient Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel catalyst composed of Pt&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy clusters coupled with super&#8208;hydrophilic CeO2 is developed. This coupling simultaneously enhances the intrinsic activity and accelerates the interfacial H2O dissociation kinetics for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. When integrated into an anion exchange membrane water electrolysis, the system achieves low cell voltages of 1.74 V at 1 A cm&#8722;2, and can maintain its performance for at least 500 h at an industrial&#8208;level current density.








Abstract
Simultaneously enhancing the intrinsic activity and accelerating H2O dissociation kinetics is crucial for developing advanced low&#8208;Pt electrocatalysts for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a low&#8208;noble&#8208;metal Pt&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy alloy clusters coupled with super&#8208;hydrophilic CeO2 on porous carbon support (Pt&#8208;HEA&#8208;cluster/CeO2/C) is developed. The optimized Pt&#8208;HEA&#8208;cluster/CeO2/C catalyst exhibits the faster Volmer&#8208;Tafel mechanism with an exceptionally low overpotential of 12.3 mV at &#8722;10 mA cm&#8722;2 in 1.0 m KOH, surpassing the benchmark commercial Pt/C (32.2 mV). When integrated into an anion exchange membrane water electrolysis, the system achieves low cell voltages of 1.74 V at 1 A cm&#8722;2, and can maintain its performance for at least 500 h at an industrial&#8208;level current density. Operando spectroscopy and density functional theory&#160;calculations reveal that H2O preferentially adsorbs on Ce site of CeO2, while the interfacial Pt sites in contact with Ce can simultaneously act as efficient active sites for H2O dissociation, thus significantly enhancing the sluggish Volmer kinetics via Ce&#8208;Pt dual&#8208;site synergy. Concurrently, the electronic structure of surface Pt sites is synergistically regulated through the metal bonds in the HEA and interfacial Pt&#9472;O&#9472;Ce linkage, thus effectively optimizing its hydrogen adsorption free energy. This work establishes a new paradigm in synergistic catalysis between Pt&#8208;HEA&#8208;clusters and CeO2 for efficient alkaline HER.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Demonstration of wide&#8208;field visual neurons employing MoSe2/MoS2 heterojunctions with TS integration. The population&#8208;coded architecture reduces information distortion rate by 82.1% vs single devices (p &lt; 0.0001), while achieving broad receptive field coverage through complementary 473 nm (MoS2) and 808 nm (MoSe2) sensitivity. This bio&#8208;inspired design combines mammalian visual principles with scalable semiconductor fabrication for advanced machine vision applications.








Abstract
Modern neuromorphic systems face critical bottlenecks in emulating biological vision, particularly in reconciling wide&#8208;spectrum perception, distortion&#8208;free encoding, and population&#8208;level signal processing. Drawing inspiration from the stochastic&#8208;resilient population coding of macaque visual neurons, an advanced visual neuron prototype is developed that incorporates photoelectric multi&#8208;stimulation field&#8208;effect transistor and innovative parallel threshold&#8208;switch architecture. The visual neuron integrates broadband photodetection (350&#8211;1000 nm) with biomimetic spike population encoding in a monolithic architecture. The photosensitive MoSe2/MoS2 heterojunction region in field&#8208;effect transistor extends the visual perception field from UV to infrared wavelengths (350&#8211;700 nm to 350&#8211;1000 nm), doubling the original field. Meanwhile, under the same conditions, the photocurrent response achieves a 1.36&#8208;fold increase from 0.109 to 0.148 A (W&#8201;cm&#8722;2)&#8722;1. The parallel threshold&#8208;switching design transforms single&#8208;unit encoding into cooperative population coding, achieving an 82.1% reduction rate in signal distortion. When deployed in a spiking neural network, this population&#8208;coding paradigm demonstrates high accuracy in pattern recognition, surpassing single neuron architectures by 12.1%, while maintaining the information processing time at the biological scale (&lt;200 ms). By unifying van der Waals heterostructure photonics with macaque&#8208;derived neural population coding principles, this work establishes a transformative framework for bioinspired vision hardware, bridging the critical gap between neuromorphic materials and cortical processing efficiency.

Low&#8208;temperature co&#8208;fired ceramics integrate MOF&#8208;derived hierarchical alumina particles within a glass matrix. This design achieves excellent solar reflectance and thermal emittance, enabling dual functions: building energy conservation and enhanced photovoltaic efficiency. This work advances large&#8208;scale production of passive radiative cooling materials for sustainable energy solutions, accelerating the global transition to climate&#8208;neutral infrastructure.








Abstract
To combat the global energy crisis, passive radiative cooling materials provide more sustainable solutions to save energy for cooling buildings and capture renewable energy for powering them. However, the design of passive radiative cooling materials is subject to a trade&#8208;off between solar reflectance and practicality. To overcome this dilemma, a low&#8208;temperature co&#8208;firing ceramic is reported that integrates hierarchically structured alumina particles&#8212;derived from nano/micro metal&#8211;organic frameworks&#8212;within a glass matrix. These alumina particles enhance light backscattering by utilizing optimized geometric parameters and high porosity to achieve near&#8208;perfect solar reflectance (&gt;0.98), while the glass matrix ensures high long&#8208;wave infrared emittance (0.93). This synergy enables a maximum sub&#8208;ambient temperature reduction of 7.4&#160;&#176;C during the daytime and a midday short&#8208;circuit current boost of 10.46 mA. Global simulations project a net CO2 emission reduction of 1.43 billion metric tons through reducing cooling demands and enhancing photovoltaic output. Combined with robust mechanical strength (43 MPa), UV resistance (&gt;2000 h), superhydrophobicity (150&#176; water contact angle, maintaining an exceptional solar reflectance of 0.97), flame resistance (&gt;1000&#160;&#176;C tolerance), and near&#8208;100% recyclability, this low&#8208;cost and scalable ceramic provides an effective strategy to accelerate the global transition toward climate&#8208;neutral infrastructure.

         <title>D&#8208;Band Width Rationally Broadened by Configuring Nearest Coordination of Metal Site for Enhanced Active Site&#8208;Intermediate Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational coordination engineering broadens the d&#8208;band width of metal sites, establishing a linear relationship with intermediate adsorption. An optimal window of broadening achieves peak hydrogen evolution activity, while deviations induce performance loss. This strategy transcends conventional valence&#8208;state modulation and offers a universal framework for designing high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;based site, as an important type of active site, plays the benchmarking role in the redox and charge transfer processes in the heterogeneous catalysis. Modulating the valence state of metal site as a promising and simple strategy theoretically enables control over the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates. However, this strategy is intrinsically limited by the local atomic configuration, often leading to unpredictable catalytic failures. Here, it is reported that the intermediate adsorption strength of platinum active site with different valence states exhibits a linear relationship with the d&#8208;band width of Pt (Wd&#8208;Pt). Adjusting the nearest&#8208;neighbor coordination environment of Pt sites by changing the transition metals bonded to Pt effectively modulates the Wd&#8208;Pt, which offers a high activity (&#951;10 = 14 mV) in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Wd&#8208;Pt broadening elevates the Pt&#9472;H anti&#8208;bonding states across the Fermi level, strengthening active site&#8208;absorbate interactions and thereby tuning HER catalytic activity. In addition, this d&#8208;band width engineering strategy can be expanded to other catalysts with the metal active site. The present study transcends limitations in valence state modulation and sheds light on deeper understanding of d&#8208;band structure of metal sites and a methodology to boost the activity of metal sites in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Control of Effective Elastomer Density Enables Mechanically Robust and High&#8208;Efficiency Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective elastomer density (De) is introduced as a unified descriptor linking elastomer structure to device performance. A critical De enables optimal balance between efficiency and stretchability. At critical De, intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells achieved an initial power conversion efficiency of 14.3% with 80% retention at 30.6% strain, representing the highest performance reported for elastomer&#8211;plasticized IS&#8208;OSCs.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs) are highly promising for next&#8208;generation wearable electronics. The incorporation of thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) provides a cost&#8208;effective strategy to improve mechanical compliance. However, the influence of TPE structural diversity on device performance has been largely overlooked. In this work, the concept of effective elastomer density (De) is introduced as a unified molecular descriptor to quantitatively evaluate how elastomer structures affect IS&#8208;OSC morphology and functionality. It is demonstrated that increasing De enhances stretchability by inducing domain coarsening and surface roughening in amorphous regions, but simultaneously prolongs exciton lifetimes and suppresses charge extraction and transport. Notably, IS&#8208;OSCs achieve an optimal balance at a critical De of 1.5 mol&#160;m&#8722;3, delivering a high initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.3% and retaining 80% of the initial PCE at 30.6% strain, representing the best performance reported to date for IS&#8208;OSCs employing the elastomer&#8208;plasticization strategy. This descriptor&#8208;based framework provides a predictive and generalizable guideline for the molecular design of elastomers in stretchable optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Biomimetic Water&#8208;Based Metamaterial Absorber for Ultrabroadband Radar Stealth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the hierarchical porous architecture of Pachliopta aristolochiae butterfly wings and leveraging the intrinsic dielectric dispersion of water, a biomimetic water&#8208;based metamaterial absorber is proposed. Simulation and experiments show that the absorber has properties of ultra&#8208;broadband performance, angular stability, and scalable fabrication, can be used for adaptive camouflage, electromagnetic shielding, and multispectral stealth technologies.








Abstract
Inspired by the hierarchical porous architecture of Pachliopta aristolochiae butterfly wings and leveraging the intrinsic dielectric dispersion of water, it proposes a biomimetic water&#8208;based metamaterial absorber. Breaking conventional compactness&#8208;bandwidth trade&#8208;offs, this work integrates aqueous metamaterials with bio&#8208;inspired architecture, combining butterfly&#8208;derived hierarchical porosity and water's dielectric dispersion to achieve unprecedented microwave absorption. The absorber employs hexagonal water cavities in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix, mimicking butterfly&#8208;wing multiscale pores to extend wave paths through cascaded resonances. Water serves as &#8220;artificial melanin,&#8221; enabling tunable dielectric loss via molecular relaxation, with absorption dynamically adjusted through water column height/temperature for frequency&#8208;shifting and bandwidth broadening. The centrosymmetric geometry ensures polarization insensitivity and wide&#8208;angle stability. Optimized aqueous unit coupling achieves &gt;95% experimentally verified absorption (17.11&#8211;35.74&#160;GHz) and &gt;10&#160;dB simulated radar cross section (RCS) reduction. Experimental validation shows that the measured absorptivity is in high agreement with the simulation results. Unlike rigid multilayered alternatives, this water&#8208;PDMS architecture offers optical transparency, flexibility, and inherent fluidic tunability for functional reconfiguration. With advantages in ultra&#8208;broadband performance, angular stability, and scalable fabrication, the proposed absorber opens new avenues for adaptive camouflage, electromagnetic shielding, and multispectral stealth technologies.

         <title>Innate Immune&#8208;Cloaked Microgel&#8208;Coated Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Reverse Persistent Pulmonary Fibrosis via Reparative Macrophages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft microgel coating is developed with a &#8220;self&#8221; peptide that helps mesenchymal stromal cells evade innate immune clearance. These engineered cells reverse fibrosis through secreted signals. Single&#8208;cell analysis reveals a special macrophage type that drives healing. This approach enables a living pharmacy for long&#8208;term tissue repair.








Abstract
The innate immune system plays a dual role in both mediating pathogenic processes following tissue damage and acting as a barrier to effective therapeutic delivery. Strategies that evade immune clearance while modulating host immune components offer promising solutions for treating complex chronic diseases, such as fibrosis. Here, an innate immune checkpoint material&#8208;based strategy is presented in which mesenchymal stromal cells, coated with a soft conformal microgel and functionalized with the CD47 self&#8208;marker agonist, effectively evade clearance by tissue resident macrophages. These engineered cells reverse persistent fibrotic damage in the lungs through a paracrine mechanism. Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing identifies a transitional antigen&#8208;presenting macrophage subpopulation that mediates these reparative effects.

&lt;p&gt;A soft microgel coating is developed with a &#8220;self&#8221; peptide that helps mesenchymal stromal cells evade innate immune clearance. These engineered cells reverse fibrosis through secreted signals. Single-cell analysis reveals a special macrophage type that drives healing. This approach enables a living pharmacy for long-term tissue repair.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The innate immune system plays a dual role in both mediating pathogenic processes following tissue damage and acting as a barrier to effective therapeutic delivery. Strategies that evade immune clearance while modulating host immune components offer promising solutions for treating complex chronic diseases, such as fibrosis. Here, an innate immune checkpoint material-based strategy is presented in which mesenchymal stromal cells, coated with a soft conformal microgel and functionalized with the CD47 self-marker agonist, effectively evade clearance by tissue resident macrophages. These engineered cells reverse persistent fibrotic damage in the lungs through a paracrine mechanism. Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies a transitional antigen-presenting macrophage subpopulation that mediates these reparative effects. By combining immune cloaking with the presentation of local signals encoded in the gel coatings, this strategy can be used to design secretory cells for long-term tissue remodeling, enabling a living pharmacy for chronic tissue damage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Giant Shell Nanorods for High&#8208;Efficiency and Low&#8208;Roll&#8208;Off Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that low&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio CdSe&#8208;based nanorods enhance charge confinement, suppress leakage current, and limit EQE roll&#8208;off to just 2% across 25&#8211;1&#8201;000 mA cm&#8722;2, enabling red NR&#8208;LEDs with record&#8208;high efficiency (23.4%), brightness (289&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2), and lifetime (T95 10&#8201;638 h at 1&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2).








Abstract
1D colloidal semiconductor nanorods (NRs) offer polarized emission and enhanced photon out&#8208;coupling efficiency for high&#8208;efficiency light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, their practical application has been limited by severe efficiency roll&#8208;off at high current densities due to thin radial shells along the radial direction and the high aspect ratio that leads to random orientation during the fabrication of solution&#8208;processed films, which causes structural gaps, triggering leakage currents and ultimately exacerbating efficiency roll&#8208;off. Here, fatty acid is introduced to mitigate the c&#8208;axial growth induced by phosphonic acid in traditional NRs synthesis, while promoting radial shell growth, thereby forming giant&#8208;shell CdSe/CdZnSe/CdS/CdZnS NRs with an aspect ratio of &#8776;2.2. This design effectively alleviates electron leakage caused by random orientation in NR films, while minimizing interfacial defects and Auger recombination, achieving a near&#8208;unity PLQY. Consequently, NR&#8208;LEDs based on these NRs exhibit a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.4% and a luminance of 289&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. Significantly, this NR design greatly suppresses the EQE roll&#8208;off at high current density. Furthermore, the devices have a long T95 lifetime of more than 10&#160;000&#160;h at a luminance of 1&#160;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. This material design strategy lays the foundation for realizing highly polarized NR&#8208;LEDs for efficient high&#8208;definition displays.

         <title>Cooling Crystallization at Solid Interfaces en Route to a Janus Nanocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique RuNiW/W2C Janus structure are synthesized through a cooling crystallization strategy, serving as highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for urea assisted hydrogen production.








Abstract
Hydrogen production via water electrolysis is limited by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however replacing OER with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) provides a promising, energy&#8208;efficient alternative. The development of Janus electrocatalysts offers new opportunities to address the intrinsic complexity problem of the UOR, which involves multiple electron transfers. Here, a cooling crystallization strategy is reported, guided by carbophilicity differences, to synthesize multi&#8208;metallic RuNiW/W2C Janus nanoparticles as efficient catalysts for catalyzing the UOR. In the synthesis, W2C forms during the initial heating stage and serves as a substrate that promotes the exsolution and subsequent growth of the RuNiW phase upon cooling. This Janus electrocatalyst demonstrates outstanding bifunctional performance, requiring only 1.40&#160;V versus RHE for the UOR and an overpotential of 133&#160;mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction to achieve a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, it enables urea&#8208;assisted electrolyzer to operate continuously for over 200 h. Both experiments and calculations confirm that the Janus structure effectively modulates the valence state of Ni component, optimizing urea adsorption and reducing the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step. This work provides a new avenue for designing highly efficient Janus electrocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen production.

         <title>Rigid Supramolecular Aramid Nanotubes as Catalyst Supports</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular nanotube self&#8208;assemblies with high aspect&#8208;ratios and stiffness are demonstrated as nanocatalyst supports. The extended dimensions and tunable surface chemistries of the nanotubes enable tethered gold nanoparticle catalysts to remain dispersed in solution and to be easily recovered through simple filtration. This study establishes self&#8208;assembled 1D nanomaterials as versatile scaffolds for the reuse and recovery of next&#8208;generation nanocatalysts.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;phase heterogeneous catalysts benefit from nanoscale dimensions, which maximize specific surface area and enhance catalytic activity. However, the ease of recovering such nanocatalysts depends on the design of the support materials, which are often particle&#8208;like. Rigid 1D nanomaterials are proposed as supports that can enhance separability while offering high volumetric specific surface area for greater catalyst loading and activity. Here, aramid amphiphiles (AAs) are designed to spontaneously self&#8208;assemble in water into high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio supramolecular nanotubes with tunable surface chemistry. These AA nanotubes exhibit high persistence lengths (P = 750 &#177; 340 &#181;m) and mechanical stiffnesses (3 N/m). Incorporating surface thiol groups enables immobilization of catalytic gold nanoparticles. The resulting AA nanotube&#8208;gold nanoparticle complexes exhibit high catalytic activity, efficient recoverability via simple microfiltration, and sustained reusability over ten reaction cycles. This study demonstrates the utility of molecular self&#8208;assembled 1D nanomaterials as versatile scaffolds for the reuse and recovery of nanoscale catalysts.

         <title>Tuning Molecular Afterglow via Rare&#8208;Earth Complexation in Monodisperse SiO2 Microparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the tunable afterglow of 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;doped SiO2 microparticles via rare&#8208;earth complexation. Afterglow quantum yield and lifetime are tuned from 3.00% to 9.02% and 0.07 to 1.46&#160;s, respectively. Notably, the paramagnetic effect of rare&#8208;earth ions proves more effective than their heavy&#8208;atom effect in the afterglow tuning, enabling the development of a library of customizable, optically active SiO2 microparticles for photonic crystal applications.








Abstract
Rational control of triplet&#8208;state emissions in organic molecules is key to advancing organic phosphors for optoelectronic applications. However, achieving precise modulation of both afterglow intensity and lifetime remains challenging. Here, a tunable afterglow system based on 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (1,10&#8208;phen), enabled by rare&#8208;earth (RE3+) complexation and incorporation into SiO2 microparticles (MPs) under hydrothermal conditions, is presented. Doping 1,10&#8208;phen into SiO2 MPs activates phosphorescence at 488&#160;nm, with a quantum yield of 2.59% and a lifetime of 1.14&#160;s. Upon coordination with various RE3+ ions (La3&#8314;, Y3&#8314;, Gd3&#8314;, Lu3&#8314;), both the quantum yield (3.00&#8211;9.02%) and afterglow lifetime (0.07&#8211;1.46&#160;s) are finely tunable. Remarkably, Gd3&#8314;, through its paramagnetic effect, enhances intersystem crossing more efficiently than the heavy&#8208;atom effect of Lu3&#8314;, resulting in a higher quantum yield but a shorter afterglow duration. In contrast, Y3&#8314;, which lacks a heavy&#8208;atom effect, increases the rigidity of the 1,10&#8208;phen framework, thereby improving the phosphorescence quantum yield to 3.11% and extending the afterglow lifetime to 1.46&#160;s. These findings highlight a versatile and effective strategy for tuning the optical properties of organic molecules via RE3+ complexation within SiO2 matrices, offering promising potential for the development of advanced photonic crystal platforms in optoelectronic technologies.

These findings highlight a versatile and effective strategy for tuning the optical properties of organic molecules via RE&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; complexation within SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; matrices, offering promising potential for the development of advanced photonic crystal platforms in optoelectronic technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biological and Biologically Inspired Functional Nanostructures: Insights into Structural, Optical, Thermal, and Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological and biologically&#8208;inspired functional nanostructures with structural, thermal, optical, and sensing applications are reviewed. The role of nanoscale features in biological materials on performance is described, and their blueprints are used for bio&#8208;inspired nanomaterials, synthesized using advanced techniques (i.e., photolithography, bio&#8208;templating, additive manufacturing), demonstrating analogous functional mechanisms and superior performance relative to conventional materials.








Abstract
Biological materials developed over millennia consist of simple biogenic materials, yet exhibit exceptional functional properties. Leveraging design features from these structures with engineered nanomaterial components can lead to bio&#8208;inspired structures that demonstrate superior performance over traditional engineering materials. We describe nanoscale based architectures in biological systems, their role in enhancement of structural, optical, thermal and sensing properties, and their subsequent translation to bio&#8208;inspired structures. In structurally robust biological materials, we highlight nanoscale design features that enhance strength and stiffness, while retaining toughness. In optically active biological materials, we show how periodic nanostructures manipulate electromagnetic waves resulting in structural coloration as well as antireflective and camouflaging properties. Thermally regulating biological materials utilize nanopores and other nanostructural features to statically or dynamically control temperature. In addition, biological materials that are used in sensing utilize various nanostructures that enhance sensitivity by decreasing activation thresholds for signal transduction. We discuss challenges and opportunities including understanding control mechanisms in the formation of biological materials and leveraging advancements in self&#8208;assembly with new additive manufacturing techniques. The continued evaluation of organisms, including those that exhibit multifunctionality, provides not only new design features and pathways, but significant prospects for innovation in this ever&#8208;emerging field.

         <title>Surface Energy&#8208;Confined Multi&#8208;Layer Inkjet Printing for Customizable Optical Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface energy&#8208;confined multi&#8208;layer inkjet printing strategy is developed for customizable fabrication of 3D optical microstructures. By combining interfacial energy confinement with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer processing, various 3D curved optical microstructures with tailorable morphology, material composition, and spatial configuration are precisely fabricated and integrated, offering great promise for applications in miniaturized optical systems, multi&#8208;dimensional imaging, and high&#8208;security encryption.








Abstract
Inkjet printing emerges as a versatile on&#8208;demand patterning technique for additive manufacturing of optical microstructures, yet its ability to regulate the ink droplet morphology is constrained by the intrinsic interplay between ink&#8208;substrate wetting conditions, thereby hindering the customizable fabrication of 3D microstructures. Here, a surface energy&#8208;confined multi&#8208;layer inkjet printing strategy is developed for precisely fabricating curved optical microstructures with tunable size, solid angle, and configuration. The strategy is implemented through custom&#8208;engineered layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer printing on a pre&#8208;patterned substrate with spatially defined interfacial energy barriers, enabling the precise construction and integration of distinct optical microdomes (characterized by substrate attachment and uniform curved profiles) at the microscale. Notably, the strategy facilitates the high&#8208;throughput printing of diverse topological microdomes, ranging from triangular to hexagonal architectures. The as&#8208;fabricated microdomes, featuring precisely engineered morphology and sub&#8208;nanometer surface roughness, exhibit integrated light&#8208;field manipulation capabilities and unique multifocal characteristics, highlighting their potential for miniaturized optical systems and intelligent imaging devices. Beyond UV&#8208;cured polymers, this methodology is extendable to nanomaterial&#8208;based micro&#8208;3D printing (e.g., colloidal photonic crystal microdomes), opening avenues for more sophisticated optical functionalities. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a non&#8208;imaging multidimensional encryption platform is printed leveraging 3D morphology&#8208;tailored optical readout.

         <title>Spatiotemporally Engineered Protein Delivery via Integrated Covalent Coupling and Pathological Triggers for Precision Microenvironment Reprogramming in Tissue Injury Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;responsive biomaterial platform is developed for spatiotemporally controlled factor delivery in response to phase&#8208;specific enzymes (MMP2/thrombin). Using natural biomaterials (HA, SCECM, chitosan) and enzymatic conjugation (Sortase A), the system precisely delivers each protein in spinal cord and myocardial infarction models, this sequential release strategy significantly enhances tissue repair by optimizing the therapeutic window.








Abstract
Tissue injury presents a complex microenvironment with temporal pathological dynamics, necessitating precision therapeutic strategies. However, current interventions lack effective measures that precisely respond to and modulate the dynamic changes in the microenvironment. Herein, a biomaterial&#8208;driven platform based on covalent conjugation and enzyme&#8208;responsive release, enabling the spatiotemporally controlled delivery of regenerative and immunomodulatory factors, is developed. Following tissue injury, the early&#8208;phase protease thrombin and the delayed&#8208;phase matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP2) serve as endogenous triggers that correspond to distinct stages of the microenvironmental evolution. By site&#8208;specific covalent conjugation via Sortase A (SrtA)&#8208;mediated transpeptidation to intraluminal aligned fibers, combined with outer encapsulation within T&#8208;HA (thrombin&#8208;responsive cleavable hyaluronic acid gel), it is discovered that sequential delivery (CNTF/FGF2 followed by IL&#8208;4) significantly enhances spinal cord injury (SCI) recovery compared to reverse sequencing (IL&#8208;4 followed by CNTF/FGF2). Likewise, SrtA&#8208;mediated protein conjugation to HA demonstrates that FGF2 delivery preceding IL&#8208;4 resulted in superior cardiac functional restoration in the myocardial infarction (MI) model. This spatiotemporally system optimizes the critical therapeutic window for inflammation and tissue remodeling after injury, offering a versatile paradigm for addressing the challenges posed by the dynamic nature of injured tissues.

         <title>De Novo Design of Polyimides Leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de novo design strategy for polyimides based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed and an agent, DAPiGen, for generating specific polyimides is constructed. These findings highlight the pivotal role of diamines in polyimide properties. Rigorously validated, the strategy has yielded a novel polyimide with good overall performance.








Abstract
Designing molecular structures has long been a central pursuit in organic films with super properties. However, the vast chemical space of candidate molecules poses a challenge in screening optimal materials with exceptional performance. Herein, a multi&#8208;objective performance&#8208;oriented strategy driven by deep reinforcement learning and train an agent, DAPiGen is proposed, for a de novo template&#8208;free polyimide creation. The agent combines the property predictors identified from four machine learning models and a fragment&#8208;based generation architecture with active fragments extracted from polyimides as fundamental building blocks. Its successful use is demonstrated to create several polyimides for flexible display scenarios, i.e., with specific properties such as higher transparency, lower coefficient of linear thermal expansion, superior tensile strength, and elevated glass transition temperature. Experiment validation and structural importance analysis demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of the proposed research approach. The scalable strategy presented in this work stands as a paradigm for the inverse design of a spectrum of polymeric materials, offering guidance for other structural engineering endeavors.

         <title>Electrochemically Cation&#8208;Induced Three&#8208;Phase Conversion for Consecutively Tunable Electromagnetic Wave Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A device with a sandwich&#8208;structured configuration of metal mesh@HxWO3/H2SO4/hollow graphite is designed, in which an electrochemically cation&#8208;induced three phase conversion in HxWO3 could dynamically modify the electrical structure of HxWO3 and create a mass of dipoles by the intercalation and accumulation of the external cations in the host structure, thereby enhancing the overall dynamic response capabilities of electromagnetic wave.








Abstract
Tunable electromagnetic wave responses are increasingly attracting attention in the realm of integrated electronics. However, the modulation flexibility and reliability are limited in the current electromagnetic shielding materials. In this study, a device with a sandwich&#8208;structured configuration of metal mesh@HxWO3/H2SO4/hollow graphite is designed to enable dynamic response and precise control for electromagnetic waves (EMWs). In&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical simulation revealed that the electrochemically controlled cation intercalation preferentially triggers the reversible conversion of HxWO3 from the monoclinic phase (M&#8208;phase) to the tetragonal phase (T&#8208;phase), and subsequently to the cubic phase (C&#8208;phase) by voltage management, which leads to a successive increase in valence electrons and enhancement in conductivity for precisely modulating reflection shielding efficiency of the incident EMWs. Furthermore, the intercalation and accumulation of the external cations produce a mass of dipoles in the crystal HxWO3 host structure, which further enhances the dielectric performances of materials and the dissipation capability of incident EMWs, and thus improves the electromagnetic absorption shielding effectiveness. Consequently, the outstanding modulation capability &#916;: 42.36 dB) and consecutively tunable intensity (from 10.98 to 53.34 dB) of electromagnetic shielding effectiveness is realized, which provides a more remarkable technology for adapting to demanding environments through the dynamical regulation of EMWs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tunable electromagnetic wave responses are increasingly attracting attention in the realm of integrated electronics. However, the modulation flexibility and reliability are limited in the current electromagnetic shielding materials. In this study, a device with a sandwich-structured configuration of metal mesh@H&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/hollow graphite is designed to enable dynamic response and precise control for electromagnetic waves (EMWs). In-situ characterizations and theoretical simulation revealed that the electrochemically controlled cation intercalation preferentially triggers the reversible conversion of H&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from the monoclinic phase (M-phase) to the tetragonal phase (T-phase), and subsequently to the cubic phase (C-phase) by voltage management, which leads to a successive increase in valence electrons and enhancement in conductivity for precisely modulating reflection shielding efficiency of the incident EMWs. Furthermore, the intercalation and accumulation of the external cations produce a mass of dipoles in the crystal H&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; host structure, which further enhances the dielectric performances of materials and the dissipation capability of incident EMWs, and thus improves the electromagnetic absorption shielding effectiveness. Consequently, the outstanding modulation capability &#916;: 42.36 dB) and consecutively tunable intensity (from 10.98 to 53.34 dB) of electromagnetic shielding effectiveness is realized, which provides a more remarkable technology for adapting to demanding environments through the dynamical regulation of EMWs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Blue&#8208;emitting electroluminescent quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QD&#8208;LEDs) face critical challenges that limit their practical application, including short operational lifetimes, low color purity, broad spectral linewidths, and unpredictable transient effects like blinking and positive aging. This review explores the underlying mechanisms behind these challenges, discussing key knowledge gaps that require further investigations, and highlighting recent developments of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art blue QD&#8208;LEDs.








Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QD&#8208;LEDs) are electroluminescent devices where the emissive layer consists of inorganic colloidal quantum dots. Recent breakthroughs have enabled the development of bright and efficient blue&#8208;emitting QD&#8208;LEDs based on heavy metal&#8208;free compositions. However, challenges remain that hinder their practical application in electroluminescent displays and lighting technologies. The primary obstacle is their limited operational lifetimes which remain significantly below practical requirement standards, especially in comparison to the red&#8208; and green&#8208;emitting QD&#8208;LEDs. Another important issue is the low color purity and broad spectral linewidths of heavy metal&#8208;free blue quantum dot compositions. Additional problems include transient electroluminescent behaviors such as fluorescence intermittency and positive aging effects. This review examines the current understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying these challenges faced by blue QD&#8208;LEDs. Often, contradictory explanations are proposed to account for the same phenomenon. Here, potential interpretations are suggested that may help reconcile the conflicting reports. Recent advances are further examined that have contributed to the development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art blue QD&#8208;LEDs.

         <title>Water Permeates and Plasticizes Amorphous Carbon Dots: Unraveling the Inner Accessibility of the Nanoparticles by Glass Transition Studies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The water permeability of amorphous carbon dots (CDs) is demonstrated by investigating their plasticization. Novel polyamide&#8208;based and amorphous nanoparticles are synthesized by controlling their inner packing density. Water plasticization is evidenced by the decrease of the CDs glass transition temperature with increasing the hydration degree. More compact CDs structure resulted in lower water uptake.








Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) are highly versatile nanomaterials with promising applications across catalysis, sensing, biotechnology, and optoelectronics. Yet, despite the widespread interest, their internal structure and permeability to solvents remain poorly understood. In this study, novel insights are provided into the plasticizing effect of water on amorphous CDs, addressing a critical gap in the current knowledge. A new class of polyamide&#8208;based CDs is synthesized via a microwave&#8208;assisted reaction using an amino acid and a small polyamine in water, systematically varying reaction times (3 &#8211; 60 min) to tailor the compactness of the carbon core. These findings reveal that water can permeate the internal structure of CDs and act as a plasticizer, significantly lowering their glass transition temperature, as shown by calorimetric analyses. Less compact CDs absorbed more water, while denser ones showed lower permeability. These trends are further corroborated by X&#8208;ray scattering data. This report clearly demonstrates that the carbonaceous core of CDs is accessible to water, challenging the assumption that the nanoparticles are structurally impermeable. These results lay the groundwork for new structural models of CDs and open exciting opportunities for diffusion studies, functional design, and targeted applications in nanoscience.

         <title>Promoting Electrochemical Reactions with Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts for High&#8208;Rate Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable strategy for synthesizing transition metal&#8211;bismuth atomic pairs on carbon nitride to accelerate sulfur redox reactions in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries is presented. Nickel&#8208;bismuth and cobatl&#8208;bismuth catalysts improve rate performance by promoting direct electrochemical transitions and rapid Li2S nucleation, minimizing sulfur loss, and enhancing stability.








Abstract
Sulfur cathodes offer a promising solution for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, cost&#8208;effective, and sustainable energy storage. However, their practical application is limited by sluggish and complex multistep sulfur redox reactions (SRRs), involving both electrochemical and chemical processes. Herein, it is demonstrated that accelerating electrochemical processes, particularly Li2S nucleation, over competing chemical pathways is fundamental to minimizing sulfur loss and achieving high&#8208;rate performance. To this end, a scalable and cost&#8208;effective strategy is presented for synthesizing a series of 3d transition metal&#8211;bismuth (TM&#8211;Bi) atomic pairs anchored on carbon nitride (CN) and investigate their potential to activate SRRs in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs). An initial screening identifies Ni&#8211;Bi/CN and Co&#8211;Bi/CN as highly effective in improving rate performance. Detailed analysis shows these catalysts promote direct electrochemical transitions and rapid Li2S nucleation over competing chemical reactions, enabling high charge&#8211;discharge rates while preventing active material loss and enhancing stability. Electrochemical analysis, density functional theory, and operando spectroscopy reveal that TM&#8208;Bi pairing shifts d&#8208;band states closer to the Fermi level and modulates HOMO&#8211;LUMO levels, promoting lithium polysulfide (LiPS) interaction and facilitating efficient charge transfer. These findings offer valuable insights for designing advanced catalysts for LSBs and broader electrocatalytic applications.

         <title>Origami and Kirigami on Nanomembranes: Design, Fabrication, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Origami and kirigami inspire engineering. Their scale&#8208;independent methods aid nanomembrane&#8208;based reconfigurable micro/nanostructures. The review covers design, fabrication, applications, challenges, and future directions for this interdisciplinary field.








Abstract
Origami and kirigami, traditional arts that transform flat sheets into intricate three&#8208;dimensional structures through the design of creases and cuts, have inspired a wide range of engineering applications across multiple fields. These scale&#8208;independent fabrication techniques have been adapted to nanomembranes, enabling the construction of reconfigurable micro&#8208; and nanostructures with unique properties that are challenging to achieve through conventional methods. This review highlights recent advancements in the design, fabrication, and applications of origami and kirigami on nanomembranes. Fundamental design theories for crease and cut patterns on nanomembranes and their corresponding mechanical responses under large deformations, such as twisting and bending, are discussed together with the actuation mechanisms that facilitate the transition from two&#8208;dimensional patterns to three&#8208;dimensional structures. Recently developed microfabrication methods are summarized, including patterning, detachment, and transfer printing for nanomembranes. The applications of nanomembrane&#8208;based origami and kirigami devices in optoelectronics, micro/nanorobots, and metamaterials are highlighted, which take advantage of the reconfigurable complex 3D microstructures. Key challenges in the field are identified, and future research directions are proposed to further integrate origami and kirigami principles into nanomembrane engineering. This overview aims to provide researchers with a comprehensive reference to foster further innovations and applications in this emerging interdisciplinary domain.

         <title>Giant Circular Dichroism in Proximitized WS2 Spin&#8208;Valley Transistors for Complementary Optoelectronics and Reconfigurable Logics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
WS2&#8208;based spin&#8208;valley transistors are developed with notable circular dichroic photocurrent, benefited from the proximity coupling from magnetic substrates and spin&#8208;selectivity of spin tunneling electrodes. Complementary phototransistors can be developed by reversing the spin polarization of magnets. These devices are used to build reconfigurable optoelectronic NOT, NAND, and NOR gates for optical switching and all&#8208;optical computing applications.








Abstract
The coupling of valley and spin degrees of freedom in 2D materials holds significant promise for advancing novel device applications. In this study, a highly polarized spin&#8208;valley transistor based on the circular dichroic photocurrent in WS2 is demonstrated. By integrating highly spin&#8208;selective tunneling spin detectors and leveraging the magnetic proximity effect of spin&#8208;polarized substrates, the spin degeneracy in optical transition and spin transport can be broken. A giant photocurrent polarization of 41.90% is realized at room temperature under ultraviolet light irradiation. Interestingly, the sign of the circular dichroism can be reversed by switching the magnetization of substrates and electrodes, showing an opposite resistance state under circularly polarized light. This device has removed the hurdle for developing complementary phototransistors (as they are always in low&#8208;resistance states under light illumination), which are further exploited to construct reconfigurable logic gates. The findings will pave the way for new developments in optical couplers and on&#8208;chip optical computing technologies.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Compact Topological Photonic Crystal Rainbow Nanolasers Operating in the 1550 nm Telecom Band with Wavelength&#8208;Scale Mode Volumes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale rainbow light trapping for lasing emission in the 1550 nm telecom band is experimentally demonstrated. Ultra&#8208;compact 1D and 2D topological rainbow nanolasers are presented, featuring ultra&#8208;small mode volumes, ultra&#8208;low lasing thresholds, and remarkable robustness against fabrication imperfections and defects.








Abstract
Topological rainbow trapping, spatially separating and confining multiple topologically protected light frequencies, offers a prospective scheme for achieving robust multi&#8208;wavelength single&#8208;mode coherent emission within a single nanodevice. Here, ultra&#8208;compact topological photonic crystal rainbow nanolasers&#160;operating in the 1550 nm telecom band are experimentally demonstrated. Specifically, rainbow&#8208;like single&#8208;mode emission with a controllable free spectral range and a wavelength&#8208;scale mode volume is presented in a one&#8208;dimensional topological rainbow nanolaser, exhibiting robust rainbow spectral emission across a wide temperature range and a spectral tuning capability of approximately 70 nm. Additionally, an ultra&#8208;compact two&#8208;dimensional topological rainbow nanolaser is demonstrated in an exceptionally small footprint, featuring a broad rainbow spectrum with 64 continuously tuned single&#8208;mode lasing peaks. This work provides a promising approach for realizing robust and nanoscale multi&#8208;wavelength single&#8208;mode coherent emission within a single device, paving the way for numerous potential applications in ultra&#8208;compact high&#8208;throughput data processing systems, including on&#8208;chip wavelength&#8208;division&#8208;multiplexing and optical&#160;interconnects.

         <title>Multiplexed Single&#8208;Particle Imaging Enabled by Modulation of Er3+ Energy&#8208;Level Populations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy enables multiplexed single&#8208;particle imaging by precisely tuning the red&#8208;to&#8208;green (R/G)&#160;emission ratios of Yb/Er co&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles. Quantitative modeling and experimental validation reveal that R/G modulation is dictated by excited Yb3+ density (n1&#8242;${n}_{1}^{\prime}$), which governs energy redistribution among Er3+ states. This mechanism allows more than a tenfold spectral tunability and enables reliable multicolor tracking of molecular dynamics.








Abstract
Single&#8208;particle tracking (SPT) offers critical insights into nanoscale molecular dynamics, but is limited by short tracking durations due to irreversible photobleaching and the technical complexity of multicolor imaging. Here, a non&#8208;photobleaching ratiometric imaging strategy is developed based on lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), exploiting their intrinsic, tunable red&#8208;to&#8208;green (R/G) emission ratios for multiplexed SPT. Single&#8208;particle characterization reveals over 10&#8208;fold tunability. Mechanistic investigations show that this ratiometric behavior is governed by Yb3+ excitation density, which modulates the energy distribution within energy levels of Er3+ ions. Specifically, high Yb3+ excitation densities enhance three&#8208;photon transitions, favoring red emission, while lower densities promote two&#8208;photon upconversion and green emission. Both processes proceed through a shared energy level of 2H11/2, leading to competitive energy transfer dynamics. Based on this competition mechanism, a quantitative relationship is further established between UCNPs structure and the resulting R/G emission ratio, allowing reliable prediction of spectral output across different designs. Leveraging this tunable ratiometric principle, simultaneous five&#8208;color single&#8208;particle imaging is demonstrated with a misidentification rate below 5%. This strategy is further applied to visualize receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis in live cells. This work highlights the advantages of upconversion luminescence&#8208;based R/G ratio discrimination for long&#8208;term, multicolor SPT, offering a simple and reliable tool for probing complex biological processes.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Broadband Plane Blackbody by Ultrafast Laser Induced Surface Hierarchical Structuring and Nanodefect Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid micro&#8208;nano periodic structure, realized via a one&#8208;step process utilizing the mechanism of ultrafast laser multiple interaction with a silicon surface, is reported. This structure simultaneously achieves suppression of optical backscattering and energy band engineering. The fabricated surface exhibits exceptional uniformity and stability as a blackbody, thereby addressing the stability and uniformity challenges of plan blackbodies under protracted deployment.








Abstract
Blackbodies, ideal light&#8208;absorbing objects per Planck's law, do not occur in nature on Earth. Nevertheless, they are of utmost significance in applications across astronomy, optoelectronics, and thermal radiation engineering. While artificial counterparts such as cavity blackbodies and plane blackbodies can approximate ideal blackbodies to some extent, they are beset with problems, including large volume, low emissivity, narrow bandwidth, poor uniformity, and feeble adhesion. Here, a method relying on ultrafast laser direct irradiation is reported, which enables fast writing of uniform plane blackbodies with high&#8208;emissivity over 0.98 in an ultra&#8208;broadband spectrum of 3&#8211;14 &#181;m on a doped silicon surface. A phenomenon of energy negative feedback regulation in laser&#8208;material is discovered, which allows for the simultaneous implementation of hierarchical surface structuring and nanodefect&#8208;induced energy&#8208;level engineering. The resulting micro&#8208;nano hierarchical cone&#8208;array structure effectively curbs light back&#8208;scattering and intensifies nanodefect&#8208;induced absorption. Since the laser&#8208;treated surface does not entail material adhesion or injection, it exhibits superior stability in contrast to traditional black coatings. This is corroborated by high&#8208;temperature tests exceeding 900&#160;&#176;C and repeated mechanical exfoliation tests, underscoring its resilience in harsh environmental conditions.

         <title>Acupuncture&#8208;Inspired Active&#8208;Material Microenvironment Engineering for High&#8208;Throughput Thick Electrodes by Instant Microneedle Templating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Chinese acupuncture, a microneedle&#8208;array templated extrusion (MATE) technology and an active&#8208;material microenvironment (AMME) therapy theory are proposed. This enables ultrafast fabrication of 3D thick electrodes with ordered channels, achieving a 300% capacity increase at 60 mg cm&#8722;2. The AMME therapy theory provides deeper insight into the rational design of pore structure of thick electrodes.








Abstract
Rational design and ultrafast fabrication of high&#8208;throughput thick electrodes are essential for high&#8208;energy and power density batteries. However, it is blocked by the lack of both theory and cost&#8208;effective technologies for regulating the active&#8208;material microenvironment (AMME) that fundamentally controls the ion and electron transport for each active&#8208;material particle. Here, inspired by the Chinese&#8208;acupuncture therapy that employs microneedles to dredge the cell microenvironment, a microneedle&#8208;array templated extrusion (MATE) technology is proposed along with an AMME&#8208;therapy theory to address the above challenges. Specifically, a unique clay&#8208;alike thixotropic (CAT) slurry through sol&#8208;binder is first fabricated with significant capabilities in 3D&#8208;morphing. Enabled by this morphable CAT&#8208;slurry, MATE technology is further developed to rapidly and seamlessly fabricate high&#8208;throughput 3D thick electrodes with customizable ordered ion&#8208;transport channels. Consequently, the optimized 3D thick electrode shows a remarkable improvement in specific capacity by 300% even at an ultrahigh active&#8208;material loading of 60&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 (ca. 3 times the commercial level). Finally, an AMME therapy theory based on an artificial potential field algorithm for ion&#8208;transport path optimization is established to understand the enhanced ion&#8208;transport dynamics. The proposed AMME&#8208;therapy theory and industry&#8208;friendly MATE technology could advance&#160;the design and fabrication of high&#8208;throughput electrodes in batteries and other electrochemical energy&#8208;storage devices.

Finally, an AMME therapy theory based on an artificial potential field algorithm for ion-transport path optimization is established to understand the enhanced ion-transport dynamics. The proposed AMME-therapy theory and industry-friendly MATE technology could advance&#160;the design and fabrication of high-throughput electrodes in batteries and other electrochemical energy-storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Reactive Oxygen Species Generation and Pollutant Adsorption in Advanced Oxidation Processes with Cation Vacancy&#8208;Driven Dual&#8208;Site Mn2SiO4 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cation&#8208;vacancy&#8208;driven dual active site Mn2SiO4 catalytic materials effectively activate reactive oxygen species and enhance pollutant adsorption, thereby achieving efficient oxidation degradation of recalcitrant pollutants.








Abstract
Catalytic advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have emerged as a promising strategy for the near&#8208;complete mineralization of all&#8208;organic pollutants via the strong oxidizing power of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, practical implementation is hindered by the low ROS generation yield owing to insufficient catalytically active sites and ineffective utilization stemming from transient radical lifetimes. Herein, cation vacancy&#8208;engineered manganese silicate (V&#8208;Mn2SiO4) catalysts comprising dual reaction sites are presented, which enable the highly efficient oxidation of recalcitrant organic pollutants through the activation of peroxymonosulfate. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations confirm that Mn sites adjacent to vacancies serve as the primary active centers for peroxymonosulfate activation, whereas adjacent O sites facilitate pollutant adsorption. This dual&#8208;site configuration effectively lowers the activation energy barrier and enhances peroxymonosulfate activation and singlet oxygen (1O2) generation while optimizing the 1O2 migration distance via pollutant adsorption and enrichment. The rate constants of V&#8208;Mn2SiO4 against rhodamine B and 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenol pollutants are 1.171 and 0.1291 min&#8722;1, respectively, which are comparable to those reported for atomically dispersed metal nanocatalysts in AOPs. This discovery marks a breakthrough in AOPs, accelerating their practical application in environmental remediation and advancing sustainable pollution control technologies.

         <title>Arbitrarily Shapeable Couplant with Fluidity Onset for Conformal Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative couplant is presented, comprising fibers and dynamically cross&#8208;linked polysilicone, that transitions from solid to fluid when stress exceeds a threshold. This stress&#8208;triggered fluidity, coupled with acoustic transparency, enables seamless conformability to complex geometries and reliable long&#8208;term performance, addressing challenges in imaging steep curves and pressure&#8208;sensitive tissues for industrial and medical applications.








Abstract
Couplant is indispensable for ultrasound examinations. However, shape adaptability and operational feasibility, which are both crucial, cannot be provided conjointly by existing couplants due to their either liquid or solid form. Here an ideal couplant composed of fibers and dynamically cross&#8208;linked polysilicone is reported, which exhibits a unique solid&#8208;to&#8208;fluid transition upon application of stress exceeding a threshold. Together with the acoustically transparent feature, the particularity of the stress&#8208;triggered fluidity allows conformal adapting to arbitrary geometries under stress exertion and stable preserving for long&#8208;term and reliable ultrasound examination after stress release. Steeply curved geometries and pressure&#8208;sensitive tissues, which are extremely challenging for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultrasound modalities, are successfully graphed or treated. This couplant integrates the merits of liquids and solids, providing new opportunities for various ultrasound in industrial and medical fields.

         <title>Supramolecular Amino Acids&#8208;Encoded Nanodots (SEND) with pH&#8208; and Ion&#8208;Responsive Phase Separation for Serum&#8208;Tolerant Cytosolic Protein Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of 60 supramolecular amino acid&#8208;encoded nanodots (SEND) is screened to identify candidates for serum&#8208;tolerant protein delivery. Among them, the FR (Phe&#8208;Arg) modified SEND exhibited bicarbonate&#8208;triggered liquid&#8211;solid phase separation (LSPS) driven by strengthened hydrogen bonding. This pH&#8208; and Ion&#8208;responsive LSPS protects proteins from serum&#8208;induced leakage, allowing for efficient cytosolic delivery in serum and therapeutic efficacy against lung metastasis.








Abstract
To broaden the scope of potential intracellular targets for protein drugs, artificial carriers are employed to achieve efficient cytosolic delivery. However, the majority of delivery vectors are hindered by restricted serum tolerance. Here, the screening of supramolecular amino acids&#8208;encoded nanodots (SEND) for efficient serum&#8208;tolerant cytosolic protein delivery is reported. A library of 60 nanodots is constructed by surface conjugation of different amino acids or dipeptides on cyanine five&#8208;cored polylysine dendrimers. The FR (Phe&#8208;Arg) and RW (Arg&#8208;Trp) modified SEND achieved efficient intracellular protein delivery in both serum&#8208;free and serum&#8208;containing conditions, and preserved high protein bioactivity. These two SEND can recruit a wide range of proteins and induce liquid&#8211;solid phase separation, thereby preventing the premature leakage of loaded proteins. The phase separation behavior of SEND&#8208;FR and &#8208;RW is responsive to ionic strength and pH. Moreover, SEND&#8208;FR is sensitive to bicarbonate, which promotes the hardening of SEND&#8208;FR coacervates through enhanced hydrogen bonding. Lowering the pH triggers reversion to a homogeneous phase, enabling controlled protein release. The SEND&#8208;FR is capable of sending toxic protein Saporin to the lung via systemic administration, effectively inhibiting the progression of lung metastasis. This study provides a promising strategy to construct functional nanocarriers for efficient serum&#8208;tolerant cytosolic protein delivery.

         <title>Octahedral Twisting&#8208;Mediated van der Waals Stacking Induces Ultralow Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low thermal conductivity (&#954;) is an important physical parameter inherent to all solids, and the quest for intrinsic ultralow&#8208;&#954; solids is one of the key scientific issues. By designing asymmetric units in van der Waals material In2Ge2Se&#8326;, ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.2 W&#160;m&#8722;1K&#8722;1) is achieved, demonstrating functional&#8208;unit control over phonon anharmonicity and group velocity. 








Abstract
Low thermal conductivity (&#954;) is an important physical parameter inherent to all solids, and the quest for intrinsic ultralow&#8208;&#954; solids is one of the key scientific issues. Material design based on functional units can achieve control over lattice and phonon dynamics, and it is proposed that asymmetric structural units&#8208;mediated van der Waals stacking can collectively lead to the low thermal conductivity. Herein, a novel van der Waals material In2G2Se&#8326; is reported, in which the distorted InSe&#8326; octahedron forms monolayers in conjunction with Ge2Se&#8326; dimers, which are further stacked along the c&#8208;axis via weak metavalent bonding. The distorted octahedron and van der Waals stacking result in large anharmonicity and ultrasoft acoustic phonon along &#915;&#8211;Z direction, respectively. Consequently, In2Ge2Se6 exhibits ultralow out&#8208;of&#8208;plane thermal conductivity, &#954;out&#8208;of&#8208;plane &#8776;0.2&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1K&#8722;1 at 600 K. This study establishes a model for phonon physics that simultaneously enhances phonon&#8208;phonon scattering and lowers the phonon group velocity, revealing the great potential of functional&#8208;unit&#8208;based material design for low&#8208;&#954; solids.

It guided macrophage polarization from M0 to M1 and subsequently to M2 phenotypes according to the healing progression. By simultaneously modulating the immune microenvironment, suppressing bacterial infection, promoting angiogenesis and osteogenesis, the temporal immunomodulatory hydrogel restored infected bone defects effectively.








Abstract
Early pathogen clearance and immunomodulation are critical for the restoration of infected bone defects. Conventional osteoimmunomodulatory strategies mainly emphasize M2 macrophage&#8208;mediated bone regeneration, neglecting the pivotal role of early&#8208;stage M1 macrophage&#8208;activated immune response in microbial elimination. This oversight ultimately compromises repair efficacy in infected bone defects. Herein, a temporal immunomodulatory hydrogel is developed to regulate the immune&#8208;osteogenic microenvironment for the repair of infected bone defects. The hydrogel is rapidly formed by crosslinking of acrylate&#8208;modified engineered protein with oxidized sodium alginate, mimicking extracellular matrix architecture to promote cell adhesion, angiogenesis, and osteogenesis. To achieve temporal ion release, zinc&#8208;based nanoparticles mineralized with hydroxyapatite are incorporated within the hydrogel matrix. The early&#8208;stage release of Ca2+ promotes M1 polarization to inhibit infection, while sustained release of Zn2+ induces M2 polarization to promote osteogenic differentiation. This system further exhibits antioxidant and antibacterial properties, ensuring comprehensive immunomodulation across the bone healing process. In a rat model of infected cranial defects, the hydrogel effectively remodels the osteoimmune microenvironment, suppresses infection, and facilitates vascularized bone regeneration. This work highlights a temporal immunomodulatory strategy for infected bone repair and offers new insights into the design of advanced osteoimmunomodulatory biomaterials.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printing Assisted Bidirectional &#960;&#8208;Structured Thermoelectric Generators: Reverse&#8208;Designed Flexible Architectures for Curved Heat Sources</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an innovative bidirectional &#960;&#8208;structure based on 3D printing technology, which optimizes heat conduction efficiency and enhances mechanical flexibility. Using an inverse design framework that integrates 3D scanning and curvature distribution analysis, a customized topological structure tailored to the geometry of the target heat source is developed, thereby improving thermal collection from curved surfaces.








Abstract
Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) demonstrate significant potential for sustainable energy harvesting through direct heat&#8208;to&#8208;electricity conversion. Nevertheless, conventional fully encapsulated designs face critical limitations including heat dissipation inefficiencies and restricted conformability to complex curved surfaces. This investigation proposes a breakthrough bidirectional &#960;&#8208;structured (BD&#960;&#8208;structure) that achieves enhanced mechanical compliance while establishing a mechano&#8208;electrical coupling criterion for abrupt curvature transitions. Through implementing a reverse design framework integrating 3D scanning and curvature distribution analysis, customized topological configurations are specifically developed and adapted to target heat source geometries. Concurrently, a novel photocurable composite with enhanced thermal conductivity (0.213 W&#183;m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1) is designed through 3D&#8208;printed structural optimization, achieving 59.1% power enhancement compared to conventional encapsulated modules. Experimental validation demonstrates remarkable surface fit tightness of 90.7% (positive Gaussian) and 80.2% (negative Gaussian), translating to exceptional power output improvements of 432.7% and 253.2% relative to non&#8208;optimized counterparts. This work establishes a comprehensive framework encompassing material innovation, structural design, and system integration strategies, significantly advancing flexible thermoelectric technology for high&#8208;efficiency energy harvesting from geometrically complex thermal sources.

         <title>Magnetic Milli&#8208;Spinner for Robotic Endovascular Surgery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnetic milli&#8208;spinner, with its unique structural design, achieves rapid and stable navigation through complex vasculature at speeds up to 23 cm&#183;s&#8722;1. It further enables multifunctional treatment, including localized suction and shear for efficient clot removal, targeted drug delivery, and in situ embolization for aneurysm therapy, establishing it as a versatile platform for next&#8208;generation, untethered endovascular interventions.








Abstract
Navigating the complex and high&#8208;flow environment of human vasculature remains a major challenge for conventional endovascular tools and externally actuated tethered systems. While catheter&#8208;based approaches are the clinical standard, their limited steerability and force transmission hinder access to tortuous or distal vessels, especially in the brain. Untethered robotic systems have emerged as a promising alternative for enhanced flexibility and reachability. However, most designs struggle against the high, pulsatile blood flow in human arteries. Here, the study presents a magnetically actuated milli&#8208;spinner robot that overcomes existing limitations in navigating complex and high&#8208;flow vasculature. Capable of swimming at 23&#160;cm&#183;s&#8722;1 (73 body lengths per second), the milli&#8208;spinner enables rapid, stable navigation through complex vasculature. This performance is driven by its hollow cylindrical structure with integrated helical fins and slits, which together generate a spinning&#8208;induced flow field that enhances propulsion efficiency and allows the robot to maintain stability and control even in dynamic, pulsatile blood flow environments. In addition to its navigation capabilities, the milli&#8208;spinner enables multifunctional treatment, including localized suction and shear for efficient clot removal, targeted drug delivery, and in situ embolization for aneurysm treatment. These features establish the milli&#8208;spinner as a versatile and powerful platform for next&#8208;generation, untethered endovascular interventions.

         <title>Observation of Dislocation Non&#8208;Hermitian Skin Effect in a Torus&#8208;like Acoustic Metamaterial</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Waves in non&#8208;Hermitian systems can defy intuition by accumulating at specific locations rather than spreading uniformly. While conventional studies focused on boundaries, this work reports the first experimental observation of the dislocation non&#8208;Hermitian skin effect in acoustic metamaterials. Sound is shown to concentrate at one dislocation and vanish at another, unveiling a new non&#8208;Hermitian topological localization mechanism with potential for novel sound and energy control devices.








Abstract
The non&#8208;Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), a striking phenomenon where a large number of states accumulate toward open boundaries, has garnered significant attention in both fundamental physics and emerging applications. Recent theoretical studies unveiled a distinctive dislocation NHSE by disentangling it from the established boundary NHSE, thereby bridging the gap between topological defects and non&#8208;Hermitian effects. In this work, the first experimental observation of the dislocation NHSE is reported, achieved using an ingeniously designed nonreciprocal, torus&#8208;like acoustic metamaterial with two dislocations of opposite Burgers vectors. The results show that the sound energy density inside the sample dramatically accumulates at one dislocation, while being unusually depleted at the other, a response distinct from all existing NHSE phenomena. This novel non&#8208;Hermitian effect not only probes the interplay between nontrivial defects and point&#8208;gap topology, but also holds promise for practical applications, such as the design of topological sound vacuum pumps.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Fibril Network Engineering for Scalable and Sustainable Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing a multifunctional additive strategy, high&#8208;quality films with a dual&#8208;fibril network morphology are successfully printed, achieving a remarkable PCE of 20.23% for the device and 17.26% in the module.








Abstract
Green&#8208;printed, high&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaics modules are critical to the commercial expansion and practical deployment of organic photovoltaics. Since the emergence of Y6&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs is remarkable progress. However, a considerable performance gap remains between devices processed with halogenated versus non&#8208;halogenated (green) solvents, primarily due to difficulties in controlling molecular aggregation. Here, hydroxyl&#8208;rich cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) is introduced as a multifunctional additive to enhance the morphology and performance of modules fabricated via large&#8208;area green printing. CAB suppresses excessive molecular aggregation and modulates the film&#8208;formation dynamics. Crucially, its hydroxyl side groups interact synergistically with both donor and acceptor materials to induce a dual&#8208;fibril network, providing abundant interfacial area for exciton dissociation and continuous pathways for efficient charge transport. As a result, green&#8208;printed PM6:PTP&#8208;eC9 devices achieve PCE of 19.04%. Moreover, ternary PM6:PTQ&#8208;10:PTP&#8208;eC9 devices and modules with an active area of 16.94 cm2 exhibit PCEs of 20.23% and 17.26%, respectively. This work demonstrates a viable additive engineering strategy for realizing scalable, environmentally benign, and high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaics.

Diphenyl tetrasulfide (PTS) is composited with tetramethylthiuram monosulfide (TMTM) with a PTS:TMTM molar ratio of 1:4 to form a PT14 cathode. The Li&#8208;PT14 cell shows a high discharge voltage of 2.55 V and retains 90% of the initial capacity after 700 cycles at 1 C. It also shows promising performances at elevated temperatures. When paired with a lithiated graphitic anode, the full cell delivers a capacity retention of 97% after 840 cycles at 0.5 C. Furthermore, a Li&#8208;PT14 pouch cell remains 100% of the initial capacity after 50 cycles.








Abstract
Organosulfur represents a class of promising candidates as cathode materials for rechargeable batteries. However, their development has been hindered by several key factors, including low discharge voltage, shuttle of polysulfides, and sluggish kinetics. Herein, tetramethylthiuram monosulfide (TMTM) is introduced as a functional substrate and composited with diphenyl tetrasulfide (PTS), which is denoted as PT14. During discharge, PTS generates benzenethiolate and sulfide anions, both of which can in situ react with TMTM forming new electrochemical reactive species. This design mitigates the polysulfide shuttle effect and enables rapid reaction kinetics. The Li&#8208;PT14 cell shows a high discharge voltage of 2.55&#160;V and retains 90% of the initial capacity after 700 cycles at a 1C rate. When the temperature is increased to 60&#160;&#176;C, the cell retains 95% of the initial capacity after 500 cycles. When paired with a lithiated carbon paper anode (LiC) to form a full cell, it delivers a capacity retention of 97% after 840 cycles at N/P = 3.5 and 0.5 C rate. Furthermore, a 100 mAh pouch cell assembled with the PT14 cathode shows no capacity loss after 50 cycles. This work provides a new strategy to develop advanced rechargeable batteries based on organosulfur cathode materials.

         <title>Photogenerated Carrier Reconstructed Ion Concentration Gradients for Moisture Electricity Generators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a photon moisture electricity generator (P&#8208;MEG) that leverages a coupling of photovoltaic and hydrovoltaic effects to reconstruct the ion concentration gradient under illumination, effectively addressing ion saturation and enhancing the long&#8208;term stability of moisture&#8208;based energy harvesters.








Abstract
Although moisture electricity generators (MEG), which enable conversion of atmospheric moisture into electricity, have attracted great attention, the long&#8208;term moisture absorption of MEG leads to the saturation of ion concentration gradient and the decreased ion migration rate, seriously reducing the output performance. In this work, this bottleneck of MEG is addressed by constructing a photon moisture electricity generator (P&#8208;MEG) with a photosensitive layer electrode, and the synergistic coupling of photovoltaic and hydrovoltaic effects is realized. The photogenerated carriers in photosensitive layer convert H+ on the photosensitive layer into H2, resulting in a reconstructed H+ concentration gradient between the two electrodes of P&#8208;MEG. The direct detection of H2 by gas chromatography and the increase of the pH from 0.26 to 2.11 under illumination both prove the H+ gradient reconstruction mechanism. The results show that under 80% relative humidity (RH), the illumination increases the P&#8208;MEG output voltage from 0.55 to 0.65&#160;V the current density from 17.5 to 34.5&#160;&#181;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, and the power density from 8.26 to 26.7 &#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2. Present work provides a strategy to enhance the long&#8208;term stability of MEG devices.

         <title>Flexible and Dynamic Interfacial Desolvation in High&#8208;Entropy Electrolyte for Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy flexible electrolyte (HEFE) with imbalanced H2O coordination enables mixed Zn2+ solvation (Zn(H2O)m2+, m &#8804; 6) and disordered water networks, boosting ionic conductivity and suppressing H2 evolution. It achieves 3500 h Zn cycling at 1 mA cm&#8722;2 and, with I2@C cathodes, enables solid&#8211;solid redox (3600 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1). The strategy also works for Mn2&#8314;, showing broad potential for multivalent batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are promising candidates beyond lithium&#8208;ion technologies, but the intrinsic hydrogen&#8208;down orientation of interfacial water under negative bias, together with ion depletion at the electrode surface, promotes inhomogeneous Zn plating and substantial hydrogen evolution. Here, a high&#8208;entropy flexible electrolyte (HEFE) is demonstrated that leverages the fast water&#8208;exchange kinetics of Li&#8314;, K&#8314;, and Cs&#8314;. By deliberately inducing cation&#8208;hydration disequilibrium, the HEFE forms flexible Zn(H2O)m2+ (m &#8804; 6) solvation structures embedded in a disordered water network, enhancing ionic conductivity and alleviating ion&#8208;transport limitations. Under cathodic bias, a progressive desolvation from Zn(H2O)62+ to Zn(H2O)x2+ (x &#8804; 5) proceeds while retaining aqueous disorder, thereby suppressing hydrogen evolution and enabling 3500 h of deep cycling at 1 mA cm&#8722;2/3 mAh cm&#8722;2. For iodine cathodes, the HEFE induces a pathway shift from the conventional I&#8722;&#8594;I2 route to a solid&#8211;solid (CsI&#8594;I2) conversion, fundamentally inhibiting iodide shuttling and extending full&#8208;cell life to 3600 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. Beyond Zn, the solvation&#8208;heterogeneity strategy opens avenues for reversible multivalent electrochemistry and advancing next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Growth of Two&#8208;Inch Perovskite CsPbBr3 Single&#8208;Crystal with High Irradiation Resistance for X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;inch CsPbBr3 SC were grown with vertical Bridgman method, and the X&#8208;ray detection stability of Au/CsPbBr3/Bi devices after high&#8208;dose irradiation was investigated. We found the change in the Fermi level after irradiation endows the enhancement in sensitivity, demonstrating ultra&#8208;high irradiation hardness for the devices.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 crystals have demonstrated considerable promise in &#947;&#8208;ray and X&#8208;ray detection, owing to their excellent optoelectronic properties. However, the growth of large single crystals (SCs) and the stability of CsPbBr3&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detectors under high&#8208;energy radiation exposure remain unexplored. In this study, a two&#8208;inch CsPbBr3 single&#8208;crystal is grown using the vertical Bridgman (VB) method, and its irradiation resistance in X&#8208;ray detection performance is investigated after exposure to 60Co &#947;&#8208;ray radiation. Compared with unirradiated samples, the crystals irradiated with a dose of 10&#160;Mrad exhibit a higher trap density (1.59 &#215; 1010 cm&#8722;3) and a lower resistivity (8.2 &#215; 107 &#937; cm). However, the Bi/CsPbBr3/Au devices with asymmetric electrode structure exhibit an enhanced signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (14), a stable and low dark current density (7 nA cm&#8722;2) with a current drift of 5.8 &#215; 10&#8722;15 A cm&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 V&#8722;1, and a high sensitivity of 55722 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 for X&#8208;ray detection at an electric field of 3000&#160;V cm&#8722;1. Moreover, the irradiated device remained stable X&#8208;ray response characteristics after 220 days aging. These findings highlight the exceptional defect tolerance and irradiation stability of CsPbBr3 devices for high&#8208;performance radiation detections, offering critical insights for their long&#8208;term deployment in high&#8208;radiation environments.

         <title>Chiral Noncovalent Peptide Glasses for Highly Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral noncovalent peptide glasses with high transparency, large size, and self&#8208;healing are constructed via an ambient supramolecular&#8208;coordination synergistic strategy. These glasses exhibit high and tunable circularly polarized luminescence (|glum| up to 0.29) and multi&#8208;modal encryption, paving the way for sustainable photonic security materials.








Abstract
Peptide&#8208;based noncovalent glasses exhibit natural origins, green synthesis conditions, and self&#8208;healing properties, representing a promising sustainable alternative to conventional glasses. However, developing chiral noncovalent peptide glasses with highly circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is still a challenging task. Herein, a supramolecular&#8208;coordination synergistic induced strategy is reported for constructing enantiomeric noncovalent peptide glasses from carnosine (Car) enantiomers and metal ions (Zn2+, Eu3+, Tb3+, Gd3+) under ambient conditions. The resulting chiral Car(M) peptide glasses not only exhibit high optical transparency (&gt;90%), large sizes, easily processable shapes, and high ambient self&#8208;healing performances, but also show programmable multicolor emission, chiral amplification, and full&#8208;spectrum CPL encoding. Due to the synergistic metal coordination and hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular interactions, the obtained chiral Car(M) glasses reveal record&#8208;high and tunable CPL with dissymmetry factors (|glum|) up to 0.29. Leveraging the high transparency and multicolor chiral emission of Car(M) glasses, an anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform is demonstrated including flexible multicolor QR codes, filter&#8208;resolved patterns, polarization&#8208;sensitive Morse codes, and programmable dot&#8208;array encryption. This work fabricates new chiral noncovalent peptide glasses that exhibit rapid self&#8208;healing capabilities and high, tunable CPL performance, thereby pioneering a novel avenue for chiral photonic applications.

         <title>Without Contact Resistance, Proteins in Thin&#8208;Film Solid&#8208;State Junctions Can Be Efficient Electronic Conducting Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that contact resistance is effectively eliminated in two&#8208;probe micropore device metal/protein/metal bioelectronic junctions. These results, using two different protein types in these junctions, show that, as ultrathin (&lt;40 nm) films, proteins are an even more efficient electronic transport medium than previously thought, when the contact resistance is still included in measurements.








Abstract
The solid&#8208;state protein junctions have shown efficient electron transport over a few tens of nanometer lengthscale. This work demonstrates, how the contact resistance (RC&#770;$\widehat {{R_{\mathrm{C}}}}$) of a solid&#8208;state protein junctions, treated as a contact&#8208;limited process, which can be extracted quantitatively from the measured junction resistance (RP) by using the extrapolated zero&#8208;length resistance and series resistance (RS). Alternating current (impedance spectroscopy) and direct current measurements are used to examine charge transport in junctions of human serum albumin (HSA) and bacteriorhodopsin (bR) films with varying thicknesses. Three contact configurations, Si&#8211;Au, Au&#8211;eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn), and, in a micropore device (MpD), Au&#8211;Pd, are compared. While Si&#8211;Au and Au&#8211;EGaIn junctions exhibit substantial RC&#770;$\widehat {{R_{\mathrm{C}}}}$ that are ascribed to interfacial oxides and electrostatic protein&#8211;electrode interactions, MpD effectively eliminates RC&#770;$\widehat {{R_{\mathrm{C}}}}$, enabling measuring the intrinsic electron transport across HSA and bR films. The exponential length&#8208;dependence of RP shows a transport decay constant (&#946;) that varies with interfacial conditions, underscoring the role of contact engineering. By minimizing RC&#770;$\widehat {{R_{\mathrm{C}}}}$, exceptionally low &#946; values (&#8776;0.7&#8211;1.1 nm&#8722;1) are found, proving that, indeed, proteins can have outstanding charge transport efficiencies.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Doping and Conjugation&#8208;Extension Enable Ultrahigh&#8208;Bright Full&#8208;Color Carbon Quantum Dots for Tunable Liquid&#8208;State Lasers and 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;bright full&#8208;color fluorescent carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are synthesized via a single&#8208;precursor system, achieving photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) approaching 100% (hereafter referred to as unity&#8208;CQDs). These unity&#8208;CQDs exhibit superior liquid&#8208;state laser performance compare to the widely used organic dye, Rhodamine B. The enclosed area of the CIE color coordinates for the laser spectra of these unity&#8208;CQDs covers 152.6% of the NTSC color gamut. Furthermore, these unity&#8208;CQDs demonstrate excellent compatibility with various polymers, retaining their intense fluorescence even after thorough mixing. High&#8208;precision micro/nano 3D printing has been successfully achieved using these unity&#8208;CQDs, thereby confirming their micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;scale processability.








Abstract
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) represent a novel solution&#8208;processable gain material with significant potential to replace conventional nano&#8208;luminescent materials such as organic molecules, quantum dots, and perovskites. However, the relatively low fluorescence brightness (FB) and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) have hindered their widespread adoption. In this study, pyrene is used as the sole precursor to introduce various heteroatom dopants, and followed by solvothermal treatment to synthesize blue&#8208;, green&#8208;, and red&#8208;emissive CQDs with PLQYs approaching 100% (referred to as &#8220;unity&#8208;CQDs&#8221;). The FBs of these CQDs are all approximately 2 million. Pure unity&#8208;CQDs directly emit quasi&#8208;single&#8208;mode blue, green, and red lasers in a simple mirrorless pumping system that covers an area equivalent to 152.6% of the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) standard color gamut. These lasers exhibit significantly higher Q&#8208;factors, higher gain coefficients, superior stabilities, and lower thresholds than those of Rhodamine B. Additionally, unity&#8208;CQDs demonstrate single&#8208;photon and two&#8208;photon excitation bright fluorescent imaging in biological staining. Furthermore, they can be combined with various polymer materials for solid&#8208;state vivid fluorescence applications including flexible high&#8208;transparent films, textiles, artwares, and high&#8208;precise micron&#8208;scale 3D printings. The research findings presented herein will contribute significantly toward the development and practical utilization of multicolor CQDs exhibiting ultra&#8208;high PLQYs and FBs.

         <title>Terahertz Electronic and Spin Currents in Wafer&#8208;Scale Van der Waals Bi2Se3/WSe2 Heterostructures and Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Van der Waals heterostructures offer exciting possibilities for artificial materials with unique optical, electronic, and spintronic properties. However, their use in the terahertz (THz) range is limited due to material constraints. This study demonstrates scalable, large&#8208;area, crystalline 2D heterostructures, combining topological insulators, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), and ferromagnets. This enables a range of THz phenomena from spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion, nonlinear down&#8208;conversion and magnetic proximity effects in a single heterostructure stack. Further, different TMD polymorphs &#8211; the crystal phase &#8208; significantly alter the THz responses, providing a pathway for advanced heterostructure engineering in 2D materials.








Abstract
Van der Waals heterostructures and polymorphs have promised the realization of artificial materials with multiple physical phenomena such as giant optical nonlinearities, spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge interconversion in spintronics and topological carrier protection, through an infinitely diverse set of 2D quantum materials and their stacking order in a single layered device. However, their exploitation for the terahertz range has been limited with most investigations based around the optical domain, owing to the use of exfoliated material that inherently limits both the dimensions of the materials and the scalability for applications. Here, the combination of terahertz electronic and spin currents is demonstrated through the realization of large area complex crystalline heterostructures of topological insulators, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and ferromagnets. This is demonstrated through down&#8208;conversion of optical beams into coherent terahertz currents, where the terahertz phase permits the decoupling of the physical phenomena, and bringing novel functionalities beyond those achievable in simple homostructures. In particular, the role of different TMD polymorphs (stacking orders &#8208; 1T&#8242;, 2H, and 3R) is shown with the simple change of one atomic monolayer of the material stack entirely changing the terahertz responses &#8211; both electrical and magnetic &#8208; of the artificial material. This allows to highlight ultrafast phenomena that combine both the electronic&#8208; and spin&#8208;based processes in these structures. The importance of the crystal symmetry on the magnetic properties through proximity effects is further demonstrated, showing a nonlinearity of magnetic origin as a result of the 1T&#8242; polymorph. As well as control of the terahertz currents through different polymorphs, this scalable integration of a set of highly diverse materials establishes a platform for next&#8208;generation 2D heterostructures that integrate photonic, electronic, and spintronic properties into device&#160;architectures.

         <title>COF&#8208;Based S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing COF&#8208;based S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions has been proposed as a promising strategy to enhance charge separation while maintaining strong redox capabilities, thus achieving prominent photocatalytic performance. This review begins with presenting a fresh perspective on the development and scientific significance of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, followed by a summarization of their rational design principles and the most advanced techniques currently used to verify the underlying charge transfer mechanisms. Furthermore, the review also provides a comprehensive overview of various applications of COF&#8208;based S&#8208;scheme photocatalysts. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives for development are proposed.








Abstract
Semiconductor photocatalysis presents a promising route to convert solar energy into storable fuels and tackle global energy and environmental challenges. However, its efficiency is often hindered by rapid electron&#8211;hole recombination. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8212;a class of crystalline, porous organic polymers&#8212;offer exceptional potential for photocatalysis owing to their precisely tunable structures and distinctive physicochemical properties, yet their performance remains limited by intrinsic charge recombination. To overcome this limitation, the construction of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions has been proposed as a promising strategy to enhance charge separation while maintaining strong redox capabilities. This review begins by presenting a comprehensive perspective on the development and scientific significance of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. It then systematically summarizes the design principles and synthetic strategies of COFs, followed by an in&#8208;depth discussion of the fabrication methods and principles of COF&#8208;based S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. Furthermore, advanced characterization techniques that enable precise elucidation of charge migration pathways within these heterostructures are highlighted. The review also provides a comprehensive overview of recent applications of COF&#8208;based S&#8208;scheme photocatalysts, including hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, environmental remediation, hydrogen peroxide production, and others. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives are discussed to inspire continued innovation in the development of high&#8208;performance S&#8208;scheme photocatalytic systems.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;PARPi Conjugates Delivering USP1i for Maximizing Synthetic Lethality to Stimulate STING Pathway in High&#8208;Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A GSH&#8208;responsive nanoparticle co&#8208;delivering a USP1 inhibitor and Niraparib amplifies DNA damage and collapses homologous recombination repair. This strategy restores PARPi sensitivity, remodels the ovarian tumor microenvironment, and achieves strong synergy with immune checkpoint blockade, offering a translational nanomedicine solution for overcoming therapeutic resistance in high&#8208;grade serous ovarian cancer.








Abstract
Overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and therapeutic resistance remains a significant challenge in ovarian cancer treatment. In this study, a glutathione&#8208;responsive polymeric nanoparticle platform for the co&#8208;delivery of the USP1 inhibitor SJB3&#8208;019A and the PARP inhibitor Niraparib is developed. This system synergistically enhances DNA damage accumulation, suppresses homologous recombination repair, and robustly activate the STING signaling pathway, leading to enhanced type I interferon responses and mitigation of immune evasion. Mechanistically, USP1 inhibition significantly impairs DNA repair, amplifying the synthetic lethality of PARP inhibition and promoting immunogenic cell death. In vivo studies demonstrated precise, glutathione&#8208;responsive drug release and substantial tumor accumulation of the nanoparticles, resulting in remarkable antitumor efficacy in murine ovarian cancer models. Importantly, this combinational approach effectively remodels the tumor microenvironment by increasing CD8&#8314; T cell infiltration and enhancing tumor sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade therapies. This innovative strategy targeting DNA damage responses presents a promising platform for precise and effective ovarian cancer immunotherapy.

Textile Encoding via Embroidered Tessellations
In article number 2500959, Leonid Zinatullin, Indrek Must, and co&#8208;authors present encoded textiles that mimic skin tension lines. Widely available machine embroidery is used to define transitional strain by locally packing extra length of thread in a tile pattern. Their technology demonstrator, feet&#8208;confirmable shoes, demonstrates encoding at a resolution sufficient for mimicking skin biomechanics and suggests new wearable robotic applications.

Adaptive Epitaxy of C&#8208;Si&#8208;Ge&#8208;Sn
In article number 2506919, Omar Concepci&#243;n, Giovanni Capellini, Detlev Gr&#252;tzmacher, Dan Buca, and co&#8208;workers highlight the successful epitaxial growth of novel CSiGeSn and CGeSn/SiGeSn quantum well structures, composed entirely of group&#8208;IV elements. These C&#8208; and Sn&#8208;containing ternary and quaternary semiconductors exhibit excellent crystalline quality with precise control over composition and strain. This work expands the portfolio of direct&#8208;bandgap group&#8208;IV materials that can be monolithically integrated on silicon, marking a significant step toward next&#8208;generation CMOS&#8208;compatible optoelectronic devices.

Domain Wall Motion
During polarization switching in AlScN, domain&#8208;wall transverse motion precedes longitudinal motion due to a 98% reduction in energy barriers. By regulating the mixed polarity penetrating the entire film to promote transverse motion, this work enables low&#8208;field&#8208;driven domain wall motion, reducing Ec by 25% and suppressing wake&#8208;up behavior across 6&#8208;inch wafers to advance energy&#8208;efficient wurtzite ferroelectric devices for CMOS integration. More details can be found in article number 2505988 by Xiaojuan Sun, He Tian, Dabing Li, and co&#8208;workers.

Heterogeneous Liquid&#8208;Crystal Superstructures
In article number 2506778, Peng Chen, Wei Hu, Yan&#8208;Qing Lu, and co&#8208;workers report a heterogeneous liquid&#8208;crystal (LC) superstructure with integrated nematic and chiral LCs. Through a new strategy called multidimensional photopatterning, this superstructure can simultaneously achieve near&#8208;field full&#8208;color printing and far&#8208;field full&#8208;color holography. This study facilitates the exquisite construction of LC superstructures and enlightens higher&#8208;dimensional soft matter photonics.

         <title>The Rise of Mechanobiology for Advanced Cell Engineering and Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the growing demand for cell&#8208;based therapies, efficient cellular engineering is crucial. This review calls for greater recognition of mechanobiology principles applied through advanced biomaterial designs, mechanical confinement, and highlights recent advances using micro/nanotechnologies to enhance cell manufacturing. Challenges and opportunities are also discussed to encourage further innovation in advanced cell engineering.








Abstract
The rise of cell&#8208;based therapies, regenerative medicine, and synthetic biology, has created an urgent need for efficient cell engineering, which involves the manipulation of cells for specific purposes. This demand is driven by breakthroughs in cell manufacturing, from fundamental research to clinical therapies. These innovations have come with a deeper understanding of developmental biology, continued optimization of mechanobiological processes and platforms, and the deployment of advanced biotechnological approaches. Induced pluripotent stem cells and immunotherapies like chimeric antigen receptor T cells enable personalized, scalable treatments for regenerative medicine and diseases beyond oncology. But continued development of cell manufacturing and its concomitant clinical advances is hindered by limitations in the production, efficiency, safety, regulation, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and scalability of current manufacturing routes. Here, recent developments are examined in cell engineering, with particular emphasis on mechanical aspects, including biomaterial design, the use of mechanical confinement, and the application of micro&#8208; and nanotechnologies in the efficient production of enhanced cells. Emerging approaches are described along each of these avenues based on state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fundamental mechanobiology. It is called on the field to consider mechanical cues, often overlooked in cell manufacturing, as key tools to augment or, at times, even to replace the use of traditional soluble factors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of cell-based therapies, regenerative medicine, and synthetic biology, has created an urgent need for efficient cell engineering, which involves the manipulation of cells for specific purposes. This demand is driven by breakthroughs in cell manufacturing, from fundamental research to clinical therapies. These innovations have come with a deeper understanding of developmental biology, continued optimization of mechanobiological processes and platforms, and the deployment of advanced biotechnological approaches. Induced pluripotent stem cells and immunotherapies like chimeric antigen receptor T cells enable personalized, scalable treatments for regenerative medicine and diseases beyond oncology. But continued development of cell manufacturing and its concomitant clinical advances is hindered by limitations in the production, efficiency, safety, regulation, cost-effectiveness, and scalability of current manufacturing routes. Here, recent developments are examined in cell engineering, with particular emphasis on mechanical aspects, including biomaterial design, the use of mechanical confinement, and the application of micro- and nanotechnologies in the efficient production of enhanced cells. Emerging approaches are described along each of these avenues based on state-of-the-art fundamental mechanobiology. It is called on the field to consider mechanical cues, often overlooked in cell manufacturing, as key tools to augment or, at times, even to replace the use of traditional soluble factors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte Engineering for Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically examines recent advancements in low&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LCEs) and analyzes current challenges, limitations, and failure mechanisms across various rechargeable battery systems using LCEs, including lithium&#8208;ion, lithium&#8208;metal, lithium&#8208;sulfur, sodium&#8208;ion, sodium&#8208;metal, zinc, potassium, calcium, and magnesium batteries. Modification strategies, theoretical simulations, and cutting&#8208;edge characterization techniques for LCEs are discussed, and future directions for high&#8208;performance LCEs are proposed to address ongoing challenges.








Abstract
Low&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LCEs) present significant potential for actual applications because of their cost&#8208;effectiveness, low viscosity, reduced side reactions, and wide&#8208;temperature electrochemical stability. However, current electrolyte research predominantly focuses on regulation strategies for conventional 1 m electrolytes, high&#8208;concentration electrolytes, and localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes, leaving design principles, optimization methods, and prospects of LCEs inadequately summarized. LCEs face unique challenges that cannot be addressed by the existing theories and approaches applicable to the three common electrolytes mentioned above; thus, tailored strategies to provide development guidance are urgently needed. Herein, a systematic overview of recent progress in LCEs is provided and subsequent development directions are suggested. This review proposes the core challenge of the high solvent ratio in LCEs, which triggers unstable organic&#8208;enriched electrolyte/electrode interface formation and anion depletion near the anode. On the basis of these issues, modification strategies for LCEs, including passivation interface construction and solvent&#8210;anion interaction optimization, are used in various rechargeable battery systems. Finally, the role of advanced simulations and cutting&#8208;edge characterization techniques in revealing LCE failure mechanisms is further highlighted, offering new perspectives for their future development and practical application in next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries.

Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, characterized by their high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness, are the primary candidates for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Yet, critical challenges persist, largely owing to the polysulfide (PS) anion shuttle and the instability of the lithium metal anode (LMA). Salt anions are indispensable in batteries, which influence the basic properties of bulk electrolytes (e.g., solubility, stability, and ion conductivity) and the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphases. Apart from those, the intrinsic characteristics of anions are of particular importance in Li&#8211;S batteries, as PS anions are major active intermediates that directly determine the sulfur redox kinetics and reversibility. However, the anion regulation needs further investigated, especially according to the Li&#8211;S chemistry. In this regard, fundamental considerations are provided on the anion engineering of Li&#8211;S batteries. Through a comprehensive analysis, the electrochemical behaviors of anions are reviewed. Then, the recent works on anion regulation for cathodes and anodes are summarized. For sulfur cathodes, the PSs dissolution, adsorption, conversion kinetics, and pathway are discussed in detail. For LMA, the influence of anion on lithium diffusion kinetic, the formation of SEI, and the anticorrosion are summarized. Finally, insights into the future development of anion studies are provided, aiming to identify more adequate anions for Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Cuproptosis to Cuproptosis&#8208;Like: Therapeutic Strategies for Bacterial Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review reflects on the similarities and differences between cuproptosis and cuproptosis&#8208;like death. Therapeutic strategies using cuproptosis&#8208;like death are highlighted, including multi&#8208;modal combination approaches integrating nanozyme&#8208;based chemodynamic therapy, phototherapy, gas therapy and immunomodulation against bacterial infectious diseases. Thus, understanding the mechanism of cuproptosis&#8208;like death and developing therapeutic strategies based on this process could contribute to progress in antibacterial treatment.








Abstract
Bacterial infections have become a serious public health concern worldwide, and the irrational use of antibiotics has led to the proliferation of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria, undermining the effectiveness of traditional antibacterial therapies. Cuproptosis is a copper&#8208;dependent cell death pathway that has recently been identified as a promising target for drug development and treating bacterial infections. Although bacteria differ from eukaryotes, as they lack mitochondria in their cells, they can still be affected by copper&#8208;mediated lethality by binding to lipoylated proteins and leading to abnormal protein aggregation and loss of iron&#8210;sulfur cluster proteins. This review reflects on the similarities and differences between cuproptosis and cuproptosis&#8208;like death. In addition, we highlight therapeutic strategies using cuproptosis&#8208;like death, including multi&#8208;modal combination approaches integrating nanozyme&#8208;based chemodynamic therapy, phototherapy, gas therapy and immunomodulation against bacterial infectious diseases. Thus, understanding the mechanism of cuproptosis&#8208;like death and developing therapeutic strategies based on this process could contribute to progress in antibacterial treatment.

         <title>Adaptive Epitaxy of C&#8208;Si&#8208;Ge&#8208;Sn: Customizable Bulk and Quantum Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pushes the boundaries of epitaxy by achieving all&#8208;group&#8208;IV semiconductor heterostructures and extensive characterization. The alloys open new research topics in material properties investigation for next&#8208;generation electronic and optoelectronic device technologies.








Abstract
The successful demonstration of (Si)Ge1&#8208;xSnx alloys as direct&#8208;gap materials for infrared lasers has driven intense research on group IV&#8208;based devices for nanoelectronics, energy harvesting, and quantum computing applications. The material palette of direct&#8208;gap group&#8208;IV alloys can be further extended by introducing carbon to fine&#8208;tune their structural and electronic properties, significantly expanding their functionality. This work presents heteroepitaxial growth of C(Si)GeSn alloys using an industry&#8208;standard reduced&#8208;pressure chemical vapor deposition reactor. The introduction of CBr4 as a precursor enables controlled incorporation of C atoms (&lt;1 at.%) into the epilayer lattice, while simultaneously increasing the Sn content in the CGeSn alloy up to &#8776;18 at.%. Carbon plays a key role in modulating strain, stabilizing the crystal structure, and influencing material properties. By leveraging alloying and strain engineering, quaternary CSiGeSn bulk layers and CGeSn/GeSn heterostructures are epitaxially grown. The impact of C incorporation on optical emission is investigated in LEDs based on CGeSn/GeSn multiple quantum wells, demonstrating enhanced near&#8208;infrared emission at 2.54 &#181;m, which is sustained up to room temperature.

         <title>On&#8208;the&#8208;Fly Synthesis of Freestanding Spin&#8208;Crossover Architectures With Tunable Magnetic Properties</title>

3D flow&#8208;focusing devices are an ideal platform for the processing and integration of functional materials within polymeric matrices. In this article, A. Tuan Ngo, D. Aguil&#224;, T. Sotto Mayor, M. Palacios&#8208;Corella, J. Puigmart&#237;&#8208;Luis show the on&#8208;the&#8208;fly processing of a prototypical SCO material&#8212;known for its challenging processability&#8212;thereby opening new avenues for its implementation in real&#8208;world applications.









Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) molecular&#8208;based switches have shown promise across a range of applications since their discovery, including sensing, information storage, actuators, and displays. Yet limited processability remains a barrier to their real&#8208;world implementation, as traditional methods for integrating SCO materials into polymer matrices are often complex, expensive, and prone to producing uneven material distributions. Herein, we demonstrate how 3D flow&#8208;focusing chemistry enables unprecedented control for the direct fabrication of SCO composite materials, addressing key challenges in processability, scalability, and cost. By using a 3D coaxial flow&#8208;focusing microfluidic device, we simultaneously synthesize [Fe(Htrz)2(trz)](BF4) and achieve its homogeneous incorporation into alginate fibers in a continuous manner. The device&#8217;s versatility allows for precise manipulation of the reaction&#8208;diffusion (RD) zone, resulting in SCO composite fibers with tunable physicochemical and magnetic properties. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to isolate these fibers as freestanding architectures and highlight the potential for printing them with defined shapes. Finally, we show that the 3D control of the RD zone granted by continuous flow microfluidic devices offers precise spatiotemporal control over the distribution of SCO complexes within the fibers, effectively encoding SCO materials into them. SCO&#8208;encoded fibers can seamlessly combine adaptability and functionality, offering innovative solutions for application&#8208;specific customization.

         <title>Textile Encoding Inspired by Langer Lines via Elastically Graded Embroidered Tessellations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A standard embroidery machine can encode skin&#8208;like directional mechanics into stretchable fabrics that, when worn, augment the wearer's skin. Zigzag stitch patterns, inspired by skin collagen structure, pack extra slack in threads that, when tessellated, mimic Langer lines. Pneumatic fingers with multiple bending modes and feet&#8208;conforming footwear, designed using intuitive color coding, illustrate uses in robotics.








Abstract
Morphological anisotropies and nonlinear mechanical properties shape the kinematic agility of organisms and engineered structures. Tissues, such as skin, act as biological metamaterials whose internal structures, such as packed collagen fibers, produce nonlinear and directional responses. Similarly, hierarchical thread packing governs the mechanical response of textiles. However, the capability of encoding textiles at the fabric level and at a sufficient resolution remains limited. Embroidering triangularly tiled zigzag patterns of inextensible thread on a stretchable fabric is demonstrated to encode distributed, directional stress&#8211;strain behavior at subcentimeter resolution, sufficient to mimic complex physiological characteristics such as Langer lines of the skin. The triangular unit cells solved the K&#246;nigsberg bridge problem of filling a plane with a continuous thread pair. The encoding maps directionality, directional contrast, and magnitude, three parameters that define unit cells' compliance, into hue&#8208;saturation&#8208;value color space for rapid qualitative design. Cross&#8208;talk&#8208;free arrays of embroidered restrictors enable scalable augmentation of textile mechanics. The transition threshold from the matrix&#8208; to fiber&#8208;defined behavior is achieved with 85% fidelity, enabling customizable shape&#8208;morphing structures such as restrictor bladder actuators and feet&#8208;conforming shoes. Industry&#8208;standard machine embroidery scales biomechanics&#8208;inspired structures for wearable and environmental robotics and promises future biohybrid&#160;technologies.

         <title>Bioxolography Using Diphenyliodonium Chloride and N&#8208;Vinylpyrrolidone Enables Rapid High&#8208;Resolution Volumetric 3D Printing of Spatially Encoded Living Matter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioxolography, a novel volumetric 3D&#8208;bioprinting technique, enables rapid and high&#8208;resolution fabrication of &gt;1&#160;cm3 engineered living materials. A newly developed three&#8208;component photoinitiator system significantly enhances the photoreactivity of gelatin methacryloyl&#8208;based bioresins, allowing for precise xolographic bioprinting. This platform supports multimaterial printing, concentration&#8208;controlled molecular patterning, and grayscale&#8208;mediated mechanical modulation to create complex, biomimetic, and spatially controlled architectures.








Abstract
Light&#8208;based volumetric bioprinting enables fabrication of cubic centimeter&#8208;sized living materials with micrometer resolution in minutes. Xolography is a light sheet&#8208;based volumetric printing technology that offers unprecedented volumetric generation rates and print resolutions for hard plastics. However, the limited solubility and reactivity of current dual&#8208;color photoinitiators (DCPIs) in aqueous media have hindered their application for high&#8208;resolution bioprinting of living matter. Here, we present a novel three&#8208;component formulation that drastically improves photoreactivity and thereby enables high&#8208;resolution, rapid, and cytocompatible Xolographic biofabrication of intricately architected yet mechanically robust living materials. To achieve this, various relevant additives are systematically explored, which revealed that diphenyliodonium chloride and N&#8208;vinylpyrrolidone strongly enhance D&#8208;mediated photoreactivity, as confirmed by dual&#8208;color photo&#8208;rheology. This enables Xolographic bioprinting of gelatin methacryloyl&#8208;based bioresins, producing &gt;1&#160;cm3 constructs at &#8776;20&#160;&#181;m positive and 125&#160;&#181;m negative resolution within minutes. Multimaterial printing, molecular patterning, and grayscale&#8208;mediated mechanical patterning are explored to programmably create intricate, biomimetic, and concentration&#8208;controlled architectures. We demonstrate the Bioxolographic printing of various cell types, showing excellent cell viability, compatibility with long&#8208;term culture, and ability for nascent protein deposition. These results position Bioxolography as a transformative platform for rapid, scalable, high&#8208;resolution fabrication of functional living materials with encoded chemical and mechanical properties.

         <title>Liquid Metal&#8208;Vitrimer Conductive Composite for Recyclable and Resilient Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the growing electronic waste challenge, an electrically conductive, healable, and recyclable plastic composite is created, composed of vitrimer and liquid metal microdroplets. A reconfigurable circuit board is demonstrated using this composite material, providing a notable step toward sustainable and robust electronic technologies.








Abstract
Electronic devices are ubiquitous in modern society, yet their poor recycling rates contribute to substantial economic losses and worsening environmental impacts from electronic waste (E&#8208;waste) disposal. Here, recyclable and healable electronics are reported through a vitrimer&#8208;liquid metal (LM) microdroplet composite. These electrically conductive, yet plastic&#8208;like composites display mechanical qualities of rigid thermosets and recyclability through a dynamic covalent polymer network. The composite exhibits a high glass transition temperature, good solvent resistance, high electrical conductivity, and recyclability. The vitrimer synthesis proceeds without the need for a catalyst or a high curing temperature, which enables facile fabrication of the composite materials. The as&#8208;synthesized vitrimer exhibits a fast relaxation time with reconfigurability and shape memory. The electrically conductive composite exhibits high electrical conductivity with LM volume loading as low as 5 vol.%. This enables the fabrication of fully vitrimer&#8208;based circuit boards consisting of sensors and indicator LEDs integrated with LM&#8208;vitrimer conductive wiring. Electrical self&#8208;healing and thermally triggered material healing are further demonstrated with the composites. The vitrimer and LM&#8208;composite provide a pathway toward fully recyclable, mechanically robust, and reconfigurable electronics, thus advancing the field of electronic&#160;materials.

         <dc:description>
A novel paradigm of flexible transistor featuring solid&#8211;liquid hybrid interfaces is presented, where liquid metal and ionic liquid, confined in microchannels, serve as the source/drain electrodes and gate dielectric, respectively. Benefiting from the liquids' inherent softness and damage&#8208;free processing, Fermi level pinning is significantly mitigated to a factor of &#8739;s&#8739;= 0.7, achieving a subthreshold swing of 60.7 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1, near the theoretical limit.








Abstract
Contact engineering at the semiconductor&#8211;electrode and semiconductor&#8211;dielectric interfaces is critical to the performance of electronic devices, especially for delicate 2D semiconductors. Here, this study proposes a new paradigm of flexible field&#8208;effect transistors featuring solid&#8211;liquid hybrid interfaces, in which liquid metal and ionic liquid, confined within microchannels, function as the source/drain electrodes and gate dielectric, respectively. These interfaces provide MoS&#8322; with undisturbed, atomically smooth electrical contacts, and enable efficient gate control via electric double layers. Benefiting from the inherent softness of liquids and their damage&#8208;free processing, Fermi level pinning is significantly mitigated by the liquid metal, achieving a pinning factor |s|&#160; = &#160;0.7. Meanwhile, the ionic liquid enables a subthreshold swing of 60.7&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1, approaching the theoretical thermal limit. Furthermore, our flexible transistors demonstrate multifunctionality as enhanced logic gates, low&#8208;voltage inverters, and ultra&#8208;high&#8208;linearity synaptic devices. This work underscores the promise of liquid&#8208;enabled contact strategies for advancing low&#8208;power, flexible electronics and soft robotic systems.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that aligned extracellular matrix (ECM) topography in the tumor microenvironment induces neuroblastoma cells to acquire mesenchymal features closely associated with therapy resistance and metastatic potential, using biomimetic substrates that mimic ECM topography. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism is elucidated, identifying the ROCK&#8211;YAP&#8211;EZH2 signaling axis as a key driver of the phenotypic transition linked to poor clinical outcomes.








Abstract
Neuroblastoma (NB), the most common extracranial solid tumor in children, exhibits intra&#8208;tumoral heterogeneity with two interconvertible identities: adrenergic (ADRN) and mesenchymal (MES). Compared to ADRN cells, MES cells exhibit phenotypes associated with metastasis and therapy resistance. Thus, the transition from ADRN to MES may contribute to poor clinical outcomes, necessitating further investigation into this ADRN&#8208;to&#8208;MES transition (AMT) to improve clinical responses. The extracellular matrix (ECM), a critical component of the tumor microenvironment (TME), provides structural support and delivers mechanical signals that influence oncogenic processes. This research demonstrates that high&#8208;risk NB tumors contain more topographically aligned ECM fibers than low&#8208;risk NB tumors. Using nano&#8208;fabricated biomaterials designed to mimic the aligned ECM, ECM topography is revealed to drive AMT through transcriptional and epigenetic changes, accompanied by enhanced MES phenotypic features. Furthermore, ECM topography is shown to stimulate Rho&#8208;associated kinase and YAP signaling pathways, which mediate ECM&#8208;driven reprogramming. These findings introduce ECM&#8208;driven AMT as a novel mechanism in NB progression and provide insights into TME&#8208;targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at suppressing MES cells to improve clinical outcomes in NB.

&lt;p&gt;Neuroblastoma (NB), the most common extracranial solid tumor in children, exhibits intra-tumoral heterogeneity with two interconvertible identities: adrenergic (ADRN) and mesenchymal (MES). Compared to ADRN cells, MES cells exhibit phenotypes associated with metastasis and therapy resistance. Thus, the transition from ADRN to MES may contribute to poor clinical outcomes, necessitating further investigation into this ADRN-to-MES transition (AMT) to improve clinical responses. The extracellular matrix (ECM), a critical component of the tumor microenvironment (TME), provides structural support and delivers mechanical signals that influence oncogenic processes. This research demonstrates that high-risk NB tumors contain more topographically aligned ECM fibers than low-risk NB tumors.

         <title>Restoring Ultra&#8208;Flat Bridgman&#8208;Fabricated Single&#8208;Crystal Cu(111) Wafers via Recrystallization Arrest Strategy for High&#8208;Quality Graphene Epitaxy</title>

         <dc:description>
By investigating strain&#8208; and dislocation&#8208;induced recrystallization, a tailored staged annealing method with recrystallization arrest is developed to preserve single&#8208;crystallinity. Ultra&#8208;flat Bridgman&#8208;fabricated Cu(111) wafers are restored, enabling high&#8208;quality graphene heteroepitaxy on wafer&#8208;scale substrates.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) and its ultra&#8208;flat surface are crucial for the heteroepitaxy of high&#8208;quality, single&#8208;crystal graphene films with minimal folds and additional layers. Bridgman method coupled with cutting and chemical&#8208;mechanical polishing presents a straightforward and cost&#8208;effective approach for preparing ultra&#8208;flat Cu(111) wafers but is simply discarded due to its incompatibility with standard high&#8208;temperature procedures for annealing and graphene growth. Herein, an in&#8208;depth investigation is conducted into the mechanisms of recrystallization and reverse single&#8208;crystallization induced by processing strain and dislocations. A recrystallization arrest strategy is proposed for Bridgman&#8208;cutting&#8208;polishing (BCP) derived Cu(111) wafers, guaranteeing the high single&#8208;crystallinity (96.6%) and flatness (0.81 nm) of epitaxy substrates. The thorough investigation has provided a comprehensive understanding of the effects of surface roughness on the orientation, proportion of adlayers, as well as transfer qualities of graphene films. By highlighting the paramount importance of the Bridgman cutting&#8208;polishing methodology, the efforts set the stage for achieving notable cost savings in the manufacture of ultra&#8208;flat, single&#8208;crystal graphene wafers.

         <title>Superblack Carbon Hierarchitectures for Multispectral Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superblack carbon hierarchitectures are developed through synergistic cross&#8208;dimensional engineering that integrates physical structuring with chemical modification, enabling high&#8208;performance multispectral absorption across visible, infrared, and microwave regimes simultaneously. Carbon microparticles with a fractal dimension approaching 1.0, or those possessing a networked structure, inherently offer advantages in achieving broad and strong multispectral responses.








Abstract
Multispectral absorbing materials that can efficiently dissipate waves across the visible, infrared, and microwave regimes have long been pursued for advanced applications in fields such as space exploration, stealth, and camouflage. However, the wide range of incident wavelengths, spanning five orders of magnitude, presents a significant challenge for the practical implementation of multispectral absorbers. Herein, superblack carbon hierarchitectures (SCHs) are designed using a bottom&#8208;up approach involving the self&#8208;assembly and self&#8208;sacrifice of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), realizing synergistic morphological customization and dielectric gene editing (via carbon nitride like&#8208;moieties conjugated with C&#9552;C short chains). Through the cross&#8208;dimensional coupling action between light&#8208;trapping hierarchitecture and robust dielectric loss, superb visible light absorption (&gt;99.6%), high infrared absorption (98.5%/97.5%/99.6% for long&#8208;/mid&#8208;/short&#8208;wavelength infrared regimes), and ultrabroad microwave absorption (effective bandwidth of 8.52&#160;GHz, nearly covering both the X and Ku bands) can be simultaneously achieved in monolayer SCHs&#8208;based absorbers. Furthermore, the topologically transformed structures of SCHs enable a systematic dissection of the longstanding ambiguity surrounding the geometrical effect, revealing the synergistic influence of fractal dimension and interconnection status of microparticles, particularly in the microwave regime. This work introduces a new paradigm for multispectral absorption and advances the understanding of absorption mechanisms for developing next&#8208;generation absorbers.

In this study, sodium 2,5&#8208;difluorobenzoate (2,5&#8208;NaDPA) is utilized to reduce nucleation energy barrier difference at various convex angles on PbI2 layer, delaying the growth of perovskite crystals, and effectively promoting the grain size of perovskites. Eventually, the voids of large area PVK films are greatly restrained. A high efficiency of 28.28% is obtained from a fully textured perovskite/silicon tandem device prepared in ambient condition with an effective area of 19.9 cm2.

         <title>Polymers Microspheres as Colorful Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence Delivery for Printable Optical Multiplexing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrophilic polymer microsphere is introduced as a versatile carrier for achieving color&#8208; and lifetime&#8208;tunable ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) through the dynamic rearrangement of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the polymer matrix and the phosphor. These tunable UOP polymer microspheres exhibit significant potential for applications in printable optical multiplexing.








Abstract
The development of ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials with programmable color is of great significance yet remains challenging for various optoelectronic applications. In this work, a novel type of polymer microspheres is presented as versatile carriers capable of regulating UOP colors through the reversible absorption and release of different phosphors. The rigid environment, facilitated by intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the aryl carboxylic acid groups of the phosphors and the crosslinked polyacrylamide (PAM) microspheres, effectively suppresses non&#8208;radiative transitions, enabling UOP with an impressive emission lifetime of 3.68 s. Specifically, these polymer microspheres serve as dynamic carriers that can reload and release uniformly dispersed phosphors in aqueous solution, thereby rearranging intermolecular hydrogen bonds and tuning the UOP emission color across a spectrum from blue to green and red. Furthermore, by incorporating fluorescent dyes into the polymer microspheres, the UOP color range can be extended to cover the entire visible spectrum through energy transfer mechanisms. Finally, the successful application of these UOP polymer microspheres is demonstrated in optical multiplexing. This study not only proposes a novel strategy for achieving color&#8208;tunable UOP in polymer microspheres but also broadens their potential applications in advanced optoelectronic technologies.

&lt;p&gt;A hydrophilic polymer microsphere is introduced as a versatile carrier for achieving color- and lifetime-tunable ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) through the dynamic rearrangement of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the polymer matrix and the phosphor. These tunable UOP polymer microspheres exhibit significant potential for applications in printable optical multiplexing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials with programmable color is of great significance yet remains challenging for various optoelectronic applications. In this work, a novel type of polymer microspheres is presented as versatile carriers capable of regulating UOP colors through the reversible absorption and release of different phosphors. The rigid environment, facilitated by intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the aryl carboxylic acid groups of the phosphors and the crosslinked polyacrylamide (PAM) microspheres, effectively suppresses non-radiative transitions, enabling UOP with an impressive emission lifetime of 3.68 s. Specifically, these polymer microspheres serve as dynamic carriers that can reload and release uniformly dispersed phosphors in aqueous solution, thereby rearranging intermolecular hydrogen bonds and tuning the UOP emission color across a spectrum from blue to green and red. Furthermore, by incorporating fluorescent dyes into the polymer microspheres, the UOP color range can be extended to cover the entire visible spectrum through energy transfer mechanisms. Finally, the successful application of these UOP polymer microspheres is demonstrated in optical multiplexing. This study not only proposes a novel strategy for achieving color-tunable UOP in polymer microspheres but also broadens their potential applications in advanced optoelectronic technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Injectable Functional Porous Carbon&#8208;Loaded Hydrogel with Long&#8208;Term Retention and Synergistic Anti&#8208;Tumor Properties for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>

Injectable hydrogel (CFe/&#946;CP+Cis), developed by integrating &#946;&#8208;CD&#8208;g&#8208;PEGMA (&#946;CP) molecular brush hydrogel, single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;anchored porous carbon nanozyme (CFe), and cisplatin, combines chemodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, and immunoregulation to synergistically treat tumors, providing a new direction for precise and sustained treatment of tumors.








Abstract
In situ therapies show significant promise for the treatment of unresectable tumors that lack tumor supply vessels. However, it remains a tremendous challenge to achieve precise delivery and sustained release of anti&#8208;tumor agents with synergistic anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. Here, a novel in situ injectable hydrogel (denoted as CFe/&#946;CP+Cis hydrogel) has been designed by integrating &#946;&#8208;CD&#8208;g&#8208;PEGMA (&#946;CP) molecular brush hydrogel with functional carbon nanozyme (CFe) and cisplatin. The reversible gel network of &#946;CP hydrogel and the rigid nanoscale architecture of CFe endow CFe/&#946;CP+Cis hydrogel with properties conducive to injectability and long&#8208;term retention (more than 63 days). CFe and cisplatin mixed in hydrogel are both gradually released into the tumor tissue, facilitating the synergistic anti&#8208;tumor efficacy via ferroptosis and cytotoxicity. In addition, CFe/&#946;CP hydrogel can reduce the M2&#8208;like/M1&#8208;like ratio of macrophages&#160;and promote the infiltration of CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment to enhance anti&#8208;tumor immunity. As a result, the CFe/&#946;CP+Cis hydrogel demonstrates significant potential for precise and sustained tumor treatment through chemodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, immunoregulation, and long&#8208;term retention properties.

         <title>Lesional Macrophage&#8208;Targeted Nanomedicine Regulating Cholesterol Homeostasis for the Treatment of Atherosclerosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atherosclerosis (AS) progression is driven by foam cell dysfunction and inflammation. This work develops siTTENPs, a nanoplatform capable of delivering siTRPM2 and targeting lesional macrophages to inhibit oxidized low&#8208;density lipoprotein (oxLDL) uptake and improve the inflammatory microenvironment. Additionally, &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) modification enhances cholesterol clearance, restoring lipid homeostasis. In vitro and in vivo studies confirm that siTTENPs effectively induce AS plaque regression and slow disease progression.








Abstract
The accumulation of atherosclerosis plaques within arterial walls leads to cardiovascular events. Lipid&#8208;laden macrophages, known as foam cells play a pivotal role in atherosclerotic plaque progression by disrupting cholesterol homeostasis and facilitating inflammation. This study presents a rational and multivalent nanoplatform (siTTENPs) for atherosclerosis treatment. siTTENPs can form electrostatic complexes with the nucleic acid siTRPM2, thereby reducing oxidized low&#8208;density lipoprotein (oxLDL) uptake by foam cells and alleviating inflammation. Concurrently, &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) modified siTTENPs facilitate cholesterol clearance, further re&#8208;establishing lipid homeostasis. The nanometer size and S2P peptide (CRTLLTVRKC) modification endow these particles with specific targeting capabilities toward lesional macrophages, thereby enhancing their anti&#8208;atherosclerotic efficacy. Consequently, the siTTENPs delivery system effectively inhibits pathological cholesterol internalization while simultaneously promoting cholesterol efflux mechanisms and reducing inflammation. This therapeutic intervention leads to significant regression of atherosclerotic plaque. This study introduces an innovative therapeutic strategy aimed at improving cholesterol homeostasis, with promising implications for the treatment of atherosclerosis.

         <title>Free&#8208;Standing Supramolecular Pyridine N&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Silver(I) Metallogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive analysis of pyridine N&#8208;oxide&#8208;silver(I) trifluoroacetate complexes reveals remarkable mechanical strengths that enable the creation of free&#8208;standing objects with shape control, reaching dimensions of up to centimeters and shedding new insights into the gelation mechanisms.








Abstract
Twenty&#8208;seven pyridine N&#8208;oxides (PyNOs) are investigated to evaluate the gelation of their silver(I) trifluoroacetate (AgTFA) complexes across eight solvents. Gelation occurs selectively with PyNOs featuring electron&#8208;donating groups, while those with electron&#8208;withdrawing or mixed groups do not form gels. A combination of two different PyNOs, one with an electron&#8208;donating group and the second with an electron&#8208;withdrawing group, form a gel, suggesting that gel&#8208;forming PyNO&#8208;AgTFA can override the non&#8208;gelling tendency of PyNOs comprising electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. Pyridine&#8208;AgTFA complexes lacking the N&#8211;O group fail to gel, underscoring the crucial role of the N&#8211;O functionality and its coordination with silver(I) in facilitating gelation. The resulting PyNO&#8208;AgTFA gels demonstrate remarkable mechanical strengths, enabling the fabrication of free&#8208;standing and load&#8208;bearing gel shapes, such as rods and horseshoes, with sizes up to several centimeters. The analysis of 65 X&#8208;ray crystal structures reveals that PyNO&#8208;AgTFA complexes manifest four distinct structural motifs, even when crystallized under different solvents and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal ratios, demonstrating a strong preference for a specific set of silver(I) complexes. X&#8208;ray crystallography and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction studies predict gel structures without single crystals. Density functional theory calculations of recurring non&#8208;covalent interactions in the crystal structures show interaction energies ranging from &#8722;1 to &#8722;92 kJ mol&#8722;1.

         <title>Bioinspired Immunomodulatory Scaffold Based on Mineralized Lotus Stalks Laden with MnCO Microspheres for Accelerated Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MnCo@mPDA&#8208;coated mineralized lotus petiole (MM@MDL3) is developed for skull defect repair. The primary function of MM@MDL3 is to rapidly recruit cells to the bone defect area via its aligned channels. And the MM@MDL3 exhibits strong M2 macrophage polarization by the release of CO and Mn2+ ions, which further enhances angiogenesis and osteogenesis while inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and maturation.








Abstract
Bone regeneration remains a significant clinical challenge due to the complexity of the bone healing process and the need for biomaterials that provide both structural support and immunomodulatory functions. Here, a bioinspired immunomodulatory scaffold is developed, composed of mineralized decellularized lotus stalks (MDL) integrated with manganese carbonyl (MnCO)&#8208;loaded mesoporous polydopamine (mPDA) microspheres (MM@MDL3). This scaffold mimics the hierarchical architecture of natural bone while offering controlled CO and Mn2+ release, promoting M2 macrophage polarization, reducing inflammation, and enhancing osteogenesis. In vitro studies demonstrate that MM@MDL3 effectively promotes mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation by activating the BMP2/SMAD/RUNX2 pathway. In vivo rat calvarial defect models confirm significant bone regeneration, with increased bone volume, enhanced vascularization, and reduced osteoclastogenesis. These results demonstrate MM@MDL3 as a promising strategy for large&#8208;segment bone defect repair by integrating a biomimetic structure with immunomodulatory and osteogenic properties. The proposed scaffold has great potential for treating clinical large&#8208;segment bone defects.

         <title>A Biomimetic Copper Silicate&#8208;MOF Hybrid for Highly Stable Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the drosera rotundifolia, a hierarchical hollow CuSiO3&#8208;MOF hybrid is constructed for highly stable Zn metal anode, featuring good structural stability, abundant zincophilic sites, strong desolvation capability, and fast ion migration simultaneously. Thus, the Zn@CuSiO3&#8208;MOF anode displays long&#8208;term cycling lifespans of 1200 and 400 h even under high DODZn of 45% and 90%, outperforming most reported MOF&#8208;modified anodes.








Abstract
To promote the electrochemical performance of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, various artificial interlayers are developed to mitigate dendrite growth and H2O&#8208;induced side reactions of Zn anode. Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) interlayers show much potential in solving these problems, yet their practical usage is inhibited by their inferior structural stability during cycles. Herein, inspired by the biological mechanism and symbiotic architecture of drosera rotundifolia, this challenge is tackled by constructing a hierarchical hollow CuSiO3&#8208;MOF hybrid through in situ MOF conversion. For protecting Zn anode, this biomimetic hybrid offers good structural stability, abundant zincophilic sites, strong desolvation capability, and fast ion migration, which collectively enable highly stable dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping processes and suppress H2O&#8208;related side reactions. Consequently, the Zn@CuSiO3&#8208;MOF symmetric battery achieves an ultralong lifespan exceeding 3500 h with low voltage hysteresis. Remarkably, it maintains stable cycling behaviors of 1200 and 400 h even under high depths of discharge of 45% and 90%, outperforming the most reported MOF&#8208;modified anodes. Moreover, full cells with MnO2 and C@V2O3 cathodes exhibit exceptional cycling performance and rate capability, highlighting the practical applications of Zn@CuSiO3&#8208;MOF anode for grid storage and wearable electronics. This bioinspired strategy provides a feasible approach to constructing stable MOF&#8208;based hybrid for high&#8208;performance Zn anode.

         <title>Self&#8208;Growing Scaffold for Spatial and Border Expansive Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;growing scaffolds increase both the border and the space of obsolete defects. By balancing molecular cohesion and hydrogen bonding, the growth time can be regulated within 3&#8211;7 days. Dynamic shear forces induced by scaffold growth can inhibit hematoma, enhance focal adhesion, and accelerate extracellular matrix remodeling. This regenerative model allows for minimally invasive treatment of vertical bone augmentation.








Abstract
Tissue regeneration and repair techniques approaching personalized treatment are devoted to fabricating high&#8208;precision scaffolds that accurately match the size of the defect. However, scaffolds are difficult to implant in situ for obsolete defects with loss of original space, and the size is limited by confined boundary tissue. In nature, the development of fetuses, organs, and even plants all experience a matched growth in volume and border. Inspired by that, this study proposes a space&#8208;expanding regeneration model with a self&#8208;growing (SG) scaffold, which is then used in refractory alveolar ridge vertical bone augmentation. The SG scaffold contains a multistage hydrophilic polymer network. The initial size can be eliminated for minimally invasive implantation, and gradually increased by orderly absorption of tissue fluid, achieving controlled growth in vivo. The shearing force of the SG scaffold suppresses tissue hematoma and stimulates extracellular matrix remodeling. In addition, macrophages polarize toward M2 and secrete transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946;1. Meanwhile, bone regeneration is induced within the expanded space, achieving a &#8776;5&#8208;fold vertical increase of the rat skull, and supporting a 6&#8208;mm&#8208;long titanium implant. The SG scaffold provides a spatial and border extension model for obsolete injuries.

         <title>Bioinspired Hyperboloid Mechanical Metamaterial for Shock Absorption and Strain Regulation in Cartilage Remodeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the shock&#8208;absorbing architecture of natural insect elytra, a hyperboloid metamaterial scaffold exhibits compression&#8208;torsion coupling, converting mechanical loads into strain energy. The upper hyperboloid region promotes chondrogenesis via high strain, while the lower tough lattice favors osteogenesis, enhancing the integrative regeneration of both cartilage and subchondral bone.








Abstract
Inspired by the shock&#8208;absorbing capabilities of natural insect elytra, a hyperboloid lattice metamaterial exhibiting unique compression&#8208;torsion coupling behavior is designed and fabricated. This structure efficiently converts dynamic loads into strain energy, enabling high&#8208;strain elastic deformation. The hyperboloid lattice is integrated with a classic reticulation framework and filled with GelMA hydrogel, creating a tailored osteochondral scaffold with mechanical properties that closely match those of joint tissue. Under dynamic mechanical culture, compression&#8208;torsion stimulation in the hyperboloid zone induced high&#8208;strain elastic deformation, promoting chondrogenic differentiation of stem cells, while the more rigid reticulation zone, experiencing minimal deformation, facilitated osteogenic differentiation of stem cells. In a rabbit osteochondral defect model, hyperboloid&#8208;based shock&#8208;absorption scaffolds significantly enhanced the integrative repair of both cartilage and subchondral bone via the NF&#8208;&#954;B and calcium signaling pathways. The incorporation of the hyperboloid metamaterial, with its shock&#8208;absorbing and strain&#8208;regulating properties, demonstrates great potential for developing adaptable mechanical scaffolds for cartilage remodeling.

         <title>Xolography for Rapid Volumetric Production of Objects from the Nanoscopic to Macroscopic Length Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article explores the development of materials with multi&#8208;scale control at the nanoscale (&lt;100 nm), micrometer&#8208;scale (80 &#181;m), and macro&#8208;scale (multi&#8208;component geometries). This is achieved by applying polymerization&#8208;induced microphase separation (PIMS) process via volumetric 3D printing (Xolography), expanding the design space for functional nanomaterials in diverse applications.








Abstract
Light&#8208;mediated 3D printing has revolutionized additive manufacturing, progressing from pointwise stereolithography, to layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer digital light processing, and most recently to volumetric 3D printing. Xolography, a novel light&#8208;sheet&#8208;based volumetric 3D printing approach, offers high&#8208;speed and high&#8208;precision fabrication of complex geometries unattainable with traditional methods. However, achieving nanoscale control (&lt;100&#160;nm) within these 3D printing systems remains unexplored. This work leverages polymerization&#8208;induced microphase separation (PIMS) within the xolography process to prepare network polymer materials with simultaneous control over feature sizes at the nano&#8208;, micro&#8208;, and macro&#8208;scale. By controlling the chain length and mass fraction of macromolecular chain transfer agents used in the PIMS process, precise manipulation of nanodomain size within 3D printed materials is demonstrated, while optimization of the other resin components enables the fabrication of rigid materials with feature sizes of 80&#160;&#181;m. Critically, the rapid one&#8208;step fabrication of complex and multi&#8208;component structures such as a functional waterwheel with interlocking parts, at high volume&#8208;building rates is showcased. This combined approach expands the design space for functional nanomaterials, opening new avenues for applications in diverse fields such as polymer electrolyte membranes, biomedical delivery systems, and semi&#8208;permeable microcapsules.

Three new low&#8208;cost PTQ derivative donors PTQ17, PTQ18, and PTQ19 are rationally designed and synthesized by synergistic ternary copolymerization and side chain optimization strategies, to fine&#8208;tune the molecular self&#8208;assembly morphology. Due to ideal microscopic morphology of active layer and optimized energy level alignment, PTQ18&#8208;based binary and ternary organic solar cells achieve excellent efficiencies of 19.68% and 20.06%.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly morphology optimization of organic photovoltaic materials is crucial to improve the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, three low&#8208;cost PTQ derivative donors, PTQ17, PTQ18, and PTQ19 are developed by synergistic ternary copolymerization and side chain optimization of utilizing different benzothiadiazole (BT) units, to fine&#8208;tune molecular self&#8208;assembly morphology. PTQ17, containing difluorinated BT, shows the tightest &#960;&#8208;&#960; packing and strongest molecular crystallinity, leading to excessive molecular aggregation and phase separation morphology in active layer. In contrast, PTQ19, containing dialkoxy&#8208;substituted BT, has the weakest molecular crystallinity, resulting in the worst long&#8208;range ordered molecular packing and the smallest phase domains in active layer. Remarkably, PTQ18, containing monofluorinated and monoalkoxy&#8208;substituted BT, has moderate molecular crystallinity and the best compatibility with acceptor, resulting in the most ideal microscopic morphology of active layer with desirable domain size and phase separation features. In result, the PTQ18&#8208;based binary OSC achieves an outstanding efficiency of 19.68%; and further optimized energy level alignment leads to an enhanced PCE of 20.06% in the PTQ18&#8208;based ternary device. This work demonstrates the importance of self&#8208;assembly morphology modification of organic photovoltaic molecules in improving performance of OSCs, and it has guiding role in design of high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaic materials.

         <title>Hierarchical MoS2/Poly(ionic liquid) Metamaterials for Electrically Tunable Terahertz Stealth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ToC figure illustrates a terahertz stealth metamaterial with hierarchical ionotronic architecture, where large&#8208;area MoS2 assemblies conformally integrated with poly(ionic liquid) microarrays. It highlights wave&#8208;electron&#8208;ion interactions, enabling high electrical tunability and dynamic absorption modulation within terahertz atmospheric windows. This advanced material holds significant potential for enhancing the survivability and active countermeasure capabilities of military equipment against terahertz radar detections.








Abstract
Active absorption modulation is critical for advanced stealth technologies, especially given the emerging detection threat from terahertz atmospheric windows. However, due to the difficulty in balancing high absorption and tunability, the actual manufacturing of most terahertz absorbers usually neglects the integration of electrical tuning, which limits their development of dynamic wave trapping for electronic countermeasure systems. Here, a terahertz stealth metamaterial (TSM) with hierarchical ionotronic architecture is proposed to overcome the tradeoff. Large&#8208;area continuous MoS2 assemblies tightly attached poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) microarrays provide enough conditions for surface electron conduction and plasmon mode excitation. By establishing wave&#8208;electron&#8208;ion interaction pathways, the directional migration of free anions inside the PIL and the accumulation of excess charge carriers up to 100.4% at the MoS2 interfaces are promoted, thereby stimulating changes in the plasma frequency of the absorption system. Consequently, this micro&#8208;nano structural design enhances the absorption tunability and combines multiple dissipative behaviors. TSM exhibit high specific attenuation (&#8722;275&#160;dB&#160;mm&#8722;1), frequency agility (21.4%), and phase switching (153.1&#160;deg.) within terahertz atmospheric windows. Moreover, the template&#8208;assisted assembly strategy adopted has the potential to be used for the building of universal blocks operating within other frequency ranges.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Framework Electrolyte Featured Zinc&#8208;Ion Transport for Solvent and Interphasial Co&#8208;Passivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report designs an ion&#8208;framework electrolyte to passivate solvent and interphase. Such electrolyte systems simultaneously yield a wide electrochemical stability window and robust SEI, which fill a gap in current Zn2+ electrolytes.








Abstract
The rapid application of zinc&#8208;ion (Zn2+) energy storage lacks favorable solvation structures to simultaneously form inert electrolyte environments and robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which means that Zn2+ devices cannot synchronously against the side reactions, Zn dendrites and narrow electrochemical stability windows, further hindering their wide operative voltage window and ultra&#8208;long service life. Here, ion&#8208;framework electrolytes are designed by using large&#8208;sized inert&#8208;ammonium salts as the main solute. The ion framework, assembled from ultra&#8208;large solvation ion clusters containing large tetraethylammonium cations, large anions, and abundant solvents via electrostatic interactions, not only forms suitable channels for Zn2+ transport but also constrains free solvents to passivate their electrochemical activity, achieving an ultra&#8208;wide electrochemical stability window about 3.72&#160;V. More importantly, the enrichment of the ion framework at Zn interface generates a homogenous SEI with the dense polymer&#8208;inorganic hybrid structure to passivate the interphasial chemistry, which eliminates the Zn dendrites and side reactions. Therefore, Zn anode using this electrolyte achieves the ultra&#8208;long cycling stability of 8,150&#160;h, and Zn metal||activated carbon capacitors exhibit a high operative voltage (0&#8211;2.1&#160;V) and ultra&#8208;long cycle life (&#8776;170,000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1). This electrolyte design principle is promising for addressing the typical challenges in other metal&#8208;ion systems.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Activation for Efficient Acidic CO2 Electroreduction at Industrial&#8208;Level Current Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a dual sites activation strategy to enhance the nucleophilic of Sn sites and modulate the Cu sites as harder Lewis acid sites by constructing CuS/SnS2 Mott&#8211;Schottky catalysts. The optimized charge distribution facilitates the adsorption of CO2 and *OCHO intermediates simultaneously, thus improving formic acid selectivity in acid electrolytes under industrial current densities.








Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 to formic acid in acidic media offers a promising approach for value&#8208;added CO2 utilization. However, achieving high selectivity for formic acid in acidic electrolytes remains challenging due to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), particularly at industrially relevant current densities. Herein, a charge redistribution modulation strategy is demonstrated by constructing the CuS /SnS2 Mott&#8211;Schottky catalyst to enhance formic acid selectivity. Experiments and calculation results reveal the broadening of Sn orbitals and reduced orbital symmetry of Sn orbitals contribute to enhanced CO2 adsorption, while the modulated Cu sites with a stronger Lewis acid character stabilize *OCHO intermediates more effectively. This enables dual&#8208;site activation for efficient CO2 electroreduction into formic acid synthesis. Consequently, the optimized CuS/SnS2 catalysts achieve a maximum formic acid Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 99% in acidic electrolytes and maintain selectivity above 80% at a current density of 1 A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, significantly surpassing the performance of CuS and SnS2 alone. Moreover, the excellent selectivity across pH&#8208;universal electrolytes demonstrates that dual&#8208;site activation is a promising strategy for designing highly efficient CO2 reduction reaction catalysts.

         <title>Modular Molecular Editing of End&#8208;of&#8208;Life PBT for High&#8208;Performance Sustainable and 3D&#8208;Printable Platforms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by DNA editing, a modular molecular editing strategy is proposed to upcycle end&#8208;of&#8208;life poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) into a high&#8208;performance, sustainable, and 3D&#8208;printable platform. Surpassing commercial counterparts in mechanical properties without additives, it enables programmable performance for applications like 3D materials, films, and fibers. This work provides an industrializable and sustainable solution for PBT upcycling, delivering environmental and economic benefits.









Abstract
Engineering polyesters, particularly poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT), are widely used but generate significant waste, with limited recycling options.

     alt="Modular Molecular Editing of End-of-Life PBT for High-Performance Sustainable and 3D-Printable Platforms"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by DNA editing, a modular molecular editing strategy is proposed to upcycle end-of-life poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) into a high-performance, sustainable, and 3D-printable platform. Surpassing commercial counterparts in mechanical properties without additives, it enables programmable performance for applications like 3D materials, films, and fibers. This work provides an industrializable and sustainable solution for PBT upcycling, delivering environmental and economic benefits.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering polyesters, particularly poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT), are widely used but generate significant waste, with limited recycling options. Existing mechanical and chemical recycling strategies struggle to sustainably and efficiently reuse PBT, resulting in product performance degradation and making the recycling process more costly than the upstream synthesis routes for raw materials. Inspired by DNA editing technologies in molecular biology, a modular molecular editing strategy is proposed to sequentially modify the backbone and end groups of end-of-life PBT, transforming it into a high-performance, sustainable, and 3D-printable poly(butylene adipate-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-terephthalate) (PBAT) platform. Unlike traditional commercial PBATs that produce only single components, this platform surpasses them in tensile strength and toughness without requiring additional additives and features programmable properties for diverse applications, including injection-molded parts, 3D-printed components, films, packaging, fibers, and fabrics. The industrial scalability of this strategy is validated through successful 100-L pilot-scale production. The resulting PBAT allows closed-loop polymer-to-polymer recycling by reintroducing PBT or monomers, thereby enhancing its social sustainability. When recovery is no longer feasible, the materials remain ecologically sustainable through composting, avoiding harmful environmental accumulation. This work achieves a direct polymer-to-polymer conversion of end-of-life PBT into high-performance materials, with techno-economic analysis highlighting both environmental and economic advantages.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Semiconducting Pt Structures Stabilized on 2D MoS2 Crystals Enable Ultrafast Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction of small Pt particles with 2D MoS2 crystals can stabilize bilayer Pt structures, with a semiconducting electronic structure. The semiconducting electronic structure of Pt bilayers constitutes the so far unexplored transition domain between the bulk&#8208;like, metallic band structure of compact nanoparticles and the discrete atomic orbitals of single atoms, while, remarkably, displaying the highest intrinsic activity among them.








Abstract
Metallic platinum is the best and most widely investigated catalyst for hydrogen evolution, yet little is known about Pt in its semiconducting form. Here, it is shown that semiconducting Pt structures with a thickness of only two atomic layers (0.4&#160;nm) can be stabilized on 2D MoS2 crystals. Reducing the thickness of Pt particles below the Fermi wavelength (0.5&#160;nm) opens a sizeable (0.3&#8211;0.4&#160;eV) gap in their electronic structure. The resulting electronic structure is qualitatively different from both the metallic bands of larger Pt nanoparticles and the atomic orbitals of Pt single atom catalysts while displaying the highest intrinsic activity among them. Semiconducting Pt bilayers enable H2 production at ten times higher rates (&#8776;1400 H2 s&#8722;1 @ &#951; = 100&#160;mV) than Pt single atom catalysts, and match the activity of commercial Pt nanoparticles (Pt /C catalysts) at three orders of magnitude lower Pt loadings.

         <title>Tin&#8208;Lead&#8208;Selenide Nanocrystals for Sensitive Uncooled Mid&#8208;Infrared Focal Plane Array Imager with Monolithic Readout Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin&#8208;doped lead selenide nanocrystals are synthesized to reduce thermal noise by adjusting Sn doping content. The uncooled mid&#8208;infrared focal plane array imager (64 &#215; 64 pixels) fabricated by monolithic integration above nanocrystals exhibits an excellent detectivity (7.46 &#215; 109 Jones) and a thermal sensitivity (133 mK) at room temperature. It successfully realizes the uncooled mid&#8208;infrared thermal imaging with a lens.








Abstract
The mid&#8208;infrared focal plane array (FPA) imager has developed over recent decades to become multifunctional, powerful, reliable, miniaturized, and cost&#8208;effective. However, the complexity of the refrigerated packaging process (such as dewar flask) and traditional fabrication technology (such as flip&#8208;chip) continues to contribute significantly to the high cost of industrial production. Here, a simple, low&#8208;cost, and effective type of uncooled mid&#8208;infrared FPA imager is reported through the monolithic integration of mid&#8208;infrared Pb1&#8208;xSnxSe nanocrystals (NCs) PIN heterojunction (PbS/Pb1&#8208;xSnxSe/ZnO) photodetectors and glass&#8208;based readout integrated circuits (ROICs). Sn&#8208;doping in PbSe NCs not only weakens the internal photocarrier&#8208;phonon coupling to reduce thermal noise but also optimizes the energy band structure of the heterojunction to enhance mid&#8208;infrared performance. Finally, the PbS/Pb0.86Sn0.14Se/ZnO heterojunction photodetector demonstrates a dark current (2.7 x 10&#8722;7 A mm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.5&#160;V), a detectivity of 7.46 &#215; 109 Jones at a peak wavelength of 4.25&#160;&#181;m, air stability (retaining 96.7% performance at 300 K for 360 days) and the corresponding uncooled mid&#8208;infrared FPA (64 &#215; 64 pixels) achieves excellent thermal sensitivity of 133 mK. These results underscore the substantial potential applications of mid&#8208;infrared FPA based on the heterojunction, including spectral imaging, gas leak detection, and chemical reagent identification.

         <title>Unidirectional Electrobending Deformation in Acceptor&#8208;Doped Piezoceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel unidirectional electrobending behavior with a symmetric butterfly&#8208;shaped bipolar S&#8208;E curve in acceptor&#8208;doped K0.5Na0.5NbO3 ceramics, where the bending direction is governed by the pre&#8208;poling direction rather than the applied electric field. We attribute that this unprecedented unidirectional behavior arises from the synergistic interaction between domains and defect dipoles in the surface layers.








Abstract
Since 2022, large apparent strains (&gt;1%) with highly asymmetrical strain&#8208;electric field (S&#8208;E) curves have been reported in various thin piezoceramic materials, attributed to a bidirectional electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced bending (electrobending) deformation, which consistently produces convex bending along the negative electric field direction. In this study, a novel unidirectional electrobending behavior in acceptor&#8208;doped K0.5Na0.5NbO3 ceramics are reported, where convex bending always occurs along the pre&#8208;poling direction regardless of the direction of the applied electric field. This unique deformation is related to the reorientation of the (MNb&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8722;VO&#183;&#183;$M_{{\mathrm{Nb}}}^{^{\prime\prime\prime}} - V_{\mathrm{O}}^{ \cdot \cdot }$) defect dipoles (where M2+ represents the acceptor&#8208;doped ion in the Nb&#8208; site) in one surface layer during the pre&#8208;poling process, resulting in an asymmetrical distribution of defect dipoles in the two surface layers. The synergistic interaction between ferroelectric domains and defect dipoles in the surface layers induces this unidirectional electrobending, as evidenced by a butterfly&#8208;like symmetrical bipolar S&#8208;E curve with a giant apparent strain of 3.2%. These findings provide new insights into defect engineering strategies for developing advanced piezoelectric materials with large electroinduced displacements.

         <dc:description>
Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging is used to study the structural behavior of a BWO nanoparticle as it is exposed to Argon and H2 + N2 gas environments. In the presence of the H2 + N2 gas, a semiconducting to metallic phase transition is observed to nucleate from dislocations running from the bulk to the surface.








Abstract
Nanostructuring photocatalytic and catalytic materials substantially increases the surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, thereby exposing a greater number of active sites essential for enhanced catalytic efficiency. However, optimizing these efficiencies requires the non&#8208;destructive, operando interrogation of individual nanocrystals under realistic catalytic conditions&#8212;a capability that has long remained elusive. Here, this challenge is addressed by reporting three&#8208;dimensional imaging of defects, crystal morphology, and strain dynamics in individual Bi2WO6 (BWO) nanoflakes using Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (BCDI) under operando temperature, gas, and light&#8208;driven conditions. It is demonstrated that maintaining a constant temperature of 40&#176;C thermally activates charge carriers, likely enhancing their mobility and reducing recombination rates. Furthermore, an Argon (Ar) gas flow stabilizes the reaction environment, while a mixed Hydrogen&#8211;Nitrogen (H2 + N2) flow induces a hydrogen&#8208;triggered semiconducting&#8208;to&#8208;metallic (SM) electronic phase transition accompanied by a structural transformation, as supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Both DFT and BCDI analyses reveal that during the SM phase transition, a new structural phase nucleates near defects and propagates inhomogeneously. Notably, the onset of nanoscale cracking is observed, driven by localized strain accumulation and environmental cycling, which increases surface area and potentially introduces new reactive sites. These findings illustrate that combining advanced nanostructuring with operando imaging techniques can provide critical insights into the local structural features that govern photocatalytic performance, paving the way for the rational design of next&#8208;generation photocatalytic&#160;materials.

&lt;p&gt;Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging is used to study the structural behavior of a BWO nanoparticle as it is exposed to Argon and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas environments. In the presence of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas, a semiconducting to metallic phase transition is observed to nucleate from dislocations running from the bulk to the surface.

         <title>Sword and Board in One: A Bioinspired Nanocomposite Membrane for Guided Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combinatorial design of bioinspired multiscale structure and intrinsic composition realizes a collection of functions as &#8220;sword (active offense) and board (passive defense)&#8221; in GBR treatment. This work not only sparks new vitality to bioinspired GBR treatment in the next generation toward reconciling critical conflict presented in tissue engineering but also offers a promising outlook for future clinical translation.








Abstract
Guided bone regeneration (GBR) faces far from a one&#8208;dimensional challenge. It demands a multifunctional membrane to possess paradoxical but essential properties in sophisticated clinical scenarios. Drawing inspiration from natural biological structures and superior properties, through a combination of structure innovation and composition regulation, a multicomponent nacre&#8208;inspired discontinuous Bouligand structure is devised and transcribed into a bioinspired Janus nanocomposite membrane with comprehensive properties for GBR, identical to &#8220;sword and board.&#8221; As a sword, our membrane can actively adapt to sharp bony ridges owing to high toughness, capture water molecules for fluid penetration, drive osteogenic expression, and kill bacteria. As a board, it can achieve superior mechanical strength to withstand external forces, passively maintain structural integrity for ingrowth barrier, while function as a passive substrate for cell adhesion and proliferation. Overall, the membrane with excellent mechanical properties and bio&#8208;functions is the paradigm of the combinatorial design of component and structure. It achieves the contradictory yet prerequisite features in response to the current challenge and offers new hope to advance biomedical applications. Equally important, the fabrication of our multifunctional bioinspired membrane is mild, efficient, scalable, and thus is poised to inspire the design of a broader range of functional material systems.

         <title>Biased Plasma Treated Nickel Oxide for High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ biased plasma treatment (BPT) reconstructs the surface of sputtered Nickel oxide (NiOx), enabling controlled Ni3&#8314;/Ni2&#8314; ratios and optimized surface roughness, thereby enhancing interfacial properties. This strategy enhances perovskite crystallinity and optimizes band alignment, resulting in power conversion efficiencies of 21.8% in single&#8208;junction and 32.1% (certified 31.7%) in tandem solar cells, with outstanding operational stability.








Abstract
Nickel oxide (NiOx) hole transport layer deposited by magnetron sputtering shows high stability, low cost, high reproducibility, and scalability for perovskite and tandem solar cells. However, the performance of perovskite and tandem solar cells with sputtered NiOx is limited by the defective interface and suboptimal energy band alignment. This work focuses on reconstructing the sputtered NiOx surface with in situ biased plasma treatment (BPT). It is demonstrated that in situ BPT following sputtering induces both physical and chemical changes on the NiOx surface, enabling a smoother and denser surface with controllable Ni3+/Ni2+ ratios. The in situ BPT NiOx is proven to be effective in improving the conductivity of NiOx, suppressing the non&#8208;radiation recombination, fine&#8208;tuning the energy band alignment, and facilitating the crystallinity of the perovskite. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of wide bandgap perovskite solar cells is improved to 21.8% by the implementation of BPT NiOx. Further integrating the BPT NiOx into monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells results in a high PCE of 32.1% (certified 31.7%) with excellent operational stability.

         <dc:description>
A multifunctional nanomedicine co&#8208;loading of the &#945;&#8208;emitter 223RaCl2 within iron&#8208;based MOFs is developed. Precisely targeted to mitochondria, it exploits the full decay spectrum to synchronize three therapeutic actions: direct &#945;&#8208;particle ionization, self&#8208;powered catalytic H2O2 generation via secondary electrons, and immunogenic cell death induction. This integrated approach overcomes the limitations of conventional radiotherapy by facilitating effective local tumor ablation and systemic anti&#8208;tumor immunity without external energy input.








Abstract
Internal Radionuclide Therapy (IRT) faces significant challenges, particularly the limited controlled penetration depth of conventional &#946; rays and the inefficient targeted delivery of &#945;&#8208;emitters. In this study, a mitochondria&#8208;targeted, self&#8208;powered &#945; radionuclide nanomedicine, and pioneer a groundbreaking &#8220;suborganelle precise radiodynamic immunotherapy&#8221; paradigm that synergistically integrates physical irradiation, catalytic chemistry, and immunomodulation to overcome the historical limitations of IRT is developed. The innovation establishes a &#8220;radionuclide energy internal cycling&#8221; strategy through 223RaCl2 (the first FDA&#8208;approved &#945;&#8208;emitter), unlocking three synergistic therapies from one radionuclide: precise ionizing radiation, self&#8208;powered catalysis, and immunogenic reprogramming. This paradigm uniquely exploits the full decay spectrum (&#945; particles, &#946; electrons, &#947; photons) to synchronize physical, chemical, and biological anti&#8208;tumor mechanisms without requiring external energy inputs, offering a transformative solution to overcome the physical&#8208;biological barriers of IRT and bridge localized eradication with systemic immune regulation.

         <title>Coaxial Electroluminochromic Fibers with Dynamic RGB Switching for Pixelated Smart Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coaxial electroluminochromic fiber with integrated electroluminescent cores and electrochromic shells is constructed on carbon nanotube fibers, enabling dynamic RGB switching and pixelated control. The design features low&#8208;voltage operation, fast and reversible color modulation, and high durability, offering a significant advance for multicolor smart textiles in wearable electronics and textile&#8208;based display technologies.








Abstract
The immense potential of electronic textiles for wearable applications has spurred extensive research into luminescent fibers suitable for smart textile displays. However, current electroluminescent (EL) fibers, while flexible and wearable, typically emit only a fixed color and have a 1D structure, which confines fiber&#8208;based displays to pre&#8208;designed patterns. Here, a coaxial hierarchical fiber structure is fabricated with an insulating polymer layer sandwiched between an EL core and an electrochromic (EC) shell based on carbon nanotube fibers. Acting as a dynamic optical filter with RGB tri&#8208;state switching capabilities, the EC shell can effectively modulate the optical properties of inner emitted lights via a low voltage, enabling a new &#8220;electroluminochromic&#8221; fiber with multicolor luminescence and rapid on&#8208;demand color switching. Moreover, electroluminochromic bare fibers can be woven with orthogonal electrodes at discrete gel polymer electrolyte junctions, forming individually addressable luminescent pixels. Using a warp&#8208;weft knitting approach and integration with the Internet of Things, this display textile can transmit information, exhibiting great potential for applications in smart displays and wearable electronic devices.

     alt="Coaxial Electroluminochromic Fibers with Dynamic RGB Switching for Pixelated Smart Textiles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A coaxial electroluminochromic fiber with integrated electroluminescent cores and electrochromic shells is constructed on carbon nanotube fibers, enabling dynamic RGB switching and pixelated control. The design features low-voltage operation, fast and reversible color modulation, and high durability, offering a significant advance for multicolor smart textiles in wearable electronics and textile-based display technologies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immense potential of electronic textiles for wearable applications has spurred extensive research into luminescent fibers suitable for smart textile displays. However, current electroluminescent (EL) fibers, while flexible and wearable, typically emit only a fixed color and have a 1D structure, which confines fiber-based displays to pre-designed patterns. Here, a coaxial hierarchical fiber structure is fabricated with an insulating polymer layer sandwiched between an EL core and an electrochromic (EC) shell based on carbon nanotube fibers. Acting as a dynamic optical filter with RGB tri-state switching capabilities, the EC shell can effectively modulate the optical properties of inner emitted lights via a low voltage, enabling a new &#8220;electroluminochromic&#8221; fiber with multicolor luminescence and rapid on-demand color switching. Moreover, electroluminochromic bare fibers can be woven with orthogonal electrodes at discrete gel polymer electrolyte junctions, forming individually addressable luminescent pixels. Using a warp-weft knitting approach and integration with the Internet of Things, this display textile can transmit information, exhibiting great potential for applications in smart displays and wearable electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Symmetry Basis Engineered Covalent Organic Frameworks for Water Purification Under Ultralow Light Intensity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a symmetry basis strategy to engineer pyridine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks for solar water purification. The symmetric Bby&#8208;COF exhibits a higher ofloxacin degradation than asymmetric analogs via enhanced charge density and electron sink effect. Remarkably, it achieves complete ofloxacin removal under ultra&#8208;low light using long&#8208;termed flow&#8208;through reactor, bridging lab innovation to real&#8208;world application.








Abstract
Achieving efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion of low&#8208;intensity and natural sunlight is a promising but challenged for sustainable water purification. Herein, an electron&#8208;deficient pyridine units into functional basis with symmetric and asymmetric is newly pre&#8208;designed to form covalent organic frameworks (COFs). It is found that the bidirectional push&#8208;pull effect of the bipyridine units in the symmetric Bby&#8208;COF induces an increase in charge density and enhances the electron sink effect. This transformation optimizes the activation pathway of dissolved oxygen, establishing a pathway of micropollutants decomposition mediated by superoxide free radicals and photoexcited holes oxidation. Specifically, the first&#8208;order rate constant of ofloxacin (OFL) removal for Bby&#8208;COF for is 28.14&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2&#160;min&#8722;1, surpassing that of asymmetric Bpy&#8208;COF by 6.3&#8208;times (4.45&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 min&#8722;1). Remarkably, Bby&#8208;COF can achieve complete OFL removal within 30&#8211;40&#160;min under winter sunlight conditions, demonstrating unprecedented ultra&#8208;low&#8208;light&#8208;intensity (36&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) catalytic performance. In this mode, an array&#8208;type plate&#8208;and&#8208;frame flow&#8208;through reactor can be consecutively operated for treating a total volume of 58.8 L wastewater using outdoor sunlight, meeting the potentiality of large&#8208;scale applications. This study pioneers a symmetry&#8208;engineered molecular strategy for developing high&#8208;performance organocatalysts, bridging the critical gap between laboratory photocatalysis and real&#8208;world solar wastewater treatment applications.

         <title>Robust and Fast&#8208;Transforming Soft Microrobots Driven by Low Magnetic Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new composite ink is developed by in situ grafting polyacrylamide chains onto magnetizable single&#8208;domain ferromagnetic NdFeB nanostructures for soft microrobots combined with a magnetic field&#8208;assisted 3D printing process. Benefiting from precise control of domain orientation within a single filament, the printed soft microrobots present mechanically robust and fast&#8208;transforming behaviors powered by a low magnetic field.








Abstract
Magnetically driven soft microrobots, characterized by their small size, soft structure, and responsiveness to magnetic fields, offer unique advantages such as high maneuverability, biocompatibility, and remote control, making them suitable for a variety of applications across multiple fields. Achieving low&#8208;power actuation for microrobots is more accessible, safer, and cost&#8208;effective, dependent on the precise quality and arrangement of their magnetic domains. However, traditional approaches integrating multi&#8208;domain magnetic microstructures often introduce trade&#8208;offs between mechanical stability and responsiveness. Here, a magnetic domain assembly method is presented for the fabrication of robust soft microrobots with fast transforming behaviors powered by low magnetic fields (3&#8211;15 mT). By developing a composite ink containing polyacrylamide chains grafted onto magnetizable single&#8208;domain ferromagnetic NdFeB nanostructures, precise control over domain orientation within ultrafine filaments (80&#160;&#181;m) is achieved by magnetic field&#8208;assisted 3D printing process, allowing complex and rapid shape morphing in under 1 s, even with less than 2 wt.% NdFeB. This uniform magnetic alignment results in a tenfold increase in mechanical toughness and impressive stretchability (1600%). With top&#8208;performing actuation performance at low magnetic fields, the microrobots demonstrate multimodal locomotion and robust tasking capabilities, showcasing their transformative potential for next&#8208;generation soft robotics.

         <title>Neuromorphic Polarization Vision Enabled by Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Photosynaptic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired polarization&#8208;sensitive photosynaptic transistor using anisotropic organic micro&#8208;crystals is developed to replicate biological polarization vision. A record dichroic ratio of &gt;103 is achieved under ultraweak light of 600&#160;nW&#160;cm&#8722;2 while operating at the ultralow energy consumption of 0.22&#160;pJ per synaptic event. The artificial visual neuron replicates complex polarization vision behaviors of butterflies, including intraspecific communication and target recognition.








Abstract
Polarization vision, a highly sophisticated visual capability in insects such as butterflies and bees, plays a pivotal role in enabling survival&#8208;critical ecological behaviors, such as navigation, intraspecific communication, mating, and habitat selection. However, the replication of this capability in artificial systems has long been impeded by the limited dichroic ratio (DR, typically &lt; 10) of existing materials and the complexity of conventional optical designs. Here, the first time a bioinspired polarization&#8208;sensitive photosynaptic transistor is developed based on organic micro&#8208;crystal arrays for neuromorphic polarization vision. By leveraging the polarization&#8208;dependent photogating effect in intrinsically anisotropic organic crystals, the device achieves an unprecedented DR exceeding 103 within a minimal gate&#8208;bias window of 1 V, outperforming existing polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors by two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the device successfully mimics the synaptic plasticity of polarization&#8208;sensitive visual neurons, enabling tunable transitions between short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term plasticity through a charge&#8208;storage accumulative process. Significantly, it operates with an exceptionally low energy consumption of 0.22 pJ per synaptic event under ultraweak polarized light of 600&#160;nW&#160;cm&#8722;2, rivaling the efficiency of biological neural systems. Further it demonstrates the replication of complex polarization vision behaviors of butterflies, including intraspecific communication and target recognition, using this artificial visual neuron. Our work opens new avenues for neuromorphic polarization vision, with broad implications for intelligent neurorobotics and energy&#8208;efficient biomimetic electronics.

         <title>Triboelectric Nanogenerators Enable Multifunctional Ice Accretion, Melting, and Interfacial Fracture Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water impacting, freezing, melting, and being mechanically removed from the designed dielectric surfaces generates a triboeletric signal that can be used to detect various icing and de&#8208;icing scenarios. The charge transferred directly scales with the interfacial fracture mechanism, further validating triboelectricity as an excellent ice&#8208;detection platform, including in&#8208;flight on drones flying at subzero temperatures, as demonstrated.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have significant potential to perform as sensors or compact electric power generators through the production of electrical charge during the frictional interactions between two dissimilar materials, such as liquids impacting solids. However, whether phase transitions generate a triboelectric response is not known. This study investigates the occurrence of triboelectrification during the water&#8208;ice phase transition using TENGs for real&#8208;time ice detection on critical engineering surfaces such as aircraft, wind turbine blades, and vehicles. TENGs are fabricated using aluminum electrodes and either polyethylene, silicone, or polytetrafluoroethylene as the dielectric. The freezing of water and the melting of ice are found to generate triboelectric current only during motion of the contact line, and the presence of ice can lessen additional charge transfer during continuous ice accretion. Further, ice type (rime versus glaze) can be differentiated during accretion by the initial transferred charge and how quickly the signal plateaus. It is observed that mechanical de&#8208;icing generates triboelectric charges that are proportional to the de&#8208;icing force, and this allows for the identification and quantification interfacial fracture mechanisms such as stress&#8208;controlled, toughness&#8208;controlled, and cavitation&#8208;controlled de&#8208;bonding. A prototype ice sensor is validated on a flying drone exposed to simulated rain under icing conditions, where it is able to detect both icing and de&#8208;icing in flight. The TENGs exhibited a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio as high as 83 dB, highlighting triboelectricity as a novel, real&#8208;time, and energy&#8208;efficient solution for ice detection and protection systems.

&lt;p&gt;Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have significant potential to perform as sensors or compact electric power generators through the production of electrical charge during the frictional interactions between two dissimilar materials, such as liquids impacting solids. However, whether phase transitions generate a triboelectric response is not known. This study investigates the occurrence of triboelectrification during the water-ice phase transition using TENGs for real-time ice detection on critical engineering surfaces such as aircraft, wind turbine blades, and vehicles. TENGs are fabricated using aluminum electrodes and either polyethylene, silicone, or polytetrafluoroethylene as the dielectric. The freezing of water and the melting of ice are found to generate triboelectric current only during motion of the contact line, and the presence of ice can lessen additional charge transfer during continuous ice accretion. Further, ice type (rime versus glaze) can be differentiated during accretion by the initial transferred charge and how quickly the signal plateaus. It is observed that mechanical de-icing generates triboelectric charges that are proportional to the de-icing force, and this allows for the identification and quantification interfacial fracture mechanisms such as stress-controlled, toughness-controlled, and cavitation-controlled de-bonding. A prototype ice sensor is validated on a flying drone exposed to simulated rain under icing conditions, where it is able to detect both icing and de-icing in flight. The TENGs exhibited a signal-to-noise ratio as high as 83 dB, highlighting triboelectricity as a novel, real-time, and energy-efficient solution for ice detection and protection systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Porous Elastomer Film with Controlled Liquid&#8208;Metal Distribution for Recyclable Highly Customizable and Stretchable Patterned Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a customizable porous liquid&#8208;metal (LM)/elastomer composite film with controlled LM distribution, overcoming conventional limitations of LM&#8208;based composites (unintended activation of unsintered regions under strain). It can achieve&#160;precise patterning through imprinting, thereby enabling the creation of flexible conductive patterns, which can be used in multifunctional stretchable electronics.








Abstract
Stretchable conductors with conductive patterns are crucial for flexible electronics, which demand high conductivity and stable electrical properties under significant deformations. Liquid&#8208;metal (LM)&#8208;based composites patterned by selective sintering are promising for flexible electronics, however, short&#8208;circuiting may occur due to unintended activation of unsintered regions under strain. Hence, developing highly customizable LM&#8208;based stretchable conductors remains a persistent challenge. Stretchable LM/thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) porous films are designed with controlled LM distribution through non&#8208;solvent&#8208;induced phase separation and surface modification of LM particles, which overcomes the limitations of conventional LM&#8208;based stretchable composites and enables the design of diverse flexible electronics with conductive patterns via imprinting. The porous structure increases spacing between LM particles and alleviates stress on LM particles, ensuring electrical insulation of the unimprinted regions during stretching. The customizable patterning process enables the films to be used for electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, and stripe patterns allow for dynamic tuning of EMI shielding performance. Additionally, they demonstrate excellent performance in wireless communications, tunable EM wave filters, and stretchable Joule heaters. Moreover, the solubility of TPU makes it easy to recycle LM from the film, thus demonstrating ideal recyclability. Outstanding electrical stability and versatile applications guarantee its significant impact on stretchable electronics.

         <title>Minimizing Solvent&#8208;Coordination in Ether Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries under Extreme Operating Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes using modified electrolyte exhibit excellent electrochemical performance under extreme operating conditions, and the stable operation of a high&#8208;capacity Li metal pouch cell of 30 Ah and a high&#8208;energy density Li metal pouch cell of 502.7&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, respectively. The accelerated rate calorimetry results suggest that the modified electrolyte can significantly enhance the safety of lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Ether&#8208;based electrolytes are considered to be one of the most promising systems for high&#8208;performing lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, the poor oxidation stability (&lt;4.5&#160;V) of ether solvents seriously limit their practical applications. Herein, high&#8208;voltage LMBs with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode operated under extreme conditions by minimizing solvent&#8208;coordination in ether electrolytes with fluoroethers, nitrile ethers, and highly fluorinated additives, are demonstrated. It is revealed that ethylene glycol bis(propionitrile) ether (DENE) inhibits the lone&#8208;pair electrons loss on ether oxygen through strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano groups to increase the electrochemical window to &#8805;5&#160;V. Heptafluorobutyric anhydride (HFAA) triggers the formation of solid electrolyte interphase rich&#8208;in LiF&#8208;species, ensuring uniform deposition/stripping and high reversibility of Li+. Especially, DENE and HFAA synergistically minimizes the coordination number of ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DME) and hexafluorophosphate (PF6&#8208;), thereby promoting the desolvation process of Li+ and inhibiting the interfacial side reactions. Therefore, the NCM811 cathodes using modified electrolytes exhibit excellent electrochemical performance at ultrahigh voltage (4.7&#160;V), ultrahigh rate (20 C), and ultrawide temperature range (&#8722;30 to 120&#160;&#176;C), and achieve stable operation in a high&#8208;capacity Li metal pouch cell of 30 Ah and a high&#8208;energy density Li metal pouch cell of 502.7&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, respectively.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Robust Skyrmion Lattice at Room Temperature in van der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates formation of robust ordered skyrmion lattices in pre&#8208;annealed 2D Fe3GaTe2 at room temperature via minimal strain. Magnetic force microscopy reveals that the stabilized skyrmion phase endures thousands of cycles of mechanical fatigue (stretching/bending/twisting), maintains stability across broad magnetic field and temperature ranges, and exhibits field&#8208;free stability. These results hold promise for flexible, low&#8208;power spintronic applications. 








Abstract
Manipulating topological magnetic orders of 2D magnets by strain, once achieved, offers enormous potential for future low&#8208;power flexible spintronic applications. In this work, by placing Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT), a room&#8208;temperature 2D ferromagnet, on flexible substrate, a field&#8208;free and robust formation of skyrmion lattice induced by strain is demonstrated. By applying a minimal strain of &#8776;0.80% to pre&#8208;annealed FGaT flakes, the Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) tip directly triggers the transition from maze&#8208;like domains to an ordered skyrmion lattice while scanning the sample surface. The skyrmion lattice is rather stable against extensive cyclic mechanical testing (stretching, bending, and twisting over 2000 cycles each). It also exhibits stability across a wide range of magnetic fields (&#8776;2.9 kOe) and temperatures (&#8776;323 K), as well as long&#8208;term retention stability, highlighting its robustness and field&#8208;free stabilization. The strain effect reduces the lattice symmetry and enhances the Dzyaloshinskii&#8208;Moriya interaction (DMI) of FGaT, thus stabilizing the skyrmion lattice. The findings highlight the potential of FGaT for integrating magnetic skyrmions into future low&#8208;power&#8208;consumption flexible spintronics devices.

         <title>Low&#8208;Field&#8208;Driven Domain Wall Motion in Wurtzite Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
During polarization switching in AlScN, domain&#8208;wall transverse motion invariably precedes longitudinal motion due to a 98% reduction in energy barriers. By controlling nucleation polarity to promote transverse motion, this work enables low&#8208;field&#8208;driven domain wall motion, reducing&#160;Ec by 25% while maintaining high&#160;Pr and suppressing wake&#8208;up behavior across 6&#8208;inch wafers to advance energy&#8208;efficient wurtzite ferroelectric devices for CMOS integration.








Abstract
Wurtzite&#8208;type nitride ferroelectrics emerge as a breakthrough platform for silicon&#8208;compatible nonvolatile memory technology. However, the inherent polarization reversal mechanisms involving diatomic displacements introduce complex domain dynamics and elevate energy barriers, manifesting as excessive coercive fields (Ec) and pronounced wake&#8208;up effects that hinder reliable device operation. Here, these challenges are resolved by enabling the low&#8208;field&#8208;driven domain wall motion in representative wurtzite ferroelectrics (Al0.75Sc0.25N). In situ transmission electron microscopy measurements reveal that polarization switching proceeds via preferential domain&#8208;wall transverse propagation perpendicular to the [0001] axis, preceding longitudinal propagation along the [0001] axis. First&#8208;principles simulations quantify a striking 98% reduction in energy barrier for transverse migration (0.00188&#160;eV&#160;f.u&#8722;1). Compared to longitudinal motion (0.092&#160;eV&#160;f.u&#8722;1). This switching kinetic fundamentally challenges the conventional Kolmogorov&#8208;Avrami&#8208;Ishibashi model. By controlling nucleation polarity to promote the transverse motion of the domain wall, Ec is reduced by 25%, with a high remanent polarization maintained and wake&#8208;up effects eliminated across 6&#8208;inch films. The methodology establishes a universal design principle for manipulating polarization switching in wurtzite ferroelectrics, paving the way for integrated low&#8208;energy, high&#8208;stability, uniformly&#8208;performing ferroelectric devices in large&#8208;scale complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)&#160;architectures.

However, the inherent polarization reversal mechanisms involving diatomic displacements introduce complex domain dynamics and elevate energy barriers, manifesting as excessive coercive fields (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) and pronounced wake-up effects that hinder reliable device operation. Here, these challenges are resolved by enabling the low-field-driven domain wall motion in representative wurtzite ferroelectrics (Al&lt;sub&gt;0.75&lt;/sub&gt;Sc&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;N). In situ transmission electron microscopy measurements reveal that polarization switching proceeds via preferential domain-wall transverse propagation perpendicular to the [0001] axis, preceding longitudinal propagation along the [0001] axis. First-principles simulations quantify a striking 98% reduction in energy barrier for transverse migration (0.00188&#160;eV&#160;f.u&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Compared to longitudinal motion (0.092&#160;eV&#160;f.u&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This switching kinetic fundamentally challenges the conventional Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibashi model. By controlling nucleation polarity to promote the transverse motion of the domain wall, &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is reduced by 25%, with a high remanent polarization maintained and wake-up effects eliminated across 6-inch films. The methodology establishes a universal design principle for manipulating polarization switching in wurtzite ferroelectrics, paving the way for integrated low-energy, high-stability, uniformly-performing ferroelectric devices in large-scale complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)&#160;architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deciphering the Species&#8208;Dependent Polysulfide Corrosion on Lithium Anode Toward Durable Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The corrosion of Li metal anode by different lithium polysulfide species is systematically revealed. Higher corrosion rate, more uniform Li deposition, and more durable Li anode cycling are achieved in low&#8208;order lithium polysulfides. A lithium polysulfide selection strategy is proposed to selectively inhibit the corrosion of high&#8208;order lithium polysulfides and prolong the cumulative capacity of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density of 2600&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. However, soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) violently corrode Li metal anodes, inducing rapid capacity decay and poor cycling lifespan of Li&#8211;S batteries. Herein, the corrosion of different LiPS species on the Li metal anode is systematically investigated. The corrosion rate of Li metal anode by Li2S8 and Li2S6 is higher than Li2S4. The discrepancy in corrosion rate is attributed to the continuous reaction between the LiPSs and Li metal, while the corrosion can hardly be prohibited by the LiPS&#8208;generated solid electrolyte interphase. Smaller Li nuclei size, more uniform Li deposition, and more durable cycling of Li metal anodes are found in Li2S4 electrolyte in comparison with Li2S8 and Li2S6 electrolytes. Consequently, a LiPS selection strategy is proposed to selectively inhibit the corrosion of high&#8208;order LiPSs and successfully prolong the cumulative capacity by 31% in Li&#8211;S batteries. This work clarifies the fundamentals of Li metal anode corrosion by different LiPS species and highlights the rational selection of favorable LiPS species for promoting the cycling durability of Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Tribovoltaic Effect at Liquid&#8211;MoS2 Interfaces and Spectral Analysis of Interfacial Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, the spectral features of molybdenum disulfide are used as a probing tool, providing experimental evidence for charge transfer at the liquid&#8211;solid interface, thereby validating the working mechanism of the tribovoltaic effect.








Abstract
Liquid&#8211;solid triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) offer a viable approach for harvesting water energy to power Internet of Things systems. Semiconductor&#8208;based TENGs leveraging the tribovoltaic effect have recently emerged as a focus of research. In this paper, monolayer molybdenum disulfide (ML&#8208;MoS2) is introduced as a contacting material for fabricating direct current (DC) liquid&#8211;solid nanogenerators. At the internal liquid&#8211;solid interface, electron transfer is strongly evidenced by Raman and photoluminescence spectra. For the external characteristics, macroscopic DC outputs are assessed under various conditions, with a maximum current density of 11.1 mA m&#8722;2. Correlating external output patterns with interfacial charge dynamics, a complete working mechanism of the liquid&#8211;solid tribovoltaic effect is better elucidated. This work advances innovative strategies for water energy harvesting, deepening fundamental insights into liquid&#8211;solid interactions and the tribovoltaic effect.

         <title>Self&#8208;Evolving Discovery of Carrier Biomaterials with Ultra&#8208;Low Nonspecific Protein Adsorption for Single Cell Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;evolving discovery integrating automation and AI is developed to address the high&#8208;dimensional&#8208;parameter&#8208;space challenge in carrier biomaterials. The discovered biomaterials showed ultra&#8208;low nonspecific protein adsorption, achieving a 10&#160;000&#8208;fold reduction in experiment workload; and they are further fabricated into microfluidic&#8208;used carriers for protein&#8208;analysis applications, showing a 9&#8208;fold enhancement in detection sensitivity. This study has potential for applications in single&#8208;cell analysis.








Abstract
Carrier biomaterials used in single&#8208;cell analysis face a bottleneck in protein detection sensitivity, primarily attributed to elevated false positives caused by nonspecific protein adsorption. Toward carrier biomaterials with ultra&#8208;low nonspecific protein adsorption, a self&#8208;evolving discovery is developed to address the challenge of high&#8208;dimensional parameter spaces. Automation across nine self&#8208;developed or modified workstations is integrated to achieve a &#8220;can&#8208;do&#8221; capability, and develop a synergy&#8208;enhanced Bayesian optimization algorithm as the artificial intelligence brain to enable a &#8220;can&#8208;think&#8221; capability for small&#8208;data problems inherent to time&#8208;consuming biological experiments, thereby establishing a self&#8208;evolving discovery for carrier biomaterials. Through this approach, carrier biomaterials with an ultra&#8208;low nonspecific protein adsorption index of 0.2537 are successfully discovered, representing an over 80% decrease, while achieving a 10&#160;000&#8208;fold reduction in experiment workload. Furthermore, the discovered biomaterials are fabricated into microfluidic&#8208;used carriers for protein&#8208;analysis applications, showing a 9&#8208;fold enhancement in detection sensitivity compared to conventional carriers. This is the very demonstration of a self&#8208;evolving discovery for carrier biomaterials, paving the way for advancements in single&#8208;cell protein analysis and further its integration with genomics and transcriptomics.

         <title>Localized Spin Textures Stabilized by Geometry&#8208;Induced Strain in 2D Magnet Fe3GeTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain engineering in 2D van der Waals ferromagnet Fe&#8323;GeTe&#8322; is studied using scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy. Spatially varying strain from micropillar arrays induced local 10 K Curie temperature increases, stabilizing magnetic domains including skyrmions and skyrmion bags near pillar corners. This strain&#8208;control of topological spin textures offers new avenues for spintronic technologies.








Abstract
Strain engineering promises to enable manipulation and control of the properties of exfoliated flakes of 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets for spintronic applications. However, while previous studies of strain effects have focused on global properties, the impact on local magnetic spin textures remains unexplored. Here, manipulation of magnetism in the 2D ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) is demonstrated using geometry&#8208;induced strain. Employing scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (STXM), the effects of spatially varying strain profiles on the magnetic order of FGT sheets stamped onto micropillar arrays are directly visualized. It is found that the in&#8208;plane strain components, with magnitudes &lt;0.5%, locally elevate the Curie temperature of FGT by 10 K, stabilizing magnetic domains near the pillar corners. These domains include skyrmions and higher&#8208;order topological spin textures such as skyrmioniums and skyrmion bags. The possibility to locally seed and control topological spin textures via strain opens new avenues for future spin&#8208;based information technologies.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Single&#8208;Step Approach for the Controlled Synthesis of Multifunctional Microparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile one&#8208;pot strategy combines bipolar electrochemistry and the water&#8208;organic interface to synthesize in a single&#8208;step complex patchy particles, which cannot be achieved by any other deposition process. Under the influence of an electric field, microparticles undergo selective surface modification via coupled redox reactions, enabling simultaneous deposition of several materials, resulting in distinct patches with different chemical features.








Abstract
Multicomponent patchy particles offer unique opportunities for diverse applications, yet their controlled synthesis remains challenging. Here a strategy is presented that allows generating complex microparticles, having distinct patches of different chemical composition, by using a one&#8208;pot and single&#8208;step approach. The concept is based on the synergetic combination of bipolar electrochemistry and a water/organic (w/o) interface as the reaction space. Positioning conducting microspheres at the w/o interface allows for targeted surface modification with multiple components. Under the influence of an applied electric field, oriented parallel to the interface, simultaneous redox reactions in both phases lead to the selective deposition of up to four different materials at opposite faces of the particles. This very versatile approach can also be extended beyond spherical particles for the controlled modification of 2D materials. The simplicity of the method and the inherent precise control over multiple functional components allows for the design of advanced multicomponent patchy particles, which cannot be obtained by any other deposition process.

         <title>Biomimetic Engineering of Robust Gradient Antibacterial Coatings using Hollow Nanoframes of Prussian Blue Analogues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial reef&#8208;like manganese&#8208;doped Prussian blue analogue (PBMn) is designed as a biomimetic cross&#8208;linker to enhance the mechanical robustness of the phytic acid&#8208;cationic polymer (PC) network. This approach enables the efficient deposition of PC&#8208;PBM on diverse material surfaces and complex geometries, facilitating the fabrication of gradient coating with optimized antibacterial performance while minimizing heat generation.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy for bacterial infections poses a significant challenge due to the high temperatures required for effective bacterial eradication, which can also harm surrounding healthy tissues. Determining the minimal effective temperature for bacterial destruction is therefore critical. In this study, artificial reef&#8208;like manganese&#8208;doped Prussian blue (PBMn) nanoframes are developed as photothermal agents and physical cross&#8208;linkers to reinforce a phytic acid and cationic polymer network coating. This innovative deposition approach facilitates the creation of a gradient PBMn&#8208;enhanced phytic acid&#8208;cationic polymer (PC&#8208;PBM) coating, achieving a balance between effective photothermal antibacterial activity and reduced heat&#8208;induced collateral damage. When applied to a polyurethane (PU) substrate, the gradient PC&#8208;PBM coating exhibits excellent photothermal efficiency, biocompatibility, and tunable antibacterial activity. Gene transcriptomics analysis demonstrates significant downregulation of virulence genes and biofilm&#8208;forming genes in pathogens following PC&#8208;PBM treatment, confirming the antibacterial efficacy of the coating. Both in vitro and in vivo evaluations, including studies in an infected hernia model, underscore the coating's excellent anti&#8208;infection performance. This work introduces a robust and biomimetic strategy for constructing gradient coating, advancing photothermal therapy by achieving effective bacterial eradication with reducing collateral damage to healthy tissues.

         <title>Chemical Exchange Between Silica Networks and Liquid Metals for All&#8208;Inorganic, Sintering&#8208;Free and Highly Conductive Inks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the unique chemical exchange between silica hydroxyl groups and liquid metal (LM) surfaces, this work reports a whole&#8208;inorganic LM&#8208;silica gel ink (LMSG) with high electrical conductivity, excellent thermal stability, high&#160;flexibility, and surface compatibility. Highly flexible and complicated integrated circuits are successfully fabricated by the LMSG inks. 








Abstract
Electrically conductive inks with noble metals (e.g. silver particles) and inorganic carriers (e.g. glass powder) are broadly applied in the electronics&#160;industry. However, such inorganic inks are generally not compatible with highly flexible electronics due to the inherent rigidity and poor surface compatibility. Based on the unique chemical exchange between silica hydroxyl groups and liquid metal surfaces, this work reports a wholeinorganic LM&#8211;silica gel ink (LMSG) with high electrical conductivity, excellent thermal stability, high flexibility, and surface compatibility. The conductive percolation threshold of the LMSG inks is only 43 wt.%, which is the lowest among reported LM composites so far. Interestingly, inorganic LMSG inks do not require any sintering procedure for conductive paths, removing serious constraints over traditional LM inks. In addition, LMSG inks can be prepared in bulk as powders for long&#8208;term storage (&gt;1 year) by simple dehydration, and more importantly, the dehydrated powders can conveniently regenerate LMSG inks via re&#8208;dissolution. The circuits fabricated from LMSG inks show much improved thermal stability (&gt;300&#160;&#176;C) compared with conventional LM inks (&lt;100&#160;&#176;C). LMSG ink exhibits wide surface compatibility with plastics, wood, skin, etc. Highly flexible and complicated integrated circuits with microcontroller units (MCUs) can be successfully fabricated.

         <title>Unveiling Energy Loss Mechanisms to Empower Ternary Organic Solar Cells with over 20% Efficiency: A Systematic Oligomeric Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study designs modular oligomeric donors (5BDD, 5BDD&#8208;F, 5BDT&#8208;F, 5BDT&#8208;Cl) for ternary OSCs, achieving PCEs &gt;20%. By systematically tuning energy levels, we reveal material compatibility, not HOMO alignment, drive VOC enhancement, suppress ACQ and reduce energy loss, offering new design principles for high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.








Abstract
In organic solar cells (OSCs), the ternary strategy is a mainstream approach to obtaining highly efficient OSCs. A deeper understanding of working mechanisms and the material selection criteria for boosting open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) is essential for further OSC breakthrough. Through a modular design principle, a series of oligomeric donors &#8211; 5BDD, 5BDD&#8208;F, 5BDT&#8208;F, and 5BDT&#8208;Cl &#8211; with similar molecular configurations but varying HOMO levels is systematically designed. These findings reveal that the HOMO levels of these oligomers have a negligible impact on the VOC of the ternary OSCs. Instead, their excellent compatibility with acceptors played a pivotal role in enhancing VOC. The oligomers effectively suppressed excessive acceptor aggregation and achieved Aggregation&#8208;Caused Quenching Suppression (ACQS), strengthening the external electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) and reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination energy losses. Simultaneously, oligomers fine&#8208;tuned and optimized the morphology of the blend films, leading to a higher fill factor (FF) and improved performance. Notably, the 5BDT&#8208;F&#8208; and 5BDT&#8208;Cl&#8208;based ternary OSCs achieved impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.8% and 20.1% (certified 19.76%), with FFs of 80.9% and 80.7%, respectively. This work elucidates the unusual role of the third component energy levels on the VOC in ternary OSCs and offers valuable guidance for future OSC design.

The felt demonstrates a passive heat transfer coefficient as high as 1100 W m&#8722;2 K&#8722;1 for evaporative cooling of photovoltaic cells and shows an ability to reduce ambient temperature and increase humidity for ecological restoration.








Abstract
With the explosive growth of photovoltaic (PV) power station, the energy efficiency and ecological impact of which have emerged as two important points of great concern. In this work, an approach is proposed to cool solar panels and facilitate ecological restoration by engineering moisture cycle in PV plants with an all&#8208;polymer hydroscopic felt. Formed by fibers with highly oriented polyethylene (PE) micro&#8208;fiber cores and polyacrylamide (PAAm) shells of a few microns in thickness, the felt is ultra&#8208;light, anti&#8208;corrosive, and demonstrates a high passive heat transfer coefficient of 1100&#160;W m&#8722;2 K&#8722;1. Under the solar light of one sun, the felt reduces the temperature of solar cells by 28&#160;&#176;C, and increases the output power by 20.4%. Moreover, the felt regenerates to the original state in only 1.3 times the evaporation time. In addition, due to the high evaporation and moisture absorption rate, the PE/hydrogel felt exhibits the ability to raise the ambient humidity in photovoltaic plants by 24% and lower the ambient temperature by 2.6&#160;&#176;C, which significantly promotes the survival rate of surrounding flora. These results show the ability of the all&#8208;polymer hydroscopic felt in promoting energy efficiency of PV conversion and offers the potential to augment ecological restoration using PV plants.

         <title>Electrospun Lignin/ZnO Nanofibrous Membranes for Self&#8208;Powered Ultrasensitive Flexible Airflow Sensor and Wearable Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the novel sensing applications of water evaporation&#8208;induced power generation, by using lignin/ZnO nanofibrous membranes for sensing airflow through output voltage variation. Obtained lignin/ZnO airflow sensors are self&#8208;powered, precise, and quick&#8208;responding, and can be used as wearable devices for breath monitor, surrounding movement sensor, and sweat monitor.








Abstract
The interest and demand for flexible sensors and wearable devices are rapidly growing. The added benefit of electricity generation, enabling gas sensors to be self&#8208;powered, increases the applicability of these devices for flexible and wearable airflow sensors. Inspired by water evaporation&#8208;induced power generation, this study explores its potential in sensing applications, which has not yet been explored in detail. Electrospinning technology is used to prepare superhydrophilic lignin/ZnO nanofibrous membranes with a ZnO nanoparticle layer, capable of generating at least 100&#160;mV (which allows it to power its own signal transduction). The membrane is highly sensitive to variations in airflow, enabling its use as an ultrasensitive and flexible airflow sensor. This sensor demonstrates exceptional performance, including a fast response time (0.65 s), broad detection range (with lower detection limit down to 0.25 and upper detection limit of 3&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1), and extremely high airflow velocity detection accuracy. Beyond these, it can serve as a wearable sensor for sweat monitoring, motion detection, and breath monitoring (to accurately detect breathing rate, intensity and variations in speech). Such self&#8208;powered, ultrasensitive, and flexible lignin/ZnO airflow sensors provide novel potential to advance the development of smart textiles and wearable electronics.

         <title>Covalent Surface Modification of Hydrophobic Alkoxides on Ti3C2Tx MXene Nanosheets Toward Amphiphilic and Electrically Conductive Inks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically conductive and amphiphilic MXene inks are achieved by surface modification of sodium alkoxides, where surface&#8208;modified MXenes are dispersible both in water and in non&#8208;polar solvents such as toluene. Alkoxide&#8208;functionalized MXenes also show enhanced environmental stability compared to pristine MXene, leading to higher electrical conductivity and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding properties under oxidative conditions.








Abstract
MXenes have garnered significant interest for use in conductive inks, processed either in aqueous solutions or organic solvents following surface modification. However, maintaining their electrical conductivity during dispersion across a broad range of solvents, particularly non&#8208;polar ones, has proven challenging, limiting their potential applications as conductive dispersions. Here, a straightforward method is presented for synthesizing electrically conductive and amphiphilic MXenes via surface modification. Alkoxide groups, such as ethoxide and phenoxide, are covalently attached to Ti3C2Tx MXene surfaces using a nucleophilic substitution mechanism, enabling stable dispersion in both polar and non&#8208;polar solvents. These alkoxide&#8208;functionalized MXenes exhibited an electrical conductivity of up to 2,700 S cm&#8722;1 and dispersibility in non&#8208;polar solvents like toluene, surpassing previous modification approaches. Additionally, they demonstrate enhanced oxidative stability and excellent coating performance on substrates with varied surface energies. The electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding films fabricated with these MXenes exhibited some of the highest performance among surface&#8208;modified MXenes and their composites, achieving shielding efficiency comparable to that of pristine Ti3C2Tx MXene films, while offering significantly improved durability. These findings may contribute to the development of improved processing approaches for MXenes, paving the way for advancements in printable and wearable electronics while addressing key challenges in MXene processing and modification.

         <title>Deep Eutectic Solvents Formed by Complex Hydrides: A New Class of Hydrogen&#8208;Rich Liquid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work discovers a new type of deep eutectic solvent composed of ammonia borane (NH3BH3, AB) and tetrabutylammonium borohydride (TBABH). The new liquids possess a hydrogen content higher than 5 wt%, thus representing promising high&#8208;energy liquid hydrogen carriers. The strong hydrogen bonding between AB and TBABH explains the depletion of the melting point, with the eutectic point sitting at a molar ratio of 1&#8211;2 TBABH&#8208;AB.








Abstract
Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are novel mixtures that exhibit a significant depression in melting points compared to their individual components. This work finds that combining tetrabutylammonium borohydride (TBABH) with ammonia borane (AB) yields new, stable, hydrogen&#8208;rich liquids under ambient conditions, with a glass transition as low as &#8722;50 &#176;C. Liquid mixtures containing up to 6.9 wt% hydrogen can be easily obtained through physical grinding. The strong interaction between the BH4&#8722; anion of TBABH and AB coupled with the vibration dynamics of the alkyl chains accounts for the sharp decrease in melting point. The eutectic point is identified at a TBABH&#8208;AB molar ratio of 1&#8211;2. Increasing the AB ratio further reduces the glass transition temperature but also induces a cold crystallization phenomenon. These mixtures can release hydrogen at temperatures as low as 60 &#176;C, making them promising candidates for hydrogen storage. This represents the first example of a hydride&#8208;based DES, advancing research on complex hydrides and opening the door to the discovery of new hydrogen&#8208;rich liquids for various applications.

         <title>Van der Waals Welding of Carbon Nanotubes with Near&#8208;Limit High Strength</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The welding of CNTs for the first time by a fast chemical&#8208;vapor&#8208;deposition self&#8208;assembly (FCVDS) technique using TiO2 nanoparticles as the solder is reported. It is simple, fast, pressure&#8208;free, and applicable to ambient conditions. The welded junctions have the highest strength realized in nanowelding field so far, to the best of the knowledge.








Abstract
The strength of carbon nanotube (CNT) bundles and fibers is generally much lower than that of single CNTs, the short length of CNT components results in the assembly strength can only be contributed by the weak shearing interaction between CNTs. Here, the welding of CNTs by a fast chemical&#8208;vapor&#8208;deposition self&#8208;assembly (FCVDS) technique using TiO2 nanoparticles as the solder is reported. It is simple, fast, pressure&#8208;free, applicable to ambient conditions, and can weld samples with macroscale length. The welded junctions have a mechanical strength approaching the tensile strength of a single CNT. Whereas the interface interaction between TiO2 and CNTs is only contributed by Van der Waals forces, avoiding the destruction of the defect&#8208;free structure of CNTs. The solder mass can be only &#8776;1&#160;wt% of welded CNTs.

It is simple, fast, pressure-free, applicable to ambient conditions, and can weld samples with macroscale length. The welded junctions have a mechanical strength approaching the tensile strength of a single CNT. Whereas the interface interaction between TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CNTs is only contributed by Van der Waals forces, avoiding the destruction of the defect-free structure of CNTs. The solder mass can be only &#8776;1&#160;wt% of welded CNTs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coexisting Non&#8208;Trivial Van der Waals Magnetic Orders Enable Field&#8208;Free Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque Magnetization Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orders in van der Waals magnet above room temperature, inducing an intrinsic exchange bias and canted perpendicular magnetism is discovered. Such non&#8208;trivial intrinsic magnetic order enables the realization of energy&#8208;efficient and magnetic field&#8208;free spin&#8208;orbit torque memory devices.








Abstract
The discovery of van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials exhibiting non&#8208;trivial and tunable magnetic interactions can lead to exotic magnetic states that are not readily attainable with conventional materials. Such vdW magnets can provide a unique platform for studying new magnetic phenomena and realizing magnetization dynamics for energy&#8208;efficient and non&#8208;volatile spintronic memory and computing technologies. Here, the coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orders in vdW magnet (Co0.5Fe0.5)5&#8208;xGeTe2 (CFGT) above room temperature, inducing an intrinsic exchange bias and canted perpendicular magnetism is discovered. Such non&#8208;trivial intrinsic magnetic order enables to realize energy&#8208;efficient, magnetic field&#8208;free, and deterministic spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) switching of CFGT in heterostructure with Pt. These experiments, in conjunction with density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrate the coexistence of non&#8208;trivial magnetic orders in CFGT, which enables field&#8208;free SOT magnetization dynamics in spintronic devices.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Directed Growth of Tin Perovskite for Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

         <dc:description>
Tin perovskites suffer from uncontrolled crystallization, leading to high defect density and poor LED performance. A substrate modification strategy is introduced to regulate interfacial nucleation rates and growth directions, effectively reducing defect density and improving film quality. This approach boosts photoluminescence quantum efficiency to &#8776;41% and achieves a record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency of 12.8% for tin perovskite NIR LEDs.








Abstract
Controlling the crystallization dynamics of solution&#8208;processed tin perovskites remains pivotal yet challenging for achieving high&#8208;performance lead&#8208;free optoelectronic devices. Herein, it is demonstrated that substrate&#8208;regulated interfacial nucleation governs crystal growth orientation and film quality of tin perovskites. The results show that pristine PEDOT:PSS substrates induce bottom&#8208;interface&#8208;dominated nucleation via strong PEDOT+&#8208;[SnI3]nn&#8722; interactions, driving rapid upward crystallization of tin perovskites and yielding rough films with low photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE: &#8776;26%). Strategic substrate modification with potassium citrate (PC) weakens the PEDOT+&#8208;[SnI3]nn&#8722; interactions, thereby redirecting nucleation initiation to the top interface during solvent evaporation. This results in controlled downward crystallization of tin perovskites, forming smooth films with improved crystallinity and superior optoelectronic properties (PLQE: &#8776;41%). The optimized tin perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) achieve record&#8208;breaking performance with an external quantum efficiency of 12.8% and a maximum radiance of 190&#160;W&#160;sr&#8722;1&#160;m&#8722;2, which is the highest performance reported for tin perovskite near&#8208;infrared LEDs to date. This work demonstrates interface&#8208;directed crystallization control as an effective strategy for achieving high&#8208;performance tin perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Interfacial Water on Ag/Ag2S Nanowires Enhancing the Ethanol Selectivity for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfurization optimizes the interfacial water structures on Ag/Ag2S nanowires during CO2 electroreduction, converting CO2 electroreduction selectivity from CO to ethanol with ethanol Faradic efficiency of (FE) 75%. Operando electrochemical surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (EC&#8208;SERS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations identifies interfacial water structures and intermediates including *CH2CHO and *CO, which facilitate ethanol formation. These findings reveal how interfacial water structure optimization via sulfurization enhances ethanol selectivity.








Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into multicarbon products represents a pivotal yet challenging target, particularly for metal catalysts that predominantly yield C1 products. Herein, this challenge is addressed through sulfur&#8208;induced electronic modulation of Ag&#8208;based catalysts, steering the CO2 reduction pathway toward ethanol production. By constructing atomically engineered Ag/Ag2S nanowires (NWs) via a controlled sulfurization strategy, a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 75% for ethanol at &#8722;0.95&#160;V, along with exceptional stability over 14 h of high&#8208;performance metrics surpassing most reported Ag&#8208;based systems is achieved. Operando electrochemical surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy&#160;(EC&#8208;SERS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveil that the Ag/Ag2S heterointerface synergistically regulates interfacial water networks and stabilizes key *CO intermediates, thereby accelerating CO2 activation, proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, and asymmetric C&#8208;C coupling. Furthermore, sulfurization&#8208;induced dual effects&#8208;optimized hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions and enriched K&#8314; confinement are identified as critical drivers for tailoring the local microenvironment to favor ethanol selectivity. This work not only demonstrates a rational atomic interface design for C2 product orientation but also deciphers the dynamic interplay between catalyst electronic structure and interfacial species, offering a molecular&#8208;level roadmap for advanced CO2 conversion systems.

         <title>Efficient Blue Perovskite LEDs via Bottom&#8208;Up Charge Manipulation for Solution&#8208;Processed Active&#8208;Matrix Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up collaborative charge manipulation strategy is developed to minimize the interfacial charge loss in blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes, leading to stable blue electroluminescence and an external quantum efficiency of 25.87%. Solution&#8208;processed active&#8208;matrix display with clear and uniform patterning is achieved by integrating with thin&#8208;film transistor circuits.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are emerging as strong candidates for next&#8208;generation displays due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties, solution processability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the development of highly efficient blue PeLEDs remains a significant challenge. Here, a bottom&#8208;up strategy is introduced for precise charge manipulation in blue perovskites to enhance radiative recombination efficiency. By employing 1,3&#8208;bis(N&#8208;carbazolyl)benzene as an inserted hole transport layer, improved hole injection efficiency is achieved while effectively suppressing reverse electron transport and exciton quenching. Additionally, a fluorinated ester additive is incorporated to control perovskite crystallization, facilitating the formation of well&#8208;aligned reduced&#8208;dimensional phases to reduce nonradiative recombination losses. The resulting blue PeLEDs exhibit a record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency of 25.87%, the highest reported for one&#8208;step&#8208;prepared blue perovskite films. Furthermore, integration with thin&#8208;film transistor circuits enables solution&#8208;processed active&#8208;matrix perovskite displays with sharp and uniform patterning. This work provides a comprehensive pathway for advancing blue PeLEDs toward high&#8208;performance display applications.

         <title>Dielectric&#8208;Free MoS2/VO2 Junction Field&#8208;Effect Transistor with Sensitive and Ultrafast Photoresponse for Light Encrypted Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dielectric&#8208;free MoS2/VO2 junction field&#8208;effect transistor (JFET) that achieves both high sensitivity and rapid photoresponse is presented. By leveraging the built&#8208;in electric field at the van der Waals (vdW) heterojunction modulated by the phase transition of VO2, the JFET demonstrates stable operation over a wide temperature range. Light encoders are successfully developed to realize low&#8208;power encrypted communications.








Abstract
The rise of the Internet of Things and mobile devices has created a pressing demand for advanced on&#8208;chip photodetection platforms. Two&#8208;dimensional materials have emerged as promising photodetector candidates owing to their exceptional optoelectronic properties. However, simultaneously achieving high responsivity, low noise, and quick photoresponse remains challenging for 2D material phototransistors. This study introduces a hybrid MoS2/VO2 junction field&#8208;effect transistor (JFET) designed to address this sensitivity&#8208;speed tradeoff. By leveraging the van der Waals (vdW) interface and adjustable depletion region via the VO2 gate, the JFET achieves a minimal subthreshold swing (80 mVdec&#8722;1) and little gate hysteresis (10 mV). Furthermore, the promoted carrier transport enables a sensitive photoresponse (responsivity: 103 AW&#8722;1, specific detectivity: 1012 Jones) and fast response speed (rise/decay time: 8/10 &#181;s). The device exhibits self&#8208;powered photodetection at elevated temperature, a rare occurrence for phototransistors with ohmic contact, attributed to enhanced built&#8208;in electric field at asymmetric vdW heterojunction. The JFET's effective gate controllability and sensitive photoresponse make it suitable as a low&#8208;power light encoder for encrypted communication. This work provides the foundation for integrated optoelectronic devices based on 2D materials and heterostructures.

         <title>All&#8208;Optical Synapses Based on a Mechanoluminescent Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents all&#8208;optical synapses utilizing a mechanoluminescent material&#8212;Li0.1Na0.9NbO3:Pr3+ (LNN:Pr3+)&#8212;&#160;to emulate biological synapses with homologous and heterologous synaptic behaviors through optical signal processing. The engineered trap depth distribution&#160;of LNN:Pr3+ enables multi&#8208;stimuli response to UV light, mechanical force, and thermal input, replicating diverse synaptic functionalities. Hardware&#8208;level denoising and multimode&#8208;fused perception are implemented for spatiotemporal feature extraction in dynamic environments.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing systems hold promises to overcome the inefficiencies of conventional von Neumann architecture, which are constrained by data transfer bottlenecks. However, conventional electrically modulated synapses face inherent limitations such as limited switching speed, elevated power consumption, and substantial interconnection loss. Optical signaling offers a transformative alternative, leveraging ultrafast transmission, high bandwidth, and minimal crosstalk. Here, an all&#8208;optical synapse based on a mechanoluminescent material of Li0.1Na0.9NbO3:Pr3+ (LNN:Pr3+) is presented, which emulates biological synapses, including homologous and heterologous synaptic behaviors, through optical signal processing. The engineered trap depth distribution of LNN:Pr3+ enables multi&#8208;stimuli response to UV light, mechanical force, and thermal input, replicating diverse synaptic functionalities such as short&#8208;term potentiation (STP), long&#8208;term potentiation (LTP), paired&#8208;pulse facilitation (PPF), and learning&#8208;experience behavioral adaptation. Furthermore, its utility is showcased in hardware&#8208;level denoising and multimode&#8208;fused perception, achieving spatiotemporal feature extraction in dynamic environments. This work not only sheds light into designing fully optical synapses but also bridges mechanoluminescence (ML) with neuromorphic engineering, advancing energy&#8208;efficient, light&#8208;driven artificial intelligence technologies.

         <title>Performance&#8208;Recoverable Closed&#8208;Loop Neuroprosthetic System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing and stretchable bilayer (SSB) electrode with spontaneous performance recovery consists of a nanomembrane (closely packed aligned Pt&#8208;coated Ag nanowires embedded in the self&#8208;healing polymer) and a nanocomposite (Pt&#8208;coated Ag flakes in the self&#8208;healing polymer). The SSB electrodes are used for wearable artificial mechanoreceptors and implantable peripheral neural interfaces in a closed&#8208;loop performance&#8208;recoverable neuroprosthetic system supported by a machine learning technique.








Abstract
Soft bioelectronics mechanically comparable to living tissues have driven advances in closed&#8208;loop neuroprosthetic systems for the recovery of sensory&#8208;motor functions. Despite notable progress in this field, critical challenges persist in achieving long&#8208;term stable closed&#8208;loop neuroprostheses, particularly in preventing uncontrolled drift in the electrical sensitivity and/or charge injection performance owing to material fatigue or mechanical damage. Additionally, the absence of an intelligent feedback loop has limited the ability to fully compensate for sensory&#8208;motor function loss in nervous systems. Here, a novel class of soft, closed&#8208;loop neuroprosthetic systems is presented for long&#8208;term operation, enabled by spontaneous performance recovery and machine&#8208;learning&#8208;driven correction to address the material fatigue inherent in chronic wear or implantation environments. Central to this innovation is the development of a tough, self&#8208;healing, and stretchable bilayer material with high conductivity and exceptional cyclic durability employed for robot&#8208;interface touch sensors and peripheral&#8208;nerve&#8208;adaptive electrodes. Furthermore, two central processing units, integrated in a prosthetic robot and an artificial brain, support closed&#8208;loop artificial sensory&#8208;motor operations, ensuring accurate sensing, decision&#8208;making, and feedback stimulation processes. Through these characteristics and seamless integration, our performance&#8208;recoverable closed&#8208;loop neuroprosthesis addresses challenges associated with chronic&#8208;material&#8208;fatigue&#8208;induced malfunctions, as demonstrated by successful in vivo under 4 weeks of implantation and/or mechanical damage.

         <title>Driving Multifunctional Nanomedicine Design for Non&#8208;Inflammatory Tumor Therapy with Integrated Machine Learning and Density Functional Theory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A computation&#8208;guided strategy for non&#8208;inflammatory photothermal therapy is developed, leveraging machine learning to identify RuO2 as the optimal photothermal agent with anti&#8208;inflammatory properties. Through an integrated approach, the mechanisms are elucidated using density functional theory calculations. This dual&#8208;methodology framework allows for a deeper understanding of the photothermal and anti&#8208;inflammatory performance.








Abstract
Due to the promotive role of inflammation in tumor progression, designing multifunctional nanomedicines that synergistically combine anti&#8208;tumor and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties emerges as a promising approach to enhance cancer treatment. However, identifying optimal nano&#8208;agents from a vast pool of candidates using traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods remains inefficient and lacking in systematic guidance. In this study, this challenge is addressed by integrating photothermal therapy for tumor ablation with catalase&#8208;mimicking nanozymes for inflammation mitigation as a model system to explore non&#8208;inflammatory tumor treatment strategies. Using interpretable machine learning techniques, experimental data are systematically analyzed to elucidate the relationships between nanomaterial features and functional properties, enabling the precise identification of photothermal agents with robust anti&#8208;inflammatory synergistic effects. Through this framework, ruthenium oxide nanoparticles (RuO2 NPs) are identified as a highly efficient multifunctional candidate. The catalytic properties of RuO2 NPs are further validated and rationalized through density functional theory calculations. Experimental investigations confirm the remarkable performance of RuO2 NPs, demonstrating their ability to achieve efficient photothermal tumor ablation at NIR&#8208;II biowindow and simultaneously mitigate inflammation by promoting a favorable immune microenvironment. This work highlights the transformative potential of machine learning&#8208;driven approaches in the rational design and accelerated discovery of multifunctional nanomaterials.

         <title>Scalable Jet Swimmer Driven by Pulsatile Artificial Muscles&#160;and Soft Chamber Buckling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by nautiluses, a scalable robotic jet swimmer is developed, featuring a soft chamber that buckles instantly to amplify jetting speed. It demonstrates the successful integration of smart materials and smart structures in a robotic system, offering a promising pathway for developing efficient, adaptable, and intelligent underwater soft robots.








Abstract
Cephalopods, such as squid and nautilus, achieve fast swimming by jetting water swiftly from their chambers, offering benefits in swimming speed, energy efficiency, and silent operation. Inspired by these animals, a scalable soft robotic jet swimmer that utilizes soft chamber buckling to enable rapid water jetting is proposed. The design incorporates three main components: the knotted artificial muscle (KAM), an origami&#8208;inspired soft chamber, and a custom control module. The KAM generates significant force and stroke with minimal self&#8208;weight, but its actuation speed is insufficient for propelling water. To address this limit, an origami&#8208;inspired soft chamber that buckles instantly when the KAM's pulling force reaches a critical threshold is designed, thereby amplifying actuation speed and enabling rapid water jetting. The control module periodically activates the KAM to tighten and release, facilitating effective pulsatile propulsion. Similar to Cephalopods, this design is scalable and robust. Effective swimming of two robots is demonstrated with drastically different sizes, achieving a top speed of 0.62 body length per second. We also show that the propulsion is minimally compromised even when the KAM is significantly damaged. To further enable guided locomotion, a shape memory alloy rudder is incorporated for steering via infrared stimulation. This work demonstrates successful pulsatile jet swimming through the integration of smart materials and smart structures, laying the groundwork for future innovations in underwater soft&#160;robotics.

         <title>Reticular Photoelectrochemical Transistor with Biochemical Metaplasticity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the ambipolar behavior of a metal&#8211;organic framework channel gated by a photosensitive hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework electrode, a reticular photoelectrochemical transistor is proposed and constructed. The device enables the biochemically modulated positive/negative photoconductivity and the aqueous metaplasticity with typical nonmonotonic enhanced depression effect region and the threshold sliding, which are explored for image recognition.








Abstract
Close imitation of synaptic metaplasticity is an important objective in the neuromorphic domain. Progress has been made in solid&#8208;state electronics with high&#8208;voltage dynamics, which, nevertheless, marks a significant inconsistency with the biological systems in aqueous media. Here, the concept of reticular photoelectrochemical transistor (RPECT) is proposed and devised that can realize metaplasticity with biochemical modulation. Based on the ambipolar behavior of a metal&#8211;organic framework channel gated by a photosensitive hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework electrode, biochemically modulated positive/negative photoconductivity and metaplasticity with the typical features, e.g., the nonmonotonic enhanced depression effect region and the threshold sliding are achieved. Taking advantage of such unique properties, in&#8208;sensor preprocessing and in&#8208;memory computing are further implemented for efficient image recognition. This work realizes the aqueous metaplasticity by a new device of RPECT, which also introduces the biochemical modulation into image recognition, providing a perspective for future development of machine vision processing.

         <title>Inflammation&#8208;Activatable Nanoscavengers for Sustainable Cell&#8208;Free DNA Capture and Cleavage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inflammation&#8208;activatable nanoscavenger is constructed from dendrimer&#8208;templated, charge/conformation&#8208;transformable polypeptides to mediate cell&#8208;free DNA (cfDNA) scavenging and inflammatory bowel disease treatment. Inside the inflamed intestine, the polypeptides transform from negatively charged random coils into positively charged &#945;&#8208;helices, which enables&#160;sustained cfDNA scavenging via cfDNA capture &#160;&#160;followed by Cyclen&#8208;Zn&#8208;mediated&#160;cfDNA cleavage. Thus, the nanoscavenger effectively attenuates inflammation and restores immune homeostasis.








Abstract
Cell&#8208;free DNA (cfDNA) scavenging using cationic materials represents a promising therapeutic modality for autoimmune diseases (AIDs) such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This approach, however, suffers from critical issues of binding saturation for cfDNA and risk of re&#8208;exposure of the captured cfDNA. Herein, an inflammation&#8208;activatable nanoscavenger integrating both cfDNA capture and cleavage functions is constructed from dendrimer&#8208;templated, charge&#8208; and conformation&#8208;transformable polypeptides with Cyclen&#8208;Zn complexes conjugated on the backbone termini. At neutral pH, the polypeptides containing both cis&#8208;aconitic acid and guanidine side chains adopt negative charges and random&#8208;coiled conformation, thus featuring long blood circulation and high accumulation to the inflamed intestinal tissue. Inside the mildly acidic inflammatory microenvironment, the polypeptides transform to the positively charged &#945;&#8208;helices due to removal of the cis&#8208;aconitic acid groups, thus enabling robust cfDNA capture through electrostatic attraction, salt bridging, and spatial confinement within the cavity between adjacent rod&#8208;like helices. Subsequently, the exposed Cyclen&#8208;Zn endows the nanoscavenger with DNase&#8208;like activity to cleave the captured cfDNA, allowing sustainable cfDNA capture and scavenging. In consequence, the nanoscavenger efficiently inhibits TLR9 activation and restores immune homeostasis in IBD mice. This study proposes an enlightened strategy for sustainable cfDNA scavenging, and it renders a promising modality for AIDs treatment.

         <title>Zeolite Structure Direction: Metals with a Dual Role as Amine Coordinators and Siloxy Connectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual role of metal ions as amine coordinators and siloxy connectors leads to the formation of new 3D silicate&#8208;based hybrid materials. Its isolated inorganic layers serve as a platform for the synthesis of novel porous materials. This paper serves as the seed of a new field in zeolite&#8208;zeotypes synthesis and presents the first example of a true coordination polymer&#8208;zeolite hybrid.









Abstract
Innovation in the synthesis of new zeolites is achieved primarily through the use of costly novel organic compounds as structure&#8208;directing agents (SDAs). Here, a novel type of structure&#8208;direction based on a metal&#8208;amine coordination polymer leading to a 3&#8208;dimensional silicate&#8208;based hybrid material, LEU&#8208;1, is presented. The Zn&#8208;amine polymer not only serves as an SDA, but also plays a practical role in extending the inorganic connectivity in the form of Zn&#8208;O&#8208;Si bonds. This dual&#8208;role mechanism leads to unique hybrids with huge potential for creating zeolite&#8208;like materials. It is demonstrated that by using the silicate layer in LEU&#8208;1 as a platform, two novel pure&#8208;silica zeolites can be generated. This synthesis strategy, rooted in the coordination diversity of metal&#8208;amines, opens the door to more novel zeolite structures.

         <title>Synergistic Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Engineering for Enhanced Longevity in Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to the synergism of abundant active sites and the superior catalytic effect of the uf&#8208;MBene/CNT cathode host, along with uniform lithium ion deposition facilitated by adding Na2SeO3 additives, the cell with this S@uf&#8208;MBene/CNT cathode and Na2SeO3 additive can maintain stable cycling for up to 850 cycles with a capacity retention rate of 93.6% at 0.5 C (10.62 mg cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
Due to the notorious shuttle effect and the uneven deposition of lithium ions under high current conditions, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries with ultra&#8208;high sulfur loading struggle to achieve stable long&#8208;cycle performance. Herein, a novel MBene&#8208;based composite material is prepared using the ultrasonic freeze etching method as a cathode host. The shuttle effect is effectively inhibited, thanks to its unique structure and abundant active sites. Moreover, a small amount of Na2SeO3 is introduced into the electrolyte to further enhance the long&#8208;cycle performance. Due to the &#8220;reverse tip effect,&#8221; where sodium ions preferentially deposit over lithium ions, the growth of lithium dendrites is effectively suppressed. Remarkably, the cell with the novel cathode and electrolyte design exhibits an initial capacity of 778.2 mAh g&#8722;1 and sustains stability for up to 850 cycles with a capacity retention rate of 93.6% and a sulfur loading of 10.62&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. The synergistic strategy of optimizing both cathode and electrolyte systems effectively mitigates the shuttle effect and suppresses lithium dendrite growth, offering an innovative approach to designing ultra&#8208;high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;loading lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries with extended lifespans.

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the synergism of abundant active sites and the superior catalytic effect of the uf-MBene/CNT cathode host, along with uniform lithium ion deposition facilitated by adding Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; additives, the cell with this S@uf-MBene/CNT cathode and Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; additive can maintain stable cycling for up to 850 cycles with a capacity retention rate of 93.6% at 0.5 C (10.62 mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the notorious shuttle effect and the uneven deposition of lithium ions under high current conditions, lithium-sulfur batteries with ultra-high sulfur loading struggle to achieve stable long-cycle performance. Herein, a novel MBene-based composite material is prepared using the ultrasonic freeze etching method as a cathode host. The shuttle effect is effectively inhibited, thanks to its unique structure and abundant active sites. Moreover, a small amount of Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is introduced into the electrolyte to further enhance the long-cycle performance. Due to the &#8220;reverse tip effect,&#8221; where sodium ions preferentially deposit over lithium ions, the growth of lithium dendrites is effectively suppressed. Remarkably, the cell with the novel cathode and electrolyte design exhibits an initial capacity of 778.2 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and sustains stability for up to 850 cycles with a capacity retention rate of 93.6% and a sulfur loading of 10.62&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The synergistic strategy of optimizing both cathode and electrolyte systems effectively mitigates the shuttle effect and suppresses lithium dendrite growth, offering an innovative approach to designing ultra-high-sulfur-loading lithium-sulfur batteries with extended lifespans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Clinically Accurate Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease via Single&#8208;Molecule Bioelectronic Label&#8208;Free Profiling of Multiple Blood Extracellular Vesicle Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioelectronic platform is developed to detect Alzheimer's disease biomarkers in blood extracellular vesicles with unprecedented sensitivity. By integrating transistor technology with microelectrodes, the platform identifies multiple indicators simultaneously in just 20 min, achieving perfect accuracy in clinical tests. This rapid, label&#8208;free approach can transform early diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases.








Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no cure, making early diagnosis critical for mitigating its impact. Blood extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold promises as biomarkers for AD diagnosis, but current detection technologies lack the sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities needed for efficient diagnosis. Here, a novel label&#8208;free bioelectronic platform is presented based on an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) integrated with a microelectrode array (MEA) for ultrasensitive detection of AD biomarkers in blood EVs, including amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;1&#8208;40 and A&#946;1&#8208;42), total tau (t&#8208;tau), and phosphorylated tau (p&#8208;tau181). This platform achieves a detection limit as low as the zeptomolar (zM) level, enabling the detection of single&#8208;molecule targets. It provides a comprehensive multiplexed diagnostic model capable of delivering results within 20 min. Notably, the systematic integration of multiple AD biomarkers in blood EVs is demonstrated to significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy. This study presents a novel EVs&#8208;based multiplexed diagnostic model for AD, correctly classifying all clinical samples (n = 40), far exceeding the accuracy of a single biomarker. With its high sensitivity and rapid turnaround, this platform enables reliable AD diagnosis and holds the potential for tracking disease progression, offering a transformative tool to combat the societal burden of AD.

         <title>Monolithic Terahertz Topological&#160;Mach&#8208;Zehnder Interferometer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monolithic topological Mach&#8208;Zehnder interferometer (MZI) is presented, integrating the splitter, combiner, and waveguide arms on a single chip. The interferometric fringes exhibiting high on&#8208;off contrast with extinction ratios over 20 dB are achieved by utilizing tailored unit cells that facilitate interface&#8208;dependent out&#8208;of&#8208;plane radiation losses. We also demonstrate active tuning of the MZI response through photoexcitation of the MZI arms.








Abstract
The pursuit of on&#8208;chip electromagnetic wave control for high throughput communication, spectroscopy, and quantum computing underlies the motivation for terahertz photonic integrated circuitry. Recent breakthroughs in topological photonics have enabled the development of chips that harness topologically resilient interface modes to achieve area and performance efficiency. However, the demonstration of a compact, monolithic topological Mach&#8208;Zehnder interferometer (MZI), remains a critical gap. In this work, a terahertz topological MZI is presented, exhibiting six interferometric fringes across a 17&#160;GHz bandwidth, with splitter, combiner, and arms integrated on a single chip. The interferometric fringes exhibiting high on&#8208;off contrast with extinction ratios over 20&#160;dB are achieved by utilizing tailored unit cells that facilitate interface&#8208;dependent out&#8208;of&#8208;plane radiation losses. Active tuning of the MZI response is also demonstrated through photoexcitation of the MZI arms. The presented approach is the first step toward realizing topological photonic modulators that leverage the phase degree of freedom for photonic integrated communication and quantum information processing.

         <title>Reversible Phase Transitions of Anionic and Cationic Surfactant Mixtures Drive Shape Morphing Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;controlled, reversible phase transition of ionic surfactant assemblies, coupled with dynamic partitioning between bulk phases and interfaces, induces rapid, and order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude changes in oil&#8211;water interfacial tension. Surpassing the capabilities of conventional stimuli&#8208;responsive surfactants, this transient, collaborative mechanism enables multimodal droplet shape transformations and offers a new strategy for the design of programmable, hierarchically structured, all&#8208;liquid matter acting with physicality.








Abstract
Converting chemical signals into mechanical responses is fundamental to biological systems, driving processes such as cellular motility and tissue morphogenesis. Yet, harnessing chemo&#8208;mechanical signal conversions in synthetic systems remains a key challenge in energy&#8208;dissipative materials design. While droplets can move and interact with their environment reminiscent of active biological matter, chemo&#8208;mechanical interactions are limited by the translation of chemical changes into extensive force variations required on small timescales. Droplets naturally adopt spherical shapes to minimize surface&#8208;energy and restructuring liquids into non&#8208;equilibrium geometries requires mechanisms beyond current stimuli&#8208;responsive surfactant systems, which lack the force&#8208;amplifying mechanisms needed for transient liquid structuring. Here, a spring&#8208;like charging and latch&#8208;controlled release mechanism is introduced for actuating droplets. This is based on reversible, light&#8208;induced crystal&#8208;to&#8208;coacervate phase transitions of photo&#8208;responsive surfactant assemblies, namely between anionic sodium dodecylsulfate and cationic azobenzene&#8208;based surfactants. During phase&#8208;transition, reversible partitioning of the surfactants into the oil or aqueous phases of the emulsion transiently induce rapid changes in interfacial tensions, which are up to 900 times greater than those observed for conventional stimuli&#8208;responsive surfactant systems. The insights into this novel chemo&#8208;mechanical transduction mechanism provide new control over purely liquid systems, paving the way for programmable, hierarchically structured, all&#8208;liquid matter acting with physicality.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Engineered Orthopedic Implant to Break the Antimicrobial&#8208;Osteogenic Paradox at Biointerfaces in the &#8220;Race for the Surface&#8221;</title>

Through polyphenol&#8208;amine&#8208;mediated covalent modification, quaternary ammonium groups (bactericidal agents) and phosphate groups (promoting bone&#8208;regeneration factors) are spatially organized on titanium (Ti) surfaces to regulate the surface chemical characteristics of dental implants. The surface&#8208;engineered implants (Ti&#8208;AQs) exhibited balanced antibacterial and biocompatible properties.








Abstract
Implant&#8208;associated infections and compromised osseointegration pose a dual threat to bone implants due to the biological conflict between microbial invasion and host cell colonization. However, conventional contact&#8208;killing antimicrobial coatings may negatively affect the viability of mammalian cells, limiting their further application. Here, a surface modification strategy is proposed to help mammalian cells to win the &#8220;race for the surface&#8221; on the material&#8208;tissue interfaces. Through polyphenol&#8208;amine&#8208;mediated covalent modification, quaternary ammonium groups (bactericidal agents) and phosphate groups (promoting bone&#8208;regeneration factors) are spatially organized on titanium (Ti) surfaces to regulate the surface chemical characteristics of dental implants. The surface&#8208;engineered implants (Ti&#8208;AQs) exhibited balanced antibacterial and biocompatible properties. The optimized Ti&#8208;AQ&#8208;2 coating eradicated &gt;99% of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) via destruction of disrupted bacterial membranes through metabolic interference, and simultaneously promoted adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells through Ca2+&#8208;mediated signaling pathways. Moreover, Ti&#8208;AQs can drive immunomodulation biased macrophages toward pro&#8208;repair M2 polarization. In vivo evaluations in an implant&#8208;associated infection modal confirmed that Ti&#8208;AQ&#8208;2 inhibited infection at the early stage and enhanced bone&#8208;implant integration at the late stage. This work presents a facile strategy to regulate the surface performances for developing of antibacterial implants with high biocompatibility and bioactivity.

This work presents a facile strategy to regulate the surface performances for developing of antibacterial implants with high biocompatibility and bioactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Amide Engineered Blue Phase Liquid Crystal Elastomers: Synergistic Fatigue Resistance, Programmable Mechanochromics and Spatiotemporally Encrypted Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;amide engineering creates a hierarchical energy dissipation system in blue phase liquid crystal elastomers, yielding remarkable toughness and ultralow hysteresis. This strategy enables programmable mechanochromics via thermally induced bond rearrangement. A multidimensional encryption platform is demonstrated by synergistically combining mechanical strain, UV&#8208;triggered luminescence, and temporally&#8208;gated phosphorescent afterglow for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.








Abstract
Blue phase liquid crystal elastomers (BPLCEs) hold significant promise for flexible photonic devices due to their 3D periodic photonic lattices and intrinsic soft&#8208;matter characteristics. However, achieving an optimal balance between mechanical resilience and dynamic responsiveness remains a critical challenge. This study introduces a dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding network design strategy, wherein N,N'&#8208;bisacryloylcystamine monomers are incorporated to construct a hierarchical energy dissipation system, yielding BPLCEs with remarkable toughness (1.72 MJ m&#8722;3) and ultralow hysteresis (4.8%). By integrating thermally induced topological bond rearrangement, programmable mechanical gradient films are developed to enable high&#8208;precision strain&#8208;induced patterning and an adaptive encryption mechanism governed by a &#8220;relaxation&#8208;concealment/stretching&#8208;development&#8221; paradigm. Furthermore, leveraging the spatiotemporal gating properties of embedded phosphorescent materials, a dual&#8208;mode dynamic verification system is established, facilitating multidimensional information decryption via ultraviolet&#8208;triggered rapid visualization and controlled afterglow decay lasting up to 5 s. This study not only mitigates the inherent trade&#8208;off between mechanical durability and stimulus responsiveness in soft photonic crystals but also establishes a novel framework for multidimensional synergistic regulation across mechanical, optical, and temporal domains. These findings provide a transformative strategy for advancing next&#8208;generation dynamic encryption systems, intelligent sensing technologies, and adaptive photonic displays, paving the way for innovative applications in flexible photonic devices.

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Green&#8208;Synthesis of High Purity Pinacols and Amides by Continuous Tandem Photocatalysis via a Negative Carbon Emission Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem catalytic system consisting of two continuous&#8208;flow reactors (A and B) is developed to integrate CO2 photoreduction with photo&#8208;oxidative C&#8211;C coupling and photocatalytic carbonylation. In reactor A, immobilized CdS@PCN&#8208;Co enables gram&#8208;scale pinacol production with concurrent CO generation. The evolved CO is directly transferred to reactor B, where Pd/PCN&#8208;Zn catalyzed its selective (98%) conversion to DEET, a commercial pesticide.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction for practical applications confronts significant challenges, including the waste of oxidation power and the difficulty in isolating reduction products. Herein, a pre&#8208;coordination restriction strategy is presented to hierarchically assemble CdS quantum dots (QDs), cobalt sites and Zr6 clusters in one metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), resulting in the CdS@PCN&#8208;Co composite for simultaneous CO2 photoreduction and C&#8211;C coupling. Impressively, the yields of CO and pinacols with CdS@PCN&#8208;Co can reach 59.5 mmol&#183;g&#8315;&#185; (99.4% selectivity) and 56.2 mmol&#183;g&#8315;&#185; (95.3% selectivity), respectively, over six and seven times higher than those with the CdS/PCN&#8208;Co mixture (9.8 mmol&#8226;g&#8315;&#185; CO, 29.4% selectivity; 7.8 mmol&#8226;g&#8315;&#185; pinacols, 22.7% selectivity). The superior catalytic performance of CdS@PCN&#8208;Co can be ascribed to the synergy among encapsulated CdS QDs, Zr6 clusters and PCN&#8208;Co, where photogenerated electrons can efficiently transfer from CdS QDs to Co sites for selective CO generation while the remaining holes can oxidize the adsorbed 1&#8208;phenylethanol over Zr6 surface to facilitate C&#8211;C coupling. More impressively, the released CO can be immediately used for carbonylation photosynthesis by immobilizing CdS@PCN&#8208;Co and Pd/PCN&#8208;Zn in a continuous&#8208;flow system with two reactors, which simultaneously achieves gram&#8208;scale photosynthesis of high&#8208;purity pinacols and amides by continuous tandem photocatalysis.

         <title>Multidimensional Photopatterning of Heterogeneous Liquid&#8208;Crystal Superstructures Toward Higher&#8208;Level Information Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 37, September 18, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous liquid&#8208;crystal superstructure is proposed to activate higher optical dimensions in soft matter. Multilevel optical information is precisely encoded into the superstructure through a new strategy called multidimensional photopatterning. Consequently, near&#8208;field full&#8208;color printing and far&#8208;field full&#8208;color holography are achieved simultaneously with brightness controllability and spin selectivity. This facilitates the exquisite construction of LC superstructures and enlightens higher&#8208;dimensional optics.








Abstract
Soft matter, featuring superior flexibility and intriguing tunability, has shown enormous potential in sensors, soft robots, and light tailoring. However, limited by its inherent structural complexity, soft matter remains uncompetitive in multidimensional and high&#8208;density information optics. Herein, a heterogeneous liquid&#8208;crystal (LC) superstructure composed of interlocked nematic and chiral LCs is designed to achieve higher&#8208;dimensional light control. Optically multidimensional photopatterning with programmable UV polarization and dosage is proposed to precisely customize both transverse and longitudinal LC arrangements, bringing in a wide range of light&#8208;matter interactions within a single micrometer&#8208;thick film. The constructed heterogeneous LC superstructure not only enables simultaneous near&#8208;field full&#8208;color printing and far&#8208;field full&#8208;color holography but also boasts brightness controllability and polarization selectivity. This low&#8208;cost photonic structure enables a high information density of &#8776;1.6 million hybrid&#8208;dimensional optical data per square millimeter, unlocking new capabilities in optical storage, display, and encryption. This work creates an ingenious bond between advanced photopatterning technologies and higher&#8208;level optical informatics, and pioneers soft&#8208;matter&#8208;mediated full&#8208;dimensional optics.

         <title>Nucleophilic Redox Shuttle Surpasses the Efficiency Limitation of Oxygen Redox Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible nucleophilic redox shuttle is integrated into flexible rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries to regulate oxygen redox chemistry. The NRS mediates multielectron transfer, mitigates anode parasitic reactions, and stabilizes discharge/charge tri&#8208;phase interfaces, thereby achieving high energy efficiency, prolonged cycle life, and providing mechanistic insight into oxygen electrocatalysis in advanced metal&#8211;air systems.








Abstract
Oxygen redox is a promising route for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density electrochemical systems, but poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and bubble desorption at the gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid interface limit efficiency and stability. Here, the introduction of a reversible nucleophilic electrochemistry embedded in the oxygen redox reaction, known as the nucleophilic redox shuttle (NRS), is reported to develop a strategy that surpasses the energy efficiency limitations of pure oxygen redox. By incorporating the miscible ionic liquid 1&#8208;(3&#8208;aminopropyl)imidazole (APMID) into Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs), the OER during charging is replaced by a nucleophilic oxidation reaction (NOR) with lower free&#8208;energy barriers. This pathway boosts the cycling energy efficiency from 63.2% to 80.1%, surpassing most oxygen redox&#8211;based systems.&#160;Additionally, a Zn@Cu anode is used to restore nucleophiles during charging, maintaining a low voltage gap of 0.30&#160;V (compared to &#8776;0.69&#160;V for common ZABs) over 2100 h of cycling at 1 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2. The high reversibility of the nucleophilic reactions ensures its stable operation even in gel electrolyte, demonstrated by the integration with a wearable patch electrocardiogram detection. These findings establish NRS as a robust strategy to extend the efficiency and durability of oxygen redox systems, advancing their practical application in next&#8208;generation energy storage.

         <title>A Zero&#8208;Thermal Quenching Flexible Fiber for Visible Cellular Concentration Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional biosensors suffer thermal drift, limiting accuracy. Here, an innovative flexible optical fiber detector incorporating a novel phosphor Gd3ScGa4O12: Dy3&#8314; is developed, which exhibits zero thermal quenching (up to 200&#160;&#176;C) at 577 nm. This device achieves stable (&#916;x/y &lt; 0.003) and precise (200 &#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1) HbO2 concentration measurement. This work provides a breakthrough in reusable, temperature&#8208;resistant biosensing technology.








Abstract
The development of stable and precise visible light sources is crucial for advanced cellular analysis, yet current spectrophotometric systems face significant challenges, particularly temperature&#8208;dependent signal drift and decreased measurement accuracy. In this work, a novel yellow&#8208;emitting phosphor Gd3ScGa4O12: Dy3+ is developed, which demonstrates exceptional thermal stability with zero&#8208;thermal quenching (ZTQ) up to 200&#160;&#176;C. This remarkable performance is achieved through the strategic manipulation of trap&#8208;assisted thermoluminescence enhancement mechanisms. In addition, a flexible optical detector is developed for oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) concentration testing by incorporating Gd3ScGa4O12: Dy3+ in stretchable elastomer&#8208;based optical fiber. The fabricated device exhibits exceptional photoluminescence stability (near&#8208;zero chromaticity drift, &#916;x/y &lt; 0.003 from 10 to 40&#160;&#176;C), and promising measurement accuracy (200 &#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1). Tb3+/ Eu3+/ Pr3+ doped Gd3ScGa4O12 is also developed, which all perform favorable thermal stability. This finding not only provides a reliable and reusable cellular concentration detector but also establishes a ZTQ design framework for lanthanide&#8208;doped materials.

         <title>Quantitative Tactile Sensing of Surface Microstructures Through Time&#8208;Domain Analysis of Piezoelectric Twin Signals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A piezoelectric twin&#8208;film architecture enables self&#8208;deducing the scanning speed, allowing for quantitative and tactile sensing of surface microstructures without external motion control systems. It achieves over 99.2% accuracy across a 1&#8211;1000&#160;&#181;m height range, unlocking new possibilities for advanced tactile technologies in robotics, flexible electronics, and human&#8211;machine interfaces, as well as for in situ surface characterization methods.








Abstract
Tactile sensors enabling human&#8208;like behavior to identify surface microstructures are essential for humanoid robots to interact precisely with complex environments. Most existing approaches use materials responding to dynamic forces and rely on machine learning methods to distinguish various types of surface microstructures. Quantitatively profiling the surface microstructures is significant but challenging, especially under the requirement of eliminating external bulky motion&#8208;control systems. Here, a quantitative tactile surface profiling strategy is presented through time&#8208;domain analysis of the signal of a piezoelectric twin&#8208;film architecture. The architecture uses two parallel piezoelectric films with a fixed interlayer distance, generating twin voltage signals with a time delay, which is inversely proportional to the scanning speed, and consequently removes the need for motion control. The microstructure heights correlate with the peak voltages, whereas widths and edge profiles are derived from the temporal analysis of distinct signal features. Tactile and in situ measurement of surface microstructures is demonstrated with high accuracy (&gt;99.2%) over a broad height range of 1&#8211;1000&#160;&#181;m. Furthermore, in&#8208;line quality inspection during additive manufacturing is realized by quantitatively profiling the surface microstructures. This work will drive innovations in tactile technologies that emulate and potentially surpass human capabilities and advance in situ surface characterization methods.

         <title>Shapeshifting Nanocatalyst for CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;modal in situ characterization of Ag&#8208;Cu nanoparticles during CO2 photoreduction sheds light on dynamic transformations occurring during reaction. The Cu(core)&#8208;Ag(shell) nanoparticles present the Ag replacement by Cu atoms. Ag is trapped at the subsurface forming a Ag&#8208;Cu&#8208;O phase, and the nanoparticle spreads over the substrate. These transformations are responsible for the enhanced performance of Ag&#8208;Cu nanoparticles in the CO2 photoreduction.








Abstract
The conversion of CO2 into high&#8208;value chemicals through a photoreduction reaction in water is a promising route to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. Enhancing selectivity toward hydrocarbons or alcohols can be achieved by Ag&#8208;Cu alloys. However, the stabilized surface state created by Ag&#8208;Cu interactions is still poorly understood. In this work, multi&#8208;modal in situ X&#8208;ray experiments reveals underlying mechanisms and the evolution of Ag&#8208;Cu nanoparticles under CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) conditions. Both morphological and chemical changes of Ag and Cu species induced by diffusion mechanics are tracked during nanocatalyst operation. The initial spheroid Ag&#8208;Cu nanoparticles are composed of a Cu&#8208;rich shell and Ag&#8208;rich core. The reduction treatment promotes Ag migration toward the surface. During photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, Cu atoms migrate back to the surface, forming Ag&#8208;Cu&#8208;O species. The study observes the surface oxidation of Cu(0) to Cu+ and the presence of Ag at the sub&#8208;surface region. Furthermore, nanoparticles change their shape, decreasing their specific surface area, driven by Cu diffusion during the CO2 photoreduction reaction. The results provide invaluable insights into the dynamic restructuring of the catalyst under reaction conditions and into the active species responsible for CO2 conversion.

         <title>Click Chemistry&#8208;Inspired Fixation Catalysis for Long&#8208;Life Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A click&#8208;inspired molecular catalyst enables both iodine fixation and dynamic redox catalysis in aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. The Fe&#8208;Cp catalyst forms robust Fe&#9472;I bonds and promotes axial electron transfer, suppressing shuttle effects and accelerating reaction kinetics. This dual mechanism delivers ultralong cycling stability and high&#8208;capacity pouch cells.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries are promising candidates for high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective energy storage, yet their practical deployment is hindered by severe polyiodide shuttling and limited redox kinetics. To overcome this bottleneck at its core, a molecular&#8208;level fixation catalysis strategy&#8212;inspired by click chemistry principles is presented&#8212;that transcends the limitations of conventional adsorption and heterogeneous catalysis. Inspired by the selectivity and efficiency of click reactions, a Cp(Fe(CO)2)2&#8208;derived molecular catalyst (Fe&#8208;Cp) is designed that forms directional and robust Fe&#9472;I coordination bonds, locking iodine species into stable Fe&#8208;CpI complexes. Beyond anchoring, Fe&#8208;Cp uniquely enables axial electron transfer, facilitating reversible charge redistribution and dynamic iodine redox conversion beyond the reach of surface&#8208;confined systems. This dual&#8208;function mechanism not only suppresses the polyiodide shuttle but also dynamically regulates the electron redistribution at the catalytic interface, fundamentally enhancing reaction kinetics. Benefiting from this design, the Zn&#8211;I2 batteries deliver an exceptional cycling lifespan of 63&#160;000 cycles at 20 A g&#8722;1 with 95% capacity retention and &#8776;100% Coulombic efficiency. Remarkably, even under a high mass loading of 20&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 in pouch Zn&#8211;I2 cells, the system maintains a high areal capacity of 3.3 mAh cm&#8722;2 and &#8776;100% capacity retention even after 2000 cycles.

         <title>Manipulating Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Rechargeable Metal&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Fundamental Principles and Universal Methodologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review uncovers the commonalities of rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries in aspects of sulfur redox reactions (electrochemical fundamentals, reaction mechanisms, innate challenges, and key influence factors) and advanced targeted methodologies to boost sulfur redox reactions in rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries. The existing shackles confronted by rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries and their future development directions are prospected as well.








Abstract
The profound understanding of chemical reaction essence and kinetic behaviors is crucial to develop rechargeable battery technologies. Based on multi&#8208;electron conversion, sulfur redox reactions hold great promise for establishing low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, and longstanding rechargeable batteries. However, the sulfur redox reaction processes suffer from a series of common daunting cruxes, leading to incomplete redox reactions and inferior battery performance when working in rechargeable batteries. These innate challenges of sulfur redox reactions include poor sulfur reactivity, sluggish charge transmission, severe polysulfide shuttling, high redox energy barrier, and undesirable reaction reversibility. Accordingly, it becomes a consensus to effectively manipulate sulfur redox kinetics for developing competent rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries. Herein, this review centers on sulfur redox reactions, within the compass of understanding electrochemical fundamentals, principles, thermodynamics, dynamics, and kinetics as well as emphatically presents universal methodologies to boost sulfur redox reaction kinetics in rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries. The unique viewpoint on sulfur redox reactions in rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries can provide a deepened understanding of sulfur electrochemistry and lead to new insights into the sulfur cathode designs and battery configurations, thus accelerating reaction kinetics of sulfur cathodes and promoting practical progress on high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery technologies.

         <title>Thermionics in Topological Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermionics is one of the fundamental energy conversion mechanisms in solid state systems. Recent development in topological materials opens new avenues in developing thermionic systems and devices. Due to the linear energy dispersion and topological protection of charge transport, these new materials are promising candidates for high efficiency thermionic energy generation, cooling and other applications.









Abstract
Thermionic emission is fundamental to many technologies and devices, including thermionic energy converters, X&#8208;ray tubes, scanning electron microscopes, and transmission electron microscopes. The discovery of topological materials, particularly graphene, has significantly advanced thermionics research. Thermionic emission in these materials deviates from the Richardson&#8208;Dushman equation due to their linear energy dispersion. Various models are developed to accurately describe thermionic emission. Graphene, with its dangling bond&#8208;free surface, can be stacked either vertically or laterally with materials to form heterostructures. The Schottky barrier height at the interface of heterostructures can be tuned from a few millielectronvolts to several electronvolts by selecting appropriate materials or adjusting the Fermi level of graphene. This low and tunable barrier height gives rise to a great potential in developing thermionic energy converters and photodetectors. While free&#8208;standing single&#8208;layer graphene exhibits high electron mobility, its thermionic emission capability is constrained by the low density of states. This constraint can be alleviated by using 3D Dirac materials, which also possess linear energy dispersion. Thermionic emission in 3D Dirac materials is further enhanced by the emergence of nodal&#8208;ring semimetals and Weyl semimetals that exhibit linear&#8208;like energy dispersion. This review highlights recent progress in thermionic emission and devices in graphene structures and other topological materials.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Materials for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimulus&#8208;responsive materials (SRMs) hold great promise for use in a wide range of biomedical applications. This review covers four stimulus modalities, namely, electrical, optical, magnetic, and ultrasound, and their associated SRMs. It provides a summary of the materials in each modality, their development, and current research perspectives. This review also provides a detailed analysis of the key challenges for translating these SRM technologies into clinical use.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials (SRMs) are materials that change properties when exposed to external or internal stimuli. They respond to physiological changes within cells and tissues, as well as external triggers including light, magnetic fields, ultrasound, and electricity. In medicine, SRMs have diverse applications spanning drug delivery, tissue engineering, and diagnostics. They enable targeted drug release at specific times and locations, facilitate tissue generation and repair, and enhance disease detection capabilities. Beyond medical uses, SRMs are employed in smart coatings and artificial muscle systems. The breadth of biomedical applications for SRMs is extensive, generating substantial research into novel and innovative material development. Challenges in creating safe and efficient SRMs for medical treatments have driven innovative approaches in two key areas: functionalizing and modifying naturally occurring materials and developing new synthetic nanomaterials. The complexity of producing effective SRMs has necessitated creative solutions to overcome safety and efficiency barriers in medical applications. This ongoing research continues to expand the potential therapeutic uses of these responsive materials. This review examines literature focused on SRM development for external stimuli responses, particularly light, magnetic fields, ultrasound, and electricity, rather than covering the complete spectrum of stimuli&#8208;responsive applications.

Challenges in creating safe and efficient SRMs for medical treatments have driven innovative approaches in two key areas: functionalizing and modifying naturally occurring materials and developing new synthetic nanomaterials. The complexity of producing effective SRMs has necessitated creative solutions to overcome safety and efficiency barriers in medical applications. This ongoing research continues to expand the potential therapeutic uses of these responsive materials. This review examines literature focused on SRM development for external stimuli responses, particularly light, magnetic fields, ultrasound, and electricity, rather than covering the complete spectrum of stimuli-responsive applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Printing of Conducting Polymer Hydrogels for Electrostimulation&#8208;Assisted Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights nanosized inherently conducting polymers (ICPs) as promising ink constituents for 3D printing of conducting hydrogel (CH)&#8208;based electrostimulation (ES) devices. ICP&#8208;based ink formulation, 3D printing, and solidification strategies are discussed, along with the application of 3D&#8208;printed ICP&#8208;based CHs as ES platforms for regulating cell activities such as proliferation, differentiation, and maturation, ultimately supporting tissue regeneration.








Abstract
Electrostimulation (ES) is at the cutting edge of contemporary medicine, effectively promoting tissue regeneration and wound healing by applying small electrical cues to stimulate specific cellular responses. The 3D printing of electronically conducting hydrogels (CHs) offers a transformative strategy for developing ES platforms. These hydrogels integrate conformal, customizable geometries, mechanical compliance, adequate electrical conductivity, and biocompatibility, enabling seamless interaction with native tissues. Nanosized inherently conducting polymers (ICPs) are promising conductive ink constituents for 3D printing, owing to their straightforward preparation, electrical conductivity, and printability. However, 3D printing of ICP&#8208;based CHs faces several challenges. Controlling the tendency of ICPs to aggregate and achieving the rheological properties required by specific 3D printing modalities are vital for achieving uniform and precise printed structures. Furthermore, post&#8208;printing solidification of ICPs often uses harsh curing conditions, e.g., high temperatures or toxic solvents, rendering encapsulation of biological components and cells infeasible. This review critically assesses strategies for synthesizing ICP nanostructures, preparing ICP&#8208;based CHs, and applicable 3D printing techniques. Progress in tissue regeneration utilizing 3D&#8208;printed ICP&#8208;based CHs as ES devices is highlighted, along with future perspectives regarding the development of bio&#8208;functional ICPs and integrated powering mechanisms for closed&#8208;loop ES systems.

         <title>Playing Hard with Si: Challenges and Opportunities for New Materials in Radiation Therapy Dosimetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon has been a cornerstone material of radiation therapy dosimetry for many decades, providing somewhat unchallenged performance. However, there are caveats to its use, requiring complex designs and, often, correction factors to provide accurate measurements. Alternative materials may provide previously unachievable capabilities, ushering in a new generation of radiation detectors suitable for the ever&#8208;changing landscape of radiation&#160;therapy.








Abstract
The sophistication and diversity of radiation medicine modalities continue to increase significantly in both cancer imaging and cancer radiation therapy. With over 50% of cancer patients receiving some form of radiation procedure as part of their cancer management plan, the importance and impact of quantitative radiation detector systems for quality assurance in radiation medicine should not be underestimated. There are numerous challenges faced by silicon&#8208;based detector systems used for dosimetry in radiation therapy that are discussed in this review article, especially considering emerging radiation therapy modalities that incorporate ultra&#8208;high irradiation dose&#8208;rates (e.g., MRT, FLASH&#8208;RT, VHEE&#8208;RT), while others utilize mixed radiation fields (e.g., proton&#8208;RT, heavy ion therapy) or diffusion&#8208;based dose delivery techniques (e.g., Alpha DaRT). Such challenges create exciting opportunities for new radiation detector materials. This concise review paper explores the role of silicon in radiation detection applications and highlights the challenges it faces in achieving optimal performance. Additionally, this review discusses new materials that are emerging as strong candidates for the next generation of radiation detectors, emphasizing both the opportunities and challenges associated with these&#160;materials.

Integration of computational and experimental approaches for deciphering the underlying mechanism of biomolecular condensates and potential biomaterials&#160;design (Created in Biorender. Raza, Z. (2025) https://BioRender.com/irgmeqi).









Abstract
Biomolecular condensates, a ubiquitous class of biomaterials found in living cells, have been shown to be responsible for key physiological processes, such as gene regulation, signal transduction, and stress response. Since their discovery, extensive efforts have been devoted to this field to better understand the underlying mechanisms using both computational and experimental techniques. While great progress has been achieved, the key challenges still exist. With advancements in computational power and methods and improvements in experimental precision, the gap between computation and experimentation is gradually narrowing. By integrating these approaches, researchers can elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing biomolecular condensates. This review summarizes the recent progress in utilizing computational and experimental techniques to study biomolecular condensates. Detailed discussions are provided on the key advantages and limitations of each technique, along with their successful applications to specific systems. Moreover, further discussions are focused on the possibility of utilizing biomolecular condensates as a versatile platform for drug delivery and novel bioreactor design with the help of these techniques. Finally, future directions are outlined for technique development to better understand the role of biomolecular condensates in health and disease and enable their applications as tunable&#160;biomaterials.

         <title>Separator Engineering for Sodium Metal Batteries: Challenges, Rational Design and Recent Modification Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers advances in sodium metal battery separators, focusing on interfacial stabilization, dendrite suppression, and ion transport. It analyzes diverse materials, proposes comprehensive evaluation methods, and discusses simulations and future directions for high&#8208;performance, safe, and practical separators.








Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have emerged as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems, leveraging their high theoretical capacity and the natural abundance of Na resources. Nevertheless, critical challenges, including dendritic growth, side reactions, and pronounced volume fluctuations during cycling, continue to impede their commercialization. Conventional separators, including polyolefin or glass fiber types, suffer from poor wettability, uneven ion flux, and a rough surface. To tackle these challenges, functional separator engineering encompassing interfacial chemistry regulation, multiscale structural design, and hybrid integration of advanced materials has demonstrated remarkable progress in regulating Na&#8314; flux, stabilizing SEI, and suppressing dendrite propagation. This review systematically provides a comprehensive summary of recent developments in separator engineering for SMBs, including modified polyolefin separators, enhanced glass fiber frameworks, cellulose&#8208;based separators, MOFs/COFs&#8208;based, and emerging separators. In addition, a comprehensive electrochemical evaluation framework encompassing CE in half&#8208;cells is proposed, the lifespan of symmetric cells, full cell performance, and safety validation to assess practical applicability. Furthermore, computational simulations for mechanism elucidation and predictive design, as well as future separator perspectives, have been also discussed to guide the development of next&#8208;generation separators for high&#8208;performance and commercially viable SMBs.

     alt="Separator Engineering for Sodium Metal Batteries: Challenges, Rational Design and Recent Modification Strategies"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review covers advances in sodium metal battery separators, focusing on interfacial stabilization, dendrite suppression, and ion transport. It analyzes diverse materials, proposes comprehensive evaluation methods, and discusses simulations and future directions for high-performance, safe, and practical separators.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation energy storage systems, leveraging their high theoretical capacity and the natural abundance of Na resources. Nevertheless, critical challenges, including dendritic growth, side reactions, and pronounced volume fluctuations during cycling, continue to impede their commercialization. Conventional separators, including polyolefin or glass fiber types, suffer from poor wettability, uneven ion flux, and a rough surface. To tackle these challenges, functional separator engineering encompassing interfacial chemistry regulation, multiscale structural design, and hybrid integration of advanced materials has demonstrated remarkable progress in regulating Na&#8314; flux, stabilizing SEI, and suppressing dendrite propagation. This review systematically provides a comprehensive summary of recent developments in separator engineering for SMBs, including modified polyolefin separators, enhanced glass fiber frameworks, cellulose-based separators, MOFs/COFs-based, and emerging separators. In addition, a comprehensive electrochemical evaluation framework encompassing CE in half-cells is proposed, the lifespan of symmetric cells, full cell performance, and safety validation to assess practical applicability. Furthermore, computational simulations for mechanism elucidation and predictive design, as well as future separator perspectives, have been also discussed to guide the development of next-generation separators for high-performance and commercially viable SMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Polarized Antiferromagnets for Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in anomalous and spin transport phenomena in spin&#8208;polarized antiferromagnets. Key effects&#8212;including the anomalous Hall, Nernst, and magneto&#8208;optical effects&#8212;are discussed across various antiferromagnetic platforms. The roles of spin texture, symmetry, and interlayer interactions are emphasized, offering new opportunities for spintronic applications beyond conventional ferromagnets.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarized antiferromagnets (AFMs), including altermagnets, noncollinear AFMs, and 2D layer&#8208;polarized AFMs, have emerged as transformative materials for next&#8208;generation spintronic and optoelectronic technologies. These systems uniquely combine spin&#8208;polarized electronic states with vanishing net magnetization, enabling ultrafast spin dynamics, high&#8208;density integration, and robustness against stray magnetic fields. Their unconventional symmetry&#8208;breaking mechanisms&#8212;governed by crystal symmetry, chiral spin textures, or interlayer potential control&#8212;give rise to emergent phenomena previously exclusive to ferromagnets: nonrelativistic spin&#8208;momentum locking, spontaneous anomalous transport phenomena, gate&#8208;tunable magneto&#8208;optical responses, nonrelativistic spin&#8208;polarized current, and tunneling magnetoresistance effect. This review systematically examines the fundamental principles linking symmetry, band topology, and transport properties across these material classes, synthesizing recent breakthroughs in both theory and experiment. Critical challenges are further identified in achieving room&#8208;temperature functionality, scalable N&#233;el vector control, and coherent spin&#8208;current manipulation, while outlining pathways to harness these materials for ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power memory, spin&#8208;logic architectures, and quantum information technologies.

         <title>Atmospheric Water Sorption&#8211;Desorption as a Pathway for Green Energy Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive discussion on the energy conversion from the process of sorption and desorption of water molecules. By detailing the mechanism studies, guidelines are provided for the performance enhancement in the sequence of energy conversion. It provides insights into understanding the recent advances of hydrovoltaic technology and leads to future improvement of the harnessed energy.








Abstract
Beyond the indispensable resource for living creatures, water has recently been explored as an eco&#8208;friendly source of energy, known as the hydrovoltaic technology. Of significant interest, the cyclic sorption/desorption of water molecules physically and chemically induces the gaseous/liquid&#8211;solid interactions with the substances, demonstrating potential for harnessing electricity. Existing efforts have focused on materials engineering and structural design of the energy generators, enhancing the generated electricity for real&#8208;life applications. Despite the substantial achievements, the principal interpretation of the process from water molecules to electricity establishes the foundation and serves as the guidance for device modification and performance enhancement. Herein, this review thoroughly discusses the energy conversion, from the introduction of water molecules to the generation of electricity, starting with an understanding of the sorption/desorption of water molecules. Mechanisms in charge creation from the interaction are then elucidated, where water molecules themselves serve as ions or stimulate ion dissociation from the substances. It continues with an overview of the existing advancements in sorption/desorption&#8208;induced electricity generation and practical demonstrations of the developed electricity. Based on the conversion procedure, insights for upcoming generator designs are proposed subsequently. Finally, present challenges to be addressed and perspectives on future development in the sorption/desorption&#8208;induced electricity are discussed in detail.

         <title>Sustainable Hard Carbon for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Precursor Design and Scalable Production Roadmaps</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review emphasizes sodium&#8208;ion batteries' potential, highlighting hard carbon anodes, precursor selection by volatility, and sustainable strategies (e.g., bamboo&#8208;based materials) for scalable, high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) emerge as a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the abundant and widely distributed nature of sodium resources. Hard carbon anodes, characterized by their pseudo&#8208;graphitic layered structures and nanoporosity, are key to achieving high&#8208;performance SIBs. However, the commercialization of hard carbon is hindered by significant challenges in precursor design, carbonization optimization, and sustainability. This review focuses on the critical role of precursor selection and introduces a classification system based on volatile content. High&#8208;volatility biomass precursors, such as bamboo, require pretreatments like acid/alkali leaching or hydrothermal processing to optimize pyrolysis. Medium&#8208;volatility resins and plastics benefit from crosslinking strategies, while low&#8208;volatility materials such as biochar and petroleum coke rely on nanochannel engineering to improve sodium storage performance. Bamboo&#8208;based precursors are highlighted as a promising pathway due to their renewability and environmental advantages, though challenges such as impurity control and structural engineering persist. By integrating precursor design with carbonization strategies, this review provides a comprehensive framework for understanding microstructural regulation and performance enhancement. The insights presented offer valuable guidance for developing scalable and sustainable approaches to produce high&#8208;performance hard carbon materials, paving the way for the next generation of SIB technologies.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Materials for Water Splitting: An Atomic Nanoengineering Approach to Sustainable Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
Green hydrogen production via water electrolysis is pivotal for achieving energy sustainability. However, the inherently sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction impede the progress of water&#8208;splitting technology. Recently, high&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) composed of at least five elements have garnered significant attention as promising electrocatalysts for water splitting, owing to their compositional versatility, structural robustness, and synergistic interactions among elements. This review comprehensively explores the development of HEMs, tracing their emergence and structural evolution via atomic nanoengineering strategies (i.e., from bulk to nanostructuring, from random distributions to relatively ordered architectures, from bare HEMs to reconstructed HEMs, from intact HEMs to defective structures, from pristine HEMs to functionalized variants) and revealing how these evolutionary steps contribute to the properties and enhance catalytic performance in water splitting. The fundamental roles of individual elements (e.g., active sites, promoters, stabilizers) in shaping the structure, stability, and catalytic activity of HEMs are examined, laying a foundation for the rational design of efficient HEM&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The review also highlights recent advances in HEM&#8208;based catalysts for water splitting, emphasizing desirable properties and elemental contributions. Finally, the remaining challenges and perspectives on the future directions of HEM&#8208;based materials in energy conversion technologies are discussed.

         <title>Paving the Way for Next&#8208;Generation All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries: Dry Electrode Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dry&#8208;electrode process offers a highly efficient solution to the key challenges faced by all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, including complex processing, high CO2 emissions, interfacial instability, toxicity, and limited energy density. This perspective outlines the critical challenges of implementing the dry electrode process from material fundamentals to processing, providing a guiding framework to bridge current research and future development.








Abstract
For the effective implementation of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), the progress of dry electrode technology is essential. Considering the urgent challenges posed by global warming, advancing affordable ASSBs is crucial for reliable and sustainable electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems. Despite the substantial progress in research on solid electrolytes, ASSBs continue to face fundamental challenges, including high manufacturing costs, considerable environmental impact, and insufficient interfacial stability. The dry electrode processing methodology presents a highly promising alternative to conventional wet electrode fabrication techniques, effectively addressing these limitations while facilitating scalable production capabilities. Although research on dry&#8208;electrode&#8208;based ASSBs has gained significant traction in recent years, the overall challenges are recognized as intricate due to the presence of multiple electrode components with diverse requirements and limitations. For the comprehensive review, the dry processing approach is systematically examined from the perspective of materials science and electrode processing. An electrode&#8208;component&#8208;level framework is adopted as well. Furthermore, crucial technical barriers are identified, and prospective research directions for the advancement of solid&#8208;state battery technology are delineated.

         <title>Designing an Anionic Layer in Low&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes to Promote In&#8208;Plane Ion Diffusion for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optimization model for zinc anodes centered on anion traction in a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte system is proposed. The fluoride&#8208;ion enriched interfacial layer on the zinc anode surface enhances the concentration of Zn2+ in a lateral direction through electrostatic forces, thereby facilitating horizontal zinc plating. Moreover, the repulsion between the anion&#8208;rich layer and sulfate ions can effectively inhibit the formation of byproducts.








Abstract
In contrast to high&#8208;concentration electrolyte systems, low&#8208;concentration electrolytes provide a cost&#8208;effective strategy to advance the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, such electrolytes frequently exhibit severe dendrite formation caused by localized Zn2+ concentration gradients, which critically compromise the cycling stability and operational safety of AZIBs. In this work, an innovative approach is proposed that involves the in situ construction of a fluoride&#8208;ion (F&#8722;) enriched interfacial layer on zinc anodes. This method facilitates in&#8208;plane diffusion of zinc ions at the anode interface, resulting in accelerated lateral growth of zinc deposits rather than dendritic formation. The results indicate that this orientated growth is closely associated with an anionic layer that effectively reduces random and irregular deposition as well as undesirable side reactions. The proposed system exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance within a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte framework, achieving a battery lifespan exceeding 1500 h at a current density of 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, it maintains Coulombic efficiency above 99% after 800 h of cycling. Additionally, the Na2V6O16&#183;3H2O (NVO)//Zn full battery incorporating this additive showcases enhanced long&#8208;term cycling performance and improved capacity retention, further confirming the excellent reversibility of the plating/stripping processes for zinc anode.

         <title>Tailoring Robust Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect via Entropy&#8208;Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>

Bandstructure renormalization, without (w/o) spin&#8208;orbit interaction (SOI) (left) and with SOI (right), in the low&#8208;energy Dirac bands of zero&#8208;entropy (purple) and entropic (green) VCl3 monolayer (ML) with long&#8208;range ordering (LRO). 








Abstract
The development of quantum materials and the tailoring of their functional properties is of fundamental interest in materials science. Here, a new design concept is proposed for the robust quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect via entropy engineering in 2D magnets. As a prototypical example, the configurational entropy of monolayer transition metal trihalide VCl3 is manipulated by incorporating four different transition&#8208;metal cations [Ti,Cr,Fe,Co] into the honeycomb structure made of vanadium, such that all in&#8208;plane mirror symmetries, inversion and/or roto&#8208;inversion are broken. Monolayer VCl3 is a ferromagnetic Dirac half&#8208;metal&#160;in which spin&#8208;polarized Dirac dispersion at valley momenta is accompanied by bulk states at the &#915;&#8208;point and thus the spin&#8208;orbit interaction&#8208;driven QAH&#160;phase does not exhibit fully gapped bulk band dispersion. Entropy&#8208;driven bandstructure renormalization, especially band flattening in combination with red&#8208; and blue&#8208;shifts at different momenta of the Brillouin zone and crystal&#8208;field effects, transforms Dirac half&#8208;metal to a Dirac spin&#8208;gapless semiconductor and leads to a robust QAH phase with fully gapped bulk band dispersion and, thus, a purely topological edge state transport without mixing with dissipative bulk channels. These findings provide a paradigm for designing entropy&#8208;engineered 2D materials for the realization of robust QAH effect and quantum device&#160;applications.

         <title>Fluoroether Design Enables High&#8208;Voltage All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A durable high&#8208;voltage all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte is developed by incorporating a novel organic/inorganic hybrid porous component with a fluoroether design. Due to the weakened Li+ coordination structure, the proposed high&#8208;voltage SSE exhibits durable antioxidation. The optimized electrolytes show ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance in Li||Li cells, LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||Li cells, and LiMn0.6Fe0.4PO4||Li cells even under 4.5V.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;voltage all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) holds transformative potential for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies but remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a new prototype design is presented that integrates fluorinated ether segments into the traditional oxide nanocomposite phase, enabling poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based composite electrolytes with exceptional anti&#8208;oxidation durability and enhance overall electrochemical performance. Through a combination of experimental and computational analyses, it is demonstrated that the superior performance is attributed to the formation of reconstructed Li&#8314; solvation with weakly coordinating environments. The proposed formulation exhibits excellent Li&#8208;metal compatibility, enabling stable cycling in symmetric Li||Li cells for over 9500 h. The solid&#8208;state electrolyte also exhibits outstanding high&#8208;voltage stability with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes, extending the operational voltage from 4.0 to 4.5 V. Moreover, the LiMn1&#8208;xFexPO4||Li cells have delivered remarkable cycling performance, achieving over 1200 cycles with 99% capacity retention after 500 cycles. This work establishes an innovative platform for designing electrolytes with superior antioxidation properties and enhance structural durability, paving the way for the advancement of high&#8208;voltage all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Developing high-voltage all-solid-state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) holds transformative potential for next-generation energy storage technologies but remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a new prototype design is presented that integrates fluorinated ether segments into the traditional oxide nanocomposite phase, enabling poly(ethylene oxide)-based composite electrolytes with exceptional anti-oxidation durability and enhance overall electrochemical performance. Through a combination of experimental and computational analyses, it is demonstrated that the superior performance is attributed to the formation of reconstructed Li&#8314; solvation with weakly coordinating environments. The proposed formulation exhibits excellent Li-metal compatibility, enabling stable cycling in symmetric Li||Li cells for over 9500 h. The solid-state electrolyte also exhibits outstanding high-voltage stability with LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes, extending the operational voltage from 4.0 to 4.5 V. Moreover, the LiMn&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;||Li cells have delivered remarkable cycling performance, achieving over 1200 cycles with 99% capacity retention after 500 cycles. This work establishes an innovative platform for designing electrolytes with superior antioxidation properties and enhance structural durability, paving the way for the advancement of high-voltage all-solid-state lithium metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling the Impact of Electrosorbed Ions on the Scaling Behavior of Fast&#8208;Charging Dynamics of Nanoporous Electrodes Toward Digital Design of Iontronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrosorbed ions under nanoconfinement (see TOC figure) critically reshape electrochemical potentials and impact ion transport in porous electrodes. By integrating modified Poisson&#8211;Nernst&#8211;Planck simulations with multilayered graphene membrane experiments, this study establishes a scaling relation and reveals electrosorption&#8208;enhanced transport, offering a computationally efficient framework for designing high&#8208;performance, fast&#8208;charging electrochemical and iontronic devices.








Abstract
Electrolyte&#8208;filled nanoporous electrodes with fast&#8208;charging capability are critical for advanced energy storage and iontronic devices. However, experiments and simulations consistently show that increasing electrode thickness degrades performance by limiting ion access to effective electrode/electrolyte interfaces, especially under fast&#8208;charging conditions. While often attributed to sluggish ion transport, the underlying mechanisms and the quantitative link between thickness and performance remain unclear due to complex pore structures and nanoconfined ion dynamics. Here, using multilayered graphene membranes as a model system, modified Poisson&#8211;Nernst&#8211;Planck simulations with experiments are combined to reveal how electrosorbed ions reshape local electrical and chemical potentials, particularly as the surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio increases with reduced pore size. It is shown that electrosorbed ions substantially influence the scaling behavior of capacitance across electrode thicknesses, causing marked deviations from classical transmission line models as pores approach nanometric dimensions. Despite the complexity introduced by nanoconfinement, introducing a correction factor enables capacitance&#8211;scan rate relationships to collapse into a unified curve across various electrode architectures, allowing computationally efficient design of high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging electrochemical and iontronic devices. This work highlights the unique role of 2D nanomaterials as a versatile platform for bridging experiments and theory to address long&#8208;standing challenges in ion transport dynamics.

         <title>Ultrathin Mesoporous Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets</title>

A bottom&#8208;up interface&#8208;directed co&#8208;assembly strategy enables the synthesis of ultrathin 2D mesoporous UiO&#8208;66(Ce) nanosheets with tunable thickness and uniform mesopores. The enhanced mass transport and accessible active sites significantly improve performance, highlighting the synergistic effects of 2D morphology and mesopores in metal&#8208;organic frameworks for applications in environmental remediation.








Abstract
Designing 2D mesoporous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets to overcome the limitations of bulk MOF counterparts, with a focus on enabling smooth mass transport, presents an attractive yet challenging endeavor. Here, a novel bottom&#8208;up interface&#8208;directed co&#8208;assembly method is presented for the synthesis of ultrathin 2D mesoporous UiO&#8208;66(Ce) nanosheets. The method utilizes an interface&#8208;directed co&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic perfluorooctanoic acid&#8208;induced lipid bilayers and spherical micelles from PS&#8208;b&#8208;PEO block copolymers to form unique 2D sandwich&#8208;like assemblies that guide the creation of 2D mesoporous UiO&#8208;66(Ce). The resultant 2D mesoporous UiO&#8208;66(Ce), with &#8776;23&#160;nm pore diameters and a thickness that can be tuned from 3 to 150&#160;nm, represents a substantial advancement in the application of MOFs for environmental remediation. As a model reaction, the U(VI) photoreduction benefits from the through&#8208;mesopores of its 2D morphology, which are absent in previously reported UiO&#8208;66(Ce), as they shorten the diffusion path, thereby improving mass transport and accessibility to active sites. This report demonstrates the significant role of existing mesopores in MOFs and the shape control of MOFs.

         <title>Constructing Asymmetric Sn&#8208;Cu&#8208;C Interface via Defective Carbon Trapped Atomic Clusters for Efficient Neutral Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work constructs asymmetric Sn&#8208;Cu&#8208;C interface via anchoring SnCu atomic clusters on carbon defects. Such as&#8208;synthesized SnCu&#8208;DG catalyst achieves a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency (99.5%) and a record intrinsic activity of 2.61 &#215; 10&#8722;17 mmol h&#8722;1 siteCu&#8722;1 at neutral electrolyte condition. This work reveals that the electronic asymmetry enhanced by carbon defects is the key for multi&#8208;step electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;atom cluster (MACs) catalysts have recently attracted significant research interest for their potential to catalyze multi&#8208;electron reactions through cooperative interactions among adjacent active sites. However, the controllable synthesis of MACs and the electrocatalytic mechanism understanding of their synergistic effects remain challenging. Herein, we develop a defect engineering strategy to anchor bimetallic SnCu atomic clusters at defective graphene (SnCu&#8208;DG) via carbon defect&#8208;mediated atomic trapping, wherein edge defects act as confined reactors for cluster nucleation. Taking nitrate reduction as an example, the SnCu&#8208;DG catalyst achieves a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency (99.5%) at neutral electrolyte condition, accompanied by a record intrinsic activity of 2.61 &#215; 10&#8722;17 mmol h&#8722;1 siteCu&#8722;1, surpassing Cu&#8208;DG and SnCu&#8208;G counterparts by 16.0&#8208; and 7.8&#8208;fold, respectively. X&#8208;ray adsorption spectra and theoretical calculations reveal the electrons transfer between Cu and carbon defect sites while Sn incorporation intensifies asymmetric charge polarization across the Sn&#8208;Cu&#8208;C interface. This dual modulation collaboratively optimizes the catalytic microenvironment, simultaneously enhancing *NO2&#8722; adsorption, accelerating water dissociation kinetics, and breaking the intrinsic linear scaling between intermediate adsorption and hydrogenation.

         <title>The Future of MXene Fibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective explores the diverse applications of MXene fibers, including those often overlooked in fiber&#8208;focused studies. It emphasizes the critical need to address challenges in synthesis, scalability, and long&#8208;term stability to unlock their full potential in real&#8208;world applications. 









Abstract
Since the first report on MXene&#8208;coated fibers in 2017, the field has grown rapidly, with over 1500 publications on fiber&#8208;related advancements. Improved understanding of MXene's colloidal dispersions has led to new fabrication techniques, resulting in fibers with exceptional electrical conductivity and electrochemical properties. These fibers show promise in energy storage, wearable electronics, motion and strain sensors, and electromagnetic interference shielding. Ongoing research is focused on improving their mechanical properties and fabrication methods, as well as new applications. As new MXene compositions and their properties are discovered, the field continues to open new avenues for innovation in functional fibers and textiles enabled using MXenes. This perspective explores the broad applications of MXene fibers, often overlooked in fiber&#8208;focused reviews, and emphasizes the need to address gaps in synthesis, scalability, and long&#8208;term performance to fully realize their potential.

         <title>3D Printing for Neural Repair: Bridging the Gap in Regenerative Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective article discusses how 3D bioprinting is advancing the development of neural tissue models and implants. It highlights recent progress in fabricating complex, multicellular neural constructs, examines current technical barriers, and outlines future applications in disease modeling, neurotoxicity testing, and regenerative therapies. Bioprinting offers new opportunities for personalized approaches to neurological repair.








Abstract
Neurological disorders impose a substantial global health burden, compounded by the limited regenerative capacity of neural tissues and the absence of curative therapies. 3D bioprinting offers a transformative tool to model, replace, and regenerate neural tissues through the precise spatial organization of cells and biomaterials. In this perspective article, recent advances are examined in: i) the development of in vitro neural platforms for disease modeling and drug screening; ii) bioprinted acellular scaffolds designed to guide endogenous neural repair; and iii) cell&#8208;laden constructs that aim to replace or reconstruct damaged neural circuits. Key translational challenges are critically evaluated, including vascularization, immune integration, functional maturation, and replicating the complex cytoarchitectures of native neural tissues. Highlighting representative preclinical studies and emerging biofabrication technologies, we discuss how innovations in biomaterials, scaffold design, stem cell biology, and neuroengineering are converging to overcome existing limitations. Through tailored strategies and interdisciplinary collaboration, 3D bioprinting is poised to redefine therapeutic paradigms and drive the development of next&#8208;generation, personalized regenerative therapies for neurological diseases and injuries.

Stable Fuel Cells
In article number 2504059, Hanuel Jin, Hyesung Jo, Yongsoo Yang, Dong Won Chun, Sung Jong Yoo, and co&#8208;workers present the synthesis of dome&#8208;hollow NiPt nanocatalysts incorporating ordered Ni3Pt5 phases via ultrasound&#8208;assisted atomic transposition at room temperature. Atomic ordering within multi&#8208;grained structure effectively suppresses metal dissolution in chemical and electrochemical environments, enabling high catalytic activity and long&#8208;term durability in PEMFCs under both light&#8208;duty and heavy&#8208;duty operations.

CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol over Earth&#8208;Abundant Catalysts
Hybrid Cu/Cu2P2O7 catalysts, formed by discharging Li&#8208;ion batteries, steer CO2 electroreduction decisively toward methanol, a key chemical for a sustainable future. The noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free hybrids achieve Faradaic efficiencies of 48.8 % in KHCO3 and 70.1 % in CsHCO3, operate steadily for 48 h, and sustain &gt; 100 mA cm&#8722;2 on gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes. More details can be found in article number 2501021 by Aloysius Soon, Jongsoon Kim, Jungki Ryu, and co&#8208;workers.

Novel Strain Indicator
In article number 2419414, Mun Seok Jeong and co&#8208;workers identify a new strain indicator in monolayer WSe2 using tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy. The strain sensitivity of the newly revealed Raman&#8208;inactive out&#8208;of&#8208;plane A2&#8243;(&#915;) mode was clearly demonstrated through both experimental and theoretical approaches. Specifically, density functional theory (DFT)&#8208;based analysis elucidating the origin of selection rule relaxation (attributed to strain&#8208;induced polarizability changes) provides robust support for establishing this mode as a novel phonon&#8208;based strain indicator.

Interdisciplinary Food Nanozymology
In article number 2505552, Lunjie Huang, Da&#8208;Wen Sun, and co&#8208;workers introduce the concept of food nanozymology as an emerging interdisciplinary field that bridges nanotechnology with food enzymology. By harnessing the tunable catalytic activity, robustness, and multifunctionality of nanozymes, the study explores their potential to address critical limitations of traditional enzymes, such as instability, high production costs, and limited scalability. This work provides a comprehensive framework for applying nanozymes across the food supply chain.

Bioinspired Heterogeneous Spheres
Inspired by the morphology and helical motion of Phacus helicoides, millimeter&#8208;sized spheres with an inner helical structure can imitate the micro&#8208;mixing and metabolic processes, including the adsorption, catalysis, and release capacity of Phacus helicoides. They can effectively absorb the glucose, catalyzed glucose, and eventually released the hypoglycemic drugs. More details can be found in article number 2504878 by Tao Chen, Chaobo Huang and co&#8208;workers.

Hydrogel&#8208;Based Synthetic Chromatophores
In article number 2505104, Stephen A. Morin and co&#8208;workers use dyed arrays of microscale hydrogels to emulate biological chromatophores found in cephalopods. These synthetic chromatophores expand and contract when stimulated, enabling skins with dynamic colors and patterns. By combining the optical and mechanical properties of the chromatophores, the team produced actuation systems that signal their environmental condition through color and morphology, simultaneously.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nano&#8208;Islands: Unlocking New Horizons in Catalytic Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom nano&#8208;islands (SANIs) are innovative confined&#8208;space single&#8208;atom systems composed of single atoms, nano&#8208;islands, and support. Due to their confined space, multiple active sites, interfacial interactions, and tunable coordination structure, SANIs catalysts exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity, stability, and selectivity. This review comprehensively analyzes recent advancements in SANIs catalysts, and the challenges and opportunities for their development in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, and accelerating their transformation to industrial applications are discussed.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), renowned for their maximized atomic utilization, tunable coordination environments, and unique electronic structures, are critical to energy conversion and storage. However, obstacles to their practical performance include atomic agglomeration (caused by high surface free energy) and active site passivation (due to overly strong metal&#8211;support chemical bonds). Single&#8208;atom nano&#8208;islands (SANIs) catalysts, characterized by confined spaces and innovative structural designs, have better electrocatalytic activity and stability. This review comprehensively analyzes recent advancements in SANIs catalysts, highlighting their contributions to catalytic activity, stability, structural optimization, and selectivity. We systematically summarize the design principles and strategies for SANIs electrocatalysts by focusing on material selection, metal&#8211;support interactions, and coordination structures. Finally, the challenges and opportunities associated with SANIs catalysts to promote their development in heterogeneous catalysis and accelerate their transition into industrial applications are discussed.

         <title>Artificial Intelligence&#8208;Driven Approaches in Semiconductor Research</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review on artificial intelligence and semiconductor materials aims to discuss the impact of artificial intelligence on accelerating semiconductor materials discovery, synthesis, characterization, and device optimization, addressing critical scaling and power limitations. Moreover, challenges regarding data size and quality, artificial intelligence model generalization, and autonomous experimentation are discussed to inspire more research.








Abstract
To address the persistent challenges of scaling and power consumption in integrated circuits and chips, recent research has focused on exploring novel semiconductor materials beyond silicon and designing new device architectures. The vastness of the material and parameter space poses significant challenges in terms of cost and efficiency for traditional experimental and computational methods. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) offers a highly promising avenue for accelerating semiconductor technology development. AI&#8208;driven methods demonstrate significant advantages in analyzing and interpreting large datasets, potentially freeing researchers to focus on more creative endeavors. This review provides a detailed and timely overview of how AI&#8208;driven approaches are assisting researchers across the entire semiconductor research pipeline, encompassing materials discovery, semiconductor screening, synthesis, characterization, and device performance optimization, highlighting how their integration facilitates a holistic understanding of the entire processing&#8208;structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance (PSPP) relationship. Remain challenges related to dataset quality, model generalizability, and autonomous experimentation, as well as the under&#8208;application of AI to critical needs are discussed in the semiconductor field, such as wafer&#8208;scale growth of high&#8208;quality, single&#8208;crystal semiconductor thin films beyond silicon. Addressing these challenges requires collaborative efforts from researchers across various organizations and disciplines, and represents a key focus for future research.

         <title>Food Nanozymology: Nanozyme Engineering Toward Future Food</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes are rapidly emerging in food research as a next&#8208;generation enzymatic toolkit. By proposing a transdisciplinary paradigm called food nanozymology, this work systematically elucidates its fundamental principles, diverse applications across the food supply chain, and key developmental challenges and future prospects. It establishes a clear theoretical framework to inform and guide future food research in this burgeoning interdisciplinary field.








Abstract
Enzymes have historically served as critical biocatalysts in the food supply chain, yet their industrial applicability remains constrained by intrinsic limitations such as poor stability, low availability, and high production costs. Nanozymes, synthetic nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities, offer a compelling alternative owing to their superior physicochemical properties and tunable functionalities. This review conceptualizes food nanozymology as a new interdisciplinary field that combines enzymological principles with nanotechnology to reimagine catalytic strategies in food systems. It provides a critical overview of current progress across multiple application fronts, including detection, detoxification, preservation, processing, food fortification and nutritional intervention, and resource recovery, etc. By framing food nanozymology as both a conceptual and technological shift, this work highlights its potential to catalyze innovation and improve the sustainability, efficiency, and resilience of the global food supply chain.

         <title>AI&#8208;Driven Defect Engineering for Advanced Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents how AI accelerates the design of defect&#8208;tuned thermoelectric materials. By integrating machine learning with high&#8208;throughput data and physics&#8208;informed representations, it enables efficient prediction of thermoelectric performance from complex defect landscapes. It also outlines emerging directions where machine learning may assist inverse design and promote sustainability in next&#8208;generation thermoelectric&#160;materials.








Abstract
Thermoelectric materials offer a promising pathway to directly convert waste heat to electricity. However, achieving high performance remains challenging due to intrinsic trade&#8208;offs between electrical conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity, which are further complicated by the presence of defects. This review explores how artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming thermoelectric materials design. Advanced ML approaches including deep neural networks, graph&#8208;based models, and transformer architectures, integrated with high&#8208;throughput simulations and growing databases, effectively capture structure&#8208;property relationships in a complex multiscale defect space and overcome the &#8220;curse of dimensionality&#8221;. This review discusses AI&#8208;enhanced defect engineering strategies such as composition optimization, entropy and dislocation engineering, and grain boundary design, along with emerging inverse design techniques for generating materials with targeted properties. Finally, it outlines future opportunities in novel physics mechanisms and sustainability, highlighting the critical role of AI in accelerating the discovery of thermoelectric&#160;materials.

         <title>Spin Engineering of Dual&#8208;Atom Site Catalysts for Efficient Electrochemical Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent progress in spin engineering of dual&#8208;atom site catalysts (DASCs), emphasizing how spin&#8208;related properties enhance electrocatalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. It summarizes cutting&#8208;edge developments in dual&#8208;atom catalysis, discusses the underlying spin&#8208;catalysis mechanisms and structure&#8211;performance relationships, and proposes high&#8208;throughput screening strategies to guide the rational design of spin&#8208;optimized DASCs for small&#8208;molecule conversion reactions.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom site catalysts (DASCs) provide more advantages than single&#8208;atom systems in improving energy conversions, owing to their unique features. For example, the coupling effect may align the spin of two adjacent dual&#8208;atom active centers in parallel or antiparallel via electron exchange interactions, thereby altering reaction mechanisms and overall efficiency. While numerous reviews have explored spin&#8208;dependent electrocatalysis, there remains a lack of a comprehensive, spin&#8208;focused framework for understanding the catalytic behavior of DASCs. This review emphasizes the role of spin in dual&#8208;atom site centers for electrocatalysis research. First, spin fundamentals in electrocatalysts, including spin&#8208;selective orbital occupation, spin ordering, and spin coupling, are comprehensively summarized to provide a solid foundation for subsequent discussions. Then, spin engineering strategies of DASCs are reviewed, including manipulating the spin configuration of the central atoms, modulating coordination environments, and tuning metal&#8211;support interactions. Next, recent developments in spin engineering of DASCs are reviewed, with a focus on structure&#8211;performance relationships. Furthermore, high&#8208;throughput screening techniques integrated with machine learning are discussed for developing highly efficient DASCs based on spin engineering. The challenges and opportunities of DASCs and spin engineering are thoroughly discussed to promote the advancement of new energy applications.

         <title>Immobilization of H2O in Diffusion Channel of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Long&#8208;Term CO2 Capture from Humid Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to immobilize water molecules within a robust metal&#8211;organic framework significantly enhances CO2 adsorption at low concentrations. The optimized channels by functional group regulation and water molecules immobilization in this unique MOF material facilitate the long&#8208;term viability of CO2 capture in humid flue gas. This counter&#8208;intuitive approach transforms the presence of water into favorable conditions for CO2 capture.








Abstract
Utilizing physisorption for CO2 capture in humid flue gas presents challenges, with H2O molecules either damaging the adsorbent or competing with CO2 for adsorption, compromising long&#8208;term stability. Herein, a counter&#8208;intuitive strategy is proposed to address this issue by immobilizing H2O into metal&#8211;organic framework (TYUT&#8208;ATZ, TYUT = Taiyuan University of Technology, ATZ = 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole) as binding sites for CO2 capture from humid airflow. Through tailoring the &#8208;NH2 group numbers and pore sizes creates ingenious H2O sites, preserving CO2 adsorption space and enhancing CO2 adsorption interactions in 1D channels. The well&#8208;constructed TYUT&#8208;ATZ&#8208;&#946; demonstrates a high CO2 adsorption capacity (62.7 cm3 cm&#8722;3) at 0.15&#160;bar and outstanding CO2/N2 (15/85) selectivity (2031) at 298 K, while also exhibits the highest CO2/H2O uptake ratio in humid flue gas due to its excellent water stability and unique H2O site. Consequently, it shows top&#8208;performing CO2 enrichment ability with easy regeneration in long&#8208;term separation experiments (over 100 cycles) under high&#8208;humidity (75% RH). Gas adsorption isotherms, single&#8208;crystal analysis, selectivity calculations, and contrastive breakthrough experiments comprehensively validate this artful H2O immobilization strategy in MOFs for efficient CO2 capture in humid flue gas, satisfying the application requirements of high selectivity, rapid regeneration, and long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>A Polychromatic Neuromorphic Visual System Inspired by Biomimetics for Miniature Insect Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents bulk heterojunction organic photosynapses (BHJ&#8208;OPS) for neuromorphic electronics, enabling ultra&#8208;broadband photodetection and low&#8208;energy near&#8208;infrared perception with bio&#8208;synaptic features. A neuromorphic visual system based on BHJ&#8208;OPS that can sense visual information and coordinate movements in response to environmental stimuli is successfully achieved.








Abstract
The emergence of electronics influenced by visual neural perception and action is increasingly crucial for enhancing interactive human&#8208;machine interfaces and advancing the capabilities of intelligent robots. There is an urgent demand for a system that incorporates neuromorphic environmental information encoding, synaptic signal processing, and motion control. Taking inspiration from the polychromatic visual system, it is initially employed bulk heterojunction organic photosynapses (BHJ&#8208;OPS) to replicate the functionalities of human&#8208;like visual nerve system. The BHJ&#8208;OPS, utilizing a two&#8208;terminal architecture, exhibits an ultra&#8208;broadband photodetection range (365&#8211;1060&#160;nm). For near&#8208;infrared (NIR) perception, an optical energy consumption as low as 0.2 fJ per synaptic event is demonstrated, which is the lowest energy consumption achieved so far with NIR light stimulation. By combining the photovoltaic effect in heterojunctions with electron trapping in the buffer layer, BHJ&#8208;OPS displays bio&#8208;synaptic characteristics such as short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term memory, as well as experiential learning, which endows the synapse array with multispectral color&#8208;discrimination capabilities. Finally, it is implemented miniature insect robots capable of night&#8208;time foraging and predator evasion based on a simulated 26 &#215; 26 memristor network. This demonstrates significant potential for the development of miniature insect robots with self&#8208;regulation and adaptability, particularly in exploration, monitoring, and rescue missions.

         <title>Surface Fluorination Shielding of Sulfide Solid Electrolytes for Enhanced Electrochemical Stability in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile surface fluorination using XeF2 significantly enhances the electrochemical stability of Li6PS5Cl while preserving 82.8% of its initial Li+ conductivity, which is attributed to the formation of a uniform and ultrathin (&#8776;37.3&#160;nm) fluorinated layer. The underlying fluorination mechanisms are also elucidated. The effectiveness of this strategy is further demonstrated by the outstanding performance of both the LiNi0.90Co0.05Mn0.05O2||(Li&#8208;In) half&#8208;cells and pouch&#8208;type LiNi0.90Co0.05Mn0.05O2||Li full cells.








Abstract
Despite their high Li+ conductivity and deformability, sulfide solid electrolytes suffer from limited electrochemical stability, which prevents all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) from reaching their full performance potential. Herein, a facile surface fluorination strategy is presented for Li6PS5Cl using XeF2 as a solid&#8208;state fluorinating agent, enabling a scalable dry process at moderate temperatures. An &#8776;37.3 nm&#8208;thick uniform fluorinated layer is coated on an Li6PS5Cl surface, preserving 82.8% of the initial Li+ conductivity (from 2.9 &#215; 10&#8315;3 only to 2.4 &#215; 10&#8315;3 S cm&#8315;&#185; at 30 &#176;C). The underlying fluorination mechanism, deduced through systematic investigations using X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray Rietveld refinement, nuclear magnetic resonance, and density functional theory calculations, involves the formation of surface oxidative byproducts and F substitution within the lattice. When applied to LiNi0.90Co0.05Mn0.05O2 electrodes in LiNi0.90Co0.05Mn0.05O2||(Li&#8208;In) half cells at 30 &#176;C, the fluorinated Li6PS5Cl substantially improves the electrochemical performance, delivering superior discharge capacities (e.g., 186.9 vs 173.6&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.33C), capacity retention, and safety characteristics compared to unmodified Li6PS5Cl. This enhancement is attributed to the formation of a robust fluorinated cathode electrolyte interphase that mitigates Li6PS5Cl oxidation. Finally, the stable operation of a pouch&#8208;type LiNi0.90Co0.05Mn0.05O2||Li ASSB is demonstrated, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach.

         <title>Eliminating Nearfield Coupling in Dense High Quality Factor Phase Gradient Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for fully suppressing nearfield coupling is reported between subwavelength separated meta&#8208;atoms with arbitrarily large resonant quality factors, opening the door to dynamic high resolution wavefront shaping with vanishingly small refractive index biasing. The platform provides a route for densely arrayed high Q metasurfaces with independently addressable meta&#8208;atoms, paving the way for highly efficient nonlinear and dynamic wavefront shaping.








Abstract
High Q phase gradient metasurfaces are promising for revolutionizing light manipulation, but near&#8208;field coupling typically forces a trade&#8208;off between quality factor and resolution. Here, a strategy for eliminating coupling&#8208;based nonlocal effects in wave shaping metasurfaces composed of meta&#8208;pixels is presented with arbitrarily long resonant lifetimes arranged with sub&#8208;diffraction spatial resolution. By working at a zero&#8208;coupling regime introduced by the interference between enhanced longitudinal and transverse electric fields, the tradeoff between Q and resolution no longer exists.

     alt="Eliminating Nearfield Coupling in Dense High Quality Factor Phase Gradient Metasurfaces"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategy for fully suppressing nearfield coupling is reported between subwavelength separated meta-atoms with arbitrarily large resonant quality factors, opening the door to dynamic high resolution wavefront shaping with vanishingly small refractive index biasing. The platform provides a route for densely arrayed high Q metasurfaces with independently addressable meta-atoms, paving the way for highly efficient nonlinear and dynamic wavefront shaping.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High Q phase gradient metasurfaces are promising for revolutionizing light manipulation, but near-field coupling typically forces a trade-off between quality factor and resolution. Here, a strategy for eliminating coupling-based nonlocal effects in wave shaping metasurfaces composed of meta-pixels is presented with arbitrarily long resonant lifetimes arranged with sub-diffraction spatial resolution. By working at a zero-coupling regime introduced by the interference between enhanced longitudinal and transverse electric fields, the tradeoff between Q and resolution no longer exists. Numerical demonstrations show that metasurfaces with quality factors of a few million and resolution &amp;lt;&#955;/1.6 can produce beam-splitting to angles of &#177;53&#176; and beam-steering to an angle of 33&#176; with diffraction efficiencies over 90% via refractive index modulations of just 2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt; and 7 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Experimentally, the signature of a zero-coupling regime is discovered in the form of a sign flip in the angular dispersion with resonant wavelength, which validates the scheme. Aside from triangulating a perfect decoupling configuration, one of the fabricated nanofin-isolated metasurfaces with Q-factor &amp;gt;870 has a resonant wavelength that stays within the half linewidth for incident angles of &#8722;20&#176; to 20&#176;.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough Single&#8208;Network Hydrogels via the Synergy of Defect Elimination and Dual Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of tough hydrogel in single&#8208;network is developed by leveraging nanostructures as crosslinkers and initiators within free radical reactions to optimize the network imperfections, including spatial inhomogeneities and dangling&#8208;chain defects. The integration of dangling chains and dual crosslinking into the network offers substantial enhancements in the fracture toughness and fatigue resistance without compromising its low hysteresis.









Abstract
Network imperfections, such as multi&#8208;dispersed junctions and dangling chains, significantly impair the mechanical performance of hydrogels and elastomers synthesized via free radical reactions (FRRs). Great efforts have been made to introduce sacrificial structures to enhance toughness but cause pronounced hysteresis, leaving a comprehensive solution elusive. Herein, a class of robust single&#8208;network hydrogels with minimal imperfections is reported by employing nano&#8208;crosslinkers and nano&#8208;initiators to produce monodispersed crosslinking points and eliminate dangling&#8208;chain defects, in the formation of dual crosslinking of thiolate&#8208;Au bond and chemically covalent bond in the network. As a result, the hydrogel achieves a maximum fracture toughness (78&#8201;500 J m&#8722;2) and fatigue resistance (2480 J m&#8722;2), with over 13 and 55 fold increases attributed to the incorporation of dangling chains and dual crosslinking, respectively, without compromising its low hysteresis (0.07). Eliminating dangling chains also improves interfacial contact and osmotic pressure resistance, enabling exceptional underwater self&#8208;healing and swelling properties. Even with a high water&#8208;uptake of up to 95 wt.%, the swollen hydrogel exhibits stretchability exceeding 2000%, without obvious mechanical degradation after one month of water incubation. This work demonstrates a model system for developing resilient polymers with minimized imperfections derived from FRRs, showing numerous potential applications in underwater applications.

         <title>Crystallinity&#8208;Induced Ion Rectification in Polymer/Zn Interphases for Stable Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a macromolecular ordering&#8208;tuned interphase by leveraging the phase&#8208;separated hierarchical ion tunnels in semicrystalline polymers to address Zn/electrolyte interfacial issues. The PVA interphase, with lamellar orientation parallel to the Zn anode, achieves a balance between electrode protection and ionic conductivity, enabling rapid yet uniform Zn2+ transport and interfacial stability.








Abstract
The energy density and cycle life of aqueous zinc metal batteries are hindered by inherent chemical and mechanical instabilities at the Zn/electrolyte interface, causing uncontrolled dendrite formation and side reactions. Here, an anisotropic crystalline polymer interphase by leveraging the hierarchical structure to stabilize the interface is designed. The stabilization effect strongly depends on the crystallinity of polymer chains, where the one with optimal ion transfer possesses a preferred orientation of nanocrystals parallel to the Zn anode. This topological structure creates fast tunnel for ion transport that significantly enhances the kinetics and reversibility of electrochemical transformations. The ordered crystalline phase and disordered amorphous phase respectively blocks H&#8322;O penetration and provides Zn2&#8314; transport channels, reaching an optimum between electrode protection and ion transfer. Symmetric cells with the crystallinity&#8208;tuned interface demonstrate an exceptionally long lifespan exceeding 3000&#160;h at elevated current density and capacity of 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, with a cumulative plated capacity of 7500&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. The Zn/AC hybrid ion supercapacitor exhibits outstanding stability, enduring over 10&#160;000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. The work unveils new ordering&#8208;dependent ion transport in solid&#8208;state polymer interphase/electrolyte and provides a feasible approach for advancing grid&#8208;scale aqueous batteries.

         <title>Bilateral Anchoring for Enhanced Mechanical Stability and Efficiency in Flexible all&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bilateral anchoring strategy using 2&#8208;bromoethylamine hydrobromide (2&#8208;BH) at PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface enhances interfacial adhesion and charger transfer in flexible Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cells. The introduction of 2&#8208;BH additionally mitigates Sn2+ oxidation, thereby improving the film morphology and crystallinity. Overall, such optimized flexible all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells achieve a power conversion efficiency of 24.1% and present superior mechanical durability.








Abstract
Flexible all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs) feature an outstanding power&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio, rendering them perfect for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic, wearable electronics, and aerospace applications, owing to their adaptability to flexible and lightweight substrates. However, the weak mechanical adhesion between the perovskite and adjacent functional layers, combined with tin (Sn) oxidation at the buried interface in tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) perovskites solar cells (PSCs), substantially hampers the durability and performance of device. Herein, a bilateral anchoring strategy is proposed by employing 2&#8208;bromoethylamine hydrobromide (2&#8208;BH) at the NBG perovskite/ hole transporting layer (PEDOT:PSS) interface. The incorporation of 2&#8208;BH establishes robust bonds with both PEDOT:PSS and the perovskite layer, thereby enhancing interfacial adhesion and charge transfer. Meanwhile, the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite films are also improved due to the mitigated oxidation of Sn2+. Thus, this approach yields flexible single&#8208;junction NBG &#160;with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.5%, maintaining its 95% efficiency after 3000 bending cycles. When integrated into monolithic flexible all&#8208;perovskite TSCs, a certified PCE of 24.01% is achieved.

         <title>3D Printing&#8211;In Situ Curing of Soft Organogels Using Frontal Polymerizable Inks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A frontal polymerization&#8211;3D printing&#8211;in situ&#8208;curing strategy is developed to construct soft organogel materials with various architectures. The printed patterns are produced with high fidelity and integrity while saving energy.








Abstract
3D printing has gained immense recognition owing to its fascinating ability for rapid prototyping and customization. However, the current methods usually require post&#8208;processing (direct ink writing) or continuous energy input (stereolithography) for polymer gel curing. The former lowers the fidelity and integrity of the printed layers, whereas the latter suffers from high energy consumption. To address these issues, a frontal polymerization (FP)&#8211;3D printing&#8211;in situ&#8208;curing method is developed to construct printable and polymerizable inks for acrylate&#8208;based monomers and soft organogel materials. Once initiated, no external energy supply is required, which allows for real&#8208;time conversion of monomers into polymers within seconds. Thus, the energy requirements are reduced by several orders of magnitude. More importantly, the printed structure is closely bonded, effectively avoiding the collapse and deformation of soft materials. The as&#8208;printed organogel is used as an evaporator and achieves a high water&#8208;evaporation rate of 3.77&#160;kg m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1. This FP&#8211;3D printing&#8211;in situ&#8208;curing strategy is an alternative, energy&#8208;saving method for fabricating soft materials, enabling high fidelity and integrity of printed patterns with wide applicability.

To address these issues, a frontal polymerization (FP)&#8211;3D printing&#8211;in situ-curing method is developed to construct printable and polymerizable inks for acrylate-based monomers and soft organogel materials. Once initiated, no external energy supply is required, which allows for real-time conversion of monomers into polymers within seconds. Thus, the energy requirements are reduced by several orders of magnitude. More importantly, the printed structure is closely bonded, effectively avoiding the collapse and deformation of soft materials. The as-printed organogel is used as an evaporator and achieves a high water-evaporation rate of 3.77&#160;kg m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This FP&#8211;3D printing&#8211;in situ-curing strategy is an alternative, energy-saving method for fabricating soft materials, enabling high fidelity and integrity of printed patterns with wide applicability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetically Controlled Reversible Photomagnetic Nanoactuators for Dynamic Contrast Enhancement in Optical Coherence Tomography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photomagnetic nanoactuators with &#8776;90% scattering efficiency in the second near&#8208;infrared window are demonstrated to exhibit magnetic field&#8208;controlled modulation of optical scattering and optical coherence tomography signals. These nanoactuators are reversibly assembled and disassembled under the external magnetic field modulation, enabling enhanced particle&#8208;associated signal detection with suppressed background signal both in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high&#8208;resolution imaging modality that detects scattered optical signals from light&#8211;tissue interaction. However, the ability of OCT to visualize specific molecular and cellular events is hindered by the lack of effective exogenous contrast agents capable of producing noticeable imaging contrast. Here, photomagnetic nanoactuators with &#8776;90% scattering efficiency in the second near&#8208;infrared window, capable of reversible magnetic field&#8208;mediated modulation of optical scattering and, therefore, OCT signal, are proposed. These nanoactuators consist of a magnetite core and gold shell, functioning as a reversible magnetic actuator and an optical scatterer, respectively. When exposed to the external magnetic field, photomagnetic nanoactuators are assembled into chain structures via magnetostatic interactions between nearby nanoactuators, reducing their optical scattering and, consequently, the OCT signal. Upon removal of the magnetic field, the nanoactuators are disassembled, restoring their scattering property and OCT signal. It is demonstrated that this magnetically controlled OCT response allows enhanced particle&#8208;associated signal detection with suppressed background signal via image subtraction before and after magnetic field treatment, both in vitro and in vivo. The developed nanoactuator platform offers a strategy for dynamic enhancement of OCT contrast, potentially broadening the utility of OCT for noninvasive cell tracking and molecular diagnostic imaging.

         <title>Architected Liquid Crystal Elastomer Lattices with Programmable Energy Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Architected liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) lattices with programmed alignment, stiffness, and enhanced energy absorption are created by direct ink writing. Their energy absorption behavior is measured across strain rates spanning six orders of magnitude (10&#8722;3&#8211;103 s&#8722;1). LCEs exhibit a 18&#8208;fold improvement relative to non&#8208;mesogenic (silicone) lattices at the highest strain rate tested.








Abstract
Architected LCE lattices are fabricated with flow&#8208;induced alignment via direct ink writing and systematically characterized their shape morphing, stiffness, and energy absorption behavior across strain rates spanning six orders of magnitude from 10&#8722;3 to 103 s&#8722;1. It is shown that architected liquid crystal elastomer&#160;(LCE) lattices exhibit superior energy absorption compared to their non&#8208;mesogenic (silicone) counterparts. Importantly, the LCE&#8208;to&#8208;silicone energy absorption ratios are up to 18&#8208;fold higher at the highest strain rate tested. A finite element model that captures their shape&#8208;morphing response is developed, which exhibits excellent agreement with the experimental observations. The work opens new avenues for designing and fabricating LCE lattices with programmable alignment, shape morphing, and mechanics.

         <title>Ancestral Protein&#8208;Based Lighting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) method applied to a large dataset of modern fluorescent proteins (FPs) led to a bright ancestral&#8208;like FP suitable for photon down&#8208;conversion in bio&#8208;hybrid light&#8208;emitting diodes (Bio&#8208;HLEDs).









Abstract
Protein&#8208;optoelectronics is a paradigm toward eco&#8208;designed and sustainable technologies. The challenge is, however, how to preserve the native activity of proteins upon device fabrication/operation in non&#8208;native environments (solvents, organic/inorganic interfaces, and working temperatures/irradiations). Herein, a new vision to identify and design ancestral&#8208;like fluorescent proteins (FPs) is proposed. Using ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) out of a large dataset (221) of the best modern FPs suitable for photon down&#8208;conversion in bio&#8208;hybrid light&#8208;emitting diodes (Bio&#8208;HLEDs) a historical&#8208;genetic reconstruction (family tree) was obtained, identifying a possible common ancestral FP. This computationally designed protein is produced in bacteria, featuring outstanding photoluminescence quantum yields in solution (e.g., 90%/80% for green&#8208;/red&#8208;emitting forms) and a strong tendency to agglomerate in polymer coatings. This resulted in red&#8208;emitting Bio&#8208;HLEDs that outperformed the reference with &#8776;2&#8208;fold enhanced stabilities. The resplendent green&#8208;/red&#8208;emission of ancestral&#8208;like FP itself and its respective devices led us to coin this new protein as QuetzalFP. Overall, it is set in ASR as an effective concept to reshape protein&#8208;optoelectronics allowing us to identify i) many interesting ancestral FPs for lighting and ii) QuetzalFP as stepping&#8208;stone platform for protein engineering.

         <title>Designing Maximal Strength in Nanolamellar Eutectic High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study uses molecular dynamics simulations to guide the design of EHEAs with superior mechanical performance. The simulations reveal a peak tensile strength at a critical interphase boundary spacing. Below this spacing, the governing mechanism shifts from the Hall&#8211;Petch strengthening to dislocation multiplication&#8211;mediated softening.&#160; Guided by these insights, LPBF&#8208;fabricated EHEAs achieve a tensile strength of 1.8 GPa, approaching the theoretical limit and exceeding other as&#8208;printed high&#8208;entropy alloys.








Abstract
Eutectic alloys have driven technological advancements for centuries, from early bronze tools that marked the dawn of metallurgy to high&#8208;performance soldering materials. Building on this legacy, eutectic high&#8208;entropy alloys (EHEAs) have recently emerged to push the boundaries of mechanical performance. However, the strength potential of EHEAs remains largely untapped, primarily because of limitations in cooling rates, posing a significant challenge to the development of ultra&#8208;strong bulk EHEAs. This study employs large&#8208;scale molecular dynamics simulations to uncover key insights into the design of EHEAs with exceptional mechanical performance. Simulations reveal that the maximum tensile strength occurs at a critical interphase boundary spacing, an order of magnitude larger than that observed in conventional alloys. Below this spacing, the governing mechanism shifts from the Hall&#8211;Petch strengthening to dislocation multiplication&#8211;mediated softening. Guided by the simulation insights, a tensile strength of 1.8&#160;GPa is achieved for laser powder bed fusion&#8211;fabricated EHEAs. This strength approaches the theoretical limit and outperforms other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art as&#8208;printed high&#8208;entropy alloys. This work not only establishes a viable pathway for designing ultra&#8208;strong EHEAs but also provides a promising avenue for addressing the long&#8208;standing challenge of developing high&#8208;performance as&#8208;printed materials for aerospace and other demanding applications.

         <title>Unraveling the Complexity of the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya Interaction in Layered Magnets: The Full Magnitude and Chirality Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In layered magnets, the atomistic Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) depends critically not only on the orbital occupancy of the interface layer but also on the sequence of the atomic layers. The effect can be understood by analyzing the contributions of different orbitals to DMI. Both the chirality and the magnitude of the atomistic DMI can be controlled through interface engineering.








Abstract
Chirality is one of the inherent characteristics of some objects in nature. In magnetism, chiral magnetic textures can be formed in systems with broken inversion symmetry and due to an antisymmetric magnetic interaction, known as Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI). Here, aiming for a fundamental understanding of this chiral interaction on the atomic scale, several synthetic layered structures composed of alternating atomic layers of 3d ferromagnetic metals epitaxially grown on the Ir(001) surface are designed. It is demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically that the atomistic DMI depends critically not only on the orbital occupancy of the interface magnetic layer but also on the sequence of the atomic layers. It is shown that even large atomistic DMI values can result in a small effective DMI, and conversely. Furthermore, the dependence of the effective DMI on the number of atomic layers deviates from a simple scaling law. These observations are attributed to the complexity of the electronic structure and the contributions of different orbitals to the hybridization and DMI. The results are&#160;anticipated to provide guidelines for achieving full control over both the chirality and the magnitude of the atomistic DMI in layered materials.

         <title>Fueling IgA&#8208;Dominated Humoral Immunity with an Intranasal Hybrid Tumor Vaccine to Opsonize and Strike Epithelial Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the authors confirm that breast cancer cells can directly bind with IgA, dependent on polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR)&#8208;mediated transcytosis function, modulating tumorigenic phenotype and antitumor response. To harness this biology, an intranasal tumor vaccine is designed, which can effectively combat primary and metastatic breast cancer through at least two independent mechanisms, including PIGR&#8208;IgA interaction and antigen recognition.








Abstract
Humoral immunity&#8208;cancer crosstalk has gained attention recently owing to its impact on tumor immune responses and therapy responsiveness. Here, it is shown that epithelial breast cancer cells can directly bind with non&#8208;antigen&#8208;specific IgA, dependent on polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR)&#8208;mediated transcytosis function, modulating tumoral inflammatory genes and sensitizing antitumor response. To harness this biology, a hybrid tumor vaccine is designed by covering the adjuvant&#8208;loaded cancer cell vesicles with a calcium phosphate shell, which retains the antigen information of the original tumor cells and exhibits robust mucosal adhesion in nasal tissues. Following intranasal vaccination, such a hybrid vaccine preferentially activates germinal center responses in nasal&#8208;associated lymphoid tissues and drives the production of tumoral antigen&#8208;specific IgA&#8208;dominated humoral immunity in both serum and lung through the property of &#8220;common mucosal immune system&#8221;, thus coordinating cellular immune responses to prevent lung colonization of IgA&#8208;opsonized breast cancer. In the inoperable and postoperative breast cancer model, intranasal vaccination with the hybrid vaccine also enables the amplification of the therapeutic benefits of local/systemic therapies. In summary, this work presents insights into the antitumor biology of IgA in epithelial breast cancer and explores a highly effective vaccine strategy focused on governing IgA&#8208;dominated humoral immunity to combat breast cancer, especially lung metastasis.

         <title>Multifunctional Hollow Carbon Microspheres Enable Superior Electromagnetic Wave Response and Corrosion Barrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow carbon microspheres with superior EM wave absorption and anti&#8208;corrosion capability have been produced. As results, a minimum reflection loss of &#8722;57.5 dB and an absorption bandwidth of 5.67 GHz are achieved. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that dual passivation effects provide a barrier to hinder the access of corrosive species to the substrate surface.








Abstract
Electromagnetic (EM) wave absorbing materials with corrosion barrier exhibit immense potential in meeting the requirements of electronic defense technology in the complex marine environments, but still confront conflicts in disentangling the trade&#8208;off of multifunctional applications. Herein, hollow carbon microspheres (HCMs) that simultaneously possess superior EM wave absorption and anti&#8208;corrosion capability have been produced with the aid of self&#8208;sacrificing templates. During the pyrolysis, the reductive characteristic of Zn microspheres and thermal driving force promote magnetic domain evolution, which enables optimized hetero&#8208;interface resonance and strong magnetic interactions, facilitating a minimum reflection loss lower than &#8722;40 dB and a wide absorption bandwidth greater than 5 GHz. Furthermore, HCMs&#8208;900 with both anion&#8208;repulsion characteristics and better resistance can partially reduce the adsorption/accumulation of corrosive species and decrease the charge&#8208;carrying ability, and the inevitably generated by&#8208;products of layered double hydroxides with strong anion&#8208;capture ability can hinder the access of corrosive species to the substrate surface, resulting in superior anti&#8208;corrosion capability. This innovative strategy inspires us with a motivated pathway for the rational design of advanced multifunctional anti&#8208;corrosive EM absorbing materials.

         <title>Water Oxidation to Hydrogen Peroxide Over a Super&#8208;Aerophilic Graphite Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design of super&#8208;aerophilic graphite catalyst capable of trapping in situ produced oxygen gas on its surface under the electrolyte environment. By so doing, it is able to moderate intermediate species&#160;binding, which is critical to enabling the two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction to hydrogen peroxide.








Abstract
Two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (2e&#8208;WOR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an attractive anode reaction with several merits. It can be paired with several large&#8208;scale cathode reactions that produce valuable chemical substances in an electrochemical cell. However, high&#8208;performing and reliable 2e&#8208;WOR anodic catalysts are yet to be fully developed. In this work, a rationally designed, inexpensive, robust, and selective graphite catalyst electrode is presented, made by following the key principle mechanisms of 2e&#8208;WOR. First, an aerophilic graphite&#8208;based electrode is created to leverage the challenges posed by the four&#8208;electron WOR, where&#160;the generated O2 from this reaction is kept onto the electrode surface to shift the O intermediates binding on graphite in the direction of improved H2O2 generation. An initial improvement in H2O2 selectivity of seven fold is observed, albeit with no improved H2O2 generation rates. The stunted H2O2 generation is ascribed to poor activity from pristine graphite, courtesy of less active sites and low intrinsic O2 binding in the electrolyte environment. Second, to improve and balance graphite's activity and selectivity, the structure of graphite is altered via different elemental doping (with N, S, B, and P atoms), a method that allows the retention of the O2 on the graphite surface. The super&#8208;aerophilic B&#8208;doped graphite catalyst (optimum) reaches a maximum Faraday efficiency (FE) of 60.6 &#177; 2.6% with a production rate of 26.7 &#177; 0.6 &#181;mol min&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 (85.9 &#177; 2.2 mA cm&#8722;2 partial current density) and excellent stability of over 120 h. In tandem, cathodic H2 co&#8208;production is demonstrated with an FE of above 90%. This approach demonstrates a rational approach to designing inexpensive and robust 2e&#8208;WOR anode catalysts for H2O2 and the possibility of its use in chemical co&#8208;production at the cathode.

Their outstanding figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit, remarkable voltage gains, and adaptability for ternary/quaternary logic operations signify significant advances in this field, highlighting their potential as versatile platforms for organic (bio)electronics with high sensitivity and high&#8208;density integration.








Abstract
Single&#8208;component, ultrathin ambipolar organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) combined with multivalued logic (MVL) circuits offer new opportunities for advancing next&#8208;generation bioelectronic systems due to their low&#8208;power consumption, manufacturing simplicity, and high&#8208;density integration, central to which is the evolution of ambipolar organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) as channel materials. However, small&#8208;molecule analogues remain unexplored to date for lack of well&#8208;defined molecular strategies. Herein, first two acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type vinyl&#8208;linked bis&#8208;diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;core ambipolar small&#8208;molecule OMIECs are developed featuring multiple conformational locks. It is discovered that grafting shortened glycolated sidechains produces stronger solid&#8208;state aggregation, tighter lamellar stacking, and higher crystallinity, consequently elevating the ambipolar &#181;C* figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit by over fourfold. Furthermore, the skillful manipulation of anionic species to facilitate oxidation doping enables significant increasement in p&#8208;type &#181;C* (170 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and a record&#8208;high n&#8208;type &#181;C* of 360 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, especially at a channel thickness of sub&#8208;10&#160;nm. Crucially, single&#8208;component OECT&#8208;based inverters constructed therefrom are for the first time demonstrated to accommodate ternary/quaternary logic, achieving a remarkable gain of 135&#160;V/V. This work not only provides an effective molecular design strategy for creating high&#8208;performing ultrathin&#8208;film ambipolar small&#8208;molecule OMIECs, highlighting ionic doping effect on ambipolarity, but also demonstrates their potential in MVL circuits for organic bioelectronics applications.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Topological/Ferroelectric Bi2Te3/SnSe Hetero&#8208;Memristor for In Situ Bionic&#8208;Visual Semi&#8208;Hardware Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining the advantages of two&#8208;dimensional (2D)two&#8208;dimensional ferroelectrics and 2D topological insulators, the Bi2Te3/SnSe hetero&#8208;memristor is constructed to achieve ultra&#8208;high and stable optoelectronic sensing characteristics. The device shows an average 0.25 &#181;W on/off power and 32 controllable conductive states. The semi&#8208;hardware neuromorphic system based on it achieved a 97.68% classification accuracy in low orbit satellite image recognition tasks.









Abstract
As the application of artificial vision systems continues to grow, developing efficient and low&#8208;power visual sensing devices has become a key challenge. Memristors offer tunable conductivity and integrated in&#8208;situ storage and computation functions, making them ideal for low&#8208;cost visual systems. However, most memristors currently face the dual challenges of poor stability and limited optoelectronic synaptic plasticity. Here, a Bi2Te2.7Se0.3/SnSe hetero&#8208;memristor is designed, which combines the advantages of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) topological insulators and 2D ferroelectric materials. The hetero&#8208;memristor performance can be tuned by the SnSe ferroelectric polarization and Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 topological surface state, which improve the utilization and mobility of carriers, thereby significantly improving the performance. The high 104&#8208;cycle stability, average 0.25 &#181;W on/off power, and 25 conductive states are achieved. Under different signals, the hetero&#8208;memristor can enable in situ light&#8208;electric conversion and successfully simulate various optoelectronic plasticity behaviors, such as paired&#8208;pulse facilitation, post&#8208;tetanic potentiation, spike rate&#8208;dependent plasticity, etc. Mean while, an efficient in&#8208;situ bionic&#8208;visual semi&#8208;hardware system is constructed based on the 28 &#215; 28 perception hetero&#8208;memristor array. This system efficiently performs satellite image recognition and classification, achieving an accuracy of 97.68%. The research shows that the Bi2Te2.7Se0.3/SnSe hetero&#8208;memristor is with&#160;excellent optoelectronic performances and broad application prospects, particularly in brain&#8208;like computing, smart hardware, and storage technologies.

         <title>Cloud Inspired White and Grey Plasmonic Metasurfaces for Camouflaged Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by clouds' role in Earth's thermal management, this work presents disordered plasmonic metasurfaces that mimic their radiative effects. The white metasurface enhances backscattering, acting as a cooling layer with camouflage properties. The grey state suppresses backscattering and enhances light trapping, surpassing conventional black absorbers. These metasurfaces enable advancements in camouflage, low&#8208;emissivity coatings, and thermal infrared stealth technologies.








Abstract
Inspired by nature's color&#8208;driven thermal regulation mechanisms and the atmospheric radiative effects of cloud&#8208;aerosol interactions, this work presents the design of disordered metasurfaces capable of achieving white and grey plasmonic colors. This innovation advances light and thermal management technologies within the framework of stealth and camouflage applications. The white plasmonic metasurfaces emulate the cooling effects of clouds, reducing substrate temperatures by a relative &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C under standard solar illumination through backscattering. In contrast, transitioning to a grey state with a nanocomposite absorber suppresses backscattering and enables efficient light trapping, resulting in a relative +10 &#160;&#176;C temperature increase compared to conventional black absorbers. These findings introduce a novel approach to localized thermal management, distinct from traditional passive cooling strategies that rely on high&#8208;emissivity materials. The metasurfaces&#8217; low&#8208;emissivity properties and visible appearance open opportunities in advanced camouflage, stealth technologies, and thermal energy solutions. Additionally, the scalable, sustainable design, realized through all&#8208;in&#8208;chamber nanofabrication via sputtering, eliminates the need for chemically intensive synthesis methods while ensuring long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Fluorogen&#8208;Activating Human Serum Albumin for Mitochondrial Nanoscale Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorogen&#8208;activating HSA engineered via confinement fluorescence enhances brightness, minimizes phototoxicity, and achieves superior cell permeability for nanoscale mitochondrial imaging. Co&#8208;crystal structure reveals HSA immobilizes the fluorophore in hydrophobic cavities via &#945;&#8208;type binding, restricting torsional motions for high quantum yields. Theoretical calculations elucidate excited&#8208;state dynamics. AmpHecy@HSA enables low&#8208;phototoxicity super&#8208;resolution mitochondrial imaging in living cells, expanding fluorogenic toolkit for mitochondrial science.








Abstract
Fluorescence nanoscopy of living cells employs contrast agents to reveal intrinsic correlations between mitochondrial dynamics and functions at the molecular level. However, regular mitochondrial fluorophores usually present poor photostability, low brightness, non&#8208;specific inhibitory effects, high phototoxicity, and rapid photobleaching, which have hindered the use of these tools to capture the intricate dynamic features of mitochondria. Herein, we engineered a fluorogen&#8208;activating protein (FAP), AmpHecy@HSA, a non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly of HSA and amphiphilic hemicyanine (AmpHecy) fluorophore, with exceptional cell permeability, long&#8208;lasting photostability, high brightness/fluorogenicity, and minimal phototoxicity. Crystallography and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy techniques were combined to elucidate the structural and mechanistic intricacies of fluorescence activation. These findings revealed that fluorophore photoactivation happens through the molecular conformation&#8208;induced intramolecular charge transfer, whose kinetics is mainly determined by the hydrophobic interaction between the fluorophore and nearby amino acids. This aligns with classical molecular dynamics simulations and excited&#8208;state conformation quantum mechanics. It was further demonstrated that AmpHecy@HSA can be used for super&#8208;resolved images of mitochondria within living cells without apparent phototoxicity. This work expands the fluorescent toolkit based on FAP engineering for studying live&#8208;cell mitochondrial morphology and function, advancing the fields of chemistry and biomedicine.

         <title>Artesunate Nanoplatform Targets the Serine&#8211;MAPK Axis in Cancer&#8208;Associated Fibroblasts to Reverse Photothermal Resistance in Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The artesunate nanoplatform selectively targets ECM CAF, functioning as a GTPase inhibitor through disruption of intracellular serine homeostasis. This metabolic intervention effectively suppresses MAPK cascade activity, which consequently inhibits PTT&#8208;induced CAF to ECM CAF differentiation. By attenuating this phenotypic transition, the nanoplatform significantly reduces the formation of TRB structure, ultimately enhancing tumor sensitivity to PTT.








Abstract
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a pivotal role in inducing photothermal therapy (PTT) resistance of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC), but with unclear mechanism. Herein, aminoethyl anisamide&#8208;modified nano&#8208;biomimetic low&#8208;density lipoprotein (A&#8208;aLDL) is used to target deliver the PTT agent and artesunate (ARS) to both CAFs and cancer cells. Though CAFs are sensitive to PTT and notably transition to heat&#8208;resistant phenotype, the formed protective barrier is destroyed by ARS. Subsequently, the outstanding anti&#8208;tumor effects are achieved through PTT in multiple models with such kind of combination therapy. Interestingly, the mechanism is discovered that serine metabolism plays a major role in CAF resistance through spatially omics. ARS disrupts serine homeostasis, thereby attenuating the cascade activity of GTPases in MAPK pathway. Meanwhile, MAP2K7 is the most potential target for sensitizing PTT. By integrating ARS with PTT agents, the serine&#8208;MAPK axis in CAFs is successfully modulated, thereby overcoming PTT resistance in TNBC therapy.

         <title>Organic AIE Nanoradiosensitizer Potentiates X&#8208;Ray Triggered Continuous Reactive Oxygen Species Generation for Potent Cancer Radioimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a glutathione&#8208;responsive system (named THN) is prepared for X&#8208;ray&#8208;triggered sustained ROS generation for efficient antitumor immunotherapy. The double&#8208;promoting ROS generation of THN induced massive immunogenic cancer cell death and polarized M2 macrophages into the M1 phenotype for enhanced antitumor immunotherapy. Experiments revealed that THN&#8208;sensitized RT inhibited post&#8208;surgery tumor recurrence and increased memory T&#8208;cell proportion for long&#8208;term antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Organic radiosensitizers (ORSs), with structural versatility, hold promise for sensitizing radiotherapy (RT) by interacting with X&#8208;ray photons to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). They often consist of low&#8208;Z elements that have inherently low X&#8208;ray deposition capability. However, current ORSs suffer from short circulation half&#8208;lives and low tumor retention, contradicting their requirements for sustained ROS generation upon RT in tumor sites. Herein, a glutathione&#8208;responsive system is prepared, loaded with aggregation&#8208;induced emission molecules (TPEPy&#8208;I) and Ferriprotoporphyrin IX chloride (Hemin), to act as an ORS (named THN) for X&#8208;ray triggered sustained ROS generation for efficient antitumor immunotherapy. In detail, THN effectively deposited X&#8208;ray photons, which interact with water molecules to generate abundant ROS under external radiation. Subsequently, THN&#8208;mediated radiosensitization stimulated tumor cells to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by upregulating NOX4 protein, promoting the chemodynamic process of Hemin reacting with H2O2 to continuously produce hydroxyl radicals. The double&#8208;promoting ROS generation of THN induced massive immunogenic cancer cell death and polarized M2 macrophages into the M1 phenotype for enhanced antitumor immunotherapy. Experiments revealed that THN&#8208;sensitized RT inhibited tumor recurrence and increased memory T&#8208;cell proportion for long&#8208;term antitumor immunity. The developed ORS has great clinical potential as both a radiosensitizer and a post&#8208;RT immunomodulatory agent.

         <title>Materials Evolution by Programmed Twisting: a DNA&#8208;Inspired Ultrastrong Supercoiled Conformational Fiber for Energy&#8208;Storage and Buffering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the supercoiled conformational structures and behaviors of the DNA chain, a material evolution strategy via supercoiled conformational fibers (SCFs) is proposed to achieve a number of extra&#8208;ordinary properties/functions, including pseudo&#8208;entropic elasticity, high&#8208;performance torsional energy&#8208;storage, stimulus&#8208;triggered energy release, impact buffering, and self&#8208;reinforcement.








Abstract
The conformational folding/unfolding behaviors of DNA supercoils serve as a fundamental mechanism governing ultradense bio&#8208;information storage and precise genetic transcription. Mimicking those nanoscale dynamic conformational behaviors for macroscopic materials to achieve unusual functionalities will be of great interest but remains unexplored. Herein, a DNA&#8208;inspired materials evolution paradigm is presented to create multifunctional supercoiled conformational fibers (SCFs) by programmed twisting controlled self&#8208;buckling. Through the programmed twist&#8208;stress modulation, a low&#8208;density polyethylene strip is transformed into high&#8208;performance DNA&#8208;like SCF through a unique multiscale microstructure evolution process. This DNA&#8208;like SCF exhibits five hallmark characteristics unattainable before, including ultra&#8208;large elastic deformability (900 &#177; 50%), metal&#8208;level mechanical strength (330 &#177; 30&#160;MPa), unprecedented torsional energy&#8208;storage density (16.1 &#177; 0.6&#160;kJ&#160;kg&#8722;1), torsional energy release upon appropriate stimulations, and impact buffering through conformation&#8208;mediated energy&#8208;dissipation. Characterization reveals that these unexpected energy&#8208;related properties mainly are contributed by the multiscale twisting&#8208;reinforced microstructures and conformation mechanics. Potential applications of the SCFs are demonstrated finally by harvest&#8208;and&#8208;storage of wind energy and soft&#8208;landing. The DNA&#8208;like SCFs indicate a general platform for materials evolution with extraordinary mechanics and functions.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Polymer Brushes Enables Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Battery Stable Operation under Ultra&#8208;Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>

A multifunctional polymer brush (G&#8208;pGMAAQ) is fabricated through molecular engineering strategies. G&#8208;pGMAAQ can act as a redox mediator to reduce the polysulfides conversion energy barriers, and its unique polar brush structure effectively inhibits polysulfides shuttling and homogenizes lithium&#8208;ion fluxes, enabling lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries for stable operation from &#8722;40 to 70&#160;&#176;C.









Abstract
Achieving stable operation under a wide temperature range is a critical target for the practical applications of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. However, intense lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttling at high&#8208;temperature, sluggish sulfur species conversion, and inhomogeneous Li+ deposition at low&#8208;temperature severely impair the cycle lifespan of batteries. Herein, the multifunctional polymer brushes are fabricated by grafting anthraquinone&#8208;functionalized poly(glycidyl methacrylate) brushes on graphene surfaces (G&#8208;pGMAAQ) to simultaneously regulate the evolution of sulfur and lithium species. Combining theoretical calculations and experiments, it is revealed that G&#8208;pGMAAQ serves as a redox mediator that reduces the LiPSs conversion energy barrier, and its unique polar brush&#8208;like structure effectively inhibits LiPSs shuttling and homogenizes Li+ flow. Hence, G&#8208;pGMAAQ facilitates lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries stable operation in an ultra&#8208;wide temperature range (&#8722;40&#8211;70&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell achieves an energy density of 417&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, demonstrating the commercial potential of polymer brushes for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

Rb&#8208;Cs alloyed quasi&#8208;2D perovskites with low&#8208;threshold ASEs and exceptional spectral stability are synthesized. Tuning Rb&#8208;Cs ratio enables broad ASE tunability across blue and green regions. Alloying optimizes the inter&#8208;well energy transfer and suppresses Auger recombination, yielding a record&#8208;low ASE threshold, &#8776;50% lower than mixed&#8208;halide perovskites. Their micro&#8208;ring laser arrays exhibit high Q&#8208;factors and low thresholds, showcasing superior lasing performance.








Abstract
Blue&#8208;green lasers are essential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics. While GaN&#8208;InGaN lasers offer excellent performance, their complex fabrication and challenges in precise bandgap tuning remain significant limitations. Hybrid lead halide perovskites present a promising alternative, with tunable bandgaps and cost&#8208;effective solution processing. However, halide migration in these materials causes spectral instability and luminescence shifts under operational conditions. Here, a novel class of Rb&#8208;Cs alloyed quasi&#8208;2D perovskites is introduced that achieve both low amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) thresholds and exceptional spectral stability. By precisely tuning the Rb&#8208;Cs ratio, it realizes ASE across the blue&#8208;green spectrum (481&#8211;532&#160;nm). Rb&#8208;Cs alloying critically modulates the quantum well distribution, optimizes the energy landscape, and suppresses Auger recombination, resulting in a record&#8208;low ASE threshold of 1.94 &#181;J&#183;cm&#8722;2&#8212;over 50% lower than that of mixed&#8208;halide perovskites. These materials exhibit remarkable spectral robustness, with ASE spectra remaining stable even after prolonged thermal annealing, thereby overcoming halide migration&#8208;induced degradation. Furthermore, micro&#8208;ring laser arrays fabricated from these Rb&#8208;Cs alloyed perovskites demonstrate superior lasing characteristics, including high&#8208;quality whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode resonances and low lasing thresholds, underscoring their potential for advanced laser technologies.

         <title>Suppressing Metal Dissolution in Multi&#8208;Grained Catalysts Through Intragrain Atomic Ordering for Stable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel approach room&#8208;temperature ultrasound assisted atomic ordering method using to fabricate multi&#8208;grained NiPt nanoalloys with an intermetallic Ni3Pt5 phase. The resulting catalyst exhibits state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art durability and activity in all operational condition of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Structural and electrochemical analyses reveal direct the role of atomic ordering in mitigating metal dissolution, ensuring long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Rational design of catalytic nanomaterials is essential for developing high&#8208;performance fuel cell catalysts. However, structural degradation and elemental dissolution during operation pose significant challenges to achieving long&#8208;term stability. Herein, the development of multi&#8208;grained NiPt nanocatalysts featuring an atomically ordered Ni3Pt5 phase within intragrain is reported. Ultrasound&#8208;assisted synthesis facilitates atomic transposition by supplying sufficient diffusion energy along grain boundaries, enabling unprecedented phase formation. The Ni3Pt5 embedded nanocatalysts exhibit outstanding proton exchange membrane fuel cell performance under both light&#8208;duty and heavy&#8208;duty vehicle conditions, with significantly reduced Ni dissolution. Under light&#8208;duty vehicle conditions, the catalyst achieves a mass activity of 0.94 A&#160;mgPt&#8722;1 and a 421 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current density (@ 0.8 V in air), retaining 78% of its initial mass activity after long&#8208;term operation. Under heavy&#8208;duty vehicle conditions, the multi&#8208;grained nanocrystal demonstrates only an 8% decrease in Pt utilization, a 5% power loss, and a 13 mV voltage drop, surpassing U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)&#160;durability targets. This study underscores the critical role of the atomically ordered Ni3Pt5 phase in stabilizing multi&#8208;grained NiPt nanocrystals, enhancing both durability and catalytic activity. These findings establish Ni3Pt5 embedded nanocatalysts as promising candidate for next&#8208;generation PEMFC applications, addressing key challenges in long&#8208;term operation.

         <title>An Ultrathin Membrane with Bubble&#8208;Raft&#8208;Inspired Single&#8208;Layer Nanofibrous Networks for Efficient and Low&#8208;Resistance Air Filtration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bubble&#8208;raft&#8208;inspired nanofibrous network membrane for efficient and low&#8208;resistance air filtration is fabricated via electrospinning and phase separation. Benefiting from the single&#8208;layer polysulfone nanofibrous network (&#8776;40 nm fiber diameter), the obtained membrane exhibits integrated structural features of small pore size, high porosity, and ultrathin thickness, which endows it with high filtration efficiency, low pressure drop, and high transparency.








Abstract
Airborne particulate matter (PM) is a major global safety concern, significantly straining the ecological environment, human health, and economy. Filtration membranes, essential for PM removal, are challenging in achieving both high efficiency and low air resistance, resulting in a high pressure drop during efficient filtration. Herein, inspired by bubble rafts, an ultrathinnanofibrous network membrane is fabricated by transforming a liquid film of polysulfonesolution on electrospun fibrous scaffold into a single&#8208;layer network via nonsolvent&#8208;induced phase separation. Tailoring of the polysulfone concentration in the liquid film supported by the scaffold and of the phase separation process induced by flowing nonsolvent allows the construction of the single&#8208;layer network with interconnected nanofibers (diameter of &#8776;40&#160;nm). Benefiting from the single&#8208;layer network, the membrane exhibits a small pore size (&#8776;270&#160;nm) at a high porosity of 90.3% and ultrathin thickness of &#8776;800&#160;nm. Consequently, the membrane shows high efficiency (99.8% removal of PM0.3) at an ultralow pressure drop (&lt;40&#160;Pa). Moreover, the membrane exhibits high transparency (&gt;83%) and allows the light breeze (wind speed of 3.2 m s&#8722;1) to pass through easily, enabling energy&#8208;efficient applications, such as window screens. This work provides new insights into designing membranes for efficient and low&#8208;resistance filtration and separation.

         <title>Magnetic Moment Descriptor&#8208;Guided Multifunctional Co Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Enable Wide&#8208;Temperature Uninterrupted Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of CoN4&#8208;X configurations are screened using density functional theory (DFT) simulations through second coordination sphere anion modulation (X = B, O, F, P, S, Cl). The magnetic moment is revealed as a critical descriptor for establishing dual volcano&#8208;type correlations with both chloride ion (Cl&#8722;) adsorption energy and Gibbs free energy of reaction&#8208;related intermediates.








Abstract
Developing chloride ion&#8208;resistant trifunctional catalysts is imperative and of great significance for application in renewable energy&#8208;driven seawater splitting systems (S&#8208;WSS). However, there is currently a lack of unified descriptors for the rational design of catalysts that possess both high corrosion resistance and excellent catalytic activity. Herein, the magnetic moment is proposed as the descriptor through second&#8208;coordination&#8208;shell anion engineering of CoN&#8324; moieties (named as CoN4&#8208;X, X = B/O/F/P/S/Cl). Systematic density functional theory calculations reveal that precisely modulating the spin states of CoN&#8324; centers via X&#8208;anion coordination establishes dual volcano&#8208;type relationships between magnetic moments and the adsorption energetics of Cl&#8315; ions or key reaction intermediates for oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, and hydrogen evolution reactions (ORR/OER/HER). Experimental validation demonstrates the optimized CoN&#8324;&#8208;B configuration&#8208;based catalyst (Co SAs&#8208;N/B&#8208;HCS) achieves minimized Cl&#8315; adsorption energy while delivering exceptional trifunctional ORR/OER/HER activity, as well as excellent stability in chloride ion&#8208;rich seawater&#8208;based environments (over 1000 h for seawater&#8208;based Zn&#8208;air batteries, over 800 h for seawater splitting). Notably, the Co SAs&#8208;N/B&#8208;HCS enables temperature&#8208;adaptive hydrogen production rates of 853 &#181;mol h&#8315;&#185; (60&#160;&#176;C), 616 &#181;mol h&#8315;&#185; (25&#160;&#176;C), and 397 &#181;mol h&#8315;&#185; (&#8722;30&#160;&#176;C). This work establishes a spin state engineering paradigm that simultaneously addresses catalyst corrosion and trifunctional synergy in marine energy systems.

         <title>A Hydrogen&#8208;Aided Rechargeable Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging the faster kinetics and lower overpotential of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), hydrogen&#8208;coupled charging enables the zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) to achieve ultra&#8208;fast and stable cycling performance with superior safety, which positions hydrogen aided battery&#160;(HAB) as a promising solution for electric vehicles to address challenges such as range anxiety and prolonged charging times.








Abstract
Rechargeable metal&#8211;air batteries, despite their high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness, suffer from sluggish cathodic reaction kinetics, resulting in high overpotential and low energy efficiency. In this study, a hydrogen&#8208;aided battery (HAB) based on zinc&#8211;air battery (ZAB) technology, which retains the discharge process of ZAB while introducing hydrogen gas into the cathode during charging, is proposed. The introduction of hydrogen replaces the conventional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), significantly enhancing the electrochemical performance of ZAB. Leveraging the faster kinetics and lower overpotential of HOR, the hydrogen&#8208;coupled charging enables ultra&#8208;fast and stable charging (9 s to 1 mAh cm&#8722;2) with over 200 cycles. Compared to lithium&#8208;ion batteries and fuel cells, HAB exhibits superior safety by eliminating the need for flammable electrolytes and portable hydrogen storage devices. The simultaneous &#8220;refueling&#8221; of hydrogen and electricity offers rapid energy replenishment, positioning HAB as a transformative technology for electric vehicles to address key challenges such as range anxiety and prolonged charging durations. This work not only advances the performance of metal&#8211;air batteries but also provides an innovative strategy for integrating hydrogen energy into electrochemical systems.

         <title>Porogen&#8208;Integrated Rapid Oxidation Enables Structured Mesoporous Metal Oxide Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porogen&#8208;integrated rapid oxidation (PiRO) is a method for high throughput manufacturing of mesoporous metal oxide thin films. PiRO generates up to 500 nm thick layers with through&#8208;plane 5&#8211;10 nm spheroidal close&#8208;packed pores at 230&#160;&#176;C in 30 min or less. The reduced temperatures enable deposition on both rigid and flexible polymeric substrates using roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll compatible techniques.









Abstract
Structured metal oxide films have promise in optoelectronics, sensing, energy storage, and catalysis but their uptake is predominately limited due to their long and high&#8208;temperature syntheses. Here, a self&#8208;assembling polymer is used which can act as a chelating fuel source in a solution combustion reaction to generate highly structured mesoporous aluminum oxide films at &lt;250&#160;&#176;C in a matter of minutes through a process termed porogen&#8208;integrated rapid oxidation (PiRO). The resulting films with thicknesses up to 500 nm show an open&#8208;cell, face&#8208;centered cubic structure of spheroidal pores. Further, an additional ligand can be included to control the self&#8208;assembly step to yield both through&#8208;film ordering or tunable disordering for increased pore volume as confirmed by both grazing incidence small angle X&#8208;ray scattering and ellipsometry. Finally, roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturing with PiRO is demonstrated on flexible polymeric substrates. The method offers a tunable, scalable, low&#8208;temperature, and lower&#8208;cost method to generate large&#8208;area structured mesoporous metal oxide films.

         <title>A Broad Range of Aromatic Carboxylic Acids for Photocatalytic Methane Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning identifies key spectroscopic features of aromatic carboxylic acids that enable selective photocatalytic oxygen activation and oxidation of CH&#8324; to methyl trifluoroacetate.








Abstract
Photocatalytic methane (CH&#8324;) activation under mild conditions presents a sustainable strategy for converting methane into valuable chemicals. This study introduces a versatile class of conjugated aromatic carboxylic acids as efficient, metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for CH&#8324; oxidation in sodium chloride&#8208;trifluoroacetic acid (NaCl&#8208;TFA) media. Spectroscopic analysis and machine learning using spectroscopic features further elucidate key structural and electronic factors influencing catalytic activity, offering predictive insights for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. The carboxyl group is important in generating electron&#8208;deficient carboxyl (RC(&#9552;O)O&#8226;) or carboperoxyl radicals (RC(&#9552;O)OO&#8226;), enabling selective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) for CH&#8324; functionalization. Mechanistic investigations indicate the role of acyl chloride intermediates in enhancing reactivity. This work highlights the potential of aromatic carboxylic acids to address the challenges of methane functionalization, paving the way for greener chemical transformations and the utilization of inert feedstocks in sustainable chemistry.

         <title>Bioinspired Heterogeneous Spheres with Tunable Helical Structure for Accurate and Efficient Control of Sugar Blood Level</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the morphology and helical motion of Phacus helicoides, millimeter sized spheres with an inner helical structure are designed. Phacus helicoides can &#8216;mix&#8217; their surrounding medium which facilitates the acquirement of nutrients from the environment and the excretion of metabolites into the environment. Similar to Phacus helicoides, HSs can generate mixing performance under magnetic field, which led to the enhancement toward the adsorption, catalyze, and release capacities of HSs.








Abstract
Oral antidiabetic drugs remain the primary therapeutic strategy for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to its convenience, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and non&#8208;invasive, while achieving glycemic control in &gt;60% of patients. However, compromised bioavailability of oral antidiabetic drugs frequently leads to drug&#8208;induced hypoglycemia (sulfonylureas like glibenclamide), posing significant clinical risks. To address this issue, microstirring oral pills are designed but various challenges remain, including uncontrollable release and low biocompatibility. Here, inspired by the morphology and helical motion of Phacus helicoides, millimeter&#8208;sized spheres with an inner helical structure are designed. Owing to their inner spiral structure, helical spheres (HSs) can simultaneously self&#8208;rotate and move circularly, giving them excellent and controllable mixing capacity via an external magnetic field. Moreover, HSs can imitate metabolic processes, including the adsorption, catalysis, and release capacity of Phacus helicoides, which can effectively reduce postprandial blood glucose levels (&lt;2&#160;h) in rats with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, these novel microstirring oral spheres with inner helical structure can reduce the incidence of hypoglycemia (14.2&#8208;18.6%) of the traditional sulfanilamide drug (glibenclamide) to 3.8%. Thus, it is anticipated that HSs have a potential for drug delivery as microstrring oral pills to improve bioavailability and avoid the drug&#8208;induced hypoglycemia of T2DM patients.

         <title>High Performance P&#8208;Channel Transistor Based on Amorphous Tellurium Trioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a breakthrough in p&#8208;channel transistors by transforming crystalline 2D tellurium into amorphous tellurium trioxide (a&#8208;TeO3) via UV&#8208;O3 treatment. This transformation enhances electronic properties, resulting in transistors with reduced hysteresis, superior on/off characteristics, and low barrier height, highlighting the potential of a&#8208;TeO3 as a novel semiconductor for future advancements in transistor technology.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance p&#8208;channel transistors remains a critical challenge in complementary logic circuits, despite significant advances in n&#8208;channel transistor technologies. While amorphous oxide semiconductors have revolutionized n&#8208;type transistors, achieving comparable performance for p&#8208;type counterparts has proven elusive. Here, this study demonstrates a breakthrough in p&#8208;channel technology by transforming crystalline 2D tellurium (2D&#8208;Te) into amorphous tellurium trioxide (a&#8208;TeO3) through UV ozone treatment. This structural transformation, directly observed via high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, induces dramatic changes in electronic properties, including significant bandgap widening and enhanced work function. The resulting a&#8208;TeO3&#8208;based p&#8208;channel transistors demonstrate remarkable improvements over crystalline 2D&#8208;Te transistors, featuring reduced hysteresis, superior on/off characteristics, and distinctive mobility behavior at different temperatures and gate fields. Most notably, these transistors achieve exceptionally low barrier height (10 meV) and sheet resistance values, while combining high hole mobility with excellent switching properties. The work not only introduces a novel high&#8208;performance p&#8208;channel semiconductor but also opens new avenues for phase engineering in advanced semiconductor development.

     alt="High Performance P-Channel Transistor Based on Amorphous Tellurium Trioxide"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study introduces a breakthrough in p-channel transistors by transforming crystalline 2D tellurium into amorphous tellurium trioxide (a-TeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) via UV-O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; treatment. This transformation enhances electronic properties, resulting in transistors with reduced hysteresis, superior on/off characteristics, and low barrier height, highlighting the potential of a-TeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a novel semiconductor for future advancements in transistor technology.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of high-performance p-channel transistors remains a critical challenge in complementary logic circuits, despite significant advances in n-channel transistor technologies. While amorphous oxide semiconductors have revolutionized n-type transistors, achieving comparable performance for p-type counterparts has proven elusive. Here, this study demonstrates a breakthrough in p-channel technology by transforming crystalline 2D tellurium (2D-Te) into amorphous tellurium trioxide (a-TeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) through UV ozone treatment. This structural transformation, directly observed via high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, induces dramatic changes in electronic properties, including significant bandgap widening and enhanced work function. The resulting a-TeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based p-channel transistors demonstrate remarkable improvements over crystalline 2D-Te transistors, featuring reduced hysteresis, superior on/off characteristics, and distinctive mobility behavior at different temperatures and gate fields. Most notably, these transistors achieve exceptionally low barrier height (10 meV) and sheet resistance values, while combining high hole mobility with excellent switching properties. The work not only introduces a novel high-performance p-channel semiconductor but also opens new avenues for phase engineering in advanced semiconductor development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthetic Chromatophores for Color and Pattern Morphing Skins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cephalopods use chromatophore organs (muscle&#8208;actuated pigment sacs) to alter their skin color and pattern. Synthetic chromatophores, which closely mimic the mechano&#8208;optical process found in cephalopods using stimuli&#8208;responsive microscale hydrogel actuators, are reported. Hierarchical organization and morphological control of these synthetic chromatophores enable inherently stretchable skins with color and pattern morphing capabilities and rapid response times.








Abstract
The dynamic optical and mechanical properties of cephalopod skin cannot be mimicked using traditional display technologies. Soft materials (and systems thereof) have the potential to realize cephalopod&#8208;like color switching capabilities synthetically. This report describes the fabrication of stretchable arrays of microstructured, stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels, &#8220;synthetic chromatophores,&#8221; that emulate the mechano&#8208;dynamic action of color change found in cephalopods. By combining multiple layers of these synthetic chromatophores, soft skins with color and pattern morphing capabilities that leverage halftone absorption, optical interference, and microlensing are demonstrated. These skins, made entirely of soft materials, are inherently stretchable and can be programmed to respond to specific environmental stimuli, making them well&#8208;suited for applications in soft robotics and human&#8208;machine interfaces.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Bioinspired Rechargeable Cement&#8208;Based Batteries for Low&#8208;Carbon Self&#8208;Powered Buildings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired conifer&#8208;like rechargeable cement&#8208;based batteries for low&#8208;carbon self&#8208;powered buildings is reported. This direction pore structure enhances ionic conductivity by four times (32.7 mS cm&#8722;1), while maintaining high mechanical strength (41.6 MPa). The cement&#8208;based battery delivers a remarkable capacity of 114 mAh g&#8722;1 and retaining 63.2% of capacity after 300 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Cement&#8208;based batteries (CEMBs) uniquely integrate energy storage and load&#8208;bearing functions, offering transformative potential for self&#8208;powered and sustainable buildings. Unfortunately, their application is greatly hindered by low capacity and limited cycle life. The high tortuosity of ion transport at the centimeter scale, and sluggish kinetics at the electrolyte/electrode interfaces in CEMBs are the two main reasons for the limited energy storage performance. Herein, these issues by designing vertically aligned pore channels in a cement matrix is overcome, mimicking the tracheid structure of conifer. This bioinspired design reduces the ion transport tortuosity from 7.80 to 2.86, resulting in a fourfold increase in ion conductivity (to 32.7 mS cm&#8722;1), while maintaining high mechanical strength (41.6&#160;MPa). The quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state CEMBs demonstrate superior performance, delivering a remarkable capacity of 114 mAh g&#8722;1 and retaining 63.2% of their capacity after 300 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1. In comparison, traditional CEMBs exhibit a lower initial capacity of 62 mAh g&#8722;1 and experience rapid degradation, losing functionality after just 75 cycles. Impressively, the bioinspired CEMBs can simultaneously charge a mobile phone and endure external mechanical loads, showcasing their dual functionality. This innovative bioinspired design presents a promising pathway for scaling up cement&#8208;based energy storage systems to enable low&#8208;carbon, self&#8208;powered buildings.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Nanopatterning of Binary Nanoparticles in Nonpolar Solvent via Combined Dielectrophoretic and Coulombic Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing net charges of NPs in nonpolar solvent, dielectrophoretic attraction and Coulombic modulation are combined to achieve distinct particle densities at oppositely charged surfaces. This selective assembly enables efficient submicron&#8208;scale separation of NP mixtures and forms complex binary NP patterns in one step, offering a powerful and direct route for assembling and integrating multiple NPs into advanced multifunctional nanodevices.








Abstract
Precise nanofabrication of diverse nanoparticles (NPs) with high spatial resolution is crucial for developing advanced nanodevices. While various bottom&#8208;up approaches have been developed, limitations such as complex overlay steps, contamination risks, and low spatial resolution still exist. Here, an approach is presented for sub&#8208;micron spatial resolution nanopatterning of binary NPs. By utilizing net charges of NPs dispersed in nonpolar solvent, dielectrophoretic attraction and sign&#8208;dependent Coulombic modulation are combined to achieve distinct particle densities at oppositely charged surfaces. This selective assembly enables efficient separation of NP mixtures at submicron scales, facilitating the formation of complex binary NP patterns in a single step. The technique offers a powerful and direct route for assembling and integrating multiple NPs, providing a new way for advanced multifunctional nanodevices.

         <title>Guiding Polaritonic Energy and Momentum Through 2D Bravais Lattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monolayer MoS2 based Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot microcavity is used to form polaritons. The directional flow control of polaritonic energy and momentum is facilitated by designing five types of 2D Bravais lattices based on PMMA nanopillars, which are fabricated on top of monolayer MoS2, as demonstrated through angle&#8208;resolved reflectance measurements. The unique ability to control exciton&#8208;polariton dispersion will advance its applications in photonics and quantum technologies.








Abstract
Controlling polariton dispersion facilitates the study of various new physical phenomena, such as Bose&#8208;Einstein condensation, polariton lasing, and coherent quantum fluid dynamics, with manual control remaining an area of ongoing exploration. In this work, monolayer MoS2 based Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot microcavity is used to form polaritons. Five types of Bravais lattices based on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) nanopillars are intentionally designed. The energy overlap between the periodic PMMA scattering wave and the polariton establishes a coupling channel that controls the directional flow of polaritonic energy, as demonstrated through angle&#8208;resolved reflectance measurements. Back&#8208;space image measurements further demonstrate that the dispersion in reciprocal space can be directly and manually tuned, allowing for control over their number and their positions. The coupling between the polariton and PMMA scattering wave is further demonstrated by analyzing the reflectance using temporal coupled&#8208;mode theory. The symmetries of 2D Bravais lattices allow the angle between energy and momentum flow to vary widely, and the position of the dispersion branch in a specific direction can be fine&#8208;tuned via lattice constant, enabling full&#8208;range control over polariton dispersion. This work presents the first theoretical and experimental demonstrations of guiding the direction of polaritonic energy and momentum through Bravais lattice design.

         <title>Highly Efficient Cooling via Synergistic Electro&#8208;Thermal Phase Changes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>

Featuring low energy consumption and easy integration with modern electronic, electrocaloric polymer is a highly promising alternative to vapor&#8208;compression systems. Here, the synergistic electro&#8208;thermal phase change methodology boosted the performance of electrocaloric materials, achieving a dramatic temperature drop in simulated electronic chip cooling. This methodology opened up a new way for enhancing the entropy change of electrocaloric materials.








Abstract
Electro&#8208;phase change materials (electro&#8208;PCM), based on the electrocaloric effect, have attracted significant attention and achieved rapid development in the field of cooling technology owing to their environmental protection, low energy consumption, and miniaturization. However, due to their limited isothermal entropy change and thermal conductivity, the cooling capacity of the electro&#8208;PCM devices has severely limited their cooling effect on electronic devices. Here, with the synergistic electro&#8208;thermal phase changes, the entropy change and thermal conductivity of electro&#8208;PCM are significantly improved by stacking it with thermo&#8208;phase change materials (thermo&#8208;PCM). Compared with that of the electro&#8208;PCM, the entropy change and thermal conductivity of electro&#8208;thermal phase change materials (ETPCM) stack can be up to 4.68&#8208;fold (from 28.31 to 132.35 J kg&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at electric field of 100 MV m&#8722;1) and 2.39&#8208;fold (from 0.18 to 0.43&#160;W m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1), respectively. The practicality of this strategy has also been fully validated by cooling a simulated electronic chip (1.75&#160;W cm&#8722;2) with a temperature drop of 49.32 K after constructing ETPCM stack&#8208;based cooling device using the electrostatic actuation prototype. The synergistic enhancement of entropy change and thermal conductivity paves the way for the future direction of electrocaloric cooling toward interdisciplinary fusion.

         <title>Responsive Metasurface for Directional Control of Laser and Thermal Emission Dynamic Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multispectral&#8208;responsive metasurface simultaneously modulates directional laser reflection and dynamic infrared emissivity, enabling robust dual&#8208;band camouflage and dual&#8208;modal anti&#8208;counterfeiting. By synergistically integrating spatial and spectral control, this approach greatly expands capabilities for manipulating multiple physical parameters, providing a versatile approach for advanced information encryption, holography, and thermal management applications in complex scenarios.









Abstract
Responsive metasurfaces can efficiently control the propagation and spectral properties of electromagnetic (EM) waves, emerging as an attractive technology in energy and information fields. However, achieving non&#8208;interference manipulation of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser wavelength and mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) region with spatial and spectral responsive capabilities is a challenging and long&#8208;sought task for applications, such as multispectral adaptive camouflage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Here, a multispectral responsive metasurface is demonstrated that enables independent modulation of MIR thermal emission while maintaining robust, spatially directional control of NIR laser reflections. This metasurface simultaneously achieves superior ultralow specular reflectivity of 0.049 (0.8&#8211;1.2 &#181;m) and high thermal emission regulation capability of 0.51 (8&#8211;13 &#181;m), attributed to NIR reflection splitting and a photonically amplified metal&#8208;insulator transition, respectively. The metasurface's exceptional capability to realize temperature&#8208;invariant NIR laser and dynamic MIR camouflage is experimentally proved under significant fluctuating thermal environments, superior to existing laser&#8208;IR&#8208;compatible camouflage technologies. Dual&#8208;mode information anti&#8208;counterfeiting is further demonstrated through independent channels for detection angles and temperature responses. This work provides a new pathway for stimulus&#8208;responsive materials with spatial and spectral modulation toward diverse multispectral application scenarios.

         <title>All&#8208;Dielectric Ultra&#8208;Broadband Microwave Absorbing Aerogel with Optimized Dielectric Dispersion via Dielectric Relaxation Time Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating fluorinated graphene into MXene aerogels, hydrogen bonding, and interfacial charge separation extend the dielectric relaxation time, enabling ultrathin (2.54 mm), lightweight (34.4 mg cm&#8315;3) all&#8208;dielectric broadband microwave absorption (9.08 GHz) due to the optimized dielectric dispersion law. The composite also delivers high compressive strength, rapid Joule heating, and excellent thermal insulation.








Abstract
The limited conceptual understanding and lack of effective techniques for optimizing dielectric dispersion continue to hinder the development of all&#8208;dielectric broadband microwave&#8208;absorbing materials (MAMs) with minimal thickness. In this study, a strong theoretical correlation between dielectric relaxation time and dielectric dispersion behavior is established by applying the ideal dielectric dispersion law in conjunction with Debye theory. This led to a strategic approach aimed at extending the relaxation time to optimize dielectric dispersion and achieve broadband microwave absorption without incorporating magnetic components. To realize this, fluorinated graphene (FG) is engineered to stack with MXene nanosheets, resulting in the fabrication of MXene/fluorinated graphene/cellulose nanofibers (MXene/FG/CNFs) aerogels. This configuration significantly extended the dielectric relaxation time of interfacial dipoles from 9.2&#160;ps in MXene/CNFs to 19.5&#160;ps in MXene/FG/CNFs aerogels, corresponding to a fluorine content of 35% in FG. This extension is attributed to increased interfacial dipole moments from strong electronic delocalization induced by highly electronegatively fluorine atoms. The improved structure yield progressively optimized dielectric dispersion, resulting in a maximum effective absorption bandwidth (EABmax) of 9.08&#160;GHz at a thickness of 2.54&#160;mm and a low density of 34.4&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;3. Moreover, the hybrid aerogel also exhibited fascinating Joule heating, thermal insulation, and compressive strength.

         <title>Liquid Bridges Mediate Crack Initiation, Propagation, and Coalescence to Suppress Film Failure within Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold films deposited on capillary&#8208;stabilized fluidic cushion of ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;infused nanopillar arrays show enhanced stability under large strains (&#8764; 180%) by effective control, mediated through liquid bridges, of film cracking progress, combined with exceptional strain&#8208;responsive sensitivity of resistance change by the cracking mechanism, this strategy offers a fluid&#8208;mechanics&#8208;based approach for robust wearable devices and soft robotic systems operating under extreme mechanical deformation.








Abstract
Recent flexible electronics with conformal interfaces between devices and human bodies are prone to receive circuit failure caused by uncontrollable cracking during physiological movements. A structural engineering strategy is reported that utilizes capillary&#8208;stabilized liquid bridges to spontaneously mediate crack initiation, propagation, and coalescence for film reinforcement. Specifically, rigid nanowire array are decorated onto flexible polydimethylsiloxane substrates and the nanoscale gaps between the nanowires are filled with non&#8208;volatile ionic liquids to form well&#8208;regulated meniscus. Using metal films as a model, it is found that stretchability of an Au film deposited on this meniscus exceeds that of its flat counterpart (180 vs 30%). In&#8208;situ optical observations and fluid dynamics analyses show that liquid bridge forces mechanically hinder the propagating of crack fronts and simultaneously initiate new cracks in different locations, leading to dispersed small cracks at strains below 80%. This scattering of cracks prevents the concentrated propagation and merging of cracks into penetrating fractures, with effective electrical percolation of Au films even under a high strain of 160%, which contrasts sharply with the counterparts without liquids where penetrating cracks occur at a small strain of &#8776;10%. Results indicate fluid mechanics as a versatile approach to reprogram film cracking for high&#8208;performance electronics.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a dual&#8208;mode NO2&#8208;humidity sensing platform based on Pt single&#8208;atom sensitized Nb2CTx nanosheets, enabling simultaneous high&#8208;performance time&#8208;domain NO2 and frequency&#8208;domain humidity sensing.

Real&#8208;time in situ detection of NO2 is crucial for ensuring industrial safety and healthcare. However, conventional gas sensors face challenges from environmental humidity interference, limiting their reliability in practical applications. This study presents a dual&#8208;mode, full&#8208;range NO2&#8208;humidity sensing platform based on Pt single&#8208;atom&#8208;sensitized Nb2CTx nanosheets (Pt SA&#8208;Nb2CTx) integrated with TPU fiber mats (Pt SA&#8208;Nb2CTx@TPU). Combining resistive gas sensing and capacitive humidity sensing within a single device, this platform enables simultaneous NO2 and humidity detection with full&#8208;range humidity tolerance. The uniformly dispersed Pt single&#8208;atoms on the Nb2CTx nanosheets catalyze oxygen molecule dissociation and provide additional surface&#8208;active adsorption sites, achieving a 9.1&#8208;fold improvement in resistance response to 5&#160;ppm NO2 and a 25.7&#8208;fold increase in capacitance response at 95% relative humidity. Importantly, the unaffected capacitive response allows precise calibration of NO2 concentration using resistance and capacitance, ensuring accurate NO2 detection across diverse and fluctuating humidity. Leveraging time&#8208; and frequency&#8208;domain NO2&#8208;humidity sensing capability, the Pt SA&#8208;Nb2CTx@TPU sensor is successfully integrated into self&#8208;designed functional modules to realize humidity tracking, industrial NO2 concentration alarming in full&#8208;humidity range as well as asthma prevention and alarm applications. This study offers a novel solution for humidity&#8208;compensated NO2 detection, advancing the applicability of gas sensors in complex and dynamic environments.

         <title>Roll&#8208;To&#8208;Roll Twisted Aerogel Yarns with Reinforced Structure and Low Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aerogels have exceptional thermal insulation properties, but often exhibit less satisfactory mechanical properties in textile applications. This issue is addressed by processing aerogel particles into continuous macroscopic yarns based on a roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll format through a twist&#8208;induced fibrillation method using 2D nanofiber membranes as mediators. The resulting aerogel yarns show high strength, ideal flexibility, and impressive thermal insulation properties.








Abstract
Aerogels have been considered as super thermal insulators. However, they often exhibit less satisfactory mechanical properties for textile application due to their fragility and poor processability. These problems are overcome through a twisting&#8208;induced fibrillation method, using 2D nanofiber membranes as mediators, to process aerogel particles into continuous macroscopic yarns based on a roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll format. A low concentration of strong nanofiber host in twisted form provides structural support to the aerogel particles and preserves their porous architecture. Despite the high&#8208;volume ratio (&#8776;78%) of aerogel particles, the aerogel yarns show high strength, ideal flexibility, and impressive thermal insulation properties. Textiles woven with the aerogel yarns are warmer than cashmere. The aerogel textile is extremely stable under temperatures of &#8722;196 and 100&#160;&#176;C, mechanical deformation, and even washing. This technology provides a flexible platform to extend the function (e.g., dyeability, hydrophobicity, and Joule heating) of aerogel yarns and textiles to suit various use scenarios.

         <title>3D&#8208;Architectured Acceptor with High Photoluminescence Quantum Yield and Moderate Crystallinity for High&#8208;efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Low Voltage Loss</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategic embedding of 3D norbornene units in fused&#8208;ring acceptors suppresses excessive aggregation, synergistically boosting photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and achieving a record&#8208;breaking power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.4% and an extremely low voltage loss (Vloss) of 0.548 V in organic solar cells.








Abstract
This study outlines a molecular design approach that entails integrating 3D structural motifs into the central core or terminal groups of fused&#8208;ring acceptor molecules, specifically, LLZ1, LLZ2, and LLZ3&#8211;by incorporating a 3D architecture unit of norbornene. The objective is to modulate the aggregation behavior of these molecules by modifying their molecular structure, thereby enhancing the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) values of the acceptor materials and reducing the non&#8208;radiative recombination voltage loss in the corresponding devices. Our research findings demonstrate that the introduction of norbornene units effectively suppresses excessive molecular aggregation and significantly improves the PLQY values of the acceptor molecules. Further research has demonstrated that only the acceptor molecule LLZ1, characterized by both high PLQY and moderate crystallinity, can strike an optimal balance between the dual requirements of reducing voltage loss and enhancing charge transport in the device. Utilizing the preferred molecule LLZ1, we achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.0% in binary system and 20.4% in ternary device with much&#8208;reduced voltage loss of 0.508V, which is among the highest values of current OSCs. In summary, this work provides novel insights and research directions for the development of OSCs with low voltage loss and high PCE.

         <title>Increasing the Stability of Deep Blue Phosphor&#8208;Sensitized OLEDs Using the Polariton&#8208;Enhanced Purcell Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polariton&#8208;enhanced Purcell (PEP) effect is demonstrated to enhance the stability of the deep blue phosphor&#8208;sensitized fluorescent (PSF) OLEDs by 3.1 X compared to PSF diodes lacking this effect. In addition, PSF&#8208;OLEDs exhibit reduced EQE roll&#8208;off and deep blue color emission. The PEP effect maximally extends PSF&#8208;OLED lifetimes in devices with the highest triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet energy transfer rates. This work suggests that the benefits of PEPs apply to all triplet&#8208;based OLEDs.









Abstract
The stability of efficient, deep blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) remains a major challenge in the field of organic electronics. Poor device stability originates from the high probability for destructive non&#8208;radiative triplet exciton annihilation events. Phosphor&#8208;sensitized fluorescence (PSF) is proposed to achieve an efficient, deep blue color by energy transfer from phosphors to fluorophores. Recently, the polariton&#8208;enhanced Purcell (PEP) effect is introduced to decrease the triplet radiative lifetime and density, resulting in an increase in blue phosphorescent OLED lifetime. Here, the PEP effect is introduced to enhance the stability of the PSF&#8208;OLEDs. It is shown that the PEP effect increases all radiative decay rates of the phosphors and fluorophores, leading to a reduction in the triplet annihilation events. Using a Pt&#8208;complex phosphor sensitizer and a so&#8208;called multi&#8208;resonance fluorescent emitter in a PEP cavity, a 3.1&#8208;fold lifetime increase is observed at a current density of J = 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, reduced EQE roll&#8208;off and deep blue color with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates of (0.13, 0.09). The PEP effect maximally extends PSF&#8208;OLED lifetimes in devices with the highest triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet energy transfer rates. Moreover, this work suggests that the benefits of PEPs apply to all triplet&#8208;based OLEDs.

         <title>Hair&#8208;Like Mechanoluminescent Structures with Ultralow Activation Threshold for Dynamic Force Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanoluminescence microcilia array film with a bionic hair&#8208;like structure achieves an ultralow activation threshold of just 10&#160;mN&#8212;the lowest reported to date&#8212;enabled by stress concentration. With excellent sensitivity to dynamic mechanical stimuli, mechanoluminescence&#8208;derived texture discrimination and Braille recognition with high accuracy is demonstrated for the first time via integration with an image&#8208;based machine learning approach.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML)&#8208;based sensing technology opens up new opportunities for photonic/electronic skin due to their self&#8208;powered nature, visible spatial mapping of mechanical stimuli, and intrinsic responses to dynamic forces. However, challenges such as weak brightness and high activation threshold have hindered their development. Inspired by hair&#8208;like structures of human skin, skin&#8208;bionic mechanoluminescent PDMS/ZnS:Cu microcilia array film (MLMCA) is fabricated using a magnetic field&#8208;assisted template method.

     alt="Hair-Like Mechanoluminescent Structures with Ultralow Activation Threshold for Dynamic Force Sensing"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanoluminescence microcilia array film with a bionic hair-like structure achieves an ultralow activation threshold of just 10&#160;mN&#8212;the lowest reported to date&#8212;enabled by stress concentration. With excellent sensitivity to dynamic mechanical stimuli, mechanoluminescence-derived texture discrimination and Braille recognition with high accuracy is demonstrated for the first time via integration with an image-based machine learning approach.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanoluminescence (ML)-based sensing technology opens up new opportunities for photonic/electronic skin due to their self-powered nature, visible spatial mapping of mechanical stimuli, and intrinsic responses to dynamic forces. However, challenges such as weak brightness and high activation threshold have hindered their development. Inspired by hair-like structures of human skin, skin-bionic mechanoluminescent PDMS/ZnS:Cu microcilia array film (MLMCA) is fabricated using a magnetic field-assisted template method. The MLMCA exhibits tunable aspect ratios and ML intensity, with the underlying relationship between microcilia structure and ML performance clarified through finite element analysis. The MLMCA achieves an ultralow activation threshold at the micronewton level (&#8776;10 mN) owing to the stress concentration induced by high aspect ratio. With excellent sensitivity to dynamic mechanical stimuli, the MLMCA enables texture recognition with an accuracy of 99.95% when integrated with the image machine learning approach. Furthermore, an ML-based Braille-to-speech translation system is developed and achieved a high recognition accuracy of 96.74%. This study not only tackles the persistent limitation of high activation thresholds in ML-based sensing but also pioneers the practical use of ML-based tactile sensing in texture discrimination and Braille reading.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A broadband, self&#8208;powered photodetector is developed by integrating Cl&#8208;substituted 2D perovskites with MoS2/WSe2 heterostructures via interface engineering. The device enables weak&#8208;light detection down to 0.54&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2, offering enhanced carrier transport and photogating effects. This strategy highlights a general approach to boosting the performance of 2D material&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;weak light detection represents a critical enabling technology for next&#8208;generation imaging, remote monitoring, and autonomous systems, where efficient charge transfer is essential to achieve ultralow detection thresholds. Herein, an interfacial lattice&#8208;distortion engineering strategy is proposed by selectively substituting phenylethyl ammonium (PEA) cations with 4&#8208;chlorophenylethylammonium (Cl&#8208;PEA) at perovskite heterointerfaces. This substitution induces beneficial octahedral distortions, boosting hole transport efficiency in few&#8208;layer 2D perovskites by 26%. When integrated with MoS2/WSe2 heterostructures, the optimized van der Waals contact and enhanced energy&#8208;level alignment yield a high&#8208;performance photodetection, including a responsivity of 2.7 &#215; 104 A/W, a detectivity up to 5.26 &#215; 1014&#160;Jones, and an exceptionally low noise equivalent power of 0.42&#160;fW&#160;Hz&#8722;1/2. Notably, the device operates self&#8208;powered at incident power densities as low as 0.54&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2, enabling real&#8208;time, on&#8208;chip image processing even under dim&#8208;light conditions. This functionality is further utilized for noise reduction in traffic&#8208;light images prior to object detection with YOLOv11 network, establishing a direct bridge between device&#8208;level photodetection and machine&#8208;learning&#8208;driven recognition. This interfacial lattice distortion engineering paradigm in van der Waals&#8208;contacted 2D devices opens new avenues for designing ultrasensitive, low&#8208;noise, and functionally integrated optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Liver&#8208;Targeted Tolerogenic Vaccines: A Nano&#8208;Membrane Coupled Approach for Autoimmune Disease Therapies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tolerogenic vaccine based on a membrane&#8208;nanoemulsion is developed to specifically target hepatic antigen&#8208;presenting cells. These cells recognize signals such as phosphatidylserine on the membrane; while, reducing the expression of costimulatory molecules. This contributes to a deficiency in T cell activation signals and induces multiple subsets of regulatory T cells and regulatory B cells, protecting against autoimmune tissue damage.









Abstract
The co&#8208;delivery of auto&#8208;antigens and immunomodulators for tolerance induction holds great potential in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. However, their efficacy in enriching antigens within target cells remains limited, and the use of immunomodulators poses a risk for systemic immunosuppression. Here, an apoptotic erythrocyte&#8208;derived membrane is developed for the first time, demonstrating its strong abilities to target hepatic antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) and stimulate negative regulatory pathways. These apoptotic cell membranes are engineered onto the surface of intravenous lipid emulsions encapsulating disease&#8208;associated antigens to generate a tolerogenic vaccine. This nano&#8208;membrane coupled structure facilitates robust antigen loading, efficient liver delivery, and uptake by hepatic APCs; while, concurrently downregulating the expression of costimulatory molecules to promote immune tolerance. Intravenous administration of this tolerogenic vaccine induces multiple regulatory cell subpopulations, particularly IL&#8208;10 secreting T cells, regulatory B cells, and memory regulatory T cells, collectively conferring effective protection against celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes in murine models. More importantly, it is demonstrated that this vaccine induces antigen&#8208;specific immune tolerance without compromising the normal immune responses to other antigens. The findings provide solid support for the application of this hepatic APCs&#8208;targeted tolerogenic vaccine as a versatile and translatable platform for combating autoimmune diseases.

         <title>Breaking the Reversibility Barrier in Zn&#8208;Air Systems With Dual&#8208;Electrolyte Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A separated Zn&#8208;air system is proposed to suppress hydrogen evolution and dendrites via dual&#8208;electrolyte architecture, resolving anode passivation and cathodic catalyst degradation. Integrating iodine redox chemistry enables low&#8208;voltage charging and aligns energy storage with other sustainable and green applications. 








Abstract
In response to the escalating demand for advanced energy storage solutions and the pursuit of safer, more sustainable alternatives to conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries, addressing the reversibility and stability challenges of Zn anodes in Zn&#8208;air batteries has become imperative. To tackle these issues, particularly under alkaline conditions, a unique separated Zn&#8208;air system (SZAS) is demonstrated. This system conducts the charging process in a near&#8208;neutral electrolyte, significantly suppressing hydrogen evolution reactions and dendrite growth while discharging occurs in an alkaline electrolyte to maximize voltage output. This design effectively addresses passivation layer formation and prolongs cathode lifespan by preventing catalyst deactivation and element loss during high&#8208;voltage oxygen evolution reactions (OER). The SZASs demonstrate a 99.84% Coulombic efficiency over 5000 cycles in nearly neutral electrolytes and a discharging energy density reaching 218&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in alkaline electrolyte, showing promise in advanced energy storage techniques. Additionally, replacing OER with iodine oxidation reaction reduces charging voltage to 1.5&#160;V and achieves a 3.7&#160;V output via serial discharging. This work proposes the separation engineering of battery architectures, integrating benefits from diverse electrolyte environments, and paves the way for aligning advancements in energy storage, waste management, material recycling, and sustainable power solutions for electric vehicles.

         <title>Breaking Apoptosis&#8208;Induced Immune Silence: Ultrasound&#8208;Activated Nano&#8208;Oncolytic Therapy Reinvigorates Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasound (US)&#8211;activated nano&#8208;oncolytic system, cRGD&#8208;Lip@PFP is introduced, which induces necroptosis&#8208;like oncolytic cell death. This method triggers the explosive release of DAMPs and activates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, resulting in a more potent antitumor immune response than conventional apoptosis&#8208;based therapies. This innovative strategy markedly enhances tumor immunogenicity and remodels immunosuppression to effectively improve the efficacy of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Conventional tumor therapies typically depend on the apoptotic pathway, which often leads to inadequate immunogenicity. This limitation underscores the urgent need for innovative treatments that enhance immunogenicity. In this study, an ultrasound (US)&#8208;activated nano&#8208;oncolytic system (designated as cRGD&#8208;Lip@PFP), is presented and consists of nanoliposomes (Lip) modified with the cRGD peptide for targeted tumor delivery. This system features a perfluoropentane (PFP) core that undergoes US&#8208;triggered acoustomechanical effects, enabling controlled expansion from nanoscale to microscale, ultimately leading to rupture and the generation of cavitation effects. Intracellular cavitation further induces necroptosis&#8208;like oncolytic cell death. The efficacy of various treatments in stimulating immune responses is systematically compared and it is demonstrated that the nano&#8208;oncolytic system effectively enhances the release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Additionally, the release of DNA fragments activates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, resulting in an amplified immune response. Furthermore, this nano&#8208;oncolytic system alleviates the hypoxic tumor microenvironment and counteracts immunosuppression. Compared to traditional apoptosis, the necroptosis&#8208;like oncolytic cell death induced by this strategy exhibits enhanced immunogenicity. This approach presents an innovative paradigm for tumor immunotherapy based on acoustomechanical effects, offering a promising alternative to tackle the issue of insufficient immunogenicity often associated with conventional apoptosis therapies.

This innovative strategy markedly enhances tumor immunogenicity and remodels immunosuppression to effectively improve the efficacy of immunotherapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional tumor therapies typically depend on the apoptotic pathway, which often leads to inadequate immunogenicity. This limitation underscores the urgent need for innovative treatments that enhance immunogenicity. In this study, an ultrasound (US)-activated nano-oncolytic system (designated as cRGD-Lip@PFP), is presented and consists of nanoliposomes (Lip) modified with the cRGD peptide for targeted tumor delivery. This system features a perfluoropentane (PFP) core that undergoes US-triggered acoustomechanical effects, enabling controlled expansion from nanoscale to microscale, ultimately leading to rupture and the generation of cavitation effects. Intracellular cavitation further induces necroptosis-like oncolytic cell death. The efficacy of various treatments in stimulating immune responses is systematically compared and it is demonstrated that the nano-oncolytic system effectively enhances the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Additionally, the release of DNA fragments activates the cGAS-STING pathway, resulting in an amplified immune response. Furthermore, this nano-oncolytic system alleviates the hypoxic tumor microenvironment and counteracts immunosuppression. Compared to traditional apoptosis, the necroptosis-like oncolytic cell death induced by this strategy exhibits enhanced immunogenicity. This approach presents an innovative paradigm for tumor immunotherapy based on acoustomechanical effects, offering a promising alternative to tackle the issue of insufficient immunogenicity often associated with conventional apoptosis therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anchoring Nickel and Stabilizing Oxygen in Coherent LiNiO2@LiFePO4 Composite Cathode Materials for Rechargeable Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LiNiO2@LiFePO4 composite material with coherent combination exhibits remarkable cyclability, rate capability and high first&#8208;cycle Coulombic efficiency. The coherent oriented channels favor the reversible and rapid lithium&#8208;ion transport with suppressed strain accumulation while phosphate anions anchored on the LiNiO2 surface stabilizes Ni sites, mitigating surface degradation.








Abstract
LiNiO2 is an appealing cathode material for Li&#8208;ion batteries because of high energy density and low cost but suffers from irreversible phase transition and surface instability. Herein, a ball&#8208;milled LiNiO2@LiFePO4 composite with oriented coherent combination is reported with enhanced structural stability and Li+ diffusion. The coherent oriented channels are demonstrated to favor the reversible and rapid Li+ intercalation during the H2&#8208;H3 phase transition, which significantly alleviates structural strain accumulation. The covalent P&#9472;O bonds anchored on the LiNiO2 surface stabilizes the Ni sites, mitigating surface reconstruction and lattice oxygen loss. The LiNiO2@LiFePO4 cathode exhibits a specific capacity of 210 mAh g&#8722;1 and an initial Coulombic efficiency of 93.7% at 0.1 C, along with a remarkable rate capability of 156 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C. Furthermore, the full cells pairing LiNiO2@LiFePO4 cathode and graphite anode deliver a considerable energy density over 280 Wh kg&#8722;1 and a remarkable capacity retention. This study offers an effective approach of phosphate coalesce to upgrade high&#8208;capacity nickel&#8208;rich oxide cathode materials.

         <title>Fluorine&#8211;Mediated Interfacial Microenvironment for Boosting pH&#8211;Universal CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni species (single atoms and atomic clusters) are successfully anchored onto fluorocarbon substrates (FC), forming a highly efficient and stable CO2RR electrocatalyst. The optimized Ni/FC exhibits excellent FECO in acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. More importantly, Ni/FC can maintain excellent FECO while operating at industrial currents density for 3000&#160;h. Mechanistic studies reveal that the high&#8211;electronegativity of F will cause the formation of a positive C&#948;+ center, which inhibits the adsorption of hydrogen and elevates the dissociation energy barrier of interfacial water, thereby suppressing the competitive HER process.








Abstract
Achieving highly efficient and stable conversion of carbon dioxide&#160;reduction reaction (CO2RR) into value&#8208;added chemicals at industrial current density is crucial but challenging due to its complex gas&#8211;solid&#8211;liquid interface. Here the local microenvironment of three&#8211;phase interface is successfully regulated to boost the CO2RR performance of Ni species in the universal pH range by introducing the highly electronegative F. The optimized Ni/FC achieves high&#8211;performance in converting CO2 to CO with Faraday efficiencies (FEs) over 90% in pH&#8211;universal conditions, while the main product of Ni/C is H2, especially under acidic conditions. Significantly, it can steadily operate at a high current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 3000&#160;h in a broad pH range, outperforming most recently reported CO2RR electrocatalysts. Detail in situ experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the presence of highly electronegative F will cause the formation of a positive C&#948;+ center, which inhibits the adsorption of hydrogen and increases the dissociation energy barrier of interfacial water, thereby suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work highlights the importance of regulating the local microenvironment of interfacial water, providing a new perspective in the field of electrocatalysis for suppressing competitive HER.

Innovative ferroelectric bioelectronics (FerroE) that integrate neuron&#8208;preferred flexible and topographical properties and neuron&#8208;similar behaviors enable seamless integration and adaptive communication with both Peripheral Nervous System and Central Nervous System. These neuron&#8208;like interface materials and bioelectronics that possess indistinguishable features from neurons, will open new opportunities for next&#8208;generation brain&#8211;machine interfaces, tissue engineering materials, and biomedical devices.








Abstract
Implantable bioelectronics, which are essential to neuroscience studies, neurological disorder treatment, and brain&#8211;machine interfaces, have become indispensable communication bridges between biological systems and the external world through sensing, monitoring, or manipulating bioelectrical signals. However, conventional implantable bioelectronic devices face key challenges in adaptive interfacing with neural tissues due to their lack of neuron&#8208;preferred properties and neuron&#8208;similar behaviors. Here, innovative neuron&#8208;inspired ferroelectric bioelectronics (FerroE) are reported that consists of biocompatible polydopamine&#8208;modified barium titanate nanoparticles, ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) copolymer, and cellular&#8208;scale micropyramid array structures, imparting adaptive interfacing with neural systems. These FerroE not only achieve neuron&#8208;preferred flexible and topographical properties, but also offer neuron&#8208;similar behaviors including highly efficient and stable light&#8208;induced polarization change, superior capability of producing electric signals, and seamless integration and adaptive communication with neurons. Moreover, the FerroE allows for adaptive interfacing with both peripheral and central neural networks of mice, enabling regulation of their heart rate and motion behavior in a wireless, non&#8208;genetic, and non&#8208;contact manner. Notably, the FerroE demonstrates unprecedented structural and functional stability and negligible immune response even after 3 months of implantation in vivo. Such bioinspired FerroE are opening new opportunities for next&#8208;generation brain&#8211;machine interfaces, tissue engineering materials, and biomedical devices.

         <title>Reward Driven Workflows for Unsupervised Explainable Analysis of Phases and Ferroic Variants From Atomically Resolved Imaging Data</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reward&#8208;driven workflows enable fully unsupervised segmentation of atomically resolved STEM images, revealing phases and ferroic variants without any labels. By encoding domain&#8208;wall straightness and length as explicit rewards, the method automatically tunes clustering and variational&#8208;autoencoder hyperparameters. This physics&#8208;guided optimization yields robust, real&#8208;time mappings of polarization and structural domains for next&#8208;generation autonomous microscopy.








Abstract
Rapid progress in aberration corrected electron microscopy necessitates development of robust methods for the identification of phases, ferroic variants, and other pertinent aspects of materials structure from imaging data. While unsupervised methods for clustering and classification are widely used for these tasks, their performance can be sensitive to hyperparameter selection in the analysis workflow. In this study, the effects of descriptors and hyperparameters are explored on the capability of unsupervised ML methods to distill local structural information, exemplified by the discovery of polarization and lattice distortion in Sm &#8722; dopped&#8197;BiFeO3 (BFO) thin films. It is demonstrated that a reward&#8208;driven approach can be used to optimize these key hyperparameters across the full workflow, where rewards are designed to reflect domain wall continuity and straightness, ensuring that the analysis aligns with the material's physical behavior. This approach allows the discovery of local descriptors that are best aligned with the specific physical behavior, providing insight into the fundamental physics of materials. The reward driven workflow is further extended to disentangle structural factors of variation via an optimized variational autoencoder (VAE). Finally, the importance of well&#8208;defined rewards is explored as a quantifiable measure of the success of the workflow.

This approach allows the discovery of local descriptors that are best aligned with the specific physical behavior, providing insight into the fundamental physics of materials. The reward driven workflow is further extended to disentangle structural factors of variation via an optimized variational autoencoder (VAE). Finally, the importance of well-defined rewards is explored as a quantifiable measure of the success of the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anomalous Phonon Softening with Inherent Strain in Wrinkled Monolayer WSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces the first discovery of a new local strain indicator, A2&#8242;&#8242;(&#915;)$A_2^{^{\prime\prime}}( \Gamma )$ mode, for monolayer WSe2&#8208;based excitonic applications including single photon emitter by using tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy. The correlative investigation with density functional perturbation theory provides the origin of the anomalous appearance of A2&#8242;&#8242;(&#915;)$A_2^{^{\prime\prime}}( \Gamma )$ mode, as well as the applicability for strain engineering.








Abstract
Local deformation is a control knob to dynamically tune the electronic band structure of 2D semiconductors. This study demonstrates the local strain&#8208;dependent phonon properties of monolayer tungsten diselenide, which are investigated by using the scanning tunneling microscopy&#8208;based tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy. The anomalous appearance and softening of the Raman&#8208;inactive out&#8208;of&#8208;plane A2&#8242;&#8242;(&#915;)$A_2^{^{\prime\prime}}( \Gamma )$ mode are first revealed, which exhibits equivalent behavior to other principal phonons of tungsten diselenide. Local strain calculations unveiled the linear proportionalities of A2&#8242;&#8242;(&#915;)$A_2^{^{\prime\prime}}( \Gamma )$ phonon nature on strain and it facilitates the derivation of Gr&#252;neisen parameter by experimental and theoretical approaches. Additionally, the origins of the anomalous appearance of the Raman&#8208;inactive A2&#8242;&#8242;(&#915;)$A_2^{^{\prime\prime}}( \Gamma )$ mode are clearly proved in both classical physics and quantum mechanics. Especially quantum mechanical calculations have precisely described strain&#8208;induced selection rule relaxation by polarizability changes. The first discovery provides a fundamental understanding of the strain&#8208;dependent phonon properties, as well as suggesting a new distinct strain indicator, A2&#8242;&#8242;(&#915;)$A_2^{^{\prime\prime}}( \Gamma )$ mode, for strain engineering.

         <title>Dendritic Cell&#8208;Based Biohybrid Immunomodulator Alleviates Intestinal Inflammatory Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based biohybrid immunomodulator to alleviate intestinal inflammation. The biohybrid immunomodulator is engineered by conjugating resolvin E1&#8208;loaded liposomes with Fas ligand (FasL)&#8208;transfected DCs. The immunomodulator effectively reduces inflammation by selectively eliminating Fas+CD8+ T cells and neutrophils, showing efficient therapeutic potential in both mouse and rabbit models of IBD. This study presents a feasible and customizable strategy for mitigating intestinal inflammation, offering a promising advancement in the treatment of IBD.








Abstract
Inflammation is a key driver of intestinal inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While biologics have demonstrated notable success in treating some patients, there remains a critical need for alternative therapeutic strategies to address primary and secondary non&#8208;responders. In this study, a dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based biohybrid immunomodulator is developed to alleviate intestinal inflammation, demonstrating remarkable efficacy in combating IBD. This biohybrid immunomodulator is engineered by conjugating resolvin E1&#8208;loaded liposomes with Fas ligand (FasL)&#8208;transfected DCs. Elevated Fas expression is observed in intestinal tissue samples from IBD patients, and the immunomodulator effectively reduced inflammation by selectively eliminating Fas+CD8+ T cells and neutrophils. The therapeutic potential of this approach is validated in both mouse and rabbit models of IBD, where it exhibites significant anti&#8208;inflammatory effects. Furthermore, the immunomodulator can be manufactured using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bone marrow&#8208;derived DCs, demonstrating a robust capacity to induce T cell apoptosis. This study presents a feasible and customizable strategy for mitigating intestinal inflammation, offering a promising advancement in the treatment of IBD.

         <title>Selective Electrosynthesis of Methanol from CO2 Over Cu/Cu2P2O7 Via the Formate Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu/Cu2P2O7&#8208;based hybrid catalyst delivers over 50% Faradaic efficiency and &gt;100 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 partial current density for methanol electrosynthesis from CO2. The synergy between Cu (111) facets and Cu2P2O7 promotes HCOOH&#8208;mediated pathways, offering a scalable route for sustainable liquid fuel production.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to methanol offers an eco&#8208;friendly approach to reducing carbon emissions while producing versatile liquid fuels and feedstocks. However, achieving high selectivity for methanol, especially at high current densities, remains challenging due to competing reactions that favor methane and hydrogen formation. Here, the tailored synthesis of Cu/Cu2P2O7&#8208;based hybrid catalysts is reported for efficient and selective methanol production through the discharge of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The catalyst exhibits a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 50% in both H&#8208;cells and gas&#8208;diffusion electrode cells, achieving one of the highest reported methanol partial current densities of over 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Experimental and computational analyses reveal a synergistic effect between Cu nanoparticles with a predominant (111) surface and Cu2P2O7 nanoparticles, which enhances selective methanol production via the HCOOH intermediate pathway. These findings provide insights into designing cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for selective methanol production.

         <title>Microscopic&#8208;Level Anion &amp; Diluent Chemistry in Electrolyte for Aqueous Supercapacitors Operating at High Voltage and Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscopic&#8208;level anion &amp; diluent chemistry strategy is proposed to develop an advanced Ca(ClO4)2/H2O&#8208;acetonitrile (AN) electrolyte that can operate at high voltage and low temperature. The weak interaction of H2O with ClO4&#8722; guarantees strong intramolecular O&#9472;H bonds and resulting electrolyte stability. The AN serves as a solvation diluent capable of weakening electrostatic Ca2+&#8208;ClO4&#8722; attraction, preventing salt precipitation, and finally yielding a high&#8208;performance supercapacitor.








Abstract
Aqueous supercapacitors, serving as safe and green high&#8208;power energy storage devices, hold significant potential in various applications. Exploring advanced electrolytes beyond traditional electrolytes is essential for achieving stable high&#8208;voltage and low&#8208;temperature operations. Herein, a hybrid electrolyte with a high electrochemical stability window (3.29&#160;V) and sufficient ionic conductivity (1.5 mS cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C) is developed via hybridizing 8 m Ca(ClO4)2/H2O with acetonitrile (AN) diluent. The charged Ca2+ cations anchor the oxygen atoms in H2O molecules, preventing them from being hydrogen acceptors. Meanwhile, the ClO4&#8722; anions weakly interact with hydrogen atoms, which ensures strong intramolecular O&#9472;H bonds in 8 m Ca(ClO4)2/H2O. The used AN can contribute to decreased salt dosage, without any compromise to electrochemical stability and safety. Furthermore, the AN with a higher donor number than ClO4&#8722; can replace the ClO4&#8722; in Ca2+ solvation sheaths, which reduces Ca2+&#8722;ClO4&#8722; clusters, accordingly suppressing salt precipitation even at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C. Resultantly, a symmetric supercapacitor assembled with 4.2 m Ca(ClO4)2/H2O&#8208;AN electrolyte presents high&#8208;voltage and temperature&#8208;adaptability features, with excellent rate capability and high long&#8208;term cycling stability from 25 to &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C at 2.3&#160;V.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions weakly interact with hydrogen atoms, which ensures strong intramolecular O&#9472;H bonds in 8 m Ca(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The used AN can contribute to decreased salt dosage, without any compromise to electrochemical stability and safety. Furthermore, the AN with a higher donor number than ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; can replace the ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation sheaths, which reduces Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; clusters, accordingly suppressing salt precipitation even at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C. Resultantly, a symmetric supercapacitor assembled with 4.2 m Ca(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-AN electrolyte presents high-voltage and temperature-adaptability features, with excellent rate capability and high long-term cycling stability from 25 to &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C at 2.3&#160;V.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interface Topology Driven Loss Minimization in Integrated Photonics: THz Ultrahigh&#8208;Q Cavities and Waveguides</title>

Compact, robust, and ultralow&#8208;loss on&#8208;chip photonic devices are essential for densely integrated photonic chips. Here, the underlying radiation mechanism in topological valley edge states is unveiled and a new methodology of interface topology driven bandgap and wavevector engineering is proposed to thoroughly suppress their radiation losses, thereby unleashing their full potential for robust, low&#8208;power, and densely integrated photonic chips.









Abstract
Compact, robust, and ultralow&#8208;loss on&#8208;chip photonic devices are essential for densely integrated photonic chips. Conventional designs struggle to achieve these properties due to their inherent trade&#8208;offs among compactness, robustness, and low loss. Topological valley photonic crystals (VPCs) offer a promising solution, as their valley&#8208;vortex&#8208;protected edge states are capable of robustly guiding light through sharp bends and structural perturbations with negligible loss. Notably, exhaustive control over all loss channels is crucial for minimizing undesired losses. However, the intrinsic loss mechanisms in valley edge states remain largely unexplored, severely limiting their full potential. Here, we unveil that radiation is the dominant&#160;loss mechanism in valley edge states and propose a new methodology of interface topology driven bandgap and wavevector engineering to thoroughly suppress their radiation losses in chip&#8208;scale waveguides and cavities. The methodology minimizes the radiation losses of topological cavities by &#8776;104&#8208;fold through readily tailoring interface geometry without compromising their compactness, ultimately achieving a measured loaded Q&#8208;factor of 31231.2 in the terahertz (THz) frequency regime. Furthermore, the enhanced Q&#8208;factor significantly strengthens light&#8208;matter interactions, enabling efficient spectral modulation with ultralow&#8208;power photoexcitation. These findings enable topological VPCs to realize ultra&#8208;compact and ultralow&#8208;loss devices across diverse frequencies, unleashing their full potential for robust, low&#8208;power, and densely integrated photonic chips.

         <title>Nanosecond Laser Synthesis of MXene&#8208;Derived TiO2/High&#8208;Entropy Alloys for Photo&#8208;Assisted Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>

A high&#8208;entropy photoelectrocatalyst is rapidly synthesized by pulsed laser heating MXene nanosheets loading metal ions. The MXene derived&#8208;TiO2 and high&#8208;entropy alloy heterojunction can effectively enhance the oxygen evolution reaction kinetics with solar energy assistance, reducing the charging potential of zinc&#8211;air batteries and improving the charge&#8211;discharge efficiency.









Abstract
Photo&#8208;assisted zinc&#8211;air batteries have garnered significant attention for applying solar energy to decrease the charge voltage and improve energy efficiency. However, the uniform and rapid synthesis of highly active, stable, and low&#8208;cost photoelectrocatalysts for zinc&#8211;air batteries remains a significant challenge. Herein, a pulsed laser method is reported for the rapid preparation of MXene&#8208;derived TiO2/high&#8208;entropy alloy heterojunctions (M&#8208;TiO2/HEAs) as photoelectrocatalysts. Benefiting from the exceptional photo&#8208;thermal conversion capability of MXene, the local temperature reaches up to 2800&#160;K under laser irradiation, along with ultra&#8208;fast heating and cooling rates (&#8776;106&#160;K&#160;s&#8722;1), enabling the successful synthesis of M&#8208;TiO2/HEAs. Zinc&#8211;air batteries incorporating&#160;M&#8208;TiO2/HEAs exhibit a low charge voltage of 1.87&#160;V at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 under light irradiation. In addition, it exhibits exceptional cycle stability, maintaining stable cycling for 1000&#160;h at a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that M&#8208;TiO2/HEAs heterojunctions exhibit strong electronic interactions. These interactions effectively promote the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and the conversion of electrochemical intermediates, thereby enhancing oxygen evolution reaction activity under light irradiation. This work offers valuable insights into the rapid fabrication of photoelectrocatalysts, providing new perspectives for developing light&#8208;enhanced energy storage systems.

         <title>Dynamic Gradient Oxygen Layer Enables Stable Sn Anode for Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
During lithiation/delithiation, SnOx helped to form a stable solid electrolyte interface film. In addition, the disordered SnOx lamellar structures can release stress to prevent particle pulverization during its transformation into a denser amorphous layer. Its mechanism of lithium storage in the intercalation layer and dynamic oxygen concentration gradient can enable the rapid exchange of lithium ions.









Abstract
Sn&#8208;based anodes are of significant interest due to their high capacity and resource abundance for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, incomplete lithiation and severe volume expansion result in their low capacity and electrode pulverization. Here, a rationally designed coating layer, composed of disordered SnOx (x = 1, 2) lamellar structures, on the Sn particles surface (Sn@SnOx) is proposed. This coating effectively mitigates volume expansion and minimizes lithium consumption owing to the intercalation behaviors of SnOx. During lithiation and delithiation, a dense, amorphous, mechanical coating with a dynamic gradient of oxygen forms in situ, providing excellent protection against continuous pulverization of the Sn particles. The intercalation&#8208;type dynamic gradient oxygen with high ionic conductivity enables rapid exchange of lithium ions, thus promoting the deep lithiation of Sn to form Li4.4Sn. Such gradient oxygen protection mechanism of the oxide layer in Sn@SnOx brings a high reversible capacity after 900 cycles with a capacity retention of 84%. This work offers a new strategy to design a protective coating layer on alloy&#8208;based anodes for high&#8208;performance lithium storage.

         <title>Scalable Low&#8208;Carbon Ambient&#8208;Dried Foam&#8208;Like Aerogels for Radiative Cooling with Extreme Environmental Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable low&#8208;carbon ambient&#8208;dried foam&#8208;like aerogel with integrated radiative cooling and fire/harsh&#8208;conditions resistance is fabricated via green ambient&#8208;drying process without complex freezing and hazardous solvent exchange, which overcomes critical scalable green fabrication and durability challenges in cooling aerogels, providing new insights to maximize the efficiency in striving against global warming.









Abstract
Aerogels have emerged as promising passive radiant cooling materials, offering a sustainable solution to mitigate global warming. However, the energy&#8208; and resource&#8208;intensive fabrication processes and insufficient environmental durability of current aerogels pose significant challenges for industrial scalability and long&#8208;term energy&#8208;saving applications. Here, a scalable low&#8208;carbon ambient&#8208;dried foam&#8208;like aerogel (GMSx) with integrated radiative cooling and fire/harsh&#8208;conditions resistance is reported. Thermoresponsive physicochemical interactions among gellan gum, melamine&#8208;formaldehyde resin, and fumed silica facilitate the transformation of scalable emulsion&#8208;templated hydrogels into structurally ordered GMSx via a green ambient&#8208;drying process without complex freezing and solvent exchange. The foam&#8208;like aerogel exhibits high porosity (96.2%) and record specific modulus (323 m2/s2). Optimized optical properties with 93% solar reflectance and 94% infrared emissivity yield subambient cooling of 4.8 &#176;C. Crucially, the robust crosslinked networks impart remarkable durability under extreme conditions, including exposure to hot water, strong acids/alkalis (pH 1&#8211;13), various chemicals, and 1300 &#176;C flame. Furthermore, GMSx can be customized into various shapes via extrusion or spraying techniques and applied as protective coatings using scalable brushing or dipping methods, accommodating diverse substrate geometries. This work overcomes critical scalable green fabrication and durability challenges in passive cooling aerogels, demonstrating practical potential for energy&#8208;efficient thermal management in harsh environments.

Thermoresponsive physicochemical interactions among gellan gum, melamine-formaldehyde resin, and fumed silica facilitate the transformation of scalable emulsion-templated hydrogels into structurally ordered GMSx via a green ambient-drying process without complex freezing and solvent exchange. The foam-like aerogel exhibits high porosity (96.2%) and record specific modulus (323 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Optimized optical properties with 93% solar reflectance and 94% infrared emissivity yield subambient cooling of 4.8 &#176;C. Crucially, the robust crosslinked networks impart remarkable durability under extreme conditions, including exposure to hot water, strong acids/alkalis (pH 1&#8211;13), various chemicals, and 1300 &#176;C flame. Furthermore, GMSx can be customized into various shapes via extrusion or spraying techniques and applied as protective coatings using scalable brushing or dipping methods, accommodating diverse substrate geometries. This work overcomes critical scalable green fabrication and durability challenges in passive cooling aerogels, demonstrating practical potential for energy-efficient thermal management in harsh environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct&#8208;Ink&#8208;Writing Printed Aerogels with Dynamically Reversible Thermal Management and Tunable Electromagnetic Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Honeycomb&#8208;structured (Ti3C2Tx/Fe3O4/CCMC)&#8211;(AgNW/CCMC) aerogels with tunable EMI shielding performance up to 80 dB are fabricated via DIW 3D printing, achieving compression&#8208;driven shielding adjustability, infrared stealth, and reversible thermal insulation&#8211;conduction conversion for dynamic thermal management in harsh environments.








Abstract
Achieving both structural precision and tunable performance in electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials remains a critical challenge, particularly for adaptive applications. Herein, a strategy is proposed that integrates calcium chloride (CaCl&#8322;)&#8208;induced elastic activation of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with direct ink writing (DIW) 3D printing to address the limitations in structural design and performance adjustability of EMI shielding materials. By leveraging CaCl&#8322;&#8208;crosslinked CMC (CCMC) as a flexible matrix, honeycomb&#8208;structured (Ti&#8323;C&#8322;Tx/Fe&#8323;O&#8324;/CCMC)&#8211;(Ag nanowire (AgNW)/CCMC) aerogels is fabricated with precise architecture and tunable shielding effectiveness under mechanical compression. With a 35% printing fill density, 40 wt% Ti&#8323;C&#8322;Tx, and 60% compressive strain, the aerogel achieves an optimal shielding effectiveness of 80&#160;dB. Additionally, the aerogel exhibits reversible infrared stealth and dynamically switchable thermal properties (from 0.08 to 0.67 W&#183;m&#8315;&#185;&#183;K&#8315;&#185;) in response to environmental humidity variations. This work demonstrates a versatile approach for structurally adaptive EMI shielding materials with self&#8208;regulating thermal behavior, offering promising applications in harsh environment protection, intelligent thermal camouflage, and adaptive shielding for next&#8208;generation aerospace and communication technologies.

         <title>Evaluation and Rehabilitation System for Ulnar&#8208;Innervated Muscles Facilitated by Rare Earth Oxide&#8208;Enhanced Triboelectric Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a muscle atrophy evaluation and rehabilitation system utilizing rare earth oxide&#8208;enhanced triboelectric sensors integrated with a multi&#8208;channel signal collector and machine learning algorithms, enabling precise assessment of ulnar nerve injury recovery. The system demonstrates high sensitivity, accuracy, and visualization capability, offering significant advances in grip strength rehabilitation monitoring and biomedical sensing applications.








Abstract
Ulnar nerve injuries often lead to muscle atrophy and reduced hand function, necessitating precise monitoring and effective rehabilitation strategies. Current grip strength measurement tools rely on rigid mechanical equipment, which is inconvenient and requires frequent calibration. To address this, a muscle atrophy evaluation and rehabilitation system (MUERS) is presented, featuring a highly sensitive rare earth oxide&#8208;enhanced triboelectric sensor (RETS). Utilizing the unique electrochemical properties of rare earth oxides, RETS demonstrates a linear voltage&#8208;force response in the range of 8&#8211;80 kPa, with a maximum linear error of 1.5%. Integrated with a multi&#8208;channel STM32 signal collector, RETS enables real&#8208;time grip strength monitoring across all five fingers. Combining sensor output with an SVM algorithm, the system achieves 98.61% accuracy in identifying finger grip strength injuries and classifies damage into three levels with an average accuracy of 96.67%. MUERS evaluates rehabilitation progress by scoring grip strength and providing feedback to clinicians. Over a four&#8208;week cycle, it consistently captures improvements in muscle recovery, aiding individualized rehabilitation plans. This system offers fine&#8208;grained assessment capabilities for diagnosing and monitoring nerve injury&#8208;induced muscle atrophy, paving the way for advanced biomedical sensing and personalized rehabilitation.

A multi&#8208;DoF processor is designed to perform versatile inference tasks, including single&#8208;/dual&#8208;digit and single&#8208;/dual&#8208;fashion product classification, logic operations, and image transformation. Moreover, a high&#8208;security information transmission framework is experimentally demonstrated that transforms a large volume of input data&#8212;encoded across multiple channels&#8212;into Morse code, with the true information subsequently synthesized through further decoding.








Abstract
All&#8208;optical diffractive deep neural networks (D2NNs) offer significant advantages in processing speed and power consumption, thereby accelerating the development of optical computing and artificial intelligence (AI). Integrating multiple degrees of freedom (multi&#8208;DoF) into D2NNs is a pivotal role in improving information processing and task&#8208;loading capacity, an enormous challenge in current all&#8208;optical diffractive computing/processors. Here, a multi&#8208;DoF diffractive processor is proposed and experimentally demonstrated that leverages a metasurfaces&#8208;based approach to integrate polarization, distance, and rotation channels for versatile inference tasks and information encryption. The approach is validated using three&#8208;layer metasurfaces that enable high task&#8208;capacity tasks, including single&#8208;/dual&#8208;digit and single&#8208;/dual&#8208;fashion&#8208;product classification, logic operators, and image transformation. Moreover, by mapping large volumes of input data into multi&#8208;DoF channels and encoding the information in Morse code with our D2NNs framework, a high&#8208;security information transmission system is experimentally implemented. The integration of polarization, distance, and rotation channels into an all&#8208;optical diffractive processor with multifunctional capabilities paves the way for multifunctional integrated devices and communication.

         <title>Ternary Inert Element Co&#8208;Doping: a New Approach to Stable 4.7&#160;V LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al&#8211;Mg&#8211;Ni inert co&#8208;doping synergistically enhances structural stability of LiCoO2 at highly delithiated state, with Mg/Ni stabilizing Li layers and suppressing oxygen loss, while Al reinforcing Co&#8211;O octahedra, giving a capacity retention of 58.6% after 600 cycles at 4.7&#160;V.








Abstract
LiCoO2 (LCO) has long dominated the cathode materials in portable electronic batteries due to its high volumetric energy density. However, the pursuit of higher voltages to achieve larger capacities remains a challenge due to severer structural degradation. Herein, a ternary inert element co&#8208;doping strategy that can greatly improve the structure stability of LCOs at elevated voltages is reported. Mg and Ni doping at Li site support the layered structure in the highly delithiated state, while Ni also facilitates the separation of O 2p and Co 3d orbits, thereby suppressing oxygen loss. Meanwhile, Al doping at Co site suppresses the distortion of Co&#8211;O octahedra and stabilizes the Co layers. The synergistic effects of Al, Mg and Ni co&#8208;doping inhibit the irreversible H3&#8211;H1&#8208;3 phase transitions and mitigate internal stress accumulation. The Al&#8211;Mg&#8211;Ni co&#8208;doped LCO exhibits a capacity of 221&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 65.5% after 1500 cycles at 4.6&#160;V. At a higher voltage of 4.7&#160;V, it delivers a capacity of 225.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 58.6% after 600 cycles. This multiple inert elements co&#8208;doping strategy gives an effective method for stabilizing the high&#8208;voltage LCO and other related layered oxide materials.

         <title>Amidation&#8208;Retarded Synthesis of Perovskite Quantum Dots with Low Defect Density and Enhanced Carrier Transport for Efficient Light Emitting Diodes and Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent metal halides are introduced to react with amide and retard amidation process, thereby releasing free ligands and preventing PbI2 precipitation at 200 &#176;C. The synthesized perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) show lower defect density and better charge transport capacity, realizing highly efficient CsPbI3 PQD LEDs (28.71%) and SCs (16.20%). Such strategy is universal in red/green/blue PQDs.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are promising for both solar cells (SCs) and light emitting diodes (LEDs) for their excellent optoelectronic characteristics and solution&#8208;processable fabrication. One of the general limitations for these two kinds of devices is that high defect density and poor charge transport, resulting from the unavoidable amidation&#8208;induced PbX2 precipitation at high reaction temperature. In this work, an amidation&#8208;retarded synthesis strategy is proposed to prevent the PbX2 precipitation and subsequent defect formation. Covalent metal halides are introduced to interrupt amidation by reacting with deprotonated oleic acid/protonated oleylamine. Then, free acids/amines are released to coordinate with PbX2 and form regular lead&#8208;halide octahedra during nucleation&#8208;growth process. The synthesized CsPbI3 PQDs exhibit lower defect density (5.1 &#215; 1017 cm&#8722;3), higher PLQY (92%) and better charge output capacity (&#8776;8 times improvement). As a result, the LEDs and SCs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 28.71% and power conversion efficiency of 16.20%, respectively, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance. Furthermore, the universality of such strategy has been demonstrated in red/green/blue LEDs, and could be expected in other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>An Elastomeric Electrolyte Based on Lithium&#8208;Ion&#8208;Selective Transmembrane Transport for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of fiber&#8208;network&#8208;based elastomeric solid electrolytes is formed through electrospinning&#8208;induced phase separation combined with in situ polymerization, featuring a structure in which an elastomeric layer with Li+&#8208;selective permeability encapsulates fibrous plastic crystals. With the merits of the interconnected ion transport channels, the lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;selective permeability, and the conformal interface, the assembled solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries incorporating this electrolyte demonstrate desirable electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (SSLSBs) exhibit advantages such as high specific energy, safety, and low cost, making them an ideal candidate for next&#8208;generation batteries. However, the current mechanical and electrochemical properties of solid&#8208;state electrolytes do not meet the requirements of the practical application of SSLSBs. Herein, a construction strategy of fiber&#8208;network&#8208;based elastomeric solid electrolytes (FESE) based on electrospinning&#8208;induced phase separation is proposed. The FESE features a structure in which an elastomeric layer with Li+&#8208;selective permeability encapsulates a fibrous plastic crystal electrolyte (PCE). This structure originates from the phase separation and fiberization of a hydrogenated nitrile rubber (HNBR) stabilized emulsion, driven by electrostatic jetting. Subsequently, in situ polymerization of methoxy polyethylene glycol is performed within the battery to achieve void filling. Benefiting from the interconnected ion transport channels, the Li+&#8208;selectivity, and the conformal interface, the as&#8208;prepared FESE electrolyte achieves a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 1.11 mS cm&#8315;&#185; and a Li+ transference number of 0.77. The as&#8208;assembled SSLSB delivers a high initial discharge capacity (1188 mAh g&#8722;1), remarkable rate capability (356 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4C), and excellent cycling performance (71.2% capacity retention after 800 cycles). This research presents a constructive strategy for the elastomeric electrolytes for high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Bimetallic Nanocluster&#8208;Based Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes With High External Quantum Efficiency and Saturated Red Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the fabrication of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LED) using self&#8208;emissive bimetallic gold&#8208;copper nanoclusters (NCs) is reported. The NC&#8208;LED shows a maximum brightness of 1246 cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and the highest external quantum efficiency (EQE; 12.60%) value with pure red emission among the solution&#8208;processed and non&#8208;doped NC&#8208;based LEDs.








Abstract
Self&#8208;emissive atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs) are emerging as promising emissive layer material for next&#8208;generation light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), thanks to their solid&#8208;state luminescence, well&#8208;defined structures, photo/thermal stability, low toxicity, and unique excited&#8208;state properties. However, achieving high external quantum efficiency (EQE) in solid&#8208;state NCs remains a formidable challenge. In this study, a highly stable bimetallic gold&#8208;copper NC forming [Au2Cu6(Sadm)6(DPPEO)2] stabilized with 1&#8208;adamantanethiol (HSadm) and 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (DPPE) as the primary and secondary ligands, respectively is reported. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and spectroscopic analyses suggest that the as&#8208;synthesized NC contains one phosphine bound to gold and the second phosphine has oxidized to phosphine oxide (P&#9552;O). The presence of such P&#9552;O moieties in the NC facilitated C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions along with C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and H&#183;&#183;&#183;H interactions between ligands, promoting rapid crystallization. Due to the exceptional photo/thermal stability and enhanced solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), [Au2Cu6(Sadm)6(DPPEO)2] NC is utilized to fabricate the NC&#8208;based LED (NC&#8208;LED) via the solution&#8208;processed technique, without using any additional host materials. The fabricated NC&#8208;LED shows a maximum brightness of 1246 cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and an EQE of 12.60% with a pure red emission &#8776;668 nm. This EQE value coupled with saturated pure red emission is the best among solution&#8208;processed and non&#8208;doped NC&#8208;LEDs, suggesting the enormous potential of the NCs for electro&#8208;optical devices.

         <title>Manganese&#8211;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Coordination for Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Ion Batteries With Varying Mechanical Adaptability and Machine Learning&#8211;Assisted Performance Decoding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rationally designing &#960;&#8722;conjugated anthraquinone&#8722;based redox&#8722;active ligands (DHAQ/DAAQ), a series of layered, flower&#8211;like MnMOC structures are synthesized. Comprehensive characterization techniques are employed to systematically investigate the reaction mechanisms of these MnMOCs in AZIBs. Importantly, a machine learning&#8722;based model is developed to predict specific capacity. Notably, the MnMOCs demonstrates excellent performance in practical applications, offering strong support for the advancement of MOC materials in the field of energy storage.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;ion batteries (AZIBs) have garnered significant attention owing to their high safety and low cost; however, their development is hindered by the poor cycling stability and low capacity of traditional inorganic cathode materials. This study innovatively utilizes dihydroxy/diamino anthraquinone (DHAQ/DAAQ) ligands featuring &#960;&#8211;conjugated systems and quinone&#8211;based redox activity. By precisely regulating the substitution sites (1,2&#8211;/1,4&#8211;/1,5&#8211;) and coordinating them with Mn2+, layered flower&#8722;cluster Manganese&#8211;based metal&#8211;organic coordination is successfully constructed. The experimental results indicated that in the Mn&#8722;1,4&#8722;DHAQ cathode, the symmetric structure of the 1,4&#8211;dihydroxy substitution promoted electron delocalization and formed stable coordination bonds with Mn2+, thereby providing excellent electrochemical performance. Furthermore, both in situ and ex situ characterizations elucidated the Zn2+ storage mechanism during charge&#8211;discharge processes. Notably, this work incorporated machine learning techniques to develop a specific capacity prediction model, laying a methodological foundation for future research in the field of energy storage. Theoretical calculations are employed to gain deeper insight into the underlying reasons for the outstanding performance of Mn&#8722;1,4&#8722;DHAQ. In addition, Mn&#8722;1,4&#8722;DHAQ is successfully applied as a cathode material in soft&#8722;pack batteries, gel electrolyte devices, and screen&#8722;printed devices, demonstrating excellent mechanical adaptability and practical application potential.

&lt;p&gt;By rationally designing &#960;&#8722;conjugated anthraquinone&#8722;based redox&#8722;active ligands (DHAQ/DAAQ), a series of layered, flower&#8211;like MnMOC structures are synthesized. Comprehensive characterization techniques are employed to systematically investigate the reaction mechanisms of these MnMOCs in AZIBs. Importantly, a machine learning&#8722;based model is developed to predict specific capacity. Notably, the MnMOCs demonstrates excellent performance in practical applications, offering strong support for the advancement of MOC materials in the field of energy storage.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc&#8211;ion batteries (AZIBs) have garnered significant attention owing to their high safety and low cost; however, their development is hindered by the poor cycling stability and low capacity of traditional inorganic cathode materials. This study innovatively utilizes dihydroxy/diamino anthraquinone (DHAQ/DAAQ) ligands featuring &#960;&#8211;conjugated systems and quinone&#8211;based redox activity. By precisely regulating the substitution sites (1,2&#8211;/1,4&#8211;/1,5&#8211;) and coordinating them with Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, layered flower&#8722;cluster Manganese&#8211;based metal&#8211;organic coordination is successfully constructed. The experimental results indicated that in the Mn&#8722;1,4&#8722;DHAQ cathode, the symmetric structure of the 1,4&#8211;dihydroxy substitution promoted electron delocalization and formed stable coordination bonds with Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, thereby providing excellent electrochemical performance. Furthermore, both in situ and ex situ characterizations elucidated the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; storage mechanism during charge&#8211;discharge processes. Notably, this work incorporated machine learning techniques to develop a specific capacity prediction model, laying a methodological foundation for future research in the field of energy storage. Theoretical calculations are employed to gain deeper insight into the underlying reasons for the outstanding performance of Mn&#8722;1,4&#8722;DHAQ. In addition, Mn&#8722;1,4&#8722;DHAQ is successfully applied as a cathode material in soft&#8722;pack batteries, gel electrolyte devices, and screen&#8722;printed devices, demonstrating excellent mechanical adaptability and practical application potential. Novel strategy for high&#8722;performance MOC&#8211;based AZIBs boosts practical energy storage applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Dual&#8208;Ionic Charge Compensation for CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 Perovskite Quantum Dot Solar Cells with Over 18% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile dual&#8208;ion charge compensation strategy is reported for in situ reinforcement surface lattices of CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 perovskite quantum dot solar cells with a record power conversion efficiency of 18.17%. The formed dual&#8208;ionic ligands can effectively compensate for the surface vacancies of perovskite quantum dots, enhancing crystal morphology and electronic coupling of perovskite quantum dots while eliminating trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination.








Abstract
Cesium&#8208;formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite quantum dots (CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs) receive increasing attention for new&#8208;generation solar cells due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties and solution processibility. However, during the synthesis of CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs, PQDs seriously suffer from the ligand detachment from the PQD surface under the polar antisolvent, leaving numerous surface vacancies that significantly compromise the surface lattice integrity and optoelectronic properties of PQDs. A facile dual&#8208;ionic charge compensation strategy is introduced through the bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) to reinforce the surface lattice of CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs. The dual&#8208;ionic ligands produced during the SN2 reaction could in situ fill the surface vacancies of PQDs in the nonpolar solvent, which significantly improves the surface lattice integrity and thus the optoelectronic properties of PQDs, substantially diminishing trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination. Consequently, the PQDs solar cells show a power conversion efficiency of up to 18.17%, representing the highest efficiency in CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQD solar cells. The remarkable photovoltaic performance is attributed to the reinforced surface lattice of PQDs, suppressing the energy losses induced by the nonradiative recombination. This study provides crucial design principles for optimizing the crystalline structure integrity of PQDs, which also paves a new avenue for developing high&#8208;performance solar cells or other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Unprecedented Superelasticity in Mo17O47/MoS2 Core&#8211;Shell Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
[001]&#8208;oriented Mo17O47/MoS2 core&#8211;shell nanowires exhibit remarkable superelasticity. Three&#8208;point bending tests confirm Young's modulus (103 GPa) matching DFT predictions. In situ scanning electron microscopy bending reveals 35% recoverable strain, unprecedented in inorganic nanowires. First&#8208;principles calculations attribute this superelasticity to reversible transitions between chemical bonding and van der Waals interactions, showing potential for flexible electronics.








Abstract
Inorganic materials are usually known with high modulus and brittleness. Here the finding of a [001]&#8208;oriented Mo17O47 nanowires (NWs) material is reported with a thin MoS2 shell that exhibits superelastic deformability superior to the reported inorganic NWs. Three&#8208;point bending tests reveal that the elastic modulus of Mo17O47 crystals in the [001] direction is 103&#160;GPa, consistent with the density functional theory (DFT)&#8208;predicted results. Furthermore, in situ bending tests via scanning electron microscopy, accomplished with finite element simulations, demonstrate that the NWs can sustain bending strains up to 35% repeatedly without showing appreciable residual deformation. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that this extraordinary superelasticity results from the smooth transformation between the chemical bonding and physical binding (van der Waals) in the [001] direction of Mo17O47 crystal. The remarkable superelasticity of Mo17O47 NWs may offer enormous potential in flexible electronics and photonic devices.
