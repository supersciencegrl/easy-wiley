         <title>Experimental Realization of a Superdispersion&#8208;enabled Ultrabroadband Terahertz Cloak</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Invisibility has been a topic of long&#8208;standing interest owning to the advent of metamaterials and transformation optics, but still faces open challenges after its tremendous development in recent decades. One of the big challenges is the narrow bandwidth, as the realization of an invisibility cloak is usually based on a metamaterial &#8211; an artificial composite material composed of subwavelength resonator structures that are always associated with dispersion. Different from previous works that tried to eliminate the material dispersion to enhance the bandwidth of the invisibility cloak, in this paper, we find that by judiciously harnessing the material dispersion, one can still significantly increase the bandwidth of the cloak. Interestingly, the material dispersion does not violate the law of causality. As a proof of concept, we experimentally demonstrate an ultrabroadband terahertz (THz) carpet cloak through an array of superdispersive microparticles, rendering the target object invisible to the detection of both time&#8208; and frequency&#8208;domain wideband systems. Our work presents a feasible invisibility strategy that is closer to practical applications and may pave a brand&#8208;new way for the development of dispersion&#8208;dominated ultrabroadband metadevices.

         <title>Hot&#8208;Casting&#8208;Assisted Liquid Additive Engineering for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot casting is shown to allow for reduced loading of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in perovskite precursor inks, and remnant DMSO in films. This suppresses formation of undesired byproducts. The resulting perovskite layers show fewer defects, while their solar cells exhibit superior operational stability under considerable UV&#8208;containing simulated solar exposure over 3000&#160;h.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance inorganic&#8211;organic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are often fabricated with a liquid additive such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which retards crystallization and reduces roughness and pinholes in the perovskite layers. However, DMSO can be trapped during perovskite film formation and induce voids and undesired reaction byproducts upon later processing steps. Here, it is shown that the amount of residual DMSO can be reduced in as&#8208;spin&#8208;coated films significantly through use of preheated substrates, or a so&#8208;called hot&#8208;casting method. Hot casting increases the perovskite film thickness given the same concentration of solutions, which allows for reducing the perovskite solution concentration. By reducing the amount of DMSO in proportion to the concentration of perovskite precursors and using hot casting, it is possible to fabricate perovskite layers with improved perovskite&#8211;substrate interfaces by suppressing the formation of byproducts, which increase trap density and accelerate degradation of the perovskite layers. The best&#8208;performing PSCs exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.4% (23.0% stabilized efficiency) under simulated solar illumination. Furthermore, encapsulated devices show considerably reduced post&#8208;burn&#8208;in decay, retaining 75% and 90% of their initial and post&#8208;burn&#8208;in efficiencies after 3000&#160;h of operation with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under high power of ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;containing continuous light exposure.

         <title>Challenges and Perspectives of Organic Multivalent Metal&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The challenges faced by organic multivalent metal&#8208;ion batteries and the possible strategies to solve such challenges are summarized. As a special challenge that organic multivalent metal&#8208;ion batteries (MMIBs) are facing, the charge&#8208;storage mechanism is particularly underlined. The perspectives are thereby elaborated with the outlook of practical applications of organic MMIBs.








Abstract
Rechargeable organic multivalent metal&#8208;ion batteries (MMIBs) have attracted a surge of interest as promising alternatives for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications because they can combine the advantages of both organic electrodes and multivalent metal&#8208;ion batteries. However, the development of organic MMIBs is hampered by many factors, which mean they lag far behind organic alkali&#8208;metal&#8208; (e.g., Li&#8208;, Na&#8208;, and K&#8208;) ion batteries. Herein, the challenges that are specifically faced by organic MMIBs are analyzed and the strategies that can probably solve such challenges are then discussed. As a special challenge that organic MMIBs are facing, the charge&#8208;storage mechanism is particularly underlined to deeply understand the structure&#8211;property relationships for guiding the future design of high&#8208;performance organic electrodes for MMIBs. The perspectives are thereby elaborated in this review with the outlook of practical applications of organic MMIBs.

         <title>Organic Neuro&#8208;Electronics: From Neural Interface to Neuroprosthetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
This review outlines requirements and recent advances in research on organic neuro&#8208;electronics. Neuro&#8208;electronics such as neural interfaces and neuroprosthetics provide a promising approach to diagnose and treat neurological diseases. However, the current neural interfaces are rigid and not biocompatible, so they induce an immune response and deterioration of neural signal transmission. Organic materials are promising candidates for neural interfaces, due to mechanical softness, excellent electrochemical properties and biocompatibility. Also, organic nervetronics, which mimics functional properties of biological nerves system, is being developed to overcome limitations of complex and energy&#8208;consuming conventional neuroprosthetics that limit long&#8208;term implantations and daily&#8208;life usage. We review examples of organic materials for neural interfaces and neural signal recordings, and highlight recent advances of organic nervetronics that use organic artificial synapses are highlighted, then discuss further requirements for neuroprosthetics. Finally, we discuss future challenges that must be overcome to achieve ideal organic neuro&#8208;electronics for next&#8208;generation neuroprosthetics.

         <title>Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles with Surface&#8208;Mimicking Protein Secondary Structure as Lysosome&#8208;Targeting Chimaeras for Self&#8208;Synergistic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of photodynamic semiconducting polymer nanoparticles with surface mimicking protein secondary structure (SPSS NPs) is developed to achieve self&#8208;synergistic cancer immunotherapy by combining excellent immunogenic cell death and lysosome&#8208;targeting chimaera&#8208;like multivalent programmed cell death ligand&#8208;1&#160;blockade. SPSS NPs can not only effectively suppress both primary tumor and distant tumor, but also evoke long&#8208;term immunological memory against tumor rechallenge.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has received tremendous attention for tumor treatment, but the efficacy is greatly hindered by insufficient tumor&#8208;infiltration of immune cells and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The strategy that can efficiently activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes and inhibit negative immune regulators will greatly amplify immunotherapy outcome, which is however very rare. Herein, a new kind of semiconducting polymer (SP) nanoparticles is developed, featured with surface&#8208;mimicking protein secondary structure (SPSS NPs) for self&#8208;synergistic cancer immunotherapy by combining immunogenic cell death (ICD) and immune checkpoint blockade therapy. The SPs with excellent photodynamic property are synthesized by rational fluorination, which can massively induce ICD. Additionally, the peptide antagonists are introduced and self&#8208;assembled into &#946;&#8208;sheet protein secondary structures on the photodynamic NP surface via preparation process optimization, which function as efficient lysosome&#8208;targeting chimaeras (LYTACs) to mediate the degradation of programmed cell death ligand&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;L1)&#160;in lysosome. In vivo experiments demonstrate that SPSS NPs can not only elicit strong antitumor immunity to suppress both primary tumor and distant tumor, but also evoke long&#8208;term immunological memory against tumor rechallenge. This work introduces a new kind of robust immunotherapy agents by combining well&#8208;designed photosensitizer&#8208;based ICD induction and protein secondary structures&#8208;mediated LYTAC&#8208;like multivalence PD&#8208;L1&#160;blockade, rendering great promise for synergistic immunotherapy.

This work introduces a new kind of robust immunotherapy agents by combining well-designed photosensitizer-based ICD induction and protein secondary structures-mediated LYTAC-like multivalence PD-L1&#160;blockade, rendering great promise for synergistic immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nonhalogenated Dual&#8208;Slot&#8208;Die Processing Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and effective strategy of dual&#8208;slot&#8208;die sequential processing (DSDS)&#160;is developed. Highly efficient nonhalogenated organic solar cells are fabricated by slot&#8208;die coating by the DSDS strategy without additives and complex post&#8208;treatments.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technologies, with their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching 19%. However, the typically used spin&#8208;coating method, toxic halogenated processing solvents, and the conventional bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ), which causes excessive charge recombination, hamper the commercialization and further efficiency promotion of OSCs. Here, a simple but effective dual&#8208;slot&#8208;die sequential processing (DSDS) strategy is proposed to address the above issues by achieving a continuous solution supply, avoiding the solubility limit of the nonhalogen solvents, and creating a graded&#8208;BHJ morphology. As a result, an excellent PCE of 17.07% is obtained with the device processed with o&#8208;xylene in an open&#8208;air environment with no post&#8208;treatment required, while a PCE of over 14% is preserved in a wide range of active&#8208;layer thickness. The unique film&#8208;formation mechanism is further identified during the DSDS processing, which suggests the formation of the graded&#8208;BHJ morphology by the mutual diffusion between the donor and acceptor and the subsequent progressive aggregation. The graded&#8208;BHJ structure leads to improved charge transport, inhibited charge recombination, and thus an excellent PCE. Therefore, the newly developed DSDS approach can effectively contribute to the realm of high&#8208;efficiency and eco&#8208;friendly OSCs, which can also possibly be generalized to other organic photoelectric devices.

         <title>A Euryhaline&#8208;Fish&#8208;Inspired Salinity Self&#8208;Adaptive Nanofluidic Diode Leads to High&#8208;Performance Blue Energy Harvesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sandwich&#8208;structured nanochannel system is constructed to realize salinity self&#8208;adaptive nanofluidic diodes, which lead to a high&#8208;performance salinity&#8208;gradient power generator with low internal resistance. Adaptive to changing salinity, the pore morphology of one side of the nanochannel system switches from a 1D straight nanochannel to 3D network pores, along with three orders of magnitude change for charge density.








Abstract
The adaptability to wide salinities remains a big challenge for artificial nanofluidic systems, which plays a vital role in water&#8211;energy nexus science. Here, inspired by euryhaline fish, sandwich&#8208;structured nanochannel systems are constructed to realize salinity self&#8208;adaptive nanofluidic diodes, which lead to high&#8208;performance salinity&#8208;gradient power generators with low internal resistance. Adaptive to changing salinity, the pore morphology of one side of the nanochannel system switches from a 1D straight nanochannel&#160;(45 nm) to 3D network pores (1.9 nm pore size and &#8776;1013 pore density), along with three orders of magnitude change for charge density. Thus, the abundant surface charges and narrow pores render the membrane&#8208;based osmotic power generator with power density up to 26.22 Wm&#8722;2. The salinity&#8208;adaptive membrane solves the surface charge&#8208;shielding problem caused by abundant mobile ions in high salinity and increases the overlapping degree of the electric double layer. The dynamic adaption process of the membrane to the hypersaline environment endows it with good salt endurance and stability. New routes for designing nanofluidic devices functionally adaptable to different salinities and building power generators with excellent salt endurance are demonstrated.

         <title>Accessing Excitation&#8208; and Time&#8208;Responsive Afterglows from Aqueous Processable Amorphous Polymer Films through Doping and Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart luminescent materials with tunable multicolor afterglows in response to excitation and delay time can be facilely constructed with aqueous processable polymers through physical doping. The afterglow colors can further be finely modulated by the variation of the doping concentration, co&#8208;doping, and the triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy&#8208;transfer process.








Abstract
Smart afterglow materials in response to excitation and delay time, including crystals, polymeric films, and carbon dots, have attracted considerable attention on account of their fundamental value in photophysics and promising applications in optoelectronics. However, the fabrication of amorphous and flexible polymer films with fine control remains underexplored. Herein, new doped polymer films based on sodium alginate and aromatic carboxylates are developed, which demonstrate following advantages: (i) easy and fast fabrication through the aqueous solution process, (ii) flexible, transparent, and re&#8208;dissolvable characteristics, (iii) multi&#8208;tunable afterglow colors from blue to red and even white with fine control. Specifically, even better controllability can be achieved through co&#8208;doping and triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET). Multimode advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting of these materials is demonstrated using their excitation&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent as well as TS&#8208;FRET&#8208;mediated afterglow colors.

         <title>A Skin&#8208;Inspired Design Integrating Mechano&#8211;Chemical&#8211;Thermal Robustness into Superhydrophobic Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;inspired triple&#8208;layered coating (STC) concept is proposed. The STC solves the contradiction between the superhydrophobicity and other functionalities (such as abrasion resistance, adhesion, and flame retardancy). Based on a step&#8208;by&#8208;step spraying process and feasible control of the components of each layer, continuous interfaces within layers are achieved, endowing the integration of excellent overall performances into one coating.








Abstract
Designing scalable coatings with a wide spectrum of functions such as liquid repellency, anticorrosion, and antiflaming and a high level of mechano&#8211;chemical&#8211;thermal robustness is crucial in real&#8208;life applications. However, these individual functionalities and robustness are coupled together or even have conflicting requirements on the interfacial or bulky properties of materials, and&#160;thus,&#160;simultaneously integrating all these individual features into one coating has proved challenging. Herein, an integral skin&#8208;inspired triple&#8208;layered coating (STC) that resolves conflicting demands imposed by individual features on the structural, chemical, mechanical, and thermal properties of materials is proposed. Specifically, the rational design of multiple gradients in roughness, wetting, strength, and flame retardancy and the formation of continuous interfaces along its triple layers endow a sustained liquid repellency, anticorrosion, and flame retardancy even under harsh environments, as well as strong antiabrasion on surfaces and adhesion with the substrate. Such an all&#8208;in&#8208;one design enhances the durability and lifetime of coatings and reduces the maintenance and repair, thereby contributing to cost and energy saving. Together with a facile spraying fabrication process, this STC provides a feasible and sustainable strategy for constructing energy and resource&#8208;saving materials.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sugar&#8208;derived isotropic nanoscale polycrystalline graphite (SINPG) is prepared from colloidal organization of nanocapsules to nanograins by gel&#8208;casting in a non&#8208;pressure environment. SINPG exhibits ultrahigh strength, unprecedent plasticity, and excellent deformation, acting as a metallic material in compression tests. The cleavage associated with typical van der Waals materials is avoided with SINPG.








Abstract
Obtaining large plastic deformation in polycrystalline van der Waals (vdW) materials is challenging. Achieving such deformation is especially difficult in graphite because it is highly anisotropic. The development of sugar&#8208;derived isotropic nanostructured polycrystalline graphite (SINPG) is discussed herein. The structure of this material preserves the high in&#8208;plane rigidity and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane flexibility of graphene layers and enables prominent plasticity by activating the rotation of nanoscale (5&#8211;10&#160;nm) grains. Thus, micrometer&#8208;sized SINPG samples demonstrate enhanced compressive strengths of up to 3.0&#160;GPa and plastic strains of 30&#8211;50%. These findings suggest a new pathway for enabling plastic deformation in otherwise brittle vdW materials. This new class of nanostructured carbon materials is suitable for use in a broad range of fields, from semiconductor to aerospace applications.

         <title>Intracellular Crowding by Bio&#8208;Orthogonal Hydrogel Formation Induces Reversible Molecular Stasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intracellular crosslinking in living cells using poly(ethylene glycol) macromers is introduced. Increased macromolecular crowding in the cytosol of the cell causes crosslink&#8208;induced quiescence and results in reduced protein translation, cellular motility, and actin dynamics while cell viability remains high. The effects can be reversed through polymer degradation with UV light.








Abstract
To survive extreme conditions, certain animals enter a reversible protective stasis through vitrification of the cytosol by polymeric molecules such as proteins and polysaccharides. In this work, synthetic gelation of the cytosol in living cells is used to induce reversible molecular stasis. Through the sequential lipofectamine&#8208;mediated transfection of complementary poly(ethylene glycol) macromers into mammalian cells, intracellular crosslinking occurs through bio&#8208;orthogonal strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition click reactions. This achieves efficient polymer uptake with minimal cell death (99% viable). Intracellular crosslinking decreases DNA replication and protein synthesis, and increases the quiescent population by 2.5&#8208;fold. Real&#8208;time tracking of single cells containing intracellular crosslinked polymers identifies increases in intermitotic time (15 h&#160;vs 19 h) and decreases in motility (30 &#181;m h&#8722;1&#160;vs 15&#160;&#181;m h&#8722;1). The cytosol viscosity increases threefold after intracellular crosslinking and results in disordered cytoskeletal structure in addition to the disruption of cellular coordination in a scratch assay. By incorporating photodegradable nitrobenzyl moieties into the polymer backbone, the effects of intracellular crosslinking are reversed upon exposure to light, thereby restoring proliferation (80% phospho&#8208;Rb+ cells), protein translation, and migration. Reversible intracellular crosslinking provides a novel method for dynamic manipulation of intracellular mechanics, altering essential processes that determine cellular function.

         <title>Recording Temperature with Magnetic Supraparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature is one of the most important external influences for materials. In this work, the design, working principle, and tunability of temperature&#8208;indicator supraparticles are presented. These supraparticles can record and memorize thermal influences up to 170&#160;&#176;C with a spectral magnetic readout. The magnetic signals are independent of optical constraints and can thus be utilized to obtain information from within dark, solid objects.








Abstract
Small&#8208;sized temperature indicator additives autonomously record temperature events via a gradual irreversible signal change. This permits, for instance, the indication of possible cold&#8208;chain breaches or failure of electronics but also curing of glues. Thus, information about the materials&#8217; thermal history can be obtained upon signal detection at every point of interest. In this work, maximum&#8208;temperature indicators with magnetic readout based on micrometer&#8208;sized supraparticles (SPs) are introduced. The magnetic signal transduction is, by nature, independent of the materials&#8217; optical properties. This facilitates the determination of valuable temperature information from the inside, that is, the bulk, even of dark and opaque macroscopic objects, which might differ from their surface. Compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art optical temperature indicators, complementary magnetic readout characteristics ultimately expand their applicability. The conceptualized SPs are hierarchically structured assemblies of environmentally friendly, inexpensive iron oxide nanoparticles and thermoplastic polymer. Irreversible structural changes, induced by polymer softening, yield magnetic interaction changes within and between the hierarchic sub&#8208;structures, which are distinguishable and define the temperature indication mechanism. The fundamental understanding of the SPs&#8217; working principle enables customization of the particles&#8217; working range, response time, and sensitivity, using a toolbox&#8208;like manufacturing approach. The magnetic signal change is detected self&#8208;referenced, fast, and contactless.

         <title>Electrochemical Construction of Edge&#8208;Contacted Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Junctions with Low Contact Barrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile approach is developed for constructing high&#8208;quality metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions through the edge&#8208;guided electrodeposition. Cross&#8208;sectional imaging and transport measurements confirm the seamless contact of Pd with each layer of MoS2 greatly reduces the contact barrier to &#8776;20 meV and contact resistance to &#8776;290 &#937;&#160;&#181;m and thus significantly increases the performance of FETs with Pd nanowire edge contacts.








Abstract
2D semiconductors, such as MoS2 have emerged as promising ultrathin channel materials for the further scaling of field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). However, the contact barrier at the metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions still significantly limits the device's performance. By extending the application of electrochemical deposition in 2D electronics, a distinct approach is developed for constructing metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions in an edge&#8208;contacted configuration through the edge&#8208;guided electrodeposition of varied metals. Both high&#8208;resolution microscopic imaging and electrical transport measurements confirm the successful creation of high&#8208;quality Pd&#8208;2D MoS2 junctions in desired geometry by combining electrodeposition with lithographic patterning. FETs are fabricated on the obtained Pd&#8208;2D MoS2 junctions and it is confirmed that these junctions exhibit a reduced contact barrier of &#8776;20&#160;meV and extremely low contact resistance of 290&#160;&#937;&#160;&#181;m and thus increase the averaged mobility of MoS2 FETs to &#8776;108&#160;cm2 V &#8722;1 s&#8722;1. This approach paves a new way for the construction of metal&#8208;semiconductor junctions and also demonstrates the great potential of the electrochemical deposition technique in 2D electronics.

         <title>Topological Crystalline Insulator Candidate ErAsS with Hourglass Fermion and Magnetic&#8208;Tuned Topological Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered air&#8208;stable topological crystalline insulator (TCI) candidate, ErAsS, is designed and synthesized, which maps the atomic layers in real space to the band topology in momentum space. The distorted As atomic layer and magnetic order of ErAsS induce both the hourglass fermion surface state and the magnetic&#8208;tuned exotic phases including the possible magnetic TCI.








Abstract
Topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) with hourglass fermion surface state have attracted a lot of attention and are further enriched by crystalline symmetries and magnetic order. Here, the emergence of hourglass fermion surface state and exotic phases in the newly discovered, air&#8208;stable ErAsS single crystals are shown. In the paramagnetic phase, ErAsS is expected to be a TCI with hourglass fermion surface state protected by the nonsymmorphic symmetry. Dirac&#8208;cone&#8208;like bands and nearly linear dispersions in large energy range are experimentally observed, consistent well with theoretical calculations. Below TN&#160;&#8776; 3.27 K, ErAsS enters a collinear antiferromagnetic state, which is a trivial insulator breaking the time&#8208;reversal symmetry. An intermediate incommensurate magnetic state appears in a narrow temperature range (3.27&#8211;3.65 K), exhibiting an abrupt change in magnetic coupling. The results reveal that ErAsS is an experimentally available TCI candidate and provide a unique platform to understand the formation of hourglass fermion surface state and explore magnetic&#8208;tuned topological phase transitions.

In the paramagnetic phase, ErAsS is expected to be a TCI with hourglass fermion surface state protected by the nonsymmorphic symmetry. Dirac-cone-like bands and nearly linear dispersions in large energy range are experimentally observed, consistent well with theoretical calculations. Below &lt;i&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8776; 3.27 K, ErAsS enters a collinear antiferromagnetic state, which is a trivial insulator breaking the time-reversal symmetry. An intermediate incommensurate magnetic state appears in a narrow temperature range (3.27&#8211;3.65 K), exhibiting an abrupt change in magnetic coupling. The results reveal that ErAsS is an experimentally available TCI candidate and provide a unique platform to understand the formation of hourglass fermion surface state and explore magnetic-tuned topological phase transitions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Non&#8208;Classical Crystallization Mechanism of a Composite Biogenic Guanine Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By following crystal formation in embryonic spiders, a long&#8208;sought crystallization mechanism for biogenic guanine is revealed. Guanine nucleates from a disordered precursor phase. The crystals grow by the orientated attachment of partially ordered nanogranules into platelets, which coalesce into single crystals, via gradual relaxation of structural defects. The mature guanine is a composite of crystal lamellae intercalated by macromolecular sheets.








Abstract
Spectacular colors and visual phenomena in animals are produced by light interference from highly reflective guanine crystals. Little is known about how organisms regulate crystal morphology to tune the optics of these systems. By following guanine crystal formation in developing spiders, a crystallization mechanism is elucidated. Guanine crystallization is a &#8220;non&#8208;classical,&#8221; multistep process involving a progressive ordering of states. Crystallization begins with nucleation of partially ordered nanogranules from a disordered precursor phase. Growth proceeds by orientated attachment of the nanogranules into platelets which coalesce into single crystals, via progressive relaxation of structural defects. Despite their prismatic morphology, the platelet texture is retained in the final crystals, which are composites of crystal lamellae and interlamellar sheets. Interactions between the macromolecular sheets and the planar face of guanine appear to direct nucleation, favoring platelet formation. These findings provide insights on how organisms control the morphology and optical properties of molecular crystals.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Rich Molybdenum Sulfide Quantum Dots for Amplified Photoluminescence and Photonics&#8208;Driven Reactive Oxygen Species Generation</title>

Defect&#8208;rich MoS2 QDs are obtained via a mild biomineralization&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up strategy to show enhanced photoluminescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation due to great defect/active sites elevation.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum dots (QDs) with defects have attracted interesting chemistry due to the contribution of vacancies to their unique optical, physical, catalytic, and electrical properties. Engineering defined defects into molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) QDs is challenging. Herein, by applying a mild biomineralization&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up strategy, blue photoluminescent MoS2 QDs (B&#8208;QDs) with a high density of defects are fabricated. The two&#8208;stage synthesis begins with a bottom&#8208;up synthesis of original MoS2 QDs (O&#8208;QDs) through chemical reactions of Mo and sulfide ions, followed by alkaline etching that creates high sulfur&#8208;vacancy defects to eventually form B&#8208;QDs. Alkaline etching significantly increases the photoluminescence (PL) and photo&#8208;oxidation. An increase in defect density is shown to bring about increased active sites and decreased bandgap energy; which is further validated with density functional theory calculations. There is strengthened binding affinity between QDs and O2 due to lower gap energy (&#8710;EST) between S1 and T1, accompanied with improved intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency. Lowered gap energy contributes to assist e&#8722;&#8211;h+ pair formation and the strengthened binding affinity between QDs and 3O2. Defect engineering unravels another dimension of material properties control and can bring fresh new applications to otherwise well characterized TMD nanomaterials.

         <title>Composition&#8208;Dependent Enzyme Mimicking Activity and Radiosensitizing Effect of Bimetallic Clusters to Modulate Tumor Hypoxia for Enhanced Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically precise alloy clusters Pt2M4 (M = Au, Ag, Cu) are synthesized with bright luminescence and adequate biocompatibility. The experimental results reveal that the Pt2Au4 cluster displays catalase&#8208;like activity and its radiosensitizing effect is the highest. By taking advantage of the sustainable production of O2 via decomposition of endogenous H2O2, the Pt2Au4 cluster modulates tumor hypoxia as well as increases the efficacy of radiotherapy.








Abstract
Alloying is an efficient chemistry to tailor the properties of metal clusters. As a class of promising radiosensitizers, most previously reported metal clusters exhibit unitary function and cannot overcome radioresistance of hypoxic tumors. Here, atomically precise alloy clusters Pt2M4 (M = Au, Ag, Cu) are synthesized with bright luminescence and adequate biocompatibility, and their composition&#8208;dependent enzyme mimicking activity and radiosensitizing effect is explored. Specifically, only the Pt2Au4 cluster displays catalase&#8208;like activity, while the others do not have clusterzyme properties, and its radiosensitizing effect is the highest among all the alloy clusters tested. By taking advantage of the sustainable production of O2 via the decomposition of endogenous H2O2, the Pt2Au4 cluster modulates tumor hypoxia as well as increases the efficacy of radiotherapy. This work thus advances the&#160;cluster alloying strategy to produce multifunctional therapeutic agents for improving hypoxic tumor therapy.

An artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;motivated full&#8208;skin bionic (FSB) e&#8208;skin based on vertically integrated triboelectric e&#8208;skin and supercapacitive iontronic e&#8208;skin is proposed through the mimicry of skin structures including human vellus hair, epidermis&#8211;dermis&#8211;hypodermis. Assisted by the AI&#8208;motivated &#8220;brain,&#8221; the proposed FSB e&#8208;skin can promote the function of tactile perception to advanced intelligent tactile cognition.








Abstract
Traditional electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), due to the lack of human&#8208;brain&#8208;like thinking and judging capability, is powerless to accelerate the pace to the intelligent era. Herein, artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;motivated full&#8208;skin bionic (FSB) e&#8208;skin consisting of the structures of human vellus hair, epidermis&#8211;dermis&#8211;hypodermis, is proposed. Benefiting from the double interlocked layered microcone structure and supercapacitive iontronic effect, the FSB e&#8208;skin exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity of 8053.1 kPa&#8722;1 (&lt;1&#160;kPa), linear sensitivity of 3103.5 kPa&#8722;1 (1&#8211;34&#160;kPa), and fast response/recovery time of &lt;5.6&#160;ms. In addition, it can realize the evolution from tactile perception to advanced intelligent tactile cognition after being equipped with a &#8220;brain&#8221;. First, static/dynamic contactless tactile perception is achieved based on the triboelectric effect of the vellus hair bionics. Second, the supercapacitive iontronic effect based structural bionics of the epidermis&#8211;dermis&#8211;hypodermis and a five&#8208;layer multilayer perception (MLP) enable the general intelligent tactile cognition of gesture cognition and robot interaction. Most importantly, by making full use of the FSB e&#8208;skin with a six&#8208;layer MLP neural network, an advanced intelligent material cognition system is developed for real&#8208;time cognition of the object material species and locations via one contact, which surpasses the capability of humans.

         <title>Integrating SEI into Layered Conductive Polymer Coatings for Ultrastable Silicon Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered conductive polyaniline (LCP) coating is built from a bottom&#8208;up polymer design strategy for Si anodes. The in situ formation of LCP&#8208;integrated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with uniform structure and flexible mechanical property enhances the stability of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface.








Abstract
Tackling the huge volume expansion of silicon (Si) anode desires a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to prohibit the interfacial side reactions. Here, a layered conductive polyaniline (LCP) coating is built on Si nanoparticles to achieve high areal capacity and long lifespan. The conformal LCP coating stores electrolyte in interlamination spaces and directs an in situ formation of LCP&#8208;integrated hybrid SEI skin with uniform distribution of organic and inorganic components, enhancing the flexibility of the SEI to buffer the volume changes and maintaining homogeneous ion transport during cycling. As a result, the Si anode shows a remarkable cycling stability under high areal capacity (&#8776;3&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) after 150 cycles and good rate performance of 942&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1. This work demonstrates the great potential of regulating the SEI properties by a layered polymer&#8208;directing SEI formation for the mechanical and electrochemical stabilization of Si anodes.

         <title>Brushed Metals for Rechargeable Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and solvent&#8208;free brushing method is reported to convert powders into films atop Li and Na metal foils. Benefiting from the reactivity of metals with these powder films, surface energy can be effectively tuned, thereby preventing parasitic reaction. In&#8208;operando study and electrochemical tests demonstrate the improved electrodeposition/dissolution behavior, lower polarization, and higher average coulombic efficiency for P2S5 and MoS2.








Abstract
Battery designs are swiftly changing from metal&#8208;ion to rechargeable metal batteries. Theoretically, metals can deliver maximum anode capacity and enable cells with improved energy density. In practice, these advantages are only possible if the parasitic surface reactions associated with metal anodes are controlled. These undesirable surface reactions are responsible for many troublesome issues, like dendrite formation and accelerated consumption of active materials, which leads to anodes with low cycle life or even battery runaway. Here, a facile and solvent&#8208;free brushing method is reported to convert powders into films atop Li and Na metal foils. Benefiting from the reactivity of Li metal with these powder films, surface energy can be effectively tuned, thereby preventing parasitic reaction. In&#8208;operando study of P2S5&#8208;modified Li anodes in liquid electrolyte cells reveals a smoother electrode contour and more uniform metal electrodeposition and dissolution behavior. The P2S5&#8208;modified Li anodes sustain ultralow polarization in symmetric cell for &gt;4000 h, &#8776;8&#215; longer than bare Li anodes. The capacity retention is &#8776;70% higher when P2S5&#8208;modified Li anodes are paired with a practical LiFePO4 cathode (&#8776;3.2&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) after 340 cycles. Brush coating opens a promising avenue to fabricate large&#8208;scale artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase directly on metals without the need for organic solvent.

         <title>A Snakeskin&#8208;Inspired, Soft&#8208;Hinge Kirigami Metamaterial for Self&#8208;Adaptive Conformal Electronic Armor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Survivability in complex environments is in high demand but challenging in flexible electronics or soft robotics. Snakeskin can serve as bioinspiration for employing electronic armor (E&#8208;armor) as a generic strategy to protect itself&#160;and the underlying objects from external damage. Specifically, a new concept of flexible &#8220;E&#8208;armor&#8221; as an upgrade of soft &#8220;E&#8208;skin&#8221; is introduced.








Abstract
A majority of soft&#8208;body creatures evolve armor or shells to protect themselves. Similar protection demand is for flexible electronics working in complex environments. Existing works mainly focus on improving the sensing capabilities such as electronic skin (E&#8208;skin). Inspired by snakeskin, a novel electronic armor (E&#8208;armor) is proposed, which not only possesses mechanical flexibility and electronic functions similar to E&#8208;skin, but is also able to protect itself and the underlying soft body from external physical damage. The geometry of the kirigami mechanical metamaterial (Kiri&#8208;MM) ensures auxetic stretchability and meanwhile large areal coverage for sufficient protection. Moreover, to suppress the inherent but undesired out&#8208;of&#8208;plane buckling of conventional Kiri&#8208;MMs for conformal applications, soft hinges are used to form a distinct soft (hinges)&#8208;rigid (tiles) configuration. Analytical, computational, and experimental studies of the mechanical behaviors of the soft&#8208;hinge Kiri&#8208;MM E&#8208;armor demonstrate the merits of this design, i.e., stretchability, conformability, and protectability, as applied to flexible electronics. Deploying a conductive soft material at the hinges enables facile wiring strategies for large&#8208;scale circuit arrays. Functional E&#8208;armor systems for controllable display and sensing purposes provide simple examples of a wide spectrum of applications of this concept.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Based Intrinsically Stretchable 2D&#8208;Contact Electrodes for Highly Efficient Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protocol to fabricate highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes that use an intrinsically stretchable 2D&#8208;contact electrode topped with graphene is reported. As a benefit of the fast carrier mobility with complete 2D contact with the organic material and the tunable work function of the 2D&#8208;contact stretchable electro (TCSE), the limited charge injection of the widely used silver&#8208;nanowire&#8208;based stretchable electrode is solved.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (ISOLEDs) are becoming essential components of wearable electronics. However, the efficiencies of ISOLEDs have been highly inferior compared with their rigid counterparts, which is due to the lack of ideal stretchable electrode materials that can overcome the poor charge injection at 1D metallic nanowire/organic interfaces. Herein, highly efficient ISOLEDs that use graphene&#8208;based 2D&#8208;contact stretchable electrodes (TCSEs) that incorporate a graphene layer on top of embedded metallic nanowires are demonstrated. The graphene layer modifies the work function, promotes charge spreading, and impedes inward diffusion of oxygen and moisture. The work function (WF) of 3.57&#160;eV is achieved by forming a strong interfacial dipole after deposition of a newly designed conjugated polyelectrolyte with crown ether and anionic sulfonate groups on TCSE; this is the lowest value ever reported among ISOLEDs, which overcomes the existing problem of very poor electron injection in ISOLEDs. Subsequent pressure&#8208;controlled lamination yields a highly efficient fluorescent ISOLED with an unprecedently high current efficiency of 20.3&#160;cd A&#8722;1, which even exceeds that of an otherwise&#8208;identical rigid counterpart. Lastly, a 3 inch five&#8208;by&#8208;five passive matrix ISOLED is demonstrated using convex stretching. This work can provide a rational protocol for designing intrinsically stretchable high&#8208;efficiency optoelectronic devices with favorable interfacial electronic structures.

         <title>Highly Selective Adsorption of Perfluorinated Greenhouse Gases by Porous Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porous organic cages with alkyl&#8208;, fluoroalkyl&#8208;, and partially fluorinated alkyl groups is presented and the structure&#8211;property relationships between the nature of the side&#8208;chains and the gas sorption behavior toward highly potent greenhouse gases, namely, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are studied. By this approach, one compound having superior selectivities of PFCs versus N2 or CO2 under ambient conditions is identified.








Abstract
Anthropogenic greenhouse gases contribute to global warming. Among those gases, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are thousands to tens of thousands of times more harmful to the environment than comparable amounts of carbon dioxide. To date, materials that selectively adsorb perfluorocarbons in favor of other less harmful gases have not been reported. Here, a series of porous organic cage compounds with alkyl&#8208;, fluoroalkyl&#8208;, and partially fluorinated alkyl groups is presented. Their isomorphic crystalline states allow the study of the structure&#8211;property relationship between the degree of fluorination of the alkyl chains and the gas sorption properties for PFCs and their selective uptakes in comparison to other, nonfluorinated gases. By this approach, one compound having superior selectivities of PFCs versus N2 or CO2 under ambient conditions is identified.

         <title>Designing Rewritable Dual&#8208;Mode Patterns using a Stretchable Photoresponsive Polymer via Orthogonal Photopatterning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two patterns are observed in one film! Orthogonal photopatterning is developed to fabricate dual&#8208;mode patterns in stretchable azopolymers that exhibit photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions. The dual&#8208;mode pattern contains photonic and chromatic polarization patterns, which do not interfere with each other. The dual&#8208;mode patterns are rewritable and reprocessable. They are promising materials for anti&#8208;counterfeiting, information storage, and encryption applications.








Abstract
The fabrication of dual&#8208;mode patterns in the same region of a material is a promising approach for high&#8208;density information storage, new anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies, and highly secure encryption. However, dual&#8208;mode patterns are difficult to achieve because the two patterns in one material may interfere with each other during fabrication and usage. The development of noninterfering dual&#8208;mode patterns requires new materials and patterning techniques. Herein, a novel orthogonal photopatterning technique is reported for the fabrication of noninterfering dual&#8208;mode patterns on an azopolymer P1. P1 is a unique material that exhibits both photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions and good stretchability. In the first step of orthogonal photopatterning, patterned photonic structures are fabricated on a P1 film via masked nanoimprinting controlled by photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions. In the second step, the P1 film is stretched and irradiated with polarized light through a photomask, which generates a chromatic polarization pattern. In particular, the photonic structures and chromatic polarization in the dual&#8208;mode pattern are noninterfering. Another feature of dual&#8208;mode patterns is that they are rewritable via photo&#8208;, thermal, or solution reprocessing, which are useful for recycling and reprogramming. This study opens an avenue for the development of novel materials and techniques for photopatterning.

         <title>All&#8208;Aqueous Freeform Fabrication of Perfusable Self&#8208;Standing Soft Compartments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward method based on the interfacial complexation of oppositely charged natural polyelectrolytes is proposed to directly fabricate fiber&#8208;shaped structures, stable in all&#8208;aqueous physiological&#8208;relevant conditions. Perfusable and size&#8208;controllable materials can be obtained, with adequate permeability and improved biofunctionality, enabling cell adhesion and growth. Outside the separating interface of two&#8208;phase systems, self&#8208;standing entities can be easily handled, broadening the range of applications.








Abstract
Compartmentalized structures obtained in all&#8208;aqueous settings have shown promising properties as cell encapsulation devices, as well as reactors for trans&#8208;membrane chemical reactions. While most approaches focus on the preparation of spherical devices, advances on the production of complex architectures have been enabled by the interfacial stability conferred by emulsion systems, namely mild aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPS), or non&#8208;equilibrated analogues. However, the application of non&#8208;spherical structures has mostly been reported while keeping the fabricated materials at a stable interface, limiting the free&#8208;standing character, mobility and transposition of the obtained structures to different setups. Here, the fabrication of self&#8208;standing, malleable and perfusable tubular systems through all&#8208;aqueous interfacial assembly is shown, culminating in the preparation of independent objects with stability and homogeneity after disruption of the polymer&#8208;based aqueous separating system. Those hollow structures can be fabricated with a variety of widths, and rapidly printed as long structures at flow rates of 15&#160;mm s&#8722;1. The materials are used as compartments for cell culture, showcasing high cytocompatibility, and can be tailored to promote cell adhesion. Such structures may find application in fields that benefit from freeform tubular structures, including the biomedical field with, for example, cell encapsulation, and benchtop preparation of microfluidic devices.

Based on the impedance&#8208;voltage division principle and the voltage&#8208;luminance relationship, simply fabricated asymmetrically enhanced alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven electroluminescent (AECE AC&#8208;EL) devices are designed. The AECE AC&#8208;EL configuration is successfully applied in feasible information encryption and ultrahighly stretchable pattern displays, signifying magnificent application prospects in the elegant wearable electronic systems with intelligent, multifunctional, and full&#8208;color displays.








Abstract
Traditional alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven electroluminescent (AC&#8208;EL) devices adopting a sandwich structure are commonly used in solid&#8208;state lighting and displays, while the emerging coplanar&#8208;electrode alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven light&#8208;emitting variants manifest excellent application prospects in intelligent, multifunctional, and full&#8208;color displays, and sensing purposes. In this work, an asymmetrically&#160;enhanced coplanar&#8208;electrode AC&#8208;EL device with a universal and straightforward architecture is designed based on the impedance adjustment strategy. This newly devised asymmetric structure extends the functionalities of the coplanar&#8208;electrode AC&#8208;EL devices by overcoming the bottlenecks of complicated patterning procedures and high driving voltages of symmetric configuration. The developed device design enables a new type of information encryption and ultrahighly stretchable patterned displays. Notably, the novel encryption appliances demonstrate feasible encryption/decryption features, multiple encryptions, and practical applicability; the biaxially stretchable display devices achieve the highest tensile performance in the field of stretchable electroluminescent pattern displays, and outperform the ultrahighly stretchable sandwich devices in terms of simple patterning process, higher brightness, wider color gamut, and long&#8208;term stability. The proposed configuration opens up new avenues for AC&#8208;EL devices toward a plethora of smart applications in wearable electronics with intelligent displays, dynamic interaction of human&#8208;machine interface, and soft robotics.

         <title>Rhombohedral Pd&#8211;Sb Nanoplates with Pd&#8208;Terminated Surface: An Efficient Bifunctional Fuel&#8208;Cell Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Pd&#8211;Sb hexagonal nanoplate of ordered rhombohedral Pd8Sb3 phase with a Pd&#8208;terminated surface is successfully prepared and applied as a high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalyst. The unique surface structure can effectively reduce the energy barrier of ethanol dehydrogenation in the ethanol oxidation reaction&#160;and suppress the competing two&#8208;electron pathway in the oxygen reduction reaction, leading to high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysis for energy conversion and beyond.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for the commercialization of direct ethanol fuel cells, but it is still formidably challenging. In this work, a novel Pd&#8211;Sb hexagonal nanoplate for boosting both cathodic and anodic fuel cell reactions is prepared. Detailed characterizations reveal that the nanoplates have ordered rhombohedral phase of Pd8Sb3 (denoted as Pd8Sb3 HPs). The Pd8Sb3 HPs exhibit&#160;much enhanced activity toward the oxidation of various alcohols. Particularly, Pd8Sb3 HPs/C displays superior specific and mass activities of 29.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 4.5&#160;A&#160;mgPd&#8722;1 toward the EOR, which are 7.0 and 11.3 times higher than those of commercial Pd/C, and 9.8 and 3.8 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively, representing one of the best EOR catalysts reported to date. In situ electrochemical attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) measurements reveal that Pd8Sb3 HPs/C can effectively promote the C2 pathway of the EOR. As revealed by density functional theory calculations, the high EOR activity of the Pd8Sb3 HPs can be ascribed to the reduced energy barrier of ethanol dehydrogenation. Additionally, Pd8Sb3 HPs/C also shows superior performance in the&#160;ORR.

&lt;p&gt;A novel Pd&#8211;Sb hexagonal nanoplate of ordered rhombohedral Pd&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; phase with a Pd-terminated surface is successfully prepared and applied as a high-efficiency electrocatalyst. The unique surface structure can effectively reduce the energy barrier of ethanol dehydrogenation in the ethanol oxidation reaction&#160;and suppress the competing two-electron pathway in the oxygen reduction reaction, leading to high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysis for energy conversion and beyond.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing high-performance electrocatalysts for the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for the commercialization of direct ethanol fuel cells, but it is still formidably challenging. In this work, a novel Pd&#8211;Sb hexagonal nanoplate for boosting both cathodic and anodic fuel cell reactions is prepared. Detailed characterizations reveal that the nanoplates have ordered rhombohedral phase of Pd&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (denoted as Pd&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; HPs). The Pd&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; HPs exhibit&#160;much enhanced activity toward the oxidation of various alcohols. Particularly, Pd&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; HPs/C displays superior specific and mass activities of 29.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 4.5&#160;A&#160;mg&lt;sub&gt;Pd&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; toward the EOR, which are 7.0 and 11.3 times higher than those of commercial Pd/C, and 9.8 and 3.8 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively, representing one of the best EOR catalysts reported to date. In situ electrochemical attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) measurements reveal that Pd&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; HPs/C can effectively promote the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pathway of the EOR. As revealed by density functional theory calculations, the high EOR activity of the Pd&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; HPs can be ascribed to the reduced energy barrier of ethanol dehydrogenation. Additionally, Pd&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; HPs/C also shows superior performance in the&#160;ORR. This work advances the controllable synthesis of the Pd&#8211;Sb nanostructure, giving huge impetus for the design&#160;of high-efficiency electrocatalysts for energy conversion and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revealing the Structural Coloration of Self&#8208;Assembled Chitin Nanocrystal Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chitin nanocrystals can be sustainably extracted from mushrooms and shrimp shells. These elongated nanoparticles spontaneously organize in water to form a chiral nematic mesophase. Upon evaporation, this helicoidal architecture is preserved, resulting in structurally colored films. An alkaline post&#8208;treatment to convert chitin into chitosan is found to significantly enhance the birefringence, resulting in vibrant red, green, and blue coloration.








Abstract
The structural coloration of arthropods often arises from helicoidal structures made primarily of chitin. Although it is possible to achieve analogous helicoidal architectures by exploiting the self&#8208;assembly of chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs), to date no evidence of structural coloration has been reported from such structures. Previous studies are identified to have been constrained by both the experimental inability to access sub&#8208;micrometer helicoidal pitches and the intrinsically low birefringence of crystalline chitin. To expand the range of accessible pitches, here, ChNCs are isolated from two phylogenetically distinct sources of &#945;&#8208;chitin, namely fungi and shrimp, while to increase the birefringence, an in situ alkaline treatment is performed, increasing the intensity of the reflected color by nearly two orders of magnitude. By combining this treatment with precise control over ChNC suspension formulation, structurally colored chitin&#8208;based films are demonstrated with reflection tunable from blue to near infrared.

         <title>3R Electronics: Scalable Fabrication of Resilient, Repairable, and Recyclable Soft&#8208;Matter Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
3R&#8208;electronics are introduced here: the next generation of soft&#8208;matter electronics that are Resilient, Repairable and Recyclable. It is proposed that 3R&#8208;electronics should replace current electronics, as they permit sustainable circular economy. 3R&#8208;electronics are implemented through novel liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based composites, unique high&#8208;resolution digital fabrication techniques, and an unprecedented room&#8208;temperature soldering method that permits for the first time, utilization of heat&#8208;sensitive polymers in microchip&#8208;integrated circuits.








Abstract
E&#8208;waste is rapidly turning into another man&#8208;made disaster. It is proposed that a paradigm shift toward a more sustainable future can be made through soft&#8208;matter electronics that are resilient, repairable if damaged, and recyclable (3R), provided that they achieve the same level of maturity as industrial electronics. This includes high&#8208;resolution patterning, multilayer implementation, microchip integration, and automated fabrication. Herein, a novel architecture of materials and methods for microchip&#8208;integrated condensed soft&#8208;matter 3R electronics is demonstrated. The 3R function is enabled by a biphasic liquid metal&#8208;based composite, a block copolymer with nonpermanent physical crosslinks, and an electrochemical technique for material recycling. In addition, an autonomous laser&#8208;patterning method for scalable circuit patterning with an exceptional resolution of &lt;30&#160;&#181;m in seconds is developed. The phase&#8208;shifting property of the BCPs is utilized for vapor&#8208;assisted &#8220;soldering&#8221; circuit repairing and recycling. The process is performed entirely at room temperature, thereby opening the door for a wide range of heat&#8208;sensitive and biodegradable polymers for the next generation of green electronics. The implementation and recycling of sophisticated skin&#8208;mounted patches with embedded sensors, electrodes, antennas, and microchips that build a digital fingerprint of the human electrophysiological signals is demonstrated by collecting mechanical, electrical, optical, and thermal data from the epidermis.

Atomically dispersing Fe(III) sites into fine&#8208;tuned nitrogen&#8208;rich graphitic carbon nitride nanotubes are designed for peracetic acid activation and further for Fenton&#8208;like reactions. This work opens a new avenue to develop heterogenous catalytic systems with higher reactivity and better durability using a double engine mechanism.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have emerged as an efficient oxidant activator for eliminating organic pollutants in Fenton&#8208;like systems. However, the complex preparation, single active site, lack of understanding of the fundamental mechanism, and harsh pH conditions currently limit their practical applications. In this work, single&#8208;atom iron anchored nitrogen&#8208;rich g&#8208;C3N4 nanotubes (FeCNs) are designed and synthesized by a facile approach, and eco&#8208;friendly peracetic acid (PAA) is selected as the oxidant for Fenton&#8208;like reactions. The constructed heterogenous system achieves an enhanced degradation of various organic contaminants over a wide pH range of 3.0&#8211;9.0, exhibiting an ultrahigh and stable catalytic activity, outperforming equivalent quantities of pristine g&#8208;C3N4 by 75 times. The 18O isotope&#8208;labeling technique, probe method, and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the efficient catalytic activity relies on the high&#8208;valency iron&#8208;oxo species coupled with organic radicals generated by PAA. An increase in electron transport from the contaminant to the formed &#8220;metastable PAA/FeCN catalyst surface complex&#8221; is detected. A double driving mechanism for the tubular g&#8208;C3N4 regulated by a single Fe site and PAA activation is proposed. This work opens an avenue for developing novel catalysts with the coexistence of multiple active units and providing opportunities for significantly improving catalytic efficiency.

         <title>An Encapsulation&#8208;Based Sodium Storage via Zn&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Implanted Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing a functional encapsulation&#8208;based sodium storage void with abundant pore structure and enriched Zn single atom sites in the inner wall is presented here. Zn single atoms provide abundant selective sodiophilic nucleation sites. Due to the rich pore structure, ZIF&#8208;derived carbon shells can provide geometric constraints and excellent ion/electron transport channels to maintain fast electron/ion contact, benefiting for encapsulating large amounts of metallic sodium.








Abstract
The properties of high theoretical capacity, low cost, and large potential of metallic sodium (Na) has strongly promoted the development of rechargeable sodium&#8208;based batteries. However, the issues of infinite volume variation, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and dendritic sodium causes a rapid decline in performance and notorious safety hazards. Herein, a highly reversible encapsulation&#8208;based sodium storage by designing a functional hollow carbon nanotube with Zn single atom sites embedded in the carbon shell (ZnSA&#8208;HCNT) is achieved. The appropriate tube space can encapsulate bulk sodium inside; the inner enriched ZnSA sites provide abundant sodiophilic sites, which can evidently reduce the nucleation barrier of Na deposition. Moreover, the carbon shell derived from ZIF&#8208;8 provides geometric constraints and excellent ion/electron transport channels for the rapid transfer of Na+ due to its pore&#8208;rich shell, which can be revealed by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As expected, Na@ZnSA&#8208;HCNT anodes present steady long&#8208;term performance in symmetrical battery (&gt;900 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). Moreover, superior electrochemical performance of Na@ZnSA&#8208;HCNT||PB full cells can be delivered. This work develops a new strategy based on carbon nanotube encapsulation of metallic sodium, which improves the safety and cycling performance of sodium metal anode.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The properties of high theoretical capacity, low cost, and large potential of metallic sodium (Na) has strongly promoted the development of rechargeable sodium-based batteries. However, the issues of infinite volume variation, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and dendritic sodium causes a rapid decline in performance and notorious safety hazards. Herein, a highly reversible encapsulation-based sodium storage by designing a functional hollow carbon nanotube with Zn single atom sites embedded in the carbon shell (Zn&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;-HCNT) is achieved. The appropriate tube space can encapsulate bulk sodium inside; the inner enriched Zn&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt; sites provide abundant sodiophilic sites, which can evidently reduce the nucleation barrier of Na deposition. Moreover, the carbon shell derived from ZIF-8 provides geometric constraints and excellent ion/electron transport channels for the rapid transfer of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; due to its pore-rich shell, which can be revealed by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As expected, Na@Zn&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;-HCNT anodes present steady long-term performance in symmetrical battery (&amp;gt;900 h at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Moreover, superior electrochemical performance of Na@Zn&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;-HCNT||PB full cells can be delivered. This work develops a new strategy based on carbon nanotube encapsulation of metallic sodium, which improves the safety and cycling performance of sodium metal anode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Uneven Stripping Behavior, an Unheeded&#160;Killer of Mg Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An astonishingly uniform electroplating morphology is proven under practical current density and areal capacity in rechargeable Mg batteries, and an asymmetric phenomenon between the plating and stripping processes is discovered. More critically, a nonlinear volcano relation between the non&#8208;uniformity of the stripping morphology and the current density is proposed, which is defined by the distribution of chlorine&#8208;containing complex ions at the interface.








Abstract
Uniform magnesium (Mg) plating/stripping under high areal capacity utilization is critical for the practical application of Mg&#8208;metal anodes in rechargeable Mg batteries. However, the failure of the Mg&#8208;metal anode when cycling under a practical areal capacity (&gt;4&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2), is of rising concern. The mechanism behind these failures remains controversial. In this work, it is illustrated that the initial plating Mg can be undoubtedly uniform in a wide range of current densities (&#8804;5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and under a practical areal capacity (6&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2). However, an unusual self&#8208;accelerating pit growth is observed in the Mg stripping side under moderate current densities (0.1&#8211;1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), which severely deteriorates the anode integrity and subsequent Mg plating uniformity, causing failure of the Mg&#8208;metal anode or short circuit of the battery. The stripping morphology depends on the applied current density, as non&#8208;uniformity versus the current density displays a volcano plot during the stripping process. Through in situ spectroscopy, it is illustrated that this current&#8208;dependent behavior is determined by the evolution of chlorine&#8208;containing complex ions near the interface. This research reminds that the plating/stripping process of the Mg&#8208;metal anode must be considered comprehensively for practical Mg&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Atomic and Electronic Manipulation of Robust Ferroelectric Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
True 2D ferroelectricity up to T&#160;= 400 K is achieved via atomic and electronic manipulation of polymorphs in Mo1&#8722;xWxTe2, developing an original phase diagram for ferroelectricity in atomically thin materials.








Abstract
Polymorphism allows the symmetry of the lattice and spatial charge distributions of atomically thin materials to be designed. While various polymorphs for superconducting, magnetic, and topological states have been extensively studied, polymorphic control is a challenge for robust ferroelectricity in atomically thin geometries. Here, the atomic and electric manipulation of ferroelectric polymorphs in Mo1&#8722;xWxTe2 is reported. Atomic manipulation for polymorphic control via chemical pressure (substituting tungsten for molybdenum atoms) and charge density modulation can realize tunable polar lattice structures and robust ferroelectricity up to T&#160;= 400 K with a constant coercive field in an atomically thin material. Owing to the effective inversion symmetry breaking, the ferroelectric switching withstands a charge carrier density of up to 1.1 &#215; 1013 cm&#8722;2, developing an original diagram for ferroelectric switching in atomically thin materials.

         <title>Stable and Bright Electroluminescent Devices utilizing Emissive 0D Perovskite Nanocrystals Incorporated in a 3D CsPbBr3 Matrix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly luminescent 0D Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals are incorporated into 3D CsPbBr3 films&#160;to form single&#8208;layer perovskite light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells. The 0D Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals improve the maximum luminance to 11&#8239;200&#160;cd m&#8722;2, the power efficiency to 33.0 Lm W&#8722;1, the external quantum efficiency to 8.3%, and the operational stability to 129 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The 0D cesium lead halide perovskite Cs4PbBr6 has drawn remarkable interest due to its highly efficient robust green emission compared to its 3D CsPbBr3 counterpart. However, seizing the advantages of the superior photoluminescence properties for practical light&#8208;emitting devices remains elusive. To date, Cs4PbBr6 has been employed only as a higher&#8208;bandgap nonluminescent matrix to passivate or provide quantum/dielectric confinement to CsPbBr3 in light&#8208;emitting devices and to enhance its photo&#8208;/thermal/environmental stability. To resolve this disparity, a novel solvent engineering method to incorporate highly luminescent 0D Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals (perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs)) into a 3D CsPbBr3 film, forming the active emissive layer in single&#8208;layer perovskite light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (PeLECs) is designed. A dramatic increase of the maximum external quantum efficiency and luminance from 2.7% and 6050&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for a 3D&#8208;only PeLEC to 8.3% and 11&#8239;200&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for a 3D&#8211;0D PNC device with only 7% by weight of 0D PNCs is observed. The majority of this increase is driven by the efficient inherent emission of the 0D PNCs, while the concomitant morphology improvement also contributes to reduced leakage current, reduced hysteresis, and enhanced operational lifetime (half&#8208;life of 129 h), making this one of the best&#8208;performing LECs reported to date.

         <title>Observation of Topological Edge States in Thermal Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological phases have been demonstrated in various wave systems, however, they still remain unexplored in a purely diffusive system. This work reveals the topological phase in a&#160;purely diffusive system, that is, a thermal lattice. The experimental results show that the nontrivial topological phase of the thermal lattice can enable thermal edge states that exponentially decay within the gap of bulk decays.








Abstract
Topological band theory predicts that bulk materials with nontrivial topological phases support topological edge states. This phenomenon is universal for various wave systems and is widely observed for electromagnetic and acoustic waves. Here, the notion of band topology is extended from wave to diffusion dynamics. Unlike wave systems that are usually Hermitian, diffusion systems are anti&#8208;Hermitian with purely imaginary eigenvalues corresponding to decay rates. By direct probe of the temperature diffusion, the Hamiltonian of a thermal lattice is experimentally retrieved, and the emergence of topological edge decays is observed within the gap of bulk decays. The results of this work show that such edge states exhibit robust decay rates, which are topologically protected against disorder. This work constitutes a thermal analogue of topological insulators and paves the way to exploring defect&#8208;immune heat dissipation.

         <title>Unraveling Device Physics of Dilute&#8208;Donor Narrow&#8208;Bandgap Organic Solar Cells with Highly Transparent Active Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active layers for (semi&#8208;)transparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs) must meet high transparency requirements for integrated energy&#8208;harvesting solutions. A pathway towards high visible transparency is combining a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing acceptor material with small fractions of a visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing donor component. An in&#8208;depth analysis of three blend systems yields an in&#8208;depth understanding of the device physics upon reduction of the donor.








Abstract
The charge generation&#8211;recombination dynamics in three narrow&#8208;bandgap near&#8208;IR absorbing nonfullerene (NFA) based organic photovoltaic (OPV) systems with varied donor concentrations of 40%, 30%, and 20% are investigated. The dilution of the polymer donor with visible&#8208;range absorption leads to highly transparent active layers with blend average visible transmittance (AVT) values of 64%, 70%, and 77%, respectively. Opaque devices in the optimized highly reproducible device configuration comprising these transparent active layers lead to photoconversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 7.0%, 6.5%, and 4.1%. The investigation of these structures yields quantitative insights into changes in the charge generation, non&#8208;geminate charge recombination, and extraction dynamics upon dilution of the donor. Lastly, this study gives an outlook for employing the highly transparent active layers in semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs).

&lt;p&gt;Active layers for (semi-)transparent organic photovoltaics (ST-OPVs) must meet high transparency requirements for integrated energy-harvesting solutions. A pathway towards high visible transparency is combining a near-infrared-absorbing acceptor material with small fractions of a visible-light-absorbing donor component. An in-depth analysis of three blend systems yields an in-depth understanding of the device physics upon reduction of the donor.

Photoactive Materials
Next&#8208;generation photovoltaics will be lightweight, flexible, and (semi)transparent. Highly transparent organic photoactive materials are reported by Thuc&#8208;Quyen Nguyen, Viktor Brus, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2203796. The changes in the fundamental processes in solar cells comprising a near&#8208;IR&#8208;absorbing acceptor and a visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing donor are revealed upon dilution of the donor material, paving the way for integrated energy&#8208;harvesting solutions based on semitransparent organic photovoltaics.

Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes
Intrinsically stretchable light&#8208;emitting diodes (ISOLEDs) are becoming increasingly important for wearable electronics. In article number 2203040, Han&#8208;Young Woo, Tae&#8208;Woo Lee, and co&#8208;workers report the design of highly efficient ISOLEDs that use a graphene&#8208;based 2D&#8208;contact stretchable electrode. As a benefit of a newly designed conjugated polyelectrolyte with efficient electron injection capability, the ISOLED yields an unprecedently high current efficiency of 20.3 cd A&#8722;1.

Superhydrophobic Coatings
A skin&#8208;inspired triple&#8208;layered superhydrophobic coating concept is proposed by Libin Liu, Zuankai Wang, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2203792. By a facile step&#8208;by&#8208;step spraying process and careful control of the components of each layer, continuous interfaces within layers are achieved, endowing the integration of superhydrophobicity, excellent abrasion resistance, and flame retardancy into one coating.

A comprehensive overview of fully stretchable organic solar cells (f&#8208;SOSCs), including essential studies to make each layer of an f&#8208;SOSC stretchable and efficient is provided. Various strategies to simultaneously enhance the photovoltaic and mechanical properties of the active layer, ranging from material design to fabrication control, are emphasized.








Abstract
Recent advances in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) have greatly enhanced their commercial viability. Considering the technical standards (e.g., mechanical robustness) required for wearable electronics, which are promising application platforms for OSCs, the development of fully stretchable OSCs (f&#8208;SOSCs) should be accelerated. Here, a comprehensive overview of f&#8208;SOSCs, which are aimed to reliably operate under various forms of mechanical stress, including bending and multidirectional stretching, is provided. First, the mechanical requirements of f&#8208;SOSCs, in terms of tensile and cohesion/adhesion properties, are summarized along with the experimental methods to evaluate those properties. Second, essential studies to make each layer of f&#8208;SOSCs stretchable and efficient are discussed, emphasizing strategies to simultaneously enhance the photovoltaic and mechanical properties of the active layer, ranging from material design to fabrication control. Key improvements to the other components/layers (i.e., substrate, electrodes, and interlayers) are also covered. Lastly, considering that f&#8208;SOSC research is in its infancy, the current challenges and future prospects are explored.

         <title>Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Based Hollow Mesoporous Nanoparticles: Synthesis Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in the synthesis and catalysis&#8208;related applications of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based hollow mesoporous nanoparticles (HMNs) is summarized in detail. This Review will help the readers to understand the challenges and more importantly provide insights into designing novel multifunctional HMN&#8208;based nanomaterials.








Abstract
As second&#8208;generation mesoporous materials, mesoporous noble metals (NMs) are of significant interest for their wide applications in catalysis, sensing, bioimaging, and biotherapy owing to their structural and metallic features. The introduction of interior hollow cavity into NM&#8208;based mesoporous nanoparticles (MNs), which subtly integrate hierarchical hollow and mesoporous structure into one nanoparticle, produces a new type of hollow MNs (HMNs). Benefiting from their higher active surface, better electron/mass transfer, optimum electronic structure, and nanoconfinement space, NM&#8208;based HMNs exhibit their high efficiency in enhancing catalytic activity and stability and tuning catalytic selectivity. In this review, recent progress in the design, synthesis, and catalytic applications of NM&#8208;based HMNs is summarized, including the findings of the groups. Five main strategies for synthesizing NM&#8208;based HMNs, namely silica&#8208;assisted surfactant&#8208;templated nucleation, surfactant&#8208;templated sequential nucleation, soft &#8220;dual&#8221;&#8208;template, Kirkendall effect in synergistic template, and galvanic&#8208;replacement&#8208;assisted surfactant template, are described in detail. In addition, the applications in ethanol oxidation electrocatalysis and hydrogenation reactions are discussed to highlight the high activity, enhanced stability, and optimal selectivity of NM&#8208;based HMNs in (electro)catalysis. Finally, the further outlook that may lead the directions of synthesis and applications of NM&#8208;based HMNs is prospected.

         <title>Bionic Regulators Break the Ecological Niche of Pathogenic Bacteria for Modulating Dysregulated Microbiome in Colitis</title>

Abstract
Therapeutic approaches that reprogram the gut microbiome are promising strategies to alleviate and cure inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, abnormal expansion of E. coli during inflammation can promote pathogenic bacteria occupying ecological niches to resist reprogramming of the microbiome. Herein, we develop a bionic regulator (CaWO4@YCW) to efficiently and precisely regulate the gut microbiome by specifically suppressing the abnormal expansion of E. coli during colitis and boosting probiotic growth. Inspired by the binding of E. coli strains to the mannose&#8208;rich yeast cell wall (YCW), we chose YCW as the bionic shell to encapsulate CaWO4. We demonstrate that the YCW shell endows CaWO4 with superior resistance to the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract and adheres to the abnormally expanded E. coli in colitis, specifically as a positioner. Notably, the high expression of calprotectin at the colitis site triggers the release of tungsten ions through calcium deprivation in CaWO4, thus inhibiting E. coli growth by replacing molybdenum in the molybdopterin cofactor. Moreover, YCW functions as a prebiotic and promotes probiotic growth. Consequently, CaWO4@YCW can efficiently and precisely reprogram the gut microbiome by eliminating pathogenic bacteria and providing prebiotics, resulting in an extraordinary therapeutic advantage for DSS&#8208;induced colitis.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymer&#8208;based dielectrics have received intensive interest from academic community in the field of high&#8208;power energy storage owing to their superior flexibility and fast charge&#8208;discharge ability. Recently, how to suppress the loss of polymer&#8208;based dielectrics has been increasingly recognized as a critical point to attain a high charge&#8208;discharge efficiency in the film capacitors. Some achievements have been made in analyzing the source of loss and suppressing loss via Edison's trial and error method. In this review, the significance of suppressing loss in polymer&#8208;based dielectrics is firstly emphasized. Then, different sources of loss are discussed carefully and an in&#8208;depth analysis of the related measurements is presented. Next, recent research results in suppressing loss are summarized and discussed and discussed in detail according to different strategies. Lastly, the challenges and opportunities in the loss suppression research for the rational design of high&#8208;efficiency polymer&#8208;based dielectrics are proposed.

         <title>Accurate wavelength tracking by exciton spin mixing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Wavelength discriminating systems typically consist of heavy benchtop&#8208;based instruments, comprising diffractive optics, moving parts, and adjacent detectors. For simple wavelength measurements, such as lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip light source calibration or laser wavelength tracking, which do not require polychromatic analysis and cannot handle bulky spectroscopy instruments, light&#8208;weight, easy&#8208;to&#8208;process, and flexible single&#8208;pixel devices are attracting increasing attention. Here, we propose a device for monotonously transforming wavelength information into the time domain with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence at the heart of its functionality that demonstrates a resolution down to one nanometer and below. It is solution&#8208;processed from a single host&#8208;guest system comprising organic room&#8208;temperature phosphors and colloidal quantum dots. The share of excited triplet states within the photoluminescent layer is dependent on the excitation wavelength and determines the afterglow intensity of the film, which is tracked by a simple photodetector. Finally, an all&#8208;organic thin&#8208;film wavelength sensor and two applications are demonstrated where our novel measurement concept successfully replaces a full spectrometer.

         <title>Roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll Fabrication of Zero&#8208;Volume&#8208;Expansion Lithium Composite Anodes to Realize High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Flexible and Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal anode offers a promising solution for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, the significant volume expansion of Li metal during charge results in poor cycling stability as a result of the dendritic deposition and broken solid electrolyte interphase. Herein, we propose a facile one&#8208;step roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll fabrication of a zero&#8208;volume&#8208;expansion Li metal composite anode (zeroVE&#8208;Li) to realize the outstanding electrochemical and mechanical stability of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs. The zeroVE&#8208;Li possesses a sandwich&#8208;like trilayer structure, which consists of an upper electron&#8208;insulating layer and a bottom lithiophilic layer that synergistically guides the Li deposition from the bottom up, and a middle porous layer that eliminates the volume expansion. This sandwich structure eliminates dendrite formation, prevents volume change during cycling, and provides outstanding flexibility to the Li metal anode even at a practical areal capacity over 3.0 mAh cm&#8211;2. Pairing zeroVE&#8208;Li with commercial NMC811 or LCO cathode, we demonstrate flexible LMBs that offer a record&#8208;breaking Figure of Merit (FOM, 45.6), large whole&#8208;cell energy density (375&#160;Wh L&#8211;1, based on the volume of the anode, separator, cathode, and package), high&#8208;capacity retention (&gt;99.8% per cycle), and remarkable mechanical robustness under practical conditions.

         <title>Enabling Electron Injection for Microbial Electrosynthesis with n&#8208;Type Conjugated Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating Shewanella oneidensis&#160;MR&#8208;1 with a newly synthesized n&#8208;type conjugated polyelectrolyte forms a 3D conductive network that allows efficient electron transfer from electrode to living cells, thereby enabling microbial electrosynthesis. The one&#8208;step self&#8208;assembly process offers a simple and effective strategy to improve bioelectrochemical systems.








Abstract
Microbial electrosynthesis&#8212;using renewable electricity to stimulate microbial metabolism&#8212;holds the promise of sustainable chemical production. A key limitation hindering performance is slow electron&#8208;transfer rates at biotic&#8211;abiotic interfaces. Here a new n&#8208;type conjugated polyelectrolyte is rationally designed and synthesized and its use is demonstrated as a soft conductive material to encapsulate electroactive bacteria Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1. The self&#8208;assembled 3D living biocomposite amplifies current uptake from the electrode &#8776;674&#8208;fold over controls with the same initial number of cells, thereby enabling continuous synthesis of succinate from fumarate. Such functionality is a result of the increased number of bacterial cells having intimate electronic communication with the electrode and a higher current uptake per cell. This is underpinned by the molecular design of the polymer to have an n&#8208;dopable conjugated backbone for facile reduction by the electrode and zwitterionic side chains for compatibility with aqueous media. Moreover, direct arylation polycondensation is employed instead of the traditional Stille polymerization to avoid non&#8208;biocompatible tin by&#8208;products. By demonstrating synergy between living cells with n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials, these results provide new strategies for improving the performance of bioelectrosynthesis technologies.

         <title>Controlled Formation of Conduction Channels in Memristive Devices Observed by X&#8208;ray Multimodal Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While neuromorphic computing provides a means for achieving faster and more energy efficient computations, the accuracy needs improvement by reducing the randomness of memristive behavior. The controlled formation of conduction channels is shown here, as observed by X&#8208;ray multimodal imaging of both oxygen stoichiometry and crystallinity. The results suggest an effective route for controlling the otherwise random electroforming process.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing provides a means for achieving faster and more energy efficient computations than conventional digital computers for artificial intelligence (AI). However, its current accuracy is generally less than the dominant software&#8208;based AI. The key to improving accuracy is to reduce the intrinsic randomness of memristive devices, emulating synapses in the brain for neuromorphic computing. Here using a planar device as a model system, the controlled formation of conduction channels is achieved with high oxygen vacancy concentrations through the design of sharp protrusions in the electrode gap, as observed by X&#8208;ray multimodal imaging of both oxygen stoichiometry and crystallinity. Classical molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the controlled formation of conduction channels arises from confinement of the electric field, yielding a reproducible spatial distribution of oxygen vacancies across switching cycles. This work demonstrates an effective route to control the otherwise random electroforming process by electrode design, facilitating the development of more accurate memristive devices for neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Porosity MgO Microparticles for Heat&#8208;Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By making the MgO particles ultrahighly porous, the structural collapse due to volume changes is minimized when hydration and dehydration reactions occur. Additionally, upon using a very large reaction surface, pure MgO not only reaches 90.3% of the theoretical storage value, but also reaches a high reaction rate. The stability of the heat storage and release cycle is confirmed.








Abstract
Continuous industrial development has increased the demand of energy. Inevitably, the development of energy sources is steadily progressing using various methods. Rather than establishing a new energy source, a system for storing waste heat generated by industry has now been accepted as a useful strategy.

&lt;p&gt;By making the MgO particles ultrahighly porous, the structural collapse due to volume changes is minimized when hydration and dehydration reactions occur. Additionally, upon using a very large reaction surface, pure MgO not only reaches 90.3% of the theoretical storage value, but also reaches a high reaction rate. The stability of the heat storage and release cycle is confirmed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous industrial development has increased the demand of energy. Inevitably, the development of energy sources is steadily progressing using various methods. Rather than establishing a new energy source, a system for storing waste heat generated by industry has now been accepted as a useful strategy. Among such systems, the hydration and dehydration reactions of MgO/Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;are eco-friendly, have relatively low toxicity and risk, and have a large reserves. Therefore, it is a promising candidate for a heat-storage system. In this study, ultrahigh-porosity particles are used to maximize the heat-storage efficiency of pure MgO. Due to its large surface area, the heat storage rate is 90.3% of the theoretical value and the reaction rate is very high. In addition, as structural collapse, likely to be caused by volume changes between reactions, is blocked as the porous region is filled and emptied, the cycle stability is secured.

         <title>Multiscale Functional Metal Architectures by Antibody&#8208;Guided Metallization of Specific Protein Assemblies in Ex Vivo Multicellular Organisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of metallic structures mimicking the specific protein assemblies in multicellular organisms, such as human cells and animal tissue, is demonstrated via antibody&#8211;antigen interactions and electroless deposition. This work enables the use of diverse protein structures that are arranged in unique 3D geometries optimized for certain functions as scaffolds for biotemplating.








Abstract
Biological systems consist of hierarchical protein structures, each of which has unique 3D&#160;geometries optimized for specific functions. In the past decades, the growth of inorganic materials on specific proteins has attracted considerable attention. However, the use of specific proteins as templates has only been demonstrated in relatively simple organisms, such as viruses, limiting the range of structures that can be used as scaffolds. This study proposes a method for synthesizing metallic structures that resemble the 3D assemblies of specific proteins in mammalian cells and animal tissues. Using 1.4 nm nanogold&#8208;conjugated antibodies, specific proteins within cells and ex vivo tissues are labeled, and then the nanogold acts as nucleation sites for growth of metal particles. As proof of concept, various metal particles are grown using microtubules in cells as templates. The metal&#8208;containing cells are applied as catalysts and show catalytic stability in liquid&#8208;phase reactions due to the rigid support provided by the microtubules. Finally, this method is used to produce metal structures that replicate the specific protein assemblies of neurons in the mouse brain or the extracellular matrices in the mouse kidney and heart. This new biotemplating approach can facilitate the conversion of specific protein structures into metallic forms in ex vivo multicellular organisms.

         <title>A New Polymer Donor Enables Binary All&#8208;Polymer Organic Photovoltaic Cells with 18% Efficiency and Excellent Mechanical Robustness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rational molecular design, a polymer donor named PQM&#8208;Cl is designed. Optimal power conversion efficiencies of 18.0% and 16.5% are achieved in rigid and flexible all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic cells, respectively. This work demonstrates that PQM&#8208;Cl is a promising polymer donor and the design of new polymer donors is essential for further improving the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.








Abstract
The development of polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors has boosted the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells to 17%. However, the polymer donors suitable for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells are still lacking, restricting the further improvement of their PCEs. Herein, a new polymer donor named PQM&#8208;Cl is designed and its photovoltaic performance is explored. The negative electrostatic potential and low average local ionization energy distribution of the PQM&#8208;Cl surface enable efficient charge generation and transfer process. When blending with a well&#8208;used polymer acceptor, PY&#8208;IT, the PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based devices deliver an impressive PCE of 18.0% with a superior fill factor of 80.7%, both of which are the highest values for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells. The relevant measurements demonstrate that PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based films possess excellent mechanical and flexible properties. As such, PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based flexible photovoltaic cells are fabricated and an excellent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability is displayed. These results demonstrate that PQM&#8208;Cl is a potential candidate for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells and provide insights into the design of polymer donors for high&#8208;efficient all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.

         <title>Thermal Radiation Driven Ultrafast Crystallization of Perovskite Films Under Heavy Humidity for Efficient Inverted Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fabricating perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in air is conducive to low&#8208;cost commercial production, nevertheless it is rather difficult to achieve comparable device performance as that in an inert atmosphere because of poor moisture toleration of perovskite materials. Here, the perovskite crystallization process was systematically studied using two&#8208;step sequential solution deposition in inert atmosphere (glovebox) and air. We found that moisture can stabilize solvation intermediates and prevent their conversion into perovskite crystals. To address this issue, we used thermal radiation to accelerate perovskite crystallization for integrated perovskite films within 10 s in air. The as&#8208;formed perovskite films were compact, highly oriented with giant grain size, superior photoelectric properties, and low trap density. When the films were applied to PSC devices, we obtained a champion power conversion efficiency of 20.8%, one of the best results for air&#8208;processed inverted PSCs under high relative humidity (60&#177;10%). This work substantially assists understanding and modulation to perovskite crystallization kinetics under heavy humidity. Also, the ultrafast conversion strategy by thermal radiation provides unprecedented opportunities to manufacture high&#8208;quality perovskite films for low&#8208;temperature, eco&#8208;friendly, and air&#8208;processed efficient inverted PSCs.

         <title>Robust Piezoelectricity with Spontaneous Polarization in Monolayer Tellurene and Multilayer Tellurium Film at Room Temperature for Reliable Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust piezoelectricity with spontaneous polarization is detected in tellurene at room temperature due to the strong anisotropic property and dipoles induced by unique charity helical chain structure and strong intramolecular interactions. A charming memory window and high on switching current are realized in tellurene&#8208;based memory, providing a new platform to construct robust memory cells for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Robust neuromorphic computing in the Big Data era calls for long&#8208;term stable crossbar&#8208;array memory cells; however, the elemental segregation in the switch unit and memory unit that inevitably occurs upon cycling breaks the compositional and structural stability, making the whole memory cell a failure. Searching for a novel material without segregation that can be used for both switch and memory units is the major concern to fabricate robust and reliable nonvolatile cross&#8208;array memory cells. Tellurium (Te) is found recently to be the only peculiar material without segregation for switching, but the memory function has not been demonstrated yet. Herein, apparent piezoelectricity is experimentally confirmed with spontaneous polarization behaviors in elementary 2D Te, even in monolayer tellurene (0.4&#160;nm), due to the highly oriented polarization of the molecular structure and the non&#8208;centrosymmetric lattice structure. A large memory window of 7000, a low working voltage of 2&#160;V, and high on switching current up to 36.6 &#181;A&#8201;&#181;m&#8722;1 are achieved in the as&#8208;fabricated Te&#8208;based memory device, revealing the great promise of Te for both switching and memory units in one cell without segregation. The piezoelectric Te with spontaneous polarization provides a platform to build robust, reliable, and high&#8208;density logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory chips in neuromorphic computing.

Abstract
Metal halide perovskites combine excellent electronic and optical properties such as defect tolerance and high photoluminescence efficiency with the benefits of low&#8208;cost, large area, solution&#8208;based processing. Composition&#8208; and dimension&#8208;tunable properties of perovskites have already been utilized in bright and efficient light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). At the same time, there are still great challenges ahead to achieve operational and spectral stability of these devices. In this review, we consider the origins of instability of perovskite materials, and reasons for their degradation in LEDs. We then review the strategies on improving the stability of perovskite materials such as compositional engineering, dimensionality control, defect passivation, suitable encapsulation matrices, and fabrication of core/shell perovskite nanocrystals. For improvement of the operational stability of perovskite LEDs, we consider use of inorganic charge transport layers, optimization of charge balance, and proper thermal management. We conclude this review with a detailed account of the current challenges and a perspective on the key approaches and opportunities on how to reach the goal of stable, bright and efficient perovskite LEDs.

         <title>Advances in Colloidal Building Blocks: Toward Patchy Colloidal Clusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A scalable synthetic route to colloidal atoms has significantly advanced over the past two decades. Recently, colloidal clusters with DNA&#8208;coated cores called &#8220;patchy colloidal clusters&#8221; have been developed, providing a directional bonding with specific angle of rotation due to the shape complementarity between colloidal clusters. Through a DNA&#8208;mediated interlocking process, they were directly assembled into low&#8208;coordination colloidal structures, such as cubic diamond lattices. This review details the significant progress in recent years in the synthesis of&#160;patchy colloidal clusters and their assembly in experiments and simulations. Furthermore, an outlook is given on the emerging approaches to the patchy colloidal clusters and their potential applications in photonic crystals, metamaterials, topological photonic insulators, and separation membranes.

         <title>A Soft Magnetoelastic Generator for Wind Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The current energy crises and imminent danger of global warming severely limits our ability to scale societal development sustainably. As such, there is a pressing need for utilizing renewable, green energy sources such as wind energy which is ubiquitously available on Earth. In this work, we report a fundamentally new wind energy harvesting technology based on the giant magnetoelastic effect in a soft composite system, namely, magnetoelastic generators. Wind&#8208;induced mechanical deformation alters the magnetic field in a soft system, which converts wind energy into electricity via electromagnetic induction from arbitrary directions. The wind energy harvesting system features a low internal impedance of 68 &#937;, a high current density of 1.17&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, and a power density of 0.82&#160;mW cm&#8211;2 under ambient natural winds. The system is capable of sustainably driving small electronics and electrolytically splitting water. The system can generate hydrogen at a rate of 7.5 &#215; 10&#8211;2&#160;mL h&#8211;1 with a wind speed of 20 m/s. Additionally, since magnetic fields can penetrate water molecules, the magnetoelastic generators are intrinsically waterproof and work stably in harsh environments. This work paves way for wind energy harvesting with compelling features, which can contribute largely to the hydrogen economy and the sustainability of human civilization

         <title>Manipulating Offense and Defense Signaling to Fight Cold Tumors with Carrier&#8208;Free Nanoassembly of Fluorinated Prodrug and siRNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Chemoimmunotherapy has shown great potential to activate immune response, but immunosuppressive microenvironment associated T cell exhaustion remains a challenge in cancer therapy. The proper immune&#8208;modulatory strategy to provoke a robust immune response is to simultaneously regulate T&#8208;cell exhaustion and infiltration. Here, a new kind of carrier&#8208;free nanoparticle (NP) was developed to simultaneously deliver chemotherapeutic drug (doxorubicin, DOX), cytolytic peptide (melittin, MPI), and anti&#8208;TOX small interfering RNA (thymocyte selection&#8208;associated high mobility group box protein, TOX) using a fluorinated prodrug strategy. In this way, the enhanced immunogenic cell death induced by the combination of DOX and MPI can act as &#8220;offense&#8221; signaling to increase CD8+ T&#8208;cell infiltration, while the decreased TOX expression interfered with siTOX can serve as &#8220;defense&#8221; signaling to mitigate CD8+ T&#8208;cell exhaustion. As a result, the integration of DOX, MPI, and siTOX in such a bifunctional system produced a potent antitumor immune response in liver cancer and metastasis, making it a promising delivery platform and effective strategy for converting &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221; ones.

         <title>Optothermally Programmable Liquids with Spatiotemporal Precision and Functional Complexity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Due to the intrinsic lack of spatial order and self&#8208;supported shape, liquids are often incompatible with precision manufacturing/processing and are potentially limited for advanced functionality. Herein, we develop an optothermal strategy to fully command phase&#8208;separated liquids with unprecedent spatiotemporal addressability. Specifically, we focus a laser onto an Au film to create a hot spot that locally demixes a temperature&#8208;responsive solution to produce a single optothermal droplet. Spatial precision (&#8764; 1 micron) is assured by the well&#8208;defined thermal field and temporal accuracy (&#8764; 0.1 s) guaranteed by the fast heating and response rate. Time&#8208;multiplexed laser foci are deployed to engineer the thermal landscape as desired, which in turn dictates the formation/dissolution, positioning, shaping, and dynamic reconfiguration of the phase&#8208;separated liquids. We further program laser foci to orchestrate the liquid patterns in a time&#8208;continuous manner to produce liquid animations on the microscale with high fidelity. While focused laser has been routinely used to manipulate solid particles or to microfabricate solid materials, the current strategy embraces the merits of liquid and features functional complexity in information encryption, payload transportation, and reaction localization. We expect it to be further applicable in scenarios such as subcellular organization of biomolecular condensates and programmable modulation of nonequilibrium systems.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Photoelectric Detection and Imaging Enhanced by the Pyro&#8208;Phototronic Effect Based on a Photoinduced Dynamic Schottky Effect in 4H&#8208;SiC</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance self&#8208;powered 4H&#8208;SiC ultraviolet photodetector is realized using a strong photoinduced dynamic Schottky effect, and the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect is first revealed in N&#8208;doped 4H&#8208;SiC, which is beneficial to further enhance the photodetection performance. Moreover, via delicate position designs of electrodes, the 4H&#8208;SiC chip reveals efficient optical imaging and information transmission capabilities.








Abstract
Silicon carbide (SiC), one of the third&#8208;generation semiconductor materials with excellent electrical and optoelectronic properties, is ideal for high light&#8208;sensing performance. Here, a self&#8208;powered SiC ultraviolet (UV) photodetector (PD) is constructed with wider applicability and higher commercialization potential. The great performance of the PD is realized by a remarkable photoinduced dynamic Schottky effect derived from the symbiotic modulation of Schottky and Ohmic contact. Using the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect that exists in the N&#8208;doped 4H&#8208;SiC single crystal PDs, a fast pyroelectric response time of 0.27 s is achieved, which is almost ten times shorter than that obtained from the steady&#8208;state signal under UV illumination. The maximal transient photoresponsivity reaches 9.12 nA mW&#8722;1, which is &#8776;20% higher than the conventional photoelectric signal. Moreover, different regions of the 4H&#8208;SiC centimeter&#8208;scale chip output distinct signals under UV illumination, demonstrating efficient optical imaging and information transmission capabilities of this device. This work not only reveals the fundamental optoelectronic physics lying in this vital third&#8208;generation semiconductor, but also sheds light on its potential photosensing applications for large&#8208;scale commercialization.

The maximal transient photoresponsivity reaches 9.12 nA mW&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is &#8776;20% higher than the conventional photoelectric signal. Moreover, different regions of the 4H-SiC centimeter-scale chip output distinct signals under UV illumination, demonstrating efficient optical imaging and information transmission capabilities of this device. This work not only reveals the fundamental optoelectronic physics lying in this vital third-generation semiconductor, but also sheds light on its potential photosensing applications for large-scale commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectric Resonant Tunneling Diode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric modulated resonant tunneling and negative differential resistance (NDR) behaviors under external voltage in perovskite oxide BaTiO3/SrRuO3/BaTiO3 quantum&#8208;well structures are reported. The NDR ratio can be modified by &#8776;3 orders of magnitude, depending on the polarization states of the ferroelectric barrier, and a large OFF/ON resistance ratio up to 23 000 is obtained.








Abstract
Resonant tunneling is a quantum&#8208;mechanical effect in which electron transport is controlled by the discrete energy levels within a quantum&#8208;well (QW) structure. A ferroelectric resonant tunneling diode (RTD) exploits the switchable electric polarization state of the QW barrier to tune the device resistance. Here, the discovery of robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric&#8208;modulated resonant tunneling and negative differential resistance (NDR) behaviors in all&#8208;perovskite&#8208;oxide BaTiO3/SrRuO3/BaTiO3 QW structures is reported. The resonant current amplitude and voltage are tunable by the switchable polarization of the BaTiO3 ferroelectric with the NDR ratio modulated by &#8776;3 orders of magnitude and an OFF/ON resistance ratio exceeding a factor of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;104. The observed NDR effect is explained an energy bandgap between Ru&#8208;t2g and Ru&#8208;eg orbitals driven by electron&#8211;electron correlations, as follows from density functional theory calculations. This study paves the way for ferroelectric&#8208;based quantum&#8208;tunneling devices in future oxide electronics.

         <title>Energy Interplay in Materials: Unlocking Next&#8208;Generation Synchronous Multisource Energy Conversion with Layered 2D Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered 2D crystals are exemplar energy conversion materials, able to convert light, heat, or motion to electricity. These energy conversion processes can also occur synchronously, leading to complex energy interplay networks during energy harvesting/transducing. This synchronous multisource energy conversion needs to be studied and understood to enable the fabrication of next&#8208;generation energy harvesting and conversion systems.








Abstract
Layered 2D crystals have unique properties and rich chemical and electronic diversity, with over 6000 2D crystals known and, in principle, millions of different stacked hybrid 2D crystals accessible. This diversity provides unique combinations of properties that can profoundly affect the future of energy conversion and harvesting devices. Notably, this includes catalysts, photovoltaics, superconductors, solar&#8208;fuel generators, and piezoelectric devices that will receive broad commercial uptake in the near future. However, the unique properties of layered 2D crystals are not limited to individual applications and they can achieve exceptional performance in multiple energy conversion applications synchronously. This synchronous multisource energy conversion (SMEC) has yet to be fully realized but offers a real game&#8208;changer in how devices will be produced and utilized in the future. This perspective highlights the energy interplay in materials and its impact on energy conversion, how SMEC devices can be realized, particularly through layered 2D crystals, and provides a vision of the future of effective environmental energy harvesting devices with layered 2D crystals.

         <title>Strain&#8208;driven Mixed&#8208;phase Domain Architectures and Topological Transitions in Pb1&#8208;xSrxTiO3 Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The potential for creating hierarchical domain structures, or mixtures of energetically degenerate phases with distinct patterns that can be modified continually, in ferroelectric thin films offers a pathway to control their mesoscale structure beyond lattice&#8208;mismatch strain with a substrate. Here, it is demonstrated that varying the strontium content provides deterministic strain&#8208;driven control of hierarchical domain structures in Pb1&#8208;xSrxTiO3 solid solution thin films wherein two types, c/a and a1/a2, of nanodomains can coexist. Combining phase&#8208;field simulations, epitaxial thin&#8208;film growth, and detailed structural, domain, and physical&#8208;property characterization, it is observed that the system undergoes a gradual transformation (with increasing strontium content) from droplet&#8208;like a1/a2 domains in a c/a domain matrix, to a connected&#8208;labyrinth geometry of c/a domains, to a disconnected labyrinth structure of the same, and, finally, to droplet&#8208;like c/a domains in an a1/a2 domain matrix. A relationship between the different mixed&#8208;phase modulation patterns and its topological nature is established. Annealing the connected&#8208;labyrinth structure leads to domain coarsening forming distinctive regions of parallel c/a and a1/a2 domain stripes, offering additional design flexibility. Finally, it is found that the connected&#8208;labyrinth domain patterns exhibit the highest dielectric permittivity.

         <title>Design Strategies for Hydroxyapatite&#8208;based Materials to Enhance Their Catalytic Performance and Applicability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydroxyapatite (HAP) is a green catalyst which has a wide range of applications in the catalysis due to its high flexibility and multi&#8208;functionality. These properties allow HAP to accommodate a large number of catalyst modifications that can selectively improve the catalytic performance in target reactions. To date, many studies have been conducted to elucidate the effect of HAP modification on the catalytic activities for various reactions. However, systematic design strategies for HAP catalysts are not established yet due to incomplete understanding of underlying structure&#8208;activity relationships. In this review, tuning methods of HAP for improving the catalytic performance are discussed: (1) ionic composition change, (2) morphology control, (3) incorporation of other metal species, and (4) catalytic support engineering. We investigate detailed mechanisms and effects of structural modulations on the catalytic performances for attaining the design insights of HAP catalysts. In addition, computational studies to understand catalytic reactions on HAP materials are also introduced. Finally, important areas for future research are highlighted.

Abstract
The recent advances in optic neuromorphic devices have led to a subsequent rise in use for construction of energy&#8208;efficient artificial vision systems. The widespread use can be attributed to their ability to capture, store, and process visual information from the environment. The primary limitations of existing optic neuromorphic devices include nonlinear weight updates, cross&#8208;talk issues, and silicon process incompatibility. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate a highly&#8208;linear, light&#8208;tunable, cross&#8208;talk&#8208;free, and silicon&#8208;compatible one&#8208;phototransistor&#8208;one&#8208;memristor (1PT1R) optic memristor for the implementation of optic artificial neural networks (OANN). For optic image recognition in the experiment an OANN was constructed using a 16&#215;3 1PT1R memristor array, and it was trained on an online platform. The model yielded an accuracy of 99.3% after only 10 training epochs. The 1PT1R memristor, which shows good performance, demonstrated its ability as an excellent hardware solution for highly efficient optic neuromorphic and edge computing.

         <title>Determination of Crystallographic Orientation and Exposed Facets of Titanium Oxide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanocrystals have attracted great attention in heterogeneous photocatalysis and photoelectricity fields for decades. However, contradictious conclusions on the reporting of crystallographic orientation and exposed facets of TiO2 nanocrystals frequently appeared in the literature. Herein, using anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with highly exposed {001} facets as a model, we clarified the misleading conclusions that exist on anatase nanocrystals. Although the TiO2&#8208;001 nanocrystals are recognized to be dominated by {001} facets, in fact, anatase nanocrystals with both dominating {001} and {111} facets are always co&#8208;existing due to the similarities in lattice fringes and intersection angles between two types of facets (0.38&#160;nm and 90&#176; in [001] direction, 0.35&#160;nm and 82&#176; in [111] direction). We also give a paradigm for determining the crystallographic orientation and exposed facets based on transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis, which provides a universal methodology to nanomaterials for determining the orientation and exposed facets.

         <title>Challenging Bendable Organic Single Crystal and Transistor Arrays with High Mobility and Durability towards Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bendable organic single crystals are promising candidates for flexible electronics owing to their superior charge transport properties. However, large&#8208;area high&#8208;quality organic single crystals are rarely available on polymer substrates generally used in flexible electronics. Here, a surface&#8208;assisted assembly strategy based on a polymer modification, poly (amic acid) (PAA), is developed to grow large&#8208;area organic singe crystals on polymer substrates using a simple drop&#8208;casting method. The unique surface properties of PAA that enable molecular solution superwetting and promote molecular ordered assembly produce an extraordinary self&#8208;driven &#8220;meniscus&#8208;guided coating&#8221; behavior, enabling the fabrication of millimeter&#8208;sized, highly aligned organic single crystals for a variety of organic semiconductors. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors based on a mode molecule of 2,7&#8208;dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophene (C8&#8208;BTBT) demonstrate the highest (average) mobility of 18.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 (15.9 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), attractively low operating voltage of &#8722;3&#160;V, and high flexible durability. The results shed light on the large&#8208;area fabrication of organic single crystals on polymer dielectrics toward high&#8208;performance and integrated plastic electronics.

         <title>Building a Self&#8208;Adaptive Protective Layer on Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes to Enhance the Cycle Stability of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Layered Ni&#8208;rich lithium transition metal oxides are promising battery cathodes due to their high specific capacity, but their poor cycling stability due to intergranular cracks in secondary particles restricts their practical applications. Surface engineering is an effective strategy for improving a cathode's cycling stability, but most reported surface coatings cannot adapt to the dynamic volume changes of cathodes. Herein, we build a self&#8208;adaptive polymer (polyrotaxane&#8208;co&#8208;polyacrylic acid) interfacial layer on LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2. The polymer layer with a slide&#8208;ring structure exhibits high toughness and can withstand the stress caused by particle volume changes, which can prevent the cracking of particles. In addition, the slide&#8208;ring polymer acts as a physicochemical barrier that suppresses surface side reactions and alleviates the dissolution of transition metallic ions, which ensures stable cycling performance. Thus, the as&#8208;prepared cathode shows significantly improved long&#8208;term cycling stability in situations in which cracks may easily occur, especially under high&#8208;rate, high&#8208;voltage, and high&#8208;temperature conditions.

         <title>Polishing Lead&#8208;Poor Surface for Efficient Inverted CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Triiodide cesium lead perovskite (CsPbI3) has promising prospects in the development of efficient and stable photovoltaics in both single&#8208;junction and tandem structure. However, achieving inverted devices which provide good stability and are compatible to tandem devices, remains a challenge and the deep insights are still unintelligible. In this study, we&#160; found that the surface components of CsPbI3 were&#160; intrinsically lead&#8208;poor and the relevant traps were&#160; of p&#8208;type with localized states. These deep&#8208;energy&#8208;level p traps induced inferior electrons transfer and serious non&#8208;radiative recombination at CsPbI3/PCBM interface, leading to the considerable opening&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss and filling factor (FF) reduction. Compared to molecular passivation, polishing treatment with 1,4&#8208;butanediamine (DAB) could&#160; eliminate the non&#8208;stoichiometric components and root these intrinsically lead&#8208;poor traps for superior electron transfer. The polishing treatment significantly improved the FF and Voc of the inverted CsPbI3 photovoltaics, creating an efficiency promotion from 12.64% to 19.84%. Moreover, 95% of the initial efficiency of the optimized devices was&#160; maintained after the output operation for 1000&#160;h.

Abstract
With the flourishing development of material simulation methods (quantum chemistry methods, molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, phase field, etc.), extensive adoption of computing technologies (high&#8208;throughput, artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc.), and the invention of high&#8208;performance computing equipment, computational simulation tools have sparked the fundamental mechanism&#8208;level explorations to predict the diverse physicochemical properties and biological effects of biomaterials, and investigate their enormous application potential for disease prevention, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Herein, we propose the term &#8220;computational biomaterials&#8221; and summarize/discuss the computational methods currently used to explore the inherent properties of biomaterials, such as optical, magnetic, electronic, and acoustic properties, and the elucidation of corresponding biological behaviors/effects in the biomedical field. We focus on the theoretical calculation of the physiochemical properties/biological performance of biomaterials applied in disease diagnosis, drug delivery, disease therapeutics, and specific paradigms such as biomimetic biomaterials. Additionally, the biosafety evaluation applications of theoretical simulations of biomaterials are presented. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of such computational simulations for biomaterials development are clarified. It is anticipated that these simulations would offer various methodologies for facilitating and promoting the development and future clinical translations/utilization of versatile biomaterials.

A photoactivatable silencing extracellular vesicle is developed, which not only serves as a nanocarrier for packaging, tumor accumulation, and intracellular release of small interfering RNA against p21&#8208;activated kinase 4 to boost intratumoral&#160;immune infiltration, but also is able to initiate antitumor immunity through immunogenic phototherapy. The combined immunotherapy between boosted immune infiltration and immune activation elicits superior antitumor outcome.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has delivered impressive outcomes in combating tumor malignancies. However, insufficient immune infiltration and poor immunogenicity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) greatly compromise patient response rates. Here, a photoactivatable silencing extracellular vesicle (PASEV) is developed for sensitized cancer immunotherapy. p21&#8208;Activated kinase 4 (PAK4) is a newly identified tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;intrinsic &#8220;guard&#8221; associated with immune exclusion. Small interfering RNA against PAK4 (siPAK4) is designed and assembled with a photoactivatable reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive polymer to form the nanocomplex core, which is further camouflaged by extracellular vesicles from M1 macrophages. The PASEV not only serves as a vehicle for packaging, tumor accumulation, and ROS&#8208;responsive release of siPAK4 for potent PAK4 silencing, but also primes the TME through immunogenic phototherapy, thereby simultaneously boosting intratumoral infiltration and immune activation. The combined immunotherapy elicits robust anticancer immunity, thus showing great promise for fighting cancers. This work opens a new avenue to simultaneously boost intratumoral infiltration and immune activation for sensitized cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Tailoring the Thickness&#8208;Dependent Optical Properties of Conducting Nitrides and Oxides for Epsilon&#8208;Near&#8208;Zero&#8208;Enhanced Photonic Applications</title>

Abstract
The unique properties of the emerging photonic materials, conducting nitrides and oxides, especially their tailorability, large damage thresholds, and, importantly, the so&#8208;called epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero (ENZ) behavior, have enabled novel photonic phenomena spanning optical circuitry, tunable metasurfaces, and nonlinear optical devices. This work explores direct control of the optical properties of polycrystalline titanium nitride (TiN) and aluminum&#8208;doped zinc oxide (AZO) by tailoring the film thickness, and their potential for ENZ&#8208;enhanced photonic applications. We demonstrate that TiN&#8208;AZO bilayers support Ferrell&#8208;Berreman modes utilizing the thickness&#8208;dependent epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero (ENZ) resonances in the AZO films operating in the telecom wavelengths spanning from 1470 to 1750&#160;nm. The bilayer stacks also act as strong light absorbers in the ultraviolet regime employing the radiative ENZ modes and the Fabry&#8208;Perot modes in the constituent TiN films. The studied Berreman resonators exhibit optically&#8208;induced reflectance modulation of 15% with picosecond response&#8208;time. Together with the optical response tailorability of conducting oxides and nitrides, utilizing the field&#8208;enhancement near the tunable ENZ regime could enable a wide range of nonlinear optical phenomena, including all&#8208;optical switching, time refraction, and high&#8208;harmonic generation.

Abstract
The additive manufacturing technique direct laser writing (DLW), also known as two&#8208;photon laser lithography, is becoming increasingly established as a technique capable of fabricating functional three&#8208;dimensional microstructures. Recently, there has been an increasing effort to impart microstructures fabricated using DLW with advanced functionalities by introducing responsive chemical entities into the underpinning photoresists. Herein, we introduce a novel photoresist based on the photochemistry of the bimane group that can be degraded upon exposure to very mild conditions, requiring only water and visible light (&#955;max = 415&#8211;435&#160;nm) irradiation. The degradation of the microstructures was tracked and quantified using AFM measurements of their height. The influence of the writing parameters as well as the degradation conditions was investigated, unambiguously evidencing effective visible light degradation in aqueous environments. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the photodegradable resist system by incorporating it into multi&#8208;material three&#8208;dimensional microstructures, serving as a model for future applications.

         <title>SrTiO3/CuNi&#8208;Heterostructure&#8208;Based Thermopile for Sensitive Human Radiation Detection and Noncontact Human&#8211;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SrTiO3/CuNi heterostructure&#8208;based thermopile, characterized by the combination of high thermoelectric performance and near&#8208;unity long&#8208;wave infrared absorption, exhibits high sensitivity to human radiation. Further integration of human radiation into a noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction system is experimentally demonstrated, and the real&#8208;time recognition of hand gestures and touchless input of Arabic numbers and English letters are implemented.








Abstract
Noncontact interactive technology provides an intelligent solution to mitigate public health risks from cross&#8208;infection in the era of COVID&#8208;19. The utilization of human radiation as a stimulus source is conducive to the implementation of low&#8208;power, robust noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction. However, the low radiation intensity emitted by humans puts forward a high demand for photodetection performance. Here, a SrTiO3&#8722;x/CuNi&#8208;heterostructure&#8208;based thermopile is constructed, which features the combination of high thermoelectric performance and near&#8208;unity long&#8208;wave infrared absorption, to realize the self&#8208;powered detection of human radiation. The response level of this thermopile to human radiation is orders of magnitude higher than those of low&#8208;dimensional&#8208;materials&#8208;based photothermoelectric detectors and even commercial thermopiles. Furthermore, a touchless input device based on the thermopile array is developed, which can recognize hand gestures, numbers, and letters in real&#8208;time. This work offers a reliable strategy to integrate the spontaneous human radiation into noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction systems.

         <title>Semicrystalline Conjugated Polymers with Well&#8208;Defined Active Sites for Nitrogen Fixation in a Seawater Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface is well constructed by introducing a suitable semicrystalline structure in donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based conjugated polymers to significantly boost the nitrogen reduction reaction with a high Faradaic efficiency of 60.5% and a maximum NH3 yield rate of 16.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 in a neutral&#8208;buffered seawater electrolyte.








Abstract
Faradaic efficiency for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is often limited by low N2 solubility in the electrolyte, while a large number of intimate contacts between the electrolyte and solid catalyst can also inevitably sacrifice many active sites for the NRR. Here, it is reported that a &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface formed in donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based conjugated polymers (CPs) is beneficial to boosting the NRR process and at the same time suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Of particular interest, it is found that a semicrystalline CP catalyst, SC&#8208;PBDT&#8208;TT, exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency of up to 60.5% with a maximum NH3 production rate of 16.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 in a neutral&#8208;buffered seawater electrolyte. Molecular dynamics and COMSOL Multiphysics simulations reveal the origin of the observed high NRR performance arising from the presence of desirable crystal regions to resist the penetration of H2O molecules, leading to the formation of a &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface inside the catalyst for a favorable direct&#8208;contact between the catalyst and N2 molecules. Furthermore, high&#8208;throughput computations, based on density functional theory, reveal the actual real active site for N2 adsorption and reduction in SC&#8208;PBDT&#8208;TT. This work provides a new framework for optimizing NRR performance of metal&#8208;free catalysts by controlling their crystallinities.

         <title>Superionic Bifunctional Polymer Electrolytes for Solid&#8208;State Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superionic bifunctional polymer electrolytes, in which ion relaxation is decoupled from polymer relaxation, are developed to advance electromechanical and electrochemical technologies. Through the formation of intra&#8208;monomer hydrogen bonds between two functional groups, electrostatic interactions of the polymer matrix are effectively weakened to form interconnected rod&#8208;like ion channels in the glassy matrix, thereby accelerating proton transport with a low activation barrier.








Abstract
Achieving superionic conductivity from solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes is an important task in the development of future energy storage and conversion technologies. Herein, a platform for innovative electrolyte technologies based on a bifunctional polymer, poly(3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;sulfonated styrene) (PS&#8208;3H4S), is presented. By incorporating &#63743;OH and &#63743;SO3H functional groups at adjacent positions in the styrene repeating unit, &#8220;intra&#8208;monomer&#8221; hydrogen bonds are formed to effectively weaken the electrostatic interactions of the &#63743;SO3&#8722; moieties in the polymer matrix with embedded ions, promoting rich structural and dynamic heterogeneity in the PS&#8208;3H4S electrolyte. Upon the incorporation of an ionic liquid, interconnected rod&#8208;like ion channels, which allow the decoupling of ion relaxation from polymer relaxation, are formed in the stiff motif of the polymeric domains passivated by interfacial ionic layers. This results in accelerated proton hopping through the glassy polymer matrix, and proton hopping becomes more pronounced at cryogenic temperatures down to &#8722;35 &#176;C. The PS&#8208;3H4S/ionic liquid composite electrolytes exhibit a high ionic conductivity of 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 and high storage modulus of &#8776;100&#160;MPa at 25 &#176;C, and can be successfully applied in soft actuators and lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystalline Perovskite p&#8211;n Junction Nanowire Arrays for Ultrasensitive Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of ultrasensitive photodetectors is demonstrated with single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays. The high crystallinity of the nanowire arrays enables efficient carrier transport and the formation of the built&#8208;in electric field in the p&#8211;n junction facilitates effective carrier separation. The photodetectors show excellent sensitivity over a wide spectral range from 405 to 635&#160;nm with outstanding responsivities.








Abstract
Highly sensitive photodetectors play significant roles in modern optoelectronic integrated circuits. Constructing p&#8211;n junctions has been proven to be a particularly powerful approach to realizing sensitive photodetection due to their efficient carrier separation. Recently, p&#8211;n&#8208;junction photodetectors based on organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, which combine favorable optoelectronic performance with facile processability, hold great potential in practical applications. So far, these devices have generally been made of polycrystalline films, which exhibit poor carrier&#8208;transport efficiency, impeding the further improvement of their photoresponsivities. Here, a type of ultrasensitive photodetector based on single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays is demonstrated. The single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays not only possess high crystallinity that enables efficient carrier transport but also form a built&#8208;in electric field facilitating effective carrier separation. As a result, the devices show excellent photosensitivity over a wide spectral range from 405 to 635&#160;nm with an outstanding responsivity of 2.65&#160;&#215;&#160;102&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 at 532&#160;nm. These results will provide new insights into the design and construction of high&#8208;performance photodetectors for practical optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Mass Transfer Printing of Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskite Films and Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust transfer&#8208;printing method is developed using an ultrathin chemical bonding interfacial layer. The transfer&#8208;printed perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) exhibit similar performance as optimized spin&#8208;coated LEDs, and the transfer&#8208;printed nanostructure reaches a high resolution up to 1270 ppi. A white perovskite LED structure is finally demonstrated with laterally aligned red and sky&#8208;blue perovskite microstripes made by the multiple transfer&#8208;printing process.








Abstract
Most methods of depositing perovskite films cannot meet the diverse requirements of real applications such as depositing films on various types of substrates, making patterns with different bandgaps for full&#8208;color display. Here, a robust mass transfer method of perovskite films and nanostructures is reported, meeting those requirements, by using an ultrathin branched polyethylenimine as interfacial chemical bonding layers. The transfer&#8208;printed perovskite films exhibit comparable morphology, composition, optoelectronic properties, and device performances with the counterparts made by optimized spin&#8208;coating methods. The perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) using the transfer&#8208;printed films show decent external quantum efficiencies of 10.5% and 6.7% for red (680&#160;nm) and sky&#8208;blue (493&#160;nm) emissions, which are similar to the devices made by spin&#8208;coating. This robust transfer printing method also enables the the preparation of perovskite micropatterns with a high resolution up to 1270 pixels per inch. Horizontally aligned red and sky&#8208;blue perovskite microstripes are further obtained through multiple printing processes for white PeLEDs. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy for making perovskite films or micropatterns on various substrates for real applications in full&#8208;color display, white LEDs, lasing, etc.

         <title>Anode Catalysts in Anion&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Electrolysis without Supporting Electrolyte: Conductivity, Dynamics, and Ionomer Degradation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To reach the required scale for green hydrogen, it must be produced with efficient, low&#8208;capital&#8208;expense electrolyzers using non&#8208;platinum&#8208;group catalysts. In this work, oxygen&#8208;evolution catalysts in pure&#8208;water anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer devices are studied. Processes causing device failure are illustrated, nano&#8208;Co3O4 is shown to be a viable catalyst, and design rules for engineering catalyst/ionomer layers with higher performance and durability are proposed.








Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) in principle operate without soluble electrolyte using earth&#8208;abundant catalysts and cell materials and thus lower the cost of green H2. Current systems lack competitive performance and the durability needed for commercialization. One critical issue is a poor understanding of catalyst&#8208;specific degradation processes in the electrolyzer. While non&#8208;platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal (non&#8208;PGM) oxygen&#8208;evolution catalysts show excellent performance and durability in strongly alkaline electrolyte, this has not transferred directly to pure&#8208;water AEMWEs. Here, AEMWEs with five non&#8208;PGM anode catalysts are built and the catalysts&#8217; structural stability and interactions with the alkaline ionomer are characterized during electrolyzer operation and post&#8208;mortem. The results show catalyst electrical conductivity is one key to obtaining high&#8208;performing systems and that many non&#8208;PGM catalysts restructure during operation. Dynamic Fe sites correlate with enhanced degradation rates, as does the addition of soluble Fe impurities. In contrast, electronically conductive Co3O4 nanoparticles (without Fe in the crystal structure) yield AEMWEs from simple, standard preparation methods, with performance and stability comparable to IrO2. These results reveal the fundamental dynamic catalytic processes resulting in AEMWE device failure under relevant conditions, demonstrate a viable non&#8208;PGM catalyst for AEMWE operation, and illustrate underlying design rules for engineering anode catalyst/ionomer layers with higher performance and durability.

         <title>Halide Perovskite Crystallization Processes and Methods in Nanocrystals, Single Crystals, and Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleation process is more thermodynamically difficult by involving a higher surface molecular unit ratio than the growth process of solution&#8208;processed halide perovskite (HP) crystals. Nucleation occurs under a higher supersaturation (C&#160;&gt; Cmin) while growth can occur when C is over Cs. Typical preparation methods for nucleation&#8208;dominated HP nanocrystals, growth&#8208;dominated HP single crystals, and nucleation&#8208;and&#8208;growth&#8208;balanced HP thin films are reviewed.








Abstract
Halide perovskite semiconductors with extraordinary optoelectronic properties have been fascinatedly studied. Halide perovskite nanocrystals, single crystals, and thin films have been prepared for various fields, such as light emission, light detection, and light harvesting. High&#8208;performance devices rely on high crystal quality determined by the nucleation and crystal growth process. Here, the fundamental understanding of the crystallization process driven by supersaturation of the solution is discussed and the methods for halide perovskite crystals are summarized. Supersaturation determines the proportion and the average Gibbs free energy changes for surface and volume molecular units involved in the spontaneous aggregation, which could be stable in the solution and induce homogeneous nucleation only when the solution exceeds a required minimum critical concentration (Cmin). Crystal growth and heterogeneous nucleation are thermodynamically easier than homogeneous nucleation due to the existent surfaces. Nanocrystals are mainly prepared via the nucleation&#8208;dominated process by rapidly increasing the concentration over Cmin, single crystals are mainly prepared via the growth&#8208;dominated process by keeping the concentration between solubility and Cmin, while thin films are mainly prepared by compromising the nucleation and growth processes to ensure compactness and grain sizes. Typical strategies for preparing these three forms of halide perovskites are also reviewed.

         <title>Tungsten&#8208;based Nanomaterials in the Biomedical Field: A Bibliometric Analysis of Research Progress and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tungsten&#8208;based nanomaterials (TNMs) with diverse nanostructures and unique physicochemical properties have been widely applied in the biomedical field. Although various reviews have described the application of TNMs in specific biomedical fields, there are still no comprehensive studies that summarize and analyze research trends of the field as a whole. To identify and further promote the development of biomedical TNMs, a bibliometric analysis method was used to analyze all relevant literature on this topic. First, general bibliometric distributions of the dataset by year, country, institute, referenced source and research hotspots are recognized. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of the subjectively recognized research hotspots in various biomedical fields, including biological sensing, anticancer treatments, antibacterials, and toxicity evaluation. Finally, the prospects and challenges of TNMs are discussed to provide a new perspective for further promoting their development in biomedical research.

         <title>Chemical vapor deposition of high optical quality large area monolayer Janus transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We report one pot chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of large area Janus SeMoS monolayers, with the asymmetric top (Se) and bottom (S) chalcogen atomic planes with respect to the central transition metal (Mo) atoms. The formation of these two&#8208;dimensional semiconductor monolayers takes place upon the thermodynamic equilibrium driven exchange of the bottom Se atoms of the initially grown MoSe2 single crystals on gold foils with S atoms. The growth process is characterized by complementary experimental techniques including Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and the growth mechanisms are rationalized by first principal calculations. The remarkably high optical quality of the synthesized Janus monolayers is demonstrated by optical and magneto&#8208;optical measurements which reveal the strong exciton&#8208;phonon coupling and enable to obtain the exciton g&#8208;factor of &#8208;3.3.

         <title>Controlled covalent self&#8208;assembly of a homopolymer for multi&#8208;scale materials engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymer self&#8208;assembly is a crucial process in materials engineering. Currently, almost all polymer self&#8208;assembly is limited to non&#8208;covalent bonding methods, even though these methods have drawbacks as they require complicated synthesis techniques and produce relatively unstable structures. Here, a novel mechanism of covalent polymer assembly is discovered and employed to address drawbacks of non&#8208;covalent polymer self&#8208;assembly. A simple ketone homopolymer is found to self&#8208;assembly into nano&#8208; to macro&#8208;scale hydrogels during covalent crosslinking. In contrast to non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly, the covalent assembly is independent of and unaffected by solvent conditions (e.g., polarity and ionic strength) and does not require additional agents, e.g., organic solvents and surfactants. The covalent polymer self&#8208;assembly is subject to a new mechanism of control by tuning the covalent crosslinking rate. This leads to nanogels with an unprecedented and tightly controlled range of dimensions from less than 10&#160;nm to above 100&#160;nm. Moreover, the crosslinking rate also regulates the assembly behavior of microgels fabricated by microfluidics. The microgels self&#8208;assemble into granular fibers, which is 3D printed into stable porous scaffolds. The novel covalent polymer assembly method has enormous potential to revolutionize multi&#8208;scale materials fabrication for applications in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and many other fields.

         <title>Enriched&#8208;bromine surface state for stable sky&#8208;blue spectrum perovskite QLEDs with an EQE of 14.6%</title>

Abstract
Halogen vacancies are of great concern in blue&#8208;emitting perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes because they affect their efficiency and spectral shift. Here, the enriched&#8208;bromine surface state is realised using a facile strategy that employs a PbBr2 stock solution for anion exchange based on Cd&#8208;doped perovskite quantum dots. We find that the doped Cd ions are expected to reduce the formation energy of halogen vacancies filled by the external bromine ions, and the excess free bromine ions in solution are enriched in the surface by anchoring with halogen vacancies as sites, accompanied with the shedding of surface long&#8208;chain ligands during the anion exchange process, resulting in a Br&#8208;rich and &#8220;neat&#8221; surface. Moreover, the surface state exhibits good passivation of the surface defects of the controlled perovskite QDs and simultaneously increases the exciton binding energy, leading to excellent optical properties and stability. Finally, the sky&#8208;blue emitting perovskite QLEDs (490&#160;nm) are conducted with a record external quantum efficiency of 14.6% and current efficiency of 19.9&#160;cd/A. Meanwhile, the electroluminescence spectra exhibit great stability with negligible shifts under a constant operating voltage from 3 to 7&#160;V. This strategy paves the way for improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite QLEDs.

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Assisted In Situ Recrystallization for Efficient Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskites are promising candidates to replace their toxic lead&#8208;based counterparts in optoelectronic applications, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the development of tin perovskite LEDs is slow due to the challenge of obtaining high quality tin perovskite films. Here, a vapor&#8208;assisted spin&#8208;coating (VASC) method is developed to achieve high quality tin perovskites and high efficiency LEDs. It is revealed that solvent vapor can lead to in situ recrystallization of tin perovskites during the film formation process, thus significantly improving the crystalline quality with reduced defects. An antioxidant additive is further introduced to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ and increase the photoluminescence quantum efficiency up to &#8764;30%, which is an &#8764;4&#8208;fold enhancement in comparison with that of the control method. As a result, efficient tin perovskite LEDs are achieved with a peak external quantum efficiency of 5.3%, which is among the highest efficiency of lead&#8208;free perovskite LEDs.

         <title>Step&#8208;climbing Epitaxy of Layered Materials with Giant Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane Lattice Mismatch</title>

Abstract
Heteroepitaxy with large lattice mismatch remains a great challenge for high&#8208;quality epifilm growth. Although great efforts have been devoted to epifilm growth with an in&#8208;plane lattice mismatch, the epitaxy of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered crystals on stepped substrates with a giant out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice mismatch is seldom reported. Here, taking the molecular beam epitaxy of 2D semiconducting Bi2O2Se on three&#8208;dimensional SrTiO3 substrates as an example, we propose a step&#8208;climbing epitaxy growth strategy, in which the nth (n = 1, 2, 3&#8230;) epilayer climbs the step with height difference from out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice mismatch and continues to grow the n+1th epilayer. Step&#8208;climbing epitaxy can spontaneously relax and release the strain from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice mismatch, which ensures the high quality of large&#8208;area epitaxial films. Wafer&#8208;scale uniform 2D Bi2O2Se single&#8208;crystal films with controllable thickness can be obtained via step&#8208;climbing epitaxy. Most notably, one&#8208;unit&#8208;cell Bi2O2Se films (1.2&#160;nm thick) exhibit a high Hall mobility of 180 cm2/Vs at room temperature, which exceeds that of silicon and other 2D semiconductors with comparable thickness. As an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice mismatch is generally present in the epitaxy of layered materials, the step&#8208;climbing epitaxy strategy expands the existing epitaxial growth theory and provides guidance toward the high&#8208;quality synthesis of layered materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heteroepitaxy with large lattice mismatch remains a great challenge for high-quality epifilm growth. Although great efforts have been devoted to epifilm growth with an in-plane lattice mismatch, the epitaxy of two-dimensional (2D) layered crystals on stepped substrates with a giant out-of-plane lattice mismatch is seldom reported. Here, taking the molecular beam epitaxy of 2D semiconducting Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se on three-dimensional SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; substrates as an example, we propose a &lt;i&gt;step-climbing epitaxy&lt;/i&gt; growth strategy, in which the &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Why it is Unfortunate that Linear Machine Learning Models &#8220;Work&#8221; so well in Electromechanical Switching of Ferroelectric Thin Films</title>

Abstract
Machine learning is increasingly relied on to extract physical information from materials spectroscopy. Unfortunately, it is challenging to make machine learning models fail because statistical correlations can mimic the physics without understanding the data or causality. Here, using a benchmark band&#8208;excitation piezoresponse force microscopy polarization spectroscopy (BEPS) dataset openly published by the Authors in 2017, we demonstrate and overcome common pitfalls of so&#8208;called &#8220;better,&#8221; &#8220;faster,&#8221; and &#8220;less biased&#8221; machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based discovery of electromechanical switching. Using a toy and real experimental dataset, we demonstrate how the application of linear non&#8208;temporal machine learning methods to multimodal hyperspectral data results in physically reasonable embedding (eigenvalues) while producing non&#8208;sensical eigenvectors and generated spectra promoting misleading interpretations. We demonstrate, through rigorous validation, a new method of unsupervised multimodal hyperspectral analysis of BEPS using a long&#8208;short term memory (LSTM) &#946;&#8208;variational autoencoders (&#946;VAE) that is adapted to the experiments information content. By including recurrent LSTM neurons, we consider the ordinal nature of ferroelectric switching. To improve the interpretability of the latent space, we impose a variational Kullback&#8211;Leibler (KL)&#8208;divergency regularization term to the loss function. Finally, we leverage regularization scheduling of &#946; as a disentanglement metric to reduce user bias. Combining these experiment&#8208;inspired modifications enables the automated detection of various ferroelectric switching mechanisms, including a complex two&#8208;step, three&#8208;state ferroelastic switching mechanism. Ultimately, this work provides a robust machine learning methodology for the rapid discovery of electromechanically switching mechanisms in ferroelectrics and is applicable to other multimodal hyperspectral materials spectroscopies.

         <title>Supramolecular Nitric Oxide Depot for Hypoxic Tumor Vessel Normalization and Radiosensitization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In cancer radiotherapy, the lack of fixed DNA damages by oxygen in hypoxic microenvironment of solid tumors often lead to severe radioresistance. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent radiosensitizer that acts in two ways. It can directly react with the radical DNA thus fixes the damage. It also normalizes the abnormal tumor vessels, thereby increasing blood perfusion and oxygen supply. To achieve these functions, the dosage and duration of NO treatment need to be carefully controlled, otherwise it would lead to the exact opposite outcomes. However, a delivery method that fulfills both requirements is still lacking. We designed a NO depot for the control of NO releasing both over quantity and duration for hypoxic tumor vessel normalization and radiosensitization. In B16 tumor&#8208;bearing mice, the depot could provide low dosage NO continuously and release large amount of NO immediately before irradiation for a short period of time. These two modes of treatment worked in synergy to reverse the radioresistance of B16 tumor more efficiently than releasing at single dosage.

         <title>Highly Orientated Perovskite Quantum Dot Solids for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) emerge as competitive optoelectronic materials for photovoltaic applications due to their ideal bandgap energy, high defect tolerance and solution processability. However, the highly dynamic surface and unperfect cubic structure of PQDs generally result in unfavorable charge carrier transport within the PQD solids and serious nonradiative recombination. Herein, the highly orientated PQD solid is demonstrated using precursor engineering accompanied by a chemical stripping treatment (CST). A combination of systematically experimental studies and theoretical calculations is conducted to fundamentally understand the resurfacing of PQDs using the CST approach. The results reveal that highly ordered PQDs could result in a high orientation of PQD solids, significantly promoting the charge carrier transport within the PQD solids. Meanwhile, the ideal cubic&#8208;structured PQD with an iodine&#8208;rich surface dramatically decreases surface trap states, thereby substantially diminishing trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination. Consequently, the inorganic PQD solar cell (PQDSC) delivers a power conversion efficiency of up to 16.25%. This work provides a feasible avenue to construct highly orientated PQD solids with improved photophysical properties for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Ultrathin Suspended Chiral Metasurfaces for Enantio&#8208;discrimination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chiral metasurfaces can exhibit a strong circular dichroism, but it is limited by the complicated fabrication procedure and alignment errors. Here, we demonstrate a new type of self&#8208;aligned suspended chiral bilayer metasurface with only one&#8208;step electron beam lithography exposure. A significant optical chirality of 221&#176;/&#956;m can be realized using suspended metasurfaces with a thickness of 100&#160;nm. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that such a structure is capable of label&#8208;free discrimination of the chiral molecules at zeptomole level, exhibiting a much higher sensitivity (orders of magnitude) compared to the conventional circular dichroism spectroscopy. The fundamental principles for chiral sensing using molecules&#8210;metasurfaces interactions have been explored. Benefiting from the giant chiroptical response, our proposed meta&#8208;device may offer promising applications for ultrathin circular polarizers, chiral molecular detectors, and asymmetry information processing.

The two&#8208;photon&#8208;induced photodamage and consequent self&#8208;healing inside MAPbI3 single crystals are investigated. Two photobrightening and one photodarkening process are identified,&#160;which&#160;are connected to trap&#8208;filling, methylamine&#8208;chemistry, and the lead&#8208;halide sublattice. H2O is&#160;found&#160;to&#160;strongly influence the overall photodamage and kinetics of the self&#8208;healing process, showing an important connection between self&#8208;healing and the presence of H2O. 








Abstract
The future of halide perovskites (HaPs) is beclouded by limited understanding of their long&#8208;term stability. While HaPs can be altered by radiation that induces multiple processes, they can also return to their original state by &#8220;self&#8208;healing.&#8221; Here two&#8208;photon (2P) absorption is used to effect light&#8208;induced modifications within MAPbI3 single crystals. Then the changes in the photodamaged region are followed by measuring the photoluminescence, from 2P absorption with 2.5&#160;orders of magnitude lower intensity than that used for photodamaging the MAPbI3. After photodamage, two brightening and one darkening process are found, all of which recover but on different timescales. The first two are attributed to trap&#8208;filling (the fastest) and to proton&#8208;amine&#8208;related chemistry (the slowest), while photodamage is attributed to the lead&#8208;iodide sublattice. Surprisingly, while after 2P&#8208;irradiation of crystals that are stored in dry, inert ambient, photobrightening (or &#8220;light&#8208;soaking&#8221;) occurs, mostly photodarkening is seen after photodamage in humid ambient, showing an important connection between the self&#8208;healing of a HaP and the presence of H2O, for long&#8208;term steady&#8208;state illumination, practically no difference remains between samples kept in dry or humid environments. This result suggests that photobrightening requires a chemical&#8208;reservoir that is sensitive to the presence of H2O, or possibly other proton&#8208;related, particularly amine, chemistry.

         <title>Experimental Realization of Atomic Monolayer Si9C15</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Si9C15 monolayer is fabricated on Ru (0001) and Rh(111) substrates via the reaction between Si and graphene under high temperatures. The as&#8208;grown Si9C15 layer is micrometer&#8208;scale, high quality, and single crystalline with a bandgap of &#8776;1.9 eV. Combined measurements and density functional calculations confirm the buckled honeycomb structure. The novel 2D material also shows good air stability.








Abstract
Monolayer SixCy constitutes an important family of&#160;2D&#160;materials that is predicted to feature a honeycomb structure and appreciable bandgaps. However, due to its binary chemical nature and the lack of bulk polymorphs with a layered structure, the fabrication of such materials has so far been challenging. Here, the synthesis of atomic monolayer Si9C15 on Ru (0001) and Rh(111) substrates is reported. A combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to infer that the 2D lattice of Si9C15 is a buckled honeycomb structure. Monolayer Si9C15 shows semiconducting behavior with a bandgap of &#8776;1.9&#160;eV. Remarkably, the Si9C15 lattice remains intact after exposure to ambient conditions, indicating good air stability. The present work expands the 2D&#8208;materials library and provides a promising platform for future studies in nanoelectronics and nanophotonics.

         <title>Volatile Organic Compound Sensing Array and Optoelectronic Filter System using Ion&#8208;Pairing Dyes with a Wide Visible Spectrum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brief methodology to synthesize sensing materials (e.g., ion&#8208;paring dyes) with hydrophobicity, ease of color tunability, and a wide visible spectrum is suggested. This can simplify the sensing array, thereby producing a color map distinguishing functional groups as well as carbon chain lengths. The ion&#8208;pairing dyes will be extended to the electronic system promising the safety and health of the user.








Abstract
An ideal dye&#8208;based sensing array has essential design requirements, including facile preparation methodology, tolerance to water vapor, a broad range of color&#8208;responsive changes, and a simple readout system. Here, a brief synthetic route is developed for ion&#8208;pairing dyes exhibiting unusual chromatic changes across the entire visible spectrum. It requires only mixing and precipitation under mild conditions. The dyes are applied to a sensing array containing 12 sensing elements with different initial states. Owing to the numerous color variations of the dyes, the color map generated by the array is highly simple yet sufficiently accurate to distinguish among the different functional groups (such as amines, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids) as well as carbon chain lengths. Principle component analysis (PCA) demonstrates that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be well classified according to the color changes of the sensing array. The ion&#8208;pairing dyes are embedded into&#160;3D&#160;stacked nanofibers via electrospinning, and function as effective harmful&#8208;gas (e.g., formaldehyde) sensors with sub&#8208;ppm theoretical detection limits (0.15&#160;ppm). Finally, the 3D stacked nanofibers can be employed in an optoelectronic filter system that automatically checks for formaldehyde in the surroundings and also confirms the effective removal of the detected formaldehyde by the gas filter cartridge.

         <title>Exposing Single Ni Atoms in Hollow S/N&#8208;Doped Carbon Macroporous Fibers for Highly Efficient Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni single atoms embedded S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF) are fabricated through pyrolysis of rationally designed CdS&#8208;NiSx@PAN composite fibers. Benefiting from the abundant exposed single Ni atoms and hollow macroporous structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
The development of efficient and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly desirable for clean energy and fuel conversion. Herein, the facile preparation of Ni single atoms embedded hollow S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF) as efficient catalysts for OER through pyrolysis of designed CdS&#8208;NiSx/polyacrylonitrile composite fibers is reported. Specifically, CdS provides the sulfur source for the doping of polyacrylonitrile&#8208;derived carbon matrix and simultaneously creates the hollow macroporous structure, while NiSx is first reduced to nanoparticles and finally evolves into single Ni atoms through the atom migration&#8208;trapping strategy. Benefiting from the abundantly exposed single Ni atoms and hollow macroporous structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF electrocatalysts deliver outstanding activity and stability for OER. Specifically, it needs an overpotential of 285&#160;mV to achieve the benchmark current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a small Tafel slope of 50.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1.

         <title>Electroconductive, Adhesive, Non&#8208;Swelling, and Viscoelastic Hydrogels for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new conductive hydrogel is developed through the simultaneous exfoliation of graphite and polymerization of zwitterionic monomers triggered by microwave irradiation. This hydrogel demonstrates tissue&#8208;like extraneuronal electrodes satisfying requirements of bioelectronics such as low storage modulus, high viscoelasticity, low toxicity, reliable adhesion, and conformability to biological tissues, and maintenance of conductivity and hydrogel volume in wet environments.








Abstract
As a new class of materials, implantable flexible electrical conductors have recently been developed and applied to bioelectronics. An ideal electrical conductor requires high conductivity, tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties, low toxicity, reliable adhesion to biological tissues, and the ability to maintain its shape in wet physiological environments. Despite significant advances, electrical conductors that satisfy all these requirements are insufficient. Herein, a facile method for manufacturing a new conductive hydrogels through the simultaneous exfoliation of graphite and polymerization of zwitterionic monomers triggered by microwave irradiation is introduced. The mechanical properties of the obtained conductive hydrogel are similar to those of living tissue, which is ideal as a bionic adhesive for minimizing contact damage due to mechanical mismatches between hard electronics and soft tissues. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent adhesion performance, electrical conductivity, non&#8208;swelling, and high conformability in water. Excellent biocompatibility of the hydrogel is confirmed through a cytotoxicity test using C2C12 cells, a biocompatibility test on rat tissues, and their histological analysis. The hydrogel is then implanted into the sciatic nerve of a rat and neuromodulation is demonstrated through low&#8208;current electrical stimulation. This hydrogel demonstrates a tissue&#8208;like extraneuronal electrode, which possesses high conformability to improve the tissue&#8211;electronics interfaces, promising next&#8208;generation bioelectronics applications.

This hydrogel demonstrates tissue-like extraneuronal electrodes satisfying requirements of bioelectronics such as low storage modulus, high viscoelasticity, low toxicity, reliable adhesion, and conformability to biological tissues, and maintenance of conductivity and hydrogel volume in wet environments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a new class of materials, implantable flexible electrical conductors have recently been developed and applied to bioelectronics. An ideal electrical conductor requires high conductivity, tissue-like mechanical properties, low toxicity, reliable adhesion to biological tissues, and the ability to maintain its shape in wet physiological environments. Despite significant advances, electrical conductors that satisfy all these requirements are insufficient. Herein, a facile method for manufacturing a new conductive hydrogels through the simultaneous exfoliation of graphite and polymerization of zwitterionic monomers triggered by microwave irradiation is introduced. The mechanical properties of the obtained conductive hydrogel are similar to those of living tissue, which is ideal as a bionic adhesive for minimizing contact damage due to mechanical mismatches between hard electronics and soft tissues. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent adhesion performance, electrical conductivity, non-swelling, and high conformability in water. Excellent biocompatibility of the hydrogel is confirmed through a cytotoxicity test using C2C12 cells, a biocompatibility test on rat tissues, and their histological analysis. The hydrogel is then implanted into the sciatic nerve of a rat and neuromodulation is demonstrated through low-current electrical stimulation. This hydrogel demonstrates a tissue-like extraneuronal electrode, which possesses high conformability to improve the tissue&#8211;electronics interfaces, promising next-generation bioelectronics applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Emergent Magnetic Fan Structures in Manganite Homojunction Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese oxide homojunctions with gradually modulated doping level host surprisingly complex, long&#8208;range ordered magnetic superstructures whose spin alignment is tunable by low magnetic fields. Homojunctions can thus serve as a powerful design element of all&#8208;oxide spintronic devices.








Abstract
Devices with tunable magnetic noncollinearity are important components of superconducting electronics and spintronics, but they typically require epitaxial integration of several complex materials. The spin&#8208;polarized neutron reflectometry measurements on La1&#8722;xSrxMnO3 homojunction arrays with modulated Sr concentration reported herein have led to the discovery of magnetic fan structures with highly noncollinear alignment of Mn spins and an emergent periodicity twice as large as the array's unit cell. The neutron data show that these magnetic superstructures can be fully long&#8208;range ordered, despite the gradual modulation of the doping level created by charge transfer and chemical intermixing. The degree of noncollinearity can be effectively adjusted by low magnetic fields. Notwithstanding their chemical and structural simplicity, oxide homojunctions thus show considerable promise as a platform for tunable complex magnetism and as a powerful design element of spintronic&#160;devices.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Growth of Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets on Graphene as Cathode for Long&#8208;life High&#8208;capacity Lithium&#8208;ion Battery</title>

Abstract
Poor electronic and ionic conductivities of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) severely restrict the development of COF&#8208;based electrodes for practical rechargeable batteries, therefore inspiring more research interests from the direction of both material synthesis and technology. Herein, a dual&#8208;porous COF, USTB&#8208;6, with good crystallinity and rich redox&#8208;active sites has been conceived and reticulated by the polymerization of 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexa(4&#8208;formylphenyl)diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2,3&#8208;c]phenazine and 2,7&#8208;diaminopyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone. In particular, the graphene&#8208;participated heterogeneous polymerization of the same starting materials affords the uniformly dispersed COF nanosheets with the thickness of 8.3&#160;nm on the conductive carbon substrate, effectively enhancing the electronic conductivity of COF&#8208;based electrode. Such graphene&#8208;supported USTB&#8208;6 nanosheets cathode used in lithium&#8208;ion battery exhibits a specific capacity of 285&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at current density of 0.2 C and excellent rate performance with the still prominent capacity of 188&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 10 C. More importantly, a capacity of 170&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 is retained by USTB&#8208;6 nanosheets cathode after 6000 cycles change and discharge measurement at 5 C.

         <title>Wireless Stand&#8208;alone Trimodal Interactive Display Enabled by Direct Capacitive Coupling</title>

Abstract
With recent advances in interactive displays, the development of a stand&#8208;alone interactive display with no electrical interconnection is of great interest. Here, we present a wireless stand&#8208;alone interactive display (WiSID), enabled by direct capacitive coupling, consisting of three layers: two in&#8208;plane metal electrodes separated by a gap, a composite layer for field&#8208;induced electroluminescence (EL) and inverse piezoelectric sound, and a stimuli&#8208;responsive layer, from bottom to top. Alternating current (AC) power necessary for field&#8208;induced EL and inverse piezoelectric sound is wirelessly transferred from a power unit, with two in&#8208;plane electrodes remotely separated from the WiSID. The unique in&#8208;plane power transfer through the stimuli&#8208;sensitive polar bridge allows stand&#8208;alone operation of the WiSID, making it suitable for the wireless dynamic monitoring of medical fluids. Moreover, we demonstrate a haptic wireless stand&#8208;alone trimodal interactive display mounted on a human finger, whereby touch is wirelessly displayed in various outputs of EL, inverse piezoelectric sound, and tactile vibration, making it suitable for a wireless three&#8208;mode smart braille display.

         <title>Catalytic Effects of Electrodes and Electrolytes in Metal&#8208;Sulfur Batteries: Progress and Prospective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal&#8208;sulfur (M&#8208;S) batteries are promising energy storage devices due to their advantages such as the large energy density, low cost of the raw materials. However, M&#8208;S batteries suffer from many drawbacks. Endowing the electrodes and electrolytes with the proper catalytic activity is crucial to improve the electrochemical properties of M&#8208;S batteries. With regard to the S cathodes, advanced electrode materials with enhanced electrocatalytic effects can capture polysulfides and accelerate electrochemical conversion and as for the metal anodes, the proper electrode materials can provide active sites for metal deposition to reduce the deposition potential barrier and control the electroplating or stripping process. Moreover, an advanced electrolyte with the desirable design can catalyze the electrochemical reactions on the cathode and anode in high&#8208;performance M&#8208;S batteries. In this review, recent progress pertaining to the design of advanced electrode materials and electrolytes with the proper catalytic effects is summarized. The current progress of S cathodes and metal anodes in different types of M&#8208;S batteries are discussed and future development directions are described. Our objective is to provide a comprehensive review on the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art S cathodes and metal anodes in M&#8208;S batteries and research guidance for future development of this important class of batteries.

         <title>Shaping 90 wt% NanoMOFs into Robust Multifunctional Aerogels Using Tailored Bio&#8208;based Nanofibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are hybrid porous crystalline networks with tunable chemical and structural properties. However, their excellent potential is limited in practical applications due to their hard&#8208;to&#8208;shape powder form, making it challenging to assemble MOFs into macroscopic composites with mechanical integrity. While a binder matrix enables hybrid materials, such materials have a limited MOF content and thus limited functionality. To overcome this challenge, nanoMOFs are combined with tailored same&#8208;charge high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) to manufacture robust, wet&#8208;stable, and multifunctional MOF&#8208;based aerogels with 90 wt% nanoMOF loading. The porous aerogel architectures show excellent potential for practical applications such as efficient water purification, CO2 and CH4 gas adsorption and separation, and fire&#8208;safe insulation. Moreover, a one&#8208;step carbonization process enables these aerogels as effective structural energy&#8208;storage electrodes. This work exhibits the unique ability of high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio CNFs to bind large amounts of nanoMOFs in structured materials with outstanding mechanical integrity &#8211; a quality that is preserved even after carbonization. The demonstrated process is simple and fully discloses the intrinsic potential of the nanoMOFs, resulting in synergetic properties not found in the components alone, thus paving the way for MOFs in macroscopic multifunctional composites.

Abstract
The spontaneous formation of electronic orders is a crucial element for understanding complex quantum states and engineering heterostructures in two&#8208;dimensional materials. We report a novel &#8730;19&#215;&#8730;19 charge order in few&#8208;layer thick 1T&#8208;TaTe2 transition metal dichalcogenide films grown by molecular beam epitaxy, which has not been realized. Our photoemission and scanning probe measurements demonstrate that monolayer 1T&#8208;TaTe2 exhibits a variety of metastable charge density wave orders, including the &#8730;19&#215;&#8730;19 superstructure, which can be selectively stabilized by controlling the post&#8208;growth annealing temperature. Moreover, we find that only the &#8730;19&#215;&#8730;19 order persists in 1T&#8208;TaTe2 films thicker than a monolayer, up to 8 layers. Our findings identify the previously unrealized novel electronic order in a much&#8208;studied transition metal dichalcogenide and provide a viable route to control it within the epitaxial growth process.

         <title>Preparation of 2D Molybdenum Phosphide via Surface&#8208;Confined Atomic Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlayered molybdenum phosphide (MoP) with well&#8208;defined 2D morphology and tunable crystallinity can be prepared from layered molybdenum dichalcogenides via surface&#8208;confined atomic substitution. In contrast to the well&#8208;documented edge&#8208;dominated electrocatalytic performance of the MoS2 precusor, the entire basal plane of MoP demonstrates satisfying electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction performance owing to its coordination&#8208;unsaturated surface atoms with abundant dangling bonds.








Abstract
The emerging nonlayered 2D materials (NL2DMs) are sparking immense interest due to their fascinating physicochemical properties and enhanced performance in many applications. NL2DMs are particularly favored in catalytic applications owing to the extremely large surface area and low&#8208;coordinated surface atoms. However, the synthesis of NL2DMs is complex because their crystals are held together by strong isotropic covalent bonds. Here, nonlayered molybdenum phosphide (MoP) with well&#8208;defined 2D morphology is synthesized from layered molybdenum dichalcogenides via surface&#8208;confined atomic substitution. During the synthesis, the molybdenum dichalcogenide nanosheet&#160;functions as the host matrix where each layer of Mo maintains their hexagonal arrangement and forms isotropic covalent bonds with P that substitutes S, resulting in the conversion from layered van der Waals material to a covalently bonded NL2DM. The MoP nanosheets converted from few&#8208;layer MoS2 are single crystalline, while those converted from monolayers are amorphous. The converted MoP demonstrates metallic charge transport and desirable performance in the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). More importantly, in contrast to MoS2, which shows edge&#8208;dominated HER performance, the edge and basal plane of MoP deliver similar HER performance, which is correlated with theoretical calculations. This work provides a new synthetic strategy for high&#8208;quality nonlayered materials with well&#8208;defined 2D morphology for future exploration.

         <title>In Situ Characterization of the Protein Corona of Nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Here, we propose a new theoretical framework that enables the use of Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) in fluorescence imaging mode to quantify in situ protein adsorption onto nanoparticles (NP) while simultaneously monitoring for NP aggregation. We use this methodology to elucidate the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the protein corona (PC) in vitro and in vivo. Our results show that protein adsorption triggers particle aggregation over a wide concentration range and that the formed aggregate structures can be quantified using the proposed methodology. Protein affinity for polystyrene (PS) NPs was observed to be dependent on particle concentration. For complex protein mixtures, our methodology identifies that the PC composition changes with the dilution of serum proteins, demonstrating a Vroman effect never quantitatively assessed in situ on NPs. Finally, DDM allows monitoring of the evolution of the PC in vivo. Our results show that the PC composition evolves significantly over time in zebrafish larvae, confirming the inherently dynamic nature of the PC. The performance of the developed methodology allowed to obtain quantitative insights into nano&#8208;bio interactions in a vast array of physiologically relevant conditions that will serve to further improve the design of nanomedicine.

         <title>Ion&#8208;sieving Janus Separator Toward the Planar Electrodeposition for Deeply Rechargeable Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The irregular and random zinc electrodeposition has emerged as a nonnegligible barrier for deeply rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), yet traditional texture regulation of Zn substrate cannot continuously induce uniform Zn deposition. Here, a Janus separator was constructed via parallelly grown the graphene sheets modified with sulfonic cellulose on one side of the commercial glass fiber separator throughout spin&#8208;coating technique. The Janus separator could consistently regulate Zn growth toward a locked crystallographic orientation of Zn(002) texture to intercept dendrites. Furthermore, the separator can spontaneously repel SO42&#8211; and anchor H+ while allowing effective transport of Zn2+ to alleviate side reactions. Accordingly, the Zn symmetric cell harvests a long&#8208;term lifespan over 1400&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2/10 mAh cm&#8211;2 and endures stable cycling over 220&#160;h even at a high DOD of 56%. The Zn/CNT&#8208;MnO2 cell achieves an outstanding capacity retention of 95% at 1 A g&#8211;1 after 1900 cycles. Furthermore, the Zn/NH4V4O10 pouch cell with Janus separator delivers an initial capacity of 178 mAh g&#8211;1 and a high capacity retention of 87.4% after 260 cycles. This work provides a continuous regulation approach to achieve crystallographic homogeneity of Zn anode, which could be suitable to other metal batteries.

         <title>Unlock Layered Double Hydroxide as a High Performance Cathode Material for Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Advanced cathode materials play an important role in promoting aqueous battery technology for safe energy storage. Transition metal double hydroxides are usually elusive as a stable cathode for aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their unstable crystal structure, sluggish ion transportation and insufficient active sites for zinc ion storage. Here we report a trinary layered double hydroxide with hydrogen vacancies (Ni3Mn0.7Fe0.3&#8208;LDH) as a new cathode material for AZIBs. A reversible high capacity up to 328 mAh g&#8722;1 can be obtained and cycle stably over 500 cycles with a capacity retention of 85%. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the hydrogen vacancies in LDH could expose lattice oxygen atoms as active sites for zinc ion storage and accelerate ion diffusion by reducing the electrostatic interactions between zinc ions and the host structure. Besides, the synergy of trinary transitional metal cations can suppress the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion of manganese (III) oxide octahedron and enable long cycle stability. This work provides not only a series of high performance cathode materials for aqueous zinc ion batteries but also a novel materials design strategy that can be extended to other multi&#8208;valence metal ion batteries.

         <title>Visible Light Curable Acrylic Resins Toward UV&#8208;light Blocking Adhesives for Foldable Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Current technological advances in the organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) panel design of foldable smartphones demand advanced adhesives with UV&#8208;blocking abilities, beyond their conventional roles of bonding objects and relieving deformation stress. However, optically clear adhesives (OCAs) with UV&#8208;blocking ability cannot be prepared using conventional UV&#8208;curing methods relying on a photoinitiator. Herein, we present a new acrylic resin that can be efficiently cured using visible light without oxygen removal, which may be used to develop UV&#8208;blocking OCAs for use in current flexible displays. A novel photocatalyst and a specific combination of additives facilitate sufficiently rapid curing under visible light in the presence of UV absorbers. Only a very small amount of the highly active photocatalyst is required to prepare UV&#8208;blocking OCA films with very high transparency in the visible region. Using this system, a UV&#8208;blocking OCA that nearly meets the specifications of an OCA used in commercialized foldable smartphones is realized. This technology could also be utilized in other applications that require highly efficient visible&#8208;light curing, such as optically clear resins, dental resins, and 3D/4D&#8208;printable materials.

         <title>Rapid Ultratough Topological Tissue Adhesives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue adhesives capable of achieving tough adhesion in wet environments are useful in many biomedical applications. It is shown that combining pH&#8208;responsive bridging chitosan polymer chains and a tough hydrogel dissipative matrix can achieve ultratough adhesion to tissues (&gt;2000 J m&#8722;2) without covalent bond formation. These properties open opportunities for new strategies in the development of non&#8208;covalent tissue adhesives.








Abstract
Tissue adhesives capable of achieving strong and tough adhesion in permeable wet environments are useful in many biomedical applications. However, adhesion generated through covalent bond formation directly with the functional groups of tissues (i.e., &#63743;COOH and &#63743;NH2&#160;groups in collagen), or using non&#8208;covalent interactions can both be limited by weak, unstable, or slow adhesion. Here, it is shown that by combining pH&#8208;responsive bridging chitosan polymer chains and a tough hydrogel dissipative matrix one can achieve unprecedented ultratough adhesion to tissues (&gt;2000&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2) in 5&#8211;10&#160;min without covalent bond formation. The strong non&#8208;covalent adhesion is shown to be stable under physiologically relevant conditions and strongly influenced by chitosan molecular weight, molecular weight of polymers in the matrix, and pH. The adhesion mechanism relies primarily on the topological entanglement between the chitosan chains and the permeable adherends. To further expand the applicability of the adhesives, adhesion time can be decreased by dehydrating the hydrogel matrix to facilitate rapid chitosan interpenetration and entanglement (&gt;1000&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;in &#8804;1&#160;min). The unprecedented adhesive properties presented in this study open opportunities for new strategies in the development of non&#8208;covalent tissue adhesives and numerous bioapplications.

         <dc:description>
Liquid metals (LMs) with good biosafety, deformability, functionalizability, and stimulus responsiveness have great potential in biomedicine. Here, the advantages of LMs are presented. Recent advances in the design and application of LM&#8208;based biomaterials are comprehensively summarized to provide deep insights into structure&#8211;property relationships and guide their on&#8208;demand design and performance optimization for therapeutics, bioimaging, biosensors, and tissue repair.








Abstract
Liquid metals (LMs) as emerging biomaterials possess unique advantages including their favorable biosafety, high fluidity, and excellent electrical and thermal conductivities, thus providing a unique platform for a wide range of biomedical applications ranging from drug delivery, tumor therapy, and bioimaging to biosensors. The structural design and functionalization of LMs endow them with enhanced functions such as enhanced targeting ability and stimuli responsiveness, enabling them to achieve better and even multifunctional synergistic therapeutic effects. Herein, the advantages of LMs in biomedicine are presented. The design of LM&#8208;based biomaterials with different scales ranging from micro&#8208;/nanoscale to macroscale and various components is explored in&#8208;depth to promote the understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships, guiding their performance optimization and applications. Furthermore, the related advanced progress in the development of LM&#8208;based biomaterials in biomedicine is summarized. Current challenges and prospects of LMs in the biomedical field are also discussed.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Materials Innovation and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent advances, strategies, insights, and challenges of data&#8208;driven&#8208;based innovations and applications in material science are discussed. Essential subdisciplines, including framework, machine&#8208;learning algorithms, available chemical databases, commonly used key descriptors, and innovations and applications based on their synergy, are reviewed.








Abstract
Owing to the rapid developments to improve the accuracy and efficiency of both experimental and computational investigative methodologies, the massive amounts of data generated have led the field of materials science into the fourth paradigm of data&#8208;driven scientific research. This transition requires the development of authoritative and up&#8208;to&#8208;date frameworks for data&#8208;driven approaches for material innovation. A critical discussion on the current advances in the data&#8208;driven discovery of materials with a focus on frameworks, machine&#8208;learning algorithms, material&#8208;specific databases, descriptors, and targeted applications in the field of inorganic materials is presented. Frameworks for rationalizing data&#8208;driven material innovation are described, and a critical review of essential subdisciplines is presented, including: i) advanced data&#8208;intensive strategies and machine&#8208;learning algorithms; ii) material databases and related tools and platforms for data generation and management; iii) commonly used molecular descriptors used in data&#8208;driven processes. Furthermore, an in&#8208;depth discussion on the broad applications of material innovation, such as energy conversion and storage, environmental decontamination, flexible electronics, optoelectronics, superconductors, metallic glasses, and magnetic materials, is provided. Finally, how these subdisciplines (with insights into the synergy of materials science, computational tools, and mathematics) support data&#8208;driven paradigms is outlined, and the opportunities and challenges in data&#8208;driven material innovation are highlighted.

         <title>Multimode Electron Tomography Sheds Light on Synthesis, Structure, and Properties of Complex Metal&#8208;Based Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced 3D characterization techniques for complex metal&#8208;based nanomaterials by multimode electron tomography are reviewed. Advancements in data acquisition and processing are discussed, in addition to case studies of complex nanomaterials where morphology, elemental distribution, and oxidation states must be understood in 3D to gain crucial insights and drive future design and synthesis of complex nanosystems.








Abstract
Electron tomography has become a cornerstone technique for the visualization of nanoparticle morphology in three dimensions. However, to obtain in&#8208;depth information about a nanoparticle beyond surface faceting and morphology, different electron microscopy signals must be combined. The most notable examples of these combined signals include annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF&#8208;STEM) with different collection angles and the combination of ADF&#8208;STEM with energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray or electron energy loss spectroscopies. Here, the experimental and computational development of various multimode tomography techniques in connection to the fundamental materials science challenges that multimode tomography has been instrumental to overcoming are summarized. Although the techniques can be applied to a wide variety of compositions, the study is restricted to metal and metal oxide nanoparticles for the sake of simplicity. Current challenges and future directions of multimode tomography are additionally discussed.

         <title>Endocytosis&#8208;Independent and Cancer&#8208;Selective Cytosolic Protein Delivery via Reversible Tagging with LAT1 substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pro&#8208;protein approach is developed based on reversible tagging with l&#8208;type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) substrate, which enables carrier&#8208;free, cancer&#8208;selective, and endocytosis&#8208;independent cytosolic delivery via LAT1&#8208;mediated direct transport. It demonstrates high generality and robust efficiency for varieties of functional proteins, including enzymes, toxins, antibodies, and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoprotein. This facile and versatile platform holds transformative potentials in protein pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
Protein drugs targeting intracellular machineries have shown profound therapeutic potentials, but their clinical utilities are greatly hampered by the lack of efficient cytosolic delivery techniques. Existing strategies mainly rely on nanocarriers or conjugated cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs), which often have drawbacks such as materials complexity/toxicity, lack of cell specificity, and endolysosomal entrapment. Herein, a unique carrier&#8208;free approach is reported for mediating cancer&#8208;selective and endocytosis&#8208;free cytosolic protein delivery. Proteins are sequentially modified with 4&#8208;nitrophenyl 4&#8208;(4,4,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborolan&#8208;2&#8208;yl) benzyl carbonate as the H2O2&#8208;responsive domain and 3,4&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine as the substrate of l&#8208;type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1). Thus, the pro&#8208;protein can be directly transported into tumor cells by overexpressed LAT1 on cell membranes, bypassing endocytosis and endolysosomal entrapment. In the cytosol, overproduced H2O2 restores the protein structure and activity. Using this technique, versatile proteins are delivered into tumor cells with robust efficiency, including toxins, enzymes, CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoprotein, and antibodies. Furthermore, intravenously injected pro&#8208;protein of saporin shows potent anticancer efficacy in 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice, without provoking systemic toxicity. Such a facile and versatile pro&#8208;protein platform may benefit the development of protein pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging Nanomedicine for the Treatment of Ischemic Heart Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current developments, achievements, challenges, and future directions of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging nanomedicine for the treatment of ischemic heart disease (IHD), as well as their risk factors, are reviewed. The properties, generation, and physiological roles of ROS in the process of IHD development and progression are discussed.








Abstract
Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to play key roles in the progression of diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, which are independent risk factors that lead to atherosclerosis and the development of IHD. Engineered biomaterial&#8208;based nanomedicines are under extensive investigation and exploration, serving as smart and multifunctional nanocarriers for synergistic therapeutic effect. Capitalizing on cell/molecule&#8208;targeting drug delivery, nanomedicines present enhanced specificity and safety with favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Herein, the roles of ROS in both IHD and its risk factors are discussed, highlighting cardiovascular medications that have antioxidant properties, and summarizing the advantages, properties, and recent achievements of nanomedicines that have ROS scavenging capacity for the treatment of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, ischemia/reperfusion, and myocardial infarction. Finally, the current challenges of nanomedicines for ROS&#8208;scavenging treatment of IHD and possible future directions are discussed from a clinical perspective.

         <title>A Tetrahedral Framework DNA&#8208;Based Bioswitchable miRNA Inhibitor Delivery System: Application to Skin Anti&#8208;Aging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioswitchable miR inhibitor delivery system (BiRDS) is designed in this study. BiRDS maximizes miR inhibitors&#8217; loading capacity while retaining the characteristics of small&#8208;sized tFNA. Superior skin penetration ability and RNA delivery are observed with significant antiaging effects. The excellent editability of the BiRDS confers it the potential to significantly improve the stability and delivery efficiency of miR inhibitors.








Abstract
MicroRNA (miR)&#8208;based therapy shows strong potential; however, structural limitations pose a challenge in fully exploiting its biomedical functionality. Tetrahedral framework DNA (tFNA) has proven to be an ideal vehicle for miR therapy. Inspired by the ancient Chinese myth &#8220;Sun and Immortal Birds,&#8221; a novel bioswitchable miR inhibitor delivery system (BiRDS) is designed with three miR inhibitors (the three immortal birds) and a nucleic acid core (the central sun). The BiRDS fuses miR inhibitors within the framework, maximizing their loading capacity, while allowing the system to retain the characteristics of small&#8208;sized tFNA and avoiding uncertainty associated with RNA exposure in traditional loading protocols. The RNase H&#8208;responsive sequence at the tail of each &#8220;immortal bird&#8221; enables the BiRDS to transform from a 3D to a 2D structure upon entering cells, promoting the delivery of miR inhibitors. To confirm the application potential, the BiRDS is used to deliver the miR&#8208;31 inhibitor, with antiaging effects on hair follicle stem cells, into a skin aging model. Superior skin penetration ability and RNA delivery are observed with significant anti&#8208;aging effects. These findings demonstrate the capability and editability of the BiRDS to improve the stability and delivery efficacy of miRs for future innovations.

         <title>Tuning Zn&#8208;ion Solvation Chemistry with Chelating Ligands towards Stable Aqueous Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Changing the solvation sheath of hydrated Zn ions is an effective strategy to stabilize Zn anodes to obtain a practical aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery. However, key points related to the rational design remain unclear including how the properties of the solvent molecules intrinsically regulate the solvated structure of the Zn ions. We propose using a stability constant (K), namely the equilibrium constant of the complexation reaction, as a universal standard to make an accurate selection of ligands in the electrolyte to improve the anode stability. It is found that K greatly impacts the corrosion current density and nucleation overpotential. Following this, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid with a superhigh K effectively suppresses Zn corrosion and induces uniform Zn&#8208;ion deposition. As a result, the anode has an excellent stability of over 3000&#160;h. This work presents a general principle to stabilize anodes by regulating the solvation chemistry, guiding the development of novel electrolytes for sustainable aqueous batteries.

         <title>Tailoring the Desorption Behavior of Hygroscopic Gels for Atmospheric Water Harvesting in Arid Climates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The ubiquitous nature of atmospheric moisture makes it a significant water resource available at any geographical location. Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) technology, which extracts moisture from ambient air to generate clean water, is a promising strategy to realize decentralized water production. The high water uptake exhibited by salt&#8208;based sorbents makes them attractive for AWH, especially in low relative humidity (RH) environments. Salt&#8208;based sorbents often have relatively high desorption heat, rendering water release an energy&#8208;intensive process. We proposed a hygroscopic gel, PAM hydrogel controlled incorporated with LiCl, capable of effective moisture harvesting from arid environments. The interactions between the hydrophilic hydrogel network and the captured water enable the PAM&#8208;LiCl to accumulate more free and weakly&#8208;bonded water molecules, significantly lowering the desorption heat compared with conventional neat salt sorbents. Benefiting from the affinity for swelling of the polymer backbones, the developed PAM&#8208;LiCl achieves a high water uptake of ca. 1.1&#160;g/g at 20% RH with fast sorption kinetics of ca. 0.008&#160;g g&#8211;1 min&#8211;1 and further demonstrates a daily water yield up to ca. 7&#160;g/g at this condition. These findings provide a new pathway for synthesis of materials with efficient water absorption/desorption properties, to reach energy&#8208;efficient water release for AWH in arid climates.

Abstract
The construction of robust (quasi) solid&#8208;state electrolytes for flexible lithium metal batteries is desirable but extremely challenging. Herein, we report a novel flexible and robust quasi solid&#8208;state electrolyte (QSSE) with a &#8220;Tree trunk&#8221; design for ultralong&#8208;life lithium metal batteries (LMBs). In&#8208;situ grown MOF layer covers cellulose&#8208;based framework to form hierarchical ion&#8208;channels, enabling a rapid ionic transfer kinetics and excellent durability. A conductivity of 1.36 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8211;1, a transference number of 0.72, an electrochemical window of 5.26&#160;V, and a good rate performance have been achieved. The flexible LMBs fabricated with as&#8208;designed QSSEs deliver an areal capacity up to 3.1 mAh cm&#8211;2 at initial cycle with a high mass loading of 14.8&#160;mg cm&#8211;2 in Li&#8208;NCM811 cells, and can keep &#8764;80% capacity retention after 300 cycles. An ultralong&#8208;life of 3000 cycles (6000 hours) is also achieved in Li&#8208;LiFePO4 cells. This work presents a promising route in constructing a flexible QSSE towards ultralong&#8208;life LMBs, and also provides a design rationale for material and structure development in the area of energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Homogeneous Ru&#8211;Cu Alloy Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction</title>

Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is the most widely used metal as an electrocatalyst for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) because of the relatively high N2 adsorption strength for successive reaction. Recently, it has been well reported that the homogeneous Ru&#8208;based metal alloys such as Ru&#8211;Rh, Ru&#8211;Pt, and Ru&#8211;Co significantly enhance the selectivity and formation rate of ammonia (NH3). However, the metal combinations for NRR have been limited to several miscible combinations of metals with Ru, although various immiscible combinations have immense potential to show high NRR performance. In this study, we first utilize an immiscible combination of Ru and copper (Cu), and fabricate homogeneous alloy nanoparticles (Ru&#8211;Cu NPs) by the carbothermal shock (CTS) method. The Ru&#8211;Cu homogeneous NP alloys on cellulose/CNT sponge exhibit the highest selectivity and NH3 formation rate of &#8764;31% and &#8722;73&#160;&#956;mol/h/cm2, respectively. These are the highest values of the selectivity and NH3 formation rates among existing Ru&#8208;based alloy metal combinations.

         <title>Engineering Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C Catalyst Microenvironment Enabling CO2 Electroreduction with Nearly 100% CO Selectivity in Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
CO2 electrolysis in acid has been emerged as a promising route to achieve high CO2 utilization due to the inhibition of undesired carbonate formation that generally occurs in alkaline or neutral conditions. However, the efficiency and stability of this system need to be further improved through tailoring the electrocatalyst and its working environment. Here, we demonstrate that working microenvironment of structurally engineered Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst for acidic CO2 electrolysis is probed and optimized by adding hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) nanoparticles in the catalytic layer of gas diffusion electrodes. The PTFE&#8208;modified electrode delivers nearly 100% CO Faradaic efficiency at an industry&#8208;relevant current density of 250&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and a high single&#8208;pass CO2 utilization of 75.7% at a current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under 20&#8208;sccm CO2 gas flow rate. Moreover, compared to a conventional electrode without added PTFE, the PTFE&#8208;modified electrode exhibits a substantially enhanced water&#8208;flooding&#8208;resistant ability. Mechanistic investigations reveal that a moderate PTFE modification can optimize the local CO2/H2O ratio in the catalytic layer, favoring the reduction of the diffusion layer thickness and the formation of highly active and stable solid&#8722;liquid&#8722;gas interfacial microenvironment.

         <title>Dramatic Enhancement of Thermoelectric Performance in PbTe by Unconventional Grain Shrinking in Sintering Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanostructure engineering is a key strategy for tailoring properties in the fields of batteries, solar cells, thermoelectrics, and so on. Limited by grain coarsening, however, the nanostructure effect gradually degrades during the materials&#8217; manufacturing and in&#8208;service period. Herein, we develop a strategy of cleavage&#8208;fracture for grain shrinking in the Pb0.98Sb0.02Te sample during the sintering, and the grain size remains stable after repeated tests. Moreover, the initial grain boundary is filled by fractured slender grains and enriched by dislocations, evolving into a hierarchical grain&#8208;boundary structure. The lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) is greatly reduced to approach the amorphous limit. As a result, a record&#8208;high ZT value of about 1.9 is obtained at 815 K in the n&#8208;type Pb0.98Sb0.02Te sample and a decent efficiency of 6.7% in thermoelectric device. This strategy for grain shrinking will shed light on the application of nanostructure engineering under high temperature and extreme conditions in other material systems.

         <title>An Ultrahigh Rate and Stable Zinc Anode by Facet&#8208;matching&#8208;induced Dendrite Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Resource&#8208;abundant metal (e.g., zinc) batteries feature intrinsic advantages of safety and sustainability. Their practical feasibility, however, is impeded by the poor reversibility of metal anode, typically caused by the uncontrollable dendrite enlargement. Significant effort has been exerted to completely prevent dendrites from forming, but this seems less effective at high current densities. Herein, we present an alternative dendrite regulation strategy of forming tiny, homogeneously distributed, and identical zinc dendrites by facet matching, which effectively avoids undesirable dendrite enlargement. Confirmed by multiscale theoretical screening and characterization, the regularly exposed Cu(111) facets at the ridges of a copper nanowire are capable of such dendrite regulation by forming a low&#8208;mismatched Zn(002)/Cu(111) interface. Consequently, reversible zinc electroplating/stripping has been achieved at an unprecedentedly high rate of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 30,000 cycles, corresponding to an accumulative areal capacity up to 30 Ah cm&#8722;2. A full cell using this anode shows a high capacity of 308.3 mAh g&#8722;1 and a high capacity retention of 91.4% after 800 cycles. This strategy is also viable for magnesium and aluminum anodes, thus opening up a promising and universal avenue towards long life and high rate metal anodes.

         <title>Stabilisation and Performance Enhancement Strategies for Halide Perovskite Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solar energy&#8208;powered photocatalytic fuel production and chemical synthesis have been widely recognised as viable technological solutions for a sustainable energy future. However, the requirement of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts is a major bottleneck. Halide perovskites, a category of diversified semiconductor materials with suitable energy band&#8208;enabled high light utilisation efficiencies, exceptionally&#8208;long charge&#8208;carrier diffusion length&#8208;faciliated charge transport, and readily tailorable compositional, structural and morphological properties, have emerged as a new class of photocatalysts for efficient hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction and various organic synthesis reactions. Despite the noticeable progress, the development of high&#8208;performance halide perovskite photocatalysts (HPPs) is still hindered by several key challenges: the strong ionic nature and high hydrolysis tendency induced instability and an unsatifactory activity due to the need for a co&#8208;active component to realise redox processes. Herein, the recently developed advanced strategies to enhance the stability and photocatalytic activity of the HPPs are comprehensively reviewed. We firstly articulate the widely applicable stability enhancement strategies, and then explore the activity improvement strategies for fuel production and chemical synthesis. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives associated with the application of HPPs in efficient production of fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals are presented, indicating the irreplaceable role of the HPPs in the field of photocatalysis.

Abstract
Currently, extensive research efforts are being devoted to suppressing the shuttle effect of polysulfides. The uncontrollable deposition of insulating Li2S onto the surface of sulfur host materials dramatically inhibits the continuous reduction of polysulfides in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Herein, N, B co&#8208;doped hollow carbon microspheres embedded with dense FeSe&#8208;MnSe heterostructures and abundant Se vacancies (FeSe&#8208;MnSe/NBC) were rationally designed and synthesized via a facile hydrothermal reaction using ionic liquids (ILs) as dopants. The introduction of abundant heterostructures subtly guides Li2S nucleation and deposition in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) frameworks, thus avoiding the formation of the Li2S passivation layer and allowing for continuous Li+ diffusion and subsequent nucleation of Li2S. Owing to these beneficial features, Li&#8211;S batteries comprising an FeSe&#8208;MnSe/NBC electrode exhibited significantly improved performance, including a high initial capacity of 1334 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.2 C and ultra&#8208;long cycle stability with a low&#8208;capacity fading rate of 0.029% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1.0 C. Remarkably, the FeSe&#8208;MnSe/NBC pouch cell delivered a considerable areal capacity of 3.6 mAh cm&#8211;2 at 0.1 C. This study provides valuable insight into heterostructures and Se vacancies for developing practical Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Self&#8208;formation CoO Nanodots Catalyst in Co(TFSI)2&#8208;Modified Electrolyte for High Efficient Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The major challenges for Li&#8208;O2 batteries are sluggish reaction kinetics and large overpotentials due to the cathode passivation resulted from insulative and insoluble Li2O2. Here, a novel nanodots (NDs)&#8208;modified electrolyte is designed by employing cobalt bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Co(TFSI)2) as an electrolyte additive. The Co(TFSI)2 additive can react with discharge intermediate LiO2 and product Li2O2 to form CoO NDs. The generated CoO NDs are well dispersed in electrolyte, which integrates both high catalytic activity of solid catalyst and well wettability of soluble catalyst. Under the catalytic of CoO NDs, Li2O2 produces and deposits on cathode together with them. At recharge process, these well dispersed CoO NDs help to decompose solid Li2O2 at a lower overpotential. The Li&#8208;O2 cells with Co(TFSI)2 exhibit a long cycle life of 200 cycles at a current density of 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1 under a cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh g&#8722;1, as well as a superior reversibility associated with the Li2O2 formation and decomposition. We expect that the study could broaden the range of electrolyte additives and provide a new view to develop highly dispersed NDs&#8208;based catalyst for Li&#8208;O2 batteries.

         <title>Synergizing Hydrogen Spillover and Deprotonation by Internal Polarization Field in MoS2/NiPS3 Vertical Heterostructure for Boosted Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrogen spillover has emerged to upgrade hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Pt&#8208;support electrocatalysts, but it is not applicable to the deprotonated oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Non&#8208;precious catalysts that can perform well in both hydrogen spillover and deprotonation are extremely desirable for sustainable hydrogen economy. Herein, an affordable MoS2/NiPS3 vertical heterostructure catalyst is presented to synergize hydrogen spillover and deprotonation for efficient water electrolysis. Internal polarization field (IPF) is clarified as the driving force nature of hydrogen spillover in HER electrocatalysis. The hydrogen spillover from MoS2 edge to NiPS3 can activate the NiPS3 basal plane to boost the HER activity of MoS2/NiPS3 heterostructure (112&#160;mV versus RHE at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2). While for OER, the IPF in the heterostructure can facilitate the hydroxyl diffusion and render the NiPS3&#8208;to&#8208;MoS2/P&#8208;to&#8208;S dual&#8208;pathways for deprotonation. Resultantly, the stacking of OER&#8208;inactive MoS2 on the NiPS3 surface still brings intriguing OER enhancements. Serving them as electrode couples, the overall water splitting is attested stably with a cell voltage of 1.64&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2. This research puts forward IPF as the criterion in the rational design of hydrogen spillover/deprotonation&#8208;unified non&#8208;precious catalysts for efficient water electrolysis.

         <title>Ultrafine Silver Nanoparticle Encapsulated Porous Molecular Traps for Discriminative Photoelectrochemical Detection of Mustard Gas Simulants by Synergistic Size&#8208;Exclusion and Site&#8208;Specific Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ photoreduction and subsequent encapsulation process affords nanocomposite materials comprising sub&#8208;1&#160;nm Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) encapsulated in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs). Compared to traditional semiconductors and selected metal&#8211;organic framework materials, the AgNPs@HOFs exhibit significantly enhanced photocurrent. A portable photoelectrochemical (PEC) device based on AgNPs@HOF&#8208;101 detects chemical warfare agent (CWA) simulants with both nanomolar sensitivity and excellent selectivity.








Abstract
The rapid, discriminative, and portable detection of highly toxic chemical warfare agents is extremely important for response to public security emergencies but remains a challenge. One plausible solution involves the integration of porous molecular traps onto a photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor. Here, a fast and facile protocol is developed to fabricate sub&#8208;1&#160;nm AgNPs encapsulated hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) nanocomposite materials through an in situ photoreduction and subsequent encapsulation process. Compared to traditional semiconductors and selected metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) materials, these AgNPs@HOFs show significantly enhanced photocurrent. Most importantly, the portable PEC device based on AgNPs@HOF&#8208;101 can selectively recognize 13 different mustard gas simulants, including 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), based on synergistic size&#8208;exclusion and specific recognition. The extremely low detection limit for CEES (15.8&#160;nmol L&#8722;1), reusability (at least 30 cycles), and long&#8208;term working stability (at least 30 d) of the portable PEC device warrant its use as a chemical warfare agents (CWAs) sensor in practical field settings. More broadly, this work indicates that integrating porous molecular traps onto PEC sensors offers a promising strategy to further develop portable devices for CWAs detection with both ultrahigh sensitivity and selectivity.

         <title>Convection Driven Ultrarapid Protein Detection via Nanobody&#8208;Functionalized Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing alternating current electrothermal flow (ACET) at the sample incubation step accelerates the operation of an organic&#8208;electrochemical&#8208;transistor&#8208;based protein sensor with a limit of detection at the attomolar range. The ACET integrated sensor exhibits a sample&#8208;to&#8208;result time of 2 min, with better selectivity, higher sensitivity, and lower limit of detection than the equivalent sensor with diffusion&#8208;dominated operation.








Abstract
Conventional biosensors rely on the diffusion&#8208;dominated transport of the target analyte to the sensor surface. Consequently, they require an incubation step that may take several hours to allow for the capture of analyte molecules by sensor biorecognition sites. This incubation step is a primary cause of long sample&#8208;to&#8208;result times. Here, alternating current electrothermal flow (ACET) is integrated in an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT)&#8208;based sensor to accelerate the device operation. ACET is applied to the gate electrode functionalized with nanobody&#8211;SpyCatcher fusion proteins. Using the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein in human saliva as an example target, it is shown that ACET enables protein recognition within only 2 min of sample exposure, supporting its use in clinical practice. The ACET integrated sensor exhibits better selectivity, higher sensitivity, and lower limit of detection than the equivalent sensor with diffusion&#8208;dominated operation. The performance of ACET integrated sensors is compared with two types of organic semiconductors in the channel and grounds for device&#8208;to&#8208;device variations are investigated. The results provide guidelines for the channel material choice in OECT&#8208;based biochemical sensors, and demonstrate that ACET integration substantially decreases the detection speed while increasing the sensitivity and selectivity of transistor&#8208;based sensors.

         <title>Stacking and Twisting of Freestanding Complex Oxide Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The integration of dissimilar materials in heterostructures has long been a cornerstone of modern materials science &#8211; seminal examples are the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials and van der Waals heterostructures. Recently, new methods have been developed, which enable the realization of ultra&#8208;thin freestanding oxide films approaching the 2D limit. Oxides offer new degrees of freedom, due to the strong electronic interactions, especially the 3d orbitals, which give rise to rich exotic phases. Inspired by this progress, we have developed a new platform for assembling ultra&#8208;thin freestanding oxide thin films with different materials and orientations into artificial stacks with heterointerfaces. We show that the oxide stacks can be tailored by controlling the stacking sequences as well as the twist angle between the constituent layers with atomically sharp interfaces, leading to distinct moir&#233; patterns in the transmission electron micrographs of the full stacks. Stacking and twisting has been recognized as a key degree of structural freedom in 2D materials but until now has never been realized for oxide materials. Our approach opens unexplored avenues for fabricating artificial 3D oxide stacking structure with freestanding membranes across a broad range of complex oxide crystal structures with functionalities not available in conventional 2D materials.

         <title>Fingerprints Indicating Superior Properties of Internal Interfaces in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 Thin&#8208;Film Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Growth of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) absorbers under Cu&#8208;poor conditions gives rise to incorporation of numerous defects into the bulk, whereas the same absorber grown under Cu&#8208;rich conditions leads to a stoichiometric bulk with minimum defects. This suggests that CIGS absorbers grown under Cu&#8208;rich conditions are more suitable for solar cell applications. However, the CIGS solar cell devices with record efficiencies have all been fabricated under Cu&#8208;poor conditions, despite the expectations. Therefore, in the present work, we investigate both Cu&#8208;poor and Cu&#8208;rich CIGS cells and show that the superior properties of internal interfaces of Cu&#8208;poor CIGS cells, such as p&#8208;n junction and grain boundaries, makes them always the record&#8208;efficiency devices. More precisely, by employing a correlative microscopy approach, we discover for the first time the typical fingerprints for superior properties of internal interfaces necessary for maintaining a lower recombination activity in the cell. These are a Cu&#8208;depleted and Cd&#8208;enriched CIGS absorber surface near the p&#8208;n junction and the negative Cu factor (&#8710;&#946;) and high Na content (&gt; 1.5 at.%) at the grain boundaries. Thus, this work provides key factors governing the device performance (efficiency), which can be considered in the design of next&#8208;generation solar cells.

         <title>Surface Lattice Plasmon Resonances by Direct in situ Substrate Growth of Gold Nanoparticles in Ordered Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Precise arrangements of plasmonic nanoparticles on substrates are important for designing optoelectronics, sensors, and metamaterials with rational electronic, optical, and magnetic properties. Bottom&#8208;up synthesis offers unmatched control over morphology and optical response of individual plasmonic building blocks. Usually, the incorporation of nanoparticles made by bottom&#8208;up wet chemistry starts from batch synthesis of colloids, which requires time&#8208;consuming and hard&#8208;to&#8208;scale steps like ligand exchange and self&#8208;assembly. Herein, we develop an unconventional bottom&#8208;up wet&#8208;chemical synthetic approach for producing gold nanoparticle ordered arrays. Water&#8208;processable hydroxypropyl cellulose stencils facilitate the patterning of a reductant chemical ink on which nanoparticle growth selectively occurs. Arrays exhibiting lattice plasmon resonances in the visible region and near infrared (quality factors &gt;20) were produced following a rapid synthetic step (&lt;10&#160;min), all without cleanroom fabrication, specialized equipment, or self&#8208;assembly, constituting a major step forward establishing in situ growth approaches. We further demonstrate the technical capabilities of this method through modulation of the particle size, shape, and array spacings directly on the substrate. Ultimately, establishing a fundamental understanding of in situ growth has the potential to inform the fabrication of plasmonic materials, opening the door for in situ growth fabrication of waveguides, lasing platforms, and plasmonic sensors.

         <title>Tuning the Magnetization of Manganese (II) Carbonate by Intracrystalline Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bioinspired strategy of intracrystalline amino acids incorporation can be utilized to tune the magnetic properties of a crystalline host whereby both the magnetic susceptibility and N&#233;el temperature of MnCO3 change due to the incorporation of aspartic acid. These changes are attributed to the weakening of the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction, which results from the incorporation&#8208;induced lattice expansion.








Abstract
Incorporation of organic molecules into the lattice of inorganic crystalline hosts is a common phenomenon in biomineralization and is shown to alter various properties of the crystalline host. Taking this phenomenon as a source of inspiration, it is shown herein that incorporation of specific single amino acids into the lattice of manganese (II) carbonate strongly alters its inherent magnetic properties. At room temperature, the magnetic susceptibility of the amino&#8208;acid&#8208;incorporating paramagnetic MnCO3 decreases, following a simple rule of mixtures. When cooled below the N&#233;el temperature, however, the opposite trend is observed, namely an increase in magnetic susceptibility measured in a high magnetic field. Such an increase, accompanied by a drastic change in the N&#233;el phase transformation temperature, results from a decrease in MnCO3 orbital overlapping and the weakening of superexchange interactions. It may be that this is the first time that the magnetic properties of a host crystal are tuned via the incorporation of amino acids.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Liquid Crystalline Polymer for Intrinsic Fire&#8208;Resistant and Flexible Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly rigid main chain of liquid crystalline poly(aryl ether ester) (LCPAEE) endows triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) with outstanding anti&#8208;dripping, temperature&#8208; and fire&#8208;resistance, and the electrical output performance remains over 65% even after combustion for 16 s above 520&#160;&#176;C, which goes beyond any previous work on flame&#8208;retardant TENGs.








Abstract
Flammability is a great challenge in the fields of electronics. The emergence of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) provides a safe way to harvest environmentalally friendly energy and convert it into more secure power sources. Especially, polymer&#8208;based TENGs significantly accelerate the practical application of self&#8208;powered flexible electronics. However, most of the existing polymeric materials for TENGs are easily flammable and melt, dripping, in a fire scenario, and cannot be reused after combustion, which greatly limits the application of TENGs under extreme conditions. Herein, a fire&#8208;resistant TENG based on all&#8208;aromatic liquid crystalline poly(aryl ether ester) (LCPAEE) synthesized via simple and efficient one&#8208;pot melt polycondensation is reported. The highly rigid main chain of LCPAEE endows the LCP&#8208;TENG with outstanding anti&#8208;dripping, temperature&#8208; and fire&#8208;resistance. The resultant LCP&#8208;TENG exhibits excellent electrical output performance, which is attributed to the high dielectric constant (&#949;&#8242;&#160;= 4.8) and fibrous&#8208;structured morphology of LCPAEE. The device can maintain over 65% of open&#8208;circuit voltage even after 16 s combustion (&#8776;520&#160;&#176;C). Consequently, this work offers a novel strategy for tailoring the TENGs toward a secure power generator and electronics with fire hazard reduction, and potential application in firefighting, personal protection, and other extreme temperature environments.

High&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells are cpomprehensively reviewed regarding the key design parameters, the current performances, and recent advances on failure analysis and promotion strategies on cathode, electrolyte, and anode.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries promise great potential as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy&#8208;storage devices due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density of 2600&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. Evaluation and analysis on practical Li&#8211;S pouch cells are essential for achieving actual high energy density under working conditions and affording developing directions for practical applications. This review aims to afford a comprehensive overview of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S pouch cells regarding 7&#160;years of development and to point out further research directions. Key design parameters to achieve actual high energy density are addressed first, to define the research boundaries distinguished from coin&#8208;cell&#8208;level evaluation. Systematic analysis of the published literature and cutting&#8208;edge performances is then conducted to demonstrate the achieved progress and the gap toward practical applications. Following that, failure analysis as well as promotion strategies at the pouch cell level are, respectively, discussed to reveal the unique working and failure mechanism that shall be accordingly addressed. Finally, perspectives toward high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S pouch cells are presented regarding the challenges and opportunities of this field.

         <title>Looking Beyond 0 and 1: Principles and Technology of Multi&#8208;Valued Logic Devices</title>

Abstract
Ever since the invention of solid&#8208;state transistors, binary devices have dominated the electronics industry. Although the binary technology links the natural property of devices to be in the ON or OFF state with two logic levels, it provides the least possible information content per interconnect. Multi&#8208;valued logic (MVL) has long been considered as a means of improving the computation efficiency and reducing the power consumption of modern chips. In view of the power density limits of the conventional complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor technology, MVL technologies have recently gained even more attention, and various MVL unit devices based on conventional and emerging materials have been proposed. Herein, we overview the achievements toward the development of compact MVL unit devices. First, we introduce basic principles of MVL technologies by describing methods of obtaining multiple logic states and discussing radix&#8208;related aspects of MVL computation. Next, we classify and overview MVL unit devices with emphasis on principles of operation, technologies, and applications. Finally, we provide a comparative discussion of strengths and weaknesses for each class of MVL devices and conclude with the outlook for the MVL field.

Abstract
Engineering surface structure can precisely and effectively tune optoelectronic properties of halide perovskites, but are incredibly challenging. Herein, we report the design and fabrication of uniform all&#8211;inorganic CsPbBr3 cubes/tetrahedrons single&#8208;crystals with precise control of (100) and (111) surface anisotropy, respectively. By combining theoretical calculations, we demonstrated that the preferred (100) surface engineering of CsPbBr3 single&#8208;crystals enables a lowest surface bandgap energy (2.33&#160;eV) and high&#8208;rate carrier mobility up to 241 &#956;m2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1, inherently boosting their light&#8208;harvesting and carrier transport capability. Whereas, the polar (111) surface induces &#8764;0.16&#160;eV upward surface&#8208;band bending and ultrahigh surface defect density of 1.49 &#215; 1015 cm&#8211;3, which is beneficial for enhancing surface defects&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Our work highlights the anisotropic surface engineering for boosting perovskite optoelectronic devices and beyond.

This study presents new insights into biodegradable near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorescence theranostic nanoparticles by coassembling a self&#8208;sacrificially biodegradable pseudo&#8208;conjugated&#8208;polymer as well as an amphiphilic polyester with doxorubicin via reactive oxygen species responsive thioketal linkages for photodynamic immunotherapy and photoactivated chemotherapy.








Abstract
Semiconducting polymers (SP) hold great promise for cancer phototherapy due to their excellent optical properties; however, their clinical application is still hampered by their poor biodegradability. Herein, a self&#8208;sacrificially biodegradable pseudo&#8208;semiconducting polymer (PSP) for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence bioimaging, photodynamic immunotherapy, and photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) is reported. The PSP can further co&#8208;assemble with an amphiphilic polyester with pendant doxorubicin (DOX) in its side chains via reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive thioketal linkages (PEDOX), which are denoted as NP@PEDOX/PSP. The NP@PEDOX/PSP can accumulate at tumor sites and generate&#160;ROS&#160;for photodynamic immunotherapy as well as near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II fluorescence (NIR&#8208;II) for bioimaging upon irradition at 808 nm. The ROS could break up thioketal linkages in PEDOX, resulting in rapid doxorubicin (DOX) release for PACT. Finally, both PEDOX and PSP are degraded sacrificially by intracellular glutathione (GSH), resulting in the dissociation of NP@PEDOX/PSP. This work highlights the application of self&#8208;sacrificially degradable PSP for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence bioimaging, photodynamic immunotherapy, and PACT in cancer therapy.

         <title>Complement&#8208;Opsonized NIR&#8208;IIb Emissive Immunotracers for Dynamically Monitoring Neutrophils in Inflammation&#8208;Related Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complement C3 opsonized near&#8208;infrared&#8208;IIb emissive immunotracers are captured by inflammation&#8208;stimulated neutrophils in circulatory blood through complement&#8208;receptors&#8208;mediated phagocytosis, enabling dynamically monitoring neutrophils during cutaneous wound healing and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. The strategy of modulating surface chemistry of nanosized imaging agents to enhance complement C3 opsonization provides a new insight to develop immunotracers for in vivo labeling and tracking neutrophils.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of neutrophil dynamics is crucial for timely diagnosis and effective treatment of inflammation&#8208;related diseases, which requires a reliable tracer for in vivo tracking of neutrophils. However, immunotracers for neutrophils are extremely limited because of the difficulty in labeling the cells. Inspired by the natural biological function of the complement system, a strategy of enhancing the complement C3 opsonization of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles (LnNPs) by modulating their surface chemistry, thus developing a near infrared&#8208;IIb emissive nanotracer for neutrophils, is reported herein. Four kinds of surface&#8208;modified LnNPs are fabricated, among which phospholipids DOPG&#8208;modified LnNPs (LnNPs@PG) with weak antifouling ability and hydroxyl groups adsorb more complement C3 proteins and form covalent linkages with C3b active fragments under inflammation conditions, inducing enhanced complement C3 opsonization. Therefore, LnNPs@PG with enhanced complement C3 opsonization are capable of efficiently labeling inflammation&#8208;stimulated neutrophils in vivo through complement&#8208;receptors&#8208;mediated phagocytosis and achieve dynamic monitoring neutrophils during cutaneous wound healing and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Phase Exfoliation of Nonlayered Non&#8208;Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals Crystals into Nanoplatelets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent research progress on the use of liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation beyond layered van der Waals (vdW) crystals is summarized. Questions remain unanswered on how these 3D strongly bonded nonlayered crystals exfoliate into nanoplatelets, and on the insight of the exfoliation mechanism. The answer to the questions helps in revealing the future direction of this newly grown sub&#8208;family of 2D&#8208;class of materials.








Abstract
For nearly 15 years, researchers have been using liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation (LPE) to produce 2D nanosheets from layered crystals. This has yielded multiple 2D materials in a solution&#8208;processable form whose utility has been demonstrated in multiple applications. It was&#160;believed that the exfoliation of such materials is enabled by the very large bonding anisotropy of layered materials where the strength of intralayer chemical bonds is very much larger than that of interlayer van der Waals bonds. However, over the last five years, a number of papers have raised questions about our&#160;understanding of exfoliation by describing the LPE of nonlayered materials. These results are extremely surprising because, as no van der Waals gap is present to provide an easily cleaved direction, the exfoliation of such compounds requires the breaking of only chemical bonds. Here the progress in this unexpected new research area is examined. The structure and properties of nanoplatelets produced by LPE of nonlayered materials are reviewed. A number of unexplained trends are found, not least the preponderance of isotropic materials that have been exfoliated to give high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanoplatelets. Finally, the applications potential of this new class of 2D materials are considered.

         <title>Excimer Formation in the Non&#8208;Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals 2D Semiconductor Bi2O2Se</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excimer formation is unambiguously demonstrated in non&#8208;van der Waals 2D semiconductor Bi2O2Se via transient absorption spectroscopy. The excimer in Bi2O2Se nanosheets is diffusive and its formation can be described as excitons relax to an excimer geometry driven by the ultrafast photoscreening of the intrinsic built&#8208;in dipolar electric field.








Abstract
The layered semiconductor Bi2O2Se is a promising new&#8208;type 2D material that holds layered structure via electrostatic forces instead of van der Waals (vdW) attractions. Aside from the huge success in device performance, the non&#8208;vdW nature in Bi2O2Se with a built&#8208;in interlayer electric field has also provided an appealing platform for investigating unique photoexcited carrier dynamics. Here, experimental evidence for the observation of excimers in multilayer Bi2O2Se nanosheets via transient absorption spectroscopy is presented. It is found that the excimer formation is the primary decay pathway of photoexcited excitons and three&#8208;stage excimer dynamics with corresponding time scales are established. Excitation&#8208;fluence&#8208;dependent excimer dynamics further suggest that the excimer is diffusive and its formation can be simply described as excitons relaxed to an excimer geometry. This work indicates the outstanding promise of unique excitonic processes in Bi2O2Se, which may motivate novel device designs.

         <title>Asymmetric Co&#63743;N3P1 Trifunctional Catalyst with Tailored Electronic Structures Enabling Boosted Activities and Corrosion Resistance in an Uninterrupted Seawater Splitting System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric Co&#63743;N3P1 with a harmonized electronic structure can achieve strong O&#8208;binding ability, moderate H adsorption, and weak Cl&#8722;&#8208;binding ability, which helps to repel Cl&#8722; anions for enhanced corrosion resistance and optimization of the trifunctional ORR/OER/HER performance simultaneously, displaying promising potential for application in an uninterrupted seawater splitting system.








Abstract
Employing seawater splitting systems to generate hydrogen can be economically advantageous but still remains challenging, particularly for designing efficient and high Cl&#8722;&#8208;corrosion resistant trifunctional catalysts toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, single Co&#63743;N&#63743;C catalysts with well&#8208;defined symmetric Co&#63743;N4 sites are selected as atomic platforms for electronic structure tailoring. Density function theory reveals that P&#8208;doping into Co&#63743;N&#63743;C can lead to the formation of asymmetric Co&#63743;N3P1 sites with symmetry&#8208;breaking electronic structures, enabling the affinity of strong oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates, moderate H adsorption, and weak Cl&#8722; adsorption. Thus, ORR/OER/HER activities and stability are optimized simultaneously with high Cl&#8722;&#8208;corrosion resistance. The asymmetric Co&#63743;N3P1 structure based catalyst with boosted ORR/OER/HER performance endows seawater&#8208;based Zn&#8211;air batteries (S&#8208;ZABs) with superior long&#8208;term stability over 750 h and allows seawater splitting to operate continuously for 1000 h. A self&#8208;driven seawater splitting powered by S&#8208;ZABs gives ultrahigh H2 production rates of 497&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1. This work is the first to advance the scientific understanding of the competitive adsorption mechanism between Cl&#8722; and reaction intermediates from the perspective of electronic structure, paving the way for synthesis of efficient trifunctional catalysts with high Cl&#8722;&#8208;corrosion resistance.

Density function theory reveals that P-doping into Co&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C can lead to the formation of asymmetric Co&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; sites with symmetry-breaking electronic structures, enabling the affinity of strong oxygen-containing intermediates, moderate H adsorption, and weak Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption. Thus, ORR/OER/HER activities and stability are optimized simultaneously with high Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-corrosion resistance. The asymmetric Co&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; structure based catalyst with boosted ORR/OER/HER performance endows seawater-based Zn&#8211;air batteries (S-ZABs) with superior long-term stability over 750 h and allows seawater splitting to operate continuously for 1000 h. A self-driven seawater splitting powered by S-ZABs gives ultrahigh H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rates of 497&#160;&#181;mol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work is the first to advance the scientific understanding of the competitive adsorption mechanism between Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and reaction intermediates from the perspective of electronic structure, paving the way for synthesis of efficient trifunctional catalysts with high Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-corrosion resistance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Osteoimmunity&#8208;Regulating Biomimetically Hierarchical Scaffold for Augmented Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D printed scaffold with biomimetically hierarchical porous structure is constructed for augmented bone regeneration through the enhanced immunomodulatory, angiogenic, osteogenic, and weak osteoclastogenic abilities. Such osteoimmunity&#8208;regulating scaffold upregulates M2 macrophages by released carbon monoxide and&#160;Mn2+, enhances neovascularization through secreted vascular endothelial growth factor, and effectively stimulates osteoinductive activity while inhibiting osteoclast differentiation, offering positive enlightenment for promoting large&#8208;scale bone defect repair.








Abstract
Engineering a proper immune response following biomaterial implantation is essential to bone tissue regeneration. Herein, a biomimetically hierarchical scaffold composed of deferoxamine@poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) nanoparticles (DFO@PCL NPs), manganese carbonyl (MnCO) nanosheets, gelatin methacryloyl hydrogel, and a polylactide/hydroxyapatite (HA) matrix is fabricated to augment bone repair by facilitating the balance of the immune system and bone metabolism. First, a 3D printed stiff scaffold with a well&#8208;organized gradient structure mimics the cortical and cancellous bone tissues; meanwhile, an inside infusion of a soft hydrogel further endows the scaffold with characteristics of the extracellular matrix. A Fenton&#8208;like reaction between MnCO and endogenous hydrogen peroxide generated at the implant&#8208;tissue site triggers continuous release of carbon monoxide and Mn2+, thus significantly lessening inflammatory response by upregulating the M2 phenotype of macrophages, which also secretes vascular endothelial growth factor to induce vascular formation. Through activating the hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; pathway, Mn2+ and DFO@PCL NP further promote angiogenesis. Moreover, DFO inhibits osteoclast differentiation and synergistically collaborates with the osteoinductive activity of HA. Based on amounts of data in vitro and in vivo, strong immunomodulatory, intensive angiogenic, weak osteoclastogenic, and superior osteogenic abilities of such an osteoimmunity&#8208;regulating scaffold present a profound effect on improving bone regeneration, which puts forward a worthy base and positive enlightenment for large&#8208;scale bone defect repair.

         <title>Unraveling the Correlation between Raman and Photoluminescence in Monolayer MoS2 through Machine&#8208;Learning Models</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A collection of machine&#8208;learning techniques is utilized to effectively discover the hidden pattern between Raman&#8208; and PL&#8208;spectra of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), which provide insights into the physical mechanisms connecting PL and Raman features. This study's analysis further disentangles the strain and doping contributions from the Raman spectra through machine&#8208;learning models.








Abstract
2D&#160;transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with intense and tunable photoluminescence (PL) have opened up new opportunities for optoelectronic and photonic applications such as light&#8208;emitting diodes, photodetectors, and single&#8208;photon emitters. Among the standard characterization tools for 2D materials, Raman spectroscopy stands out as a fast and non&#8208;destructive technique capable of probing material's&#160;crystallinity and perturbations such as doping and strain. However, a comprehensive understanding of the correlation between photoluminescence and Raman spectra in monolayer&#160;MoS2 remains elusive due to its highly nonlinear nature. Here, the connections between PL signatures and Raman modes are systematically explored, providing comprehensive insights into the physical mechanisms correlating PL and Raman features. This study's analysis further disentangles the strain and doping contributions from the Raman spectra through machine&#8208;learning models. First, a dense convolutional network (DenseNet)&#160;to predict PL maps by spatial Raman maps is deployed. Moreover, a gradient boosted trees model (XGBoost) with Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) to bridge the impact of individual Raman features in PL features is applied. Last, a support vector machine (SVM) to project PL features on Raman frequencies is adopted. This work may serve as a methodology for applying machine learning to characterizations of 2D materials.

         <title>Directed Evolution Enables Simultaneous Controlled Release of Multiple Therapeutic Proteins from Biopolymer&#8208;Based Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directed evolution enables the identification of distinct binding partners to multiple therapeutically&#8208;relevant proteins, thereby enabling their bioactive, independently&#8208;tunable, and simultaneous controlled release from hydrogel delivery vehicles.








Abstract
With the advent of increasingly complex combination strategies of biologics, independent control over their delivery is the key to their efficacy; however, current approaches are hindered by the limited independent tunability of their release rates. To overcome these limitations, directed evolution is used to engineer highly specific, low affinity affibody binding partners to multiple therapeutic proteins to independently control protein release rates. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, specific affibody binding partners for two proteins with broad therapeutic utility: insulin&#8208;like growth factor&#8208;1 (IGF&#8208;1) and pigment epithelium&#8208;derived factor (PEDF) are identified. Protein&#8211;affibody binding interactions specific to these target proteins with equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) between 10&#8722;7 and 10&#8722;8 m are discovered. The affibodies are covalently bound to the backbone of crosslinked hydrogels using click chemistry, enabling sustained, independent, and simultaneous release of bioactive IGF&#8208;1 and PEDF over 7 days. The system is tested with C57BL/6J mice in vivo, and the affibody&#8208;controlled release of IGF&#8208;1 results in sustained activity when compared to bolus IGF&#8208;1 delivery. This work demonstrates a new, broadly applicable approach to tune the release of therapeutic proteins simultaneously and independently and thus the way for precise control over the delivery of multicomponent therapies is paved.

         <title>Herpesvirus&#8208;Mimicking DNAzyme&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticles As a Mitochondrial DNA Stress Inducer to Activate Innate Immunity for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Virus&#8208;based immunotherapy is a promising approach to treat tumor. Closely mimicking the structure and sequential infection processes of natural viruses is highly desirable for effective tumor immunotherapy but remains challenging. Here, inspired by the robust innate immunity induced by herpesvirus, we engineered a herpesvirus&#8208;mimicking nanoparticle (named Vir&#8208;ZM@TD) for tumor therapy by mimicking the structure and infection processes of herpesvirus. In this biomimetic system, DNAzyme&#8208;loaded manganese&#8209;doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks&#8209;90 nanoparticles (ZM@TD) mimic the virus nucleocapsid containing the genome; erythrocyte membrane mimics the viral envelope; and two functional peptides, RGD and HA2 peptides, resemble the surface glycoprotein spikes of herpesvirus. Vir&#8208;ZM@TD can both effectively evade rapid clearance in the blood circulation and closely mimic the serial infection processes of herpesvirus, including specific tumor targeting, membrane fusion&#8208;mediated endosomal escape, and TFAM (transcription factor A, mitochondrial) deficiency&#8208;triggered mitochondrial DNA stress, as well as the release of manganese ions (Mn2+) from organelles into the cytosol, ultimately effectively priming cGAS&#8208;STING pathway&#8208;mediated innate immunity with 68% complete regression of primary tumors and extending by 32 days the median survival time of 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice.

         <title>Percolated Plasmonic Superlattices of Nanospheres with 1&#8208;nm&#8208;level Gap as High&#8208;Index Metamaterials</title>

Abstract
Nanophotonics relies on precise control of refractive index which can be designed with metamaterials. Plasmonic superstructures of nanoparticles (NPs) can suggest a versatile way of tuning refractive index. However, the plasmonic effects in the superstructures demand 1&#8208;nm&#8208;level exquisite control over the inter&#8208;particle gap which is challenging in a sub&#8208;wavelength NPs. Thus far, a large area demonstration has been mostly discouraged. Here, we prepared hetero&#8208;ligand AuNPs which are stable in oil but become Janus particles at the oil&#8208;water interface, called &#8220;adaptive Janus particles&#8221;. NPs are bound at the interface and assembled into 2D arrays over square centimeters as toluene evaporates, which distinctively exhibit the refractive index tunability. In visible and NIR, our 2D superstructures exhibited the highest&#8208;ever refractive index (&#8764;7.8) with varying the size and inter&#8208;particle gap of NPs, which was successfully explained by plasmonic percolation model. Furthermore, fully solution&#8208;processable 2D plasmonic superstructures proved to be advantageous in flexible photonic devices such as distributed Bragg reflectors.

&lt;p&gt;Nanophotonics relies on precise control of refractive index which can be designed with metamaterials. Plasmonic superstructures of nanoparticles (NPs) can suggest a versatile way of tuning refractive index. However, the plasmonic effects in the superstructures demand 1-nm-level exquisite control over the inter-particle gap which is challenging in a sub-wavelength NPs. Thus far, a large area demonstration has been mostly discouraged. Here, we prepared hetero-ligand AuNPs which are stable in oil but become Janus particles at the oil-water interface, called &#8220;adaptive Janus particles&#8221;. NPs are bound at the interface and assembled into 2D arrays over square centimeters as toluene evaporates, which distinctively exhibit the refractive index tunability.

         <title>Controllable Heterogeneous Seeding Induced Crystallization for High&#8208;Efficiency FAPbI3&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells Over 24%</title>

Abstract
The addition of small seeding particles into a supersaturated solution is one among the most effective approaches to obtain high&#8208;quality semiconductor materials via increased crystallization rates. However, limited study was conducted on this approach for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells. Here, we propose a new strategy &#8211; &#8220;heterogeneous seeding&#8208;induced crystallization (hetero&#8208;SiC)&#8221; to assist the growth of FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite. In this work, the (t&#8208;Bu)2PMeHBF4 is directly introduced into the precursor which forms a low solubility complex with PbI2. The low solubility complex can serve as the seed to induce crystallization of perovskite during the solvent evaporation process. Various in situ measurement tools are used to visualize the hetero&#8208;SiC process, which has been shown to be an effective way of manipulating the nucleation and crystal growth of perovskite. The hetero&#8208;SiC greatly improves the film quality, reduces the film defects, and suppresses the non&#8208;radiative recombination. The hetero&#8208;SIC proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device exhibits outstanding performance with 24.0% PCE, well over the control device with 22.2% PCE. Additionally, hetero&#8208;SiC PSC stability under light illumination is enhanced and retains 84 percent of its initial performance after 1400 hours of light illumination.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Based Coacervate&#8208;Core Vesicles with Semipermeable Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coacervate droplets are promising protocell candidates. However, these droplets lack a membrane and are prone to coalescence, limiting their survival and ability to interact. This work shows that short tyrosine&#8208;rich peptide conjugates can undergo liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and subsequently transform into stable membrane&#8208;enclosed protocells by enzymatic oxidation. The coacervate&#8208;core vesicles are semipermeable and can host enzymatic reactions.








Abstract
Coacervates droplets have long been considered as potential protocells to mimic living cells. However, these droplets lack a membrane and are prone to coalescence, limiting their ability to survive, interact, and organize into higher&#8208;order assemblies. This work shows that tyrosine&#8208;rich peptide conjugates can undergo liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation in a well&#8208;defined pH window and transform into stable membrane&#8208;enclosed protocells by enzymatic oxidation and cross&#8208;linking at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface. The oxidation of the tyrosine&#8208;rich peptides into dityrosine creates a semipermeable, flexible membrane around the coacervates with tunable thickness, which displays strong intrinsic fluorescence, and stabilizes the coacervate protocells against coalescence. The membranes have an effective molecular weight cut&#8208;off of 2.5&#160;kDa, as determined from the partitioning of small dyes and labeled peptides, RNA, and polymers into the membrane&#8208;enclosed coacervate protocells. Flicker spectroscopy reveals a membrane bending rigidity of only 0.1kBT, which is substantially lower than phospholipid bilayers despite a larger membrane thickness. Finally, it is shown that enzymes can be stably encapsulated inside the protocells and be supplied with substrates from outside, which opens the way for these membrane&#8208;bound compartments to be used as molecularly crowded artificial cells capable of communication or as a vehicle for drug delivery.

         <title>Tunable Strong Coupling in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically synthesized transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) nanowires are exploited as a new type of subwavelength optical nanoresonators to simultaneously support pronounced excitonic and Mie resonances. Strong coupling between excitons and Mie resonances is demonstrated to support Mie&#8208;exciton polaritons. Moreover, the optical coupling can be further tuned by optothermal effects in a reversible and reproducible way.








Abstract
Subwavelength optical resonators with spatiotemporal control of light are essential to the miniaturization of optical devices. In this work, chemically synthesized transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) nanowires are exploited as a new type of dielectric nanoresonators to simultaneously support pronounced excitonic and Mie resonances. Strong light&#8211;matter couplings and tunable exciton polaritons in individual nanowires are demonstrated. In addition, the excitonic responses can be reversibly modulated with excellent reproducibility, offering the potential for developing tunable optical nanodevices. Being in the mobile colloidal state with highly tunable optical properties, the TMDC nanoresonators will find promising applications in integrated active optical devices, including all&#8208;optical switches and sensors.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Magnon&#8208;Mediated Magnetization Switching in All&#8208;Oxide Heterostructures with Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnon current excited in an insulating antiferromagnetic layer by an electronic spin current in an epitaxial all&#8208;oxide heterostructure is demonstrated to be effective for manipulating the perpendicular magnetization in a ferromagnetic layer. Furthermore, the critical current density to switch the magnetization is about one order of magnitude smaller than in conventional metallic systems.








Abstract
The search for efficient approaches to realize local switching of magnetic moments in spintronic devices has attracted extensive attention. One of the most promising approaches is the electrical manipulation of magnetization through electron&#8208;mediated spin torque. However, the Joule heat generated via electron motion unavoidably causes substantial energy dissipation and potential damage to spintronic devices. Here, all&#8208;oxide heterostructures of SrRuO3/NiO/SrIrO3 are epitaxially grown on SrTiO3 single&#8208;crystal substrates following the order of the ferromagnetic transition metal oxide SrRuO3 with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, insulating and antiferromagnetic NiO, and metallic transition metal oxide SrIrO3 with strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling. It is demonstrated that instead of the electron spin torques, the magnon torques present in the antiferromagnetic NiO layer can directly manipulate the perpendicular magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer. This magnon mechanism may significantly reduce the electron motion&#8208;related energy dissipation from electron&#8208;mediated spin currents. Interestingly, the threshold current density to generate a sufficient magnon current to manipulate the magnetization is one order of magnitude smaller than that in conventional metallic systems. These findings suggest a route for developing highly efficient all&#8208;oxide spintronic devices operated by magnon current.

         <title>All&#8208;Printed Ultrahigh&#8208;Responsivity MoS2 Nanosheet Photodetectors Enabled by Megasonic Exfoliation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully aerosol&#8208;jet printed (AJP) photodetectors are fabricated using megasonically exfoliated MoS2 channels and graphene electrodes. Superlative optoelectronic performance is attributed to the megasonically thinned MoS2 nanosheets, resulting in responsivities that exceed previous all&#8208;printed visible photodetectors by over three orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Printed 2D&#160;materials, derived from solution&#8208;processed inks, offer scalable and cost&#8208;effective routes to mechanically flexible optoelectronics. With micrometer&#8208;scale control and broad processing latitude, aerosol&#8208;jet printing (AJP) is of particular interest for all&#8208;printed circuits and systems. Here, AJP is utilized to achieve ultrahigh&#8208;responsivity photodetectors consisting of well&#8208;aligned, percolating networks of semiconducting MoS2 nanosheets and graphene electrodes on flexible polyimide substrates. Ultrathin (&#8776;1.2&#160;nm thick) and high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio (&#8776;1&#160;&#181;m lateral size) MoS2 nanosheets are obtained by electrochemical intercalation followed by megasonic atomization during AJP, which not only aerosolizes the inks but also further exfoliates the nanosheets. The incorporation of the high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point solvent terpineol into the MoS2 ink is critical for achieving a highly aligned and flat thin&#8208;film morphology following AJP as confirmed by grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and atomic force microscopy. Following AJP, curing is achieved with photonic annealing, which yields quasi&#8208;ohmic contacts and photoactive channels with responsivities exceeding 103&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 that outperform previously reported all&#8208;printed visible&#8208;light photodetectors by over three orders of magnitude. Megasonic exfoliation coupled with properly designed AJP ink formulations enables the superlative optoelectronic properties of ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets to be preserved and exploited for the scalable additive manufacturing of mechanically flexible optoelectronics.

         <title>Poly(arylene piperidine) Quaternary Ammonium Salts Promoting Stable Long&#8208;Lived Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Aqueous Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A long&#8208;lived polymeric room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP)&#160;system is developed based on the electrostatic interaction acting between a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix and a polymer phosphor. The quaternization of the polymeric phosphors significantly enhances the RTP performance, and a&#160;bright&#8208;green phosphorescence with a lifetime of 960&#160;ms can be observed even after soaking in water&#160;for a month.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have garnered considerable research attention owing to their excellent luminescence properties and potential application prospects in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, information storage, and optoelectronics. However, several RTP systems are extremely sensitive to humidity, and consequently, the realization of long&#8208;lived RTP in water remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a feasible and effective strategy is presented to achieve long&#8208;lived polymeric RTP systems, even in an aqueous environment, through doping of synthesized polymeric phosphor PBHDB into a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix. Compared to the precursor polymer PBN and organic molecule HDBP, a more rigid polymer microenvironment and electrostatic interaction are formed between the PMMA matrix and polymer PBHDB, which effectively reduce&#160;the nonradiative decay rate of triplet excitons and dramatically increase&#160;the phosphorescence intensity. Specifically, the phosphorescence lifetime of the PBHDB@PMMA film (1258.62&#160;ms) is much longer than those of PBN@PMMA (674.20&#160;ms) and HDBP@PMMA (1.06&#160;ms). Most importantly, a bright&#8208;green afterglow can be observed after soaking the PBHDB@PMMA film in water for more than a month. The excellent water resistance and reversible response properties endow these systems with promising potential for dynamic information encryption even in water.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life Lithium&#8208;Metal All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries and Stable Li Plating Enabled by In&#160;Situ Formation of Li3PS4 in the SEI Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrastable and kinetically favorable interface is constructed between sulfide&#8211;poly(ethylene oxide) composite solid electrolytes and lithium metal, via in&#160;situ formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) containing Li3PS4. This simple and effective approach of constructing a highly&#160;Li+&#8208;conductive, electronically insulating, chemically/electrochemically stable, and mechanically compatible Li3PS4/Li2S/LiF SEI can lead to small interfacial resistance and uniform lithium plating, which makes Li&#8208;metal&#8208;anode all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries possible.








Abstract
An ultrastable and kinetically favorable interface is constructed between sulfide&#8211;poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) and lithium metal, via in&#160;situ formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer containing Li3PS4. A specially&#160;designed sulfide, lithium polysulfidophosphate (LPS), can distribute uniformly in the PEO matrix via a simple stirring process because of its complete solubility in acetonitrile solvent, which is advantageous for creating a homogeneous SEI layer. The CSE/Li interface with high Li+ transportation capability is stabilized quickly through in&#160;situ formation of a Li3PS4/Li2S/LiF layer via the reaction between LPS and lithium metal to inhibit lithium dendrite growth. A Li/Li symmetric cell with the LPS&#8208;integrated CSE exhibits constant and small CSE/Li resistance of 10&#160;&#937;&#160;cm2&#160;during cycling, delivering stable cycling for 3475&#160;h at a current density of 0.2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;and a high critical current density of 0.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;at 60&#160;&#176;C. Impressive electrochemical performance is also demonstrated for LiFePO4/CSE/Li all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with capacity of 127.6&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;after 1000&#160;cycles at 1&#160;C.

         <title>Surface Transformation Enables a Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc&#8208;Metal Anode in Nonaqueous Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly reversible and dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal anode is achieved by the surface transformation of Cu substrate in a nonaqueous electrolyte. Meanwhile, the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth mechanism and edge&#8208;to&#8208;center stripping behavior during the plating and stripping processes is revealed by in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC&#8208;AFM).








Abstract
Significant challenges remain in developing rechargeable zinc batteries mainly because of reversibility problems on zinc&#8208;metal anodes. The dendritic growth and hydrogen evolution on zinc electrodes are major obstacles to overcome in developing practical and safe zinc batteries. Here, a dendrite&#8208;free and hydrogen&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal anode with high Coulombic efficiency up to 99.6% over 300 cycles is realized in a newly designed nonaqueous electrolyte, which comprises an inexpensive zinc salt, zinc acetate, and a green low&#8208;cost solvent, dimethyl sulfoxide. Surface transformation on Cu substrate plays a critical role in facilitating the dendrite&#8208;free deposition process, which lowers the diffusion energy barrier of the Zn atoms, leading to a uniform and compact thin film for zinc plating. Furthermore, in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy reveals the plating process via a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth mechanism and the stripping process through an edge&#8208;dissolution mechanism. In addition, Zn||Mo6S8 full cells exhibit excellent electrochemical performance in terms of cycling stability and rate capability. This work presents a new opportunity to develop nonaqueous rechargeable zinc batteries.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Microenvironment Engineering of a Single&#8208;Molecular Heterojunction for Promoting Concerted Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;inspired single&#8208;molecular heterojunction electrocatalyst with accurate amino&#8208;rich microenvironments around the active sites is uniquely designed to enable efficient CO2 capture and fast proton ferrying during CO2 electroreduction, which achieves concurrent CO production at the cathode and sulfur recovery at the anode with industrial&#8208;level current density and lower energy consumption.








Abstract
Challenges remain in the development of novel multifunctional electrocatalysts and their industrial operation on low&#8208;electricity pair&#8208;electrocatalysis platforms for the carbon cycle. Herein, an enzyme&#8208;inspired single&#8208;molecular heterojunction electrocatalyst ((NHx)16&#8208;NiPc/CNTs) with specific atomic nickel centers and amino&#8208;rich local microenvironments for industrial&#8208;level electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) and further energy&#8208;saving integrated CO2 electrolysis is designed and developed. (NHx)16&#8208;NiPc/CNTs exhibit unprecedented catalytic performance with industry&#8208;compatible current densities, &#8776;100% Faradaic efficiency and remarkable stability for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, outperforming most reported catalysts. In addition to the enhanced CO2 capture by chemisorption, the sturdy deuterium kinetic isotope effect and proton inventory studies sufficiently reveal&#160;that such distinctive local microenvironments provide an effective proton ferry effect for improving local alkalinity and proton transfer and creating local interactions to stabilize the intermediate, ultimately enabling the high&#8208;efficiency operation of eCO2RR. Further, by using (NHx)16&#8208;NiPc/CNTs as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in a flow cell, a low&#8208;electricity overall CO2 electrolysis system coupling cathodic eCO2RR with anodic oxidation reaction is developed to achieve concurrent feed gas production and sulfur recovery, simultaneously decreasing the energy input. This work paves the new way in exploring molecular electrocatalysts and electrolysis systems with techno&#8208;economic feasibility.

         <title>Tactile Near&#8208;Sensor Analogue Computing for Ultrafast Responsive Artificial Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tactile near&#8208;sensor analogue computing system that integrates a pyramidal pressure sensor array and a flexible memristor array is reported. The system can simultaneously sense and process multiple tactile stimuli without any conversion circuits. Such integration approach enables energy&#8208;efficient near&#8208;sensor analogue computing for ultrafast artificial skin applications.








Abstract
Ultrafast artificial skin enables unprecedented tactile internet applications in prosthetics, robotics, and human&#8211;machine interactions. However, current artificial skin systems that rely on front&#8208;end interface electronics typically perform redundant data transfer and analogue&#8208;to&#8208;digital conversions for decision&#8208;making, causing long latency (milliseconds). Here, a near&#8208;sensor analogue computing system based on a flexible memristor array for artificial skin applications is reported. This system, which seamlessly integrates a tactile sensor array with a flexible hafnium oxide memristor array, can simultaneously sense and compute raw multiple analogue pressure signals without interface electronics. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the system is used for real&#8208;time noise reduction and edge detection of tactile stimuli. One sensing&#8211;computing operation of this system takes about 400&#160;ns and consumes on average 1000 times less power than a conventional interface electronic system. The results demonstrate that near&#8208;sensor analogue computing offers an ultrafast and energy&#8208;efficient route to large&#8208;scale artificial skin systems.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Responsive Magnetoactive and Electro&#8211;Ionic Soft Actuator Derived from a Nickel&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetically and electrically driven dual&#8208;responsive soft actuator is presented by an engineering of unprecedented nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;MOF). It can nurture the complex motion for relevant robotic interaction. The magneto&#8211;electro&#8208;ionic soft actuator obtained from the newly developed Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;derived active material is successfully utilized to demonstrate hovering motion of a hummingbird robot under magnetic and electrical stimuli.








Abstract
There is growing demand for multiresponsive soft actuators for the realization of natural, safe, and complex motions in robotic interactions. In particular, soft actuators simultaneously stimulated by electrical and magnetic fields are always under development owing to their simple controllability and reliability during operation. Herein, magnetically and electrically driven dual&#8208;responsive soft actuators (MESAs) derived from novel nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ni&#8208;MOFs&#8208;700C), are reported. Nanoscale Ni&#8208;MOFs&#8208;700C has excellent electrochemical and magnetic properties that allow it to be used as a multifunctional material under both magnetoactive and electro&#8208;ionic actuations. The dual&#8208;responsive MESA exhibits a bending displacement of 30&#160;mm and an ultrafast rising time of 1.5 s under a very low input voltage of 1&#160;V and also exerts a bending deflection of 12.5&#160;mm at 50 mT under a high excitation frequency of 5&#160;Hz. By utilizing a dual&#8208;responsive MESA, the hovering motion of a hummingbird robot is demonstrated under magnetic and electrical stimuli.

         <title>The Energy Level Conundrum of Organic Semiconductors in Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photovoltaic gap measured by ultraviolet and low&#8208;energy photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS/LE&#8208;IPES) gives the best correlation to device properties, enabling the prediction of maximum Voc. Cyclic voltammetry (CV)&#8208;derived redox potentials are less meaningful for predicting the energetic landscape at the &#8220;donor&#8221;&#8211;&#8220;acceptor&#8221; interface.








Abstract
The frontier molecular energy levels of organic semiconductors are decisive for their fundamental function and efficiency in optoelectronics. However, the precise determination of these energy levels and their variation when using different techniques makes it hard to compare and establish design rules. In this work, the energy levels of 33 organic semiconductors via cyclic voltammetry (CV), density functional theory, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and low&#8208;energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy are determined. Solar cells are fabricated to obtain key device parameters and relate them to the significant differences in the energy levels and offsets obtained from different methods. In contrast to CV, the photovoltaic gap measured using photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) correlates well with the experimental device VOC. It is demonstrated that high&#8208;performing systems such as PM6:Y6 and WF3F:Y6, which are previously reported to have negligible ionization energy (IE) offsets (&#916;IE), possess sizable &#916;IE of &#8776;0.5&#160;eV, determined by PES. Using various D&#8211;A blends, it is demonstrated that &#916;IE plays a key role in charge generation. In contrast to earlier reports, it is shown that a vanishing &#916;IE is detrimental to device performance. Overall, these findings establish a solid base for reliably evaluating material energetics and interpreting property&#8211;performance relationships in organic solar cells.

         <title>Anhydrous Fast Proton Transport Boosted by the Hydrogen Bond Network in a Dense Oxide&#8208;Ion Array of &#945;&#8208;MoO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kinetic property of inserted charge carriers in a battery electrode dominates the power density of the system. In this work, the fast proton&#8208;transfer mechanism in the unique dense framework of &#945;&#8208;MoO3 is decoded. The hydrogen bond network boosts the proton transport and thus realizes a proton battery with high rate capabilities and long life.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;power battery chemistry is an urgent task to buffer fluctuating renewable energies and achieve a sustainable and flexible power supply. Owing to the small size of the proton and its ultrahigh mobility in water via the Grotthuss mechanism, aqueous proton batteries are an attractive candidate for high&#8208;power energy storage devices. Grotthuss proton transfer is ultrafast owing to the hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks of water molecules. In this work, similar continuous hydrogen bond networks in a dense oxide&#8208;ion array of solid &#945;&#8208;MoO3 are discovered, which facilitate the anhydrous proton transport even without structural water. The fast proton transfer and accumulation that occurs during (de)intercalation in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 is unveiled using both experiments and first&#8208;principles calculations. Coupled with a zinc anode and a superconcentrated Zn2+/H+ electrolyte, the proton&#8208;transport mechanism in anhydrous hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks realizes an aqueous MoO3&#8211;Zn battery with large capacity, long life, and fast charge&#8211;discharge abilities.

&lt;p&gt;The kinetic property of inserted charge carriers in a battery electrode dominates the power density of the system. In this work, the fast proton-transfer mechanism in the unique dense framework of &#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is decoded. The hydrogen bond network boosts the proton transport and thus realizes a proton battery with high rate capabilities and long life.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing high-power battery chemistry is an urgent task to buffer fluctuating renewable energies and achieve a sustainable and flexible power supply. Owing to the small size of the proton and its ultrahigh mobility in water via the Grotthuss mechanism, aqueous proton batteries are an attractive candidate for high-power energy storage devices. Grotthuss proton transfer is ultrafast owing to the hydrogen-bonded networks of water molecules. In this work, similar continuous hydrogen bond networks in a dense oxide-ion array of solid &#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are discovered, which facilitate the anhydrous proton transport even without structural water. The fast proton transfer and accumulation that occurs during (de)intercalation in &#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is unveiled using both experiments and first-principles calculations. Coupled with a zinc anode and a superconcentrated Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; electrolyte, the proton-transport mechanism in anhydrous hydrogen-bonded networks realizes an aqueous MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;Zn battery with large capacity, long life, and fast charge&#8211;discharge abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Kirigami&#8208;Inspired Pressure Sensors for Wearable Dynamic Cardiovascular Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kirigami&#8208;inspired pressure sensor is developed for wearable dynamic cardiovascular monitoring. Utilizing the vertical kirigami&#8208;inspired structure and a simple fabrication process, the sensor provides an ascendant way for wearable bioelectronics to overcome motion artifacts when monitoring human pulse signals, thus representing a solid advancement toward personalized cardiovascular monitoring in the era of the Internet of things.








Abstract
Continuously and accurately monitoring pulse&#8208;wave signals is critical to prevent and diagnose cardiovascular diseases. However, existing wearable pulse sensors are vulnerable to motion artifacts due to the lack of proper adhesion and conformal interface with human skin during body movement. Here, a highly sensitive and conformal pressure sensor inspired by the kirigami structure is developed to measure the human pulse wave on different body artery sites under various prestressing pressure conditions and even with body movement. COMSOL multiphysical field coupling simulation and experimental testing are used to verify the unique advantages of the kirigami structure. The device shows a superior sensitivity (35.2&#160;mV Pa&#8722;1) and remarkable stability (&gt;84&#160;000 cycles). Toward practical applications, a wireless cardiovascular monitoring system is developed for wirelessly transmitting the pulse signals to a mobile phone in real&#8208;time, which successfully distinguished the pulse waveforms from different participants. The pulse waveforms measured by the kirigami inspired pressure sensor are as accurate as those provided by the commercial medical device. Given the compelling features, the sensor provides an ascendant way for wearable electronics to overcome motion artifacts when monitoring pulse signals, thus representing a solid advancement toward personalized healthcare in the era of the Internet of Things.
