         <title>Single&#8208;Transistor Neuron with Excitatory&#8208;Inhibitory Spatiotemporal Dynamics Applied for Neuronal Oscillations</title>

Abstract
Brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic computing systems with the potential to drive the next wave of artificial intelligence demand a spectrum of critical components beyond simple characteristics. An emerging research trend is to achieve advanced functions with ultra&#8208;compact neuromorphic device. We demonstrate a single&#8208;transistor neuron that implements excitatory&#8208;inhibitory (E&#8208;I) spatiotemporal integration and series of essential neuron behaviors. Neuronal oscillations, the fundamental mode of neuronal communication that construct high&#8208;dimensional population code to achieve efficient computing in brain, can also be demonstrated by our neuron transistors. The highly&#8208;scalable E&#8208;I neuron can be the basic building block for implementing core neuronal circuit motifs and large&#8208;scale architectural plans to replicate energy&#8208;efficient neural computations, forming the foundation of future integrated neuromorphic systems.

         <title>Direct Presentation of Tumor&#8208;Associated Antigens to Induce Adaptive Immunity by Personalized Dendritic Cell&#8208;Mimicking Nanovaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based vaccines are an approved method for inducing potent antigen&#8208;specific immune responses to eliminate tumor cells. However, this promising strategy still faces challenges such as tumor&#8208;associated antigens (TAAs) loading, lymph node homing, quality control and other limitations. Here, we develop a personalized DC&#8208;mimicking nanovaccine (nanoDC) for stimulation of TAAs&#8208;specific T cell populations. The nanoDCs are fabricated using nanoparticles with dendritic structure and membranes from mature bone marrow&#8208;derived cells (BMDCs). Mature BMDCs are stimulated by nanostructures assembled from Escherichia coli (E. coli) and tumor cells to efficiently deliver TAAs and induce BMDCs maturation through the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. By maintaining co&#8208;stimulatory markers, molecules class I (MHC&#8208;I) antigen complexes, and lymphocyte homing receptors, nanoDCs efficiently migrate to lymph nodes and generate potent antigen&#8208;specific T cell responses. Consequently, vaccination with nanoDCs strongly inhibit the tumor growth and metastases formation in vivo. In particular, nanoDCs can also induce memory T cells for long&#8208;term protective immunity. This study demonstrates that DC&#8208;mimicking nanovaccines can trigger adaptive immune protection against tumors for personalized immunotherapy and precision medicine.

         <title>Reveal the Mechanism of sp&#8208;N Doping in Graphdiyne for Developing Site&#8208;Defined Metal&#8208;Free Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Due to the limited reserves of metals, scientists are devoted to exploring high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;free catalysts based on carbon materials to solve environment&#8208;related issues. Doping would build up inhomogeneous charge distribution on surface, which is an efficient approach for boosting the catalytic performance. However, doping sites are difficult to control in traditional carbon materials, thus hindering their development. Taking the advantage of unique sp&#8208;C in graphdiyne (GDY), we have site&#8208;defined introduced a new N doping configuration of sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen (sp&#8208;N), bringing a Pt&#8208;comparable catalytic activity in oxygen reduction reaction. However, the reaction intermediate of this process has never been captured, hindering the understanding of the mechanism and also the precise synthesis of metal&#8208;free catalysts. After the four&#8208;year study, we realized the fabrication of intermediate&#8208;like molecule for the first time, and finally obtained sp&#8208;N doped GDY via the pericyclic reaction. Compared with GDY doped with other N configurations, the designed sp&#8208;N GDY shows much higher catalytic activity in electroreduction of CO2 towards CH4 production, owing to the unique electronic structure introduced by sp&#8208;N, which is more favorable in stabilizing the intermediate. Thus, besides opening the black&#8208;box for the site&#8208;defined doping, this work reveals the relationship between doping configuration and products of CO2 reduction.

         <title>Decoupled Solar Energy Storage and Dark Photocatalysis in a 3D Metal&#8208;organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Materials enabling solar energy conversion and long&#8208;term storage for readily available electrical and chemical energy are key for off&#8208;grid energy distribution. Herein, the specific confinement of a rhenium coordination complex in a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) unlocks a unique electron accumulating property under visible&#8208;light irradiation. About 15&#160;C&#8729;gMOF&#8722;1 of electric charges can be concentrated and stored for over four weeks without loss. Decoupled, on&#8208;demand discharge for electrochemical reactions and H2 evolution catalysis is shown and light&#8208;driven recharging can be conducted for more than 10 cycles with &#8764;90% of the initial charging capacity retained. Experimental investigations and theorical calculations link electron trapping to MOF&#8208;induced geometry constraints as well as the coordination environment of the Re&#8208;center, highlighting the key role of MOF confinement on molecular guests. This study serves as the seminal report on 3D porous colloids achieving photo&#8208;accumulation of long&#8208;lived electrons, unlocking dark photocatalysis and a path toward solar capacitor and solar battery systems.

         <title>Observation of H2 Evolution and Electrolyte Diffusion on MoS2 Monolayer by In Situ Liquid&#8208;Phase Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ electrochemical liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM) facilitates real&#8208;time observation of the H2 evolution reaction (HER) on MoS2 monolayer. Time&#8208;series LPTEM shows sequential activation, H2 bubble formation, and electrolyte flow on different types of catalytic active sites. Directionality of H2 bubbling and competitive wetting between the bubbles and electrolyte on catalyst surface significantly affect the HER activity of the&#160;active sites.








Abstract
Unit&#8208;cell&#8208;thick MoS2 is a promising electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) owing to its tunable catalytic activity, which is determined based on the energetics and molecular interactions of different types of HER active sites. Kinetic responses of MoS2 active sites, including the reaction onset, diffusion of the electrolyte and H2 bubbles, and continuation of these processes, are important factors affecting the catalytic activity of MoS2. Investigating these factors requires a direct real&#8208;time analysis of the HER occurring on spatially independent active sites. Herein, the H2 evolution and electrolyte diffusion on the surface of MoS2 are observed in real time by in situ electrochemical liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM). Time&#8208;dependent LPTEM observations reveal that different types of active sites are sequentially activated under the same conditions. Furthermore, the electrolyte flow to these sites is influenced by the reduction potential and site geometry, which affects the bubble detachment and overall HER activity of MoS2.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic neuroelectronics have been researched to treat and diagnose neurological diseases. The organic materials provide large advantages for neural interfaces. Also, organic nervetronics provides efficient data processing by emulating functional behavior of neural systems. Recent progress in organic neural interfaces and neuroprosthetics, with aspects of materials, devices, and systems, and finally suggests future directions, is presented.








Abstract
Requirements and recent advances in research on organic neuroelectronics are outlined herein. Neuroelectronics such as neural interfaces and neuroprosthetics provide a promising approach to diagnose and treat neurological diseases. However, the current neural interfaces are rigid and not biocompatible, so they induce an immune response and deterioration of neural signal transmission. Organic materials are promising candidates for neural interfaces, due to their mechanical softness, excellent electrochemical properties, and biocompatibility. Also, organic nervetronics, which mimics functional properties of the biological nerve system, is being developed to overcome the limitations of the complex and energy&#8208;consuming conventional neuroprosthetics that limit long&#8208;term implantation and daily&#8208;life usage. Examples of organic materials for neural interfaces and neural signal recordings are reviewed, recent advances of organic nervetronics that use organic artificial synapses are highlighted, and then further requirements for neuroprosthetics are discussed. Finally, the future challenges that must be overcome to achieve ideal organic neuroelectronics for next&#8208;generation neuroprosthetics are discussed.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Unparalleled Strength and Supertoughness of Poly(urea&#8208;urethane) with Shape Memory and Clusterization&#8208;Triggered Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecularly engineered poly(urea&#8208;urethane) with unparalleled strength (&#8776;84.2&#160;MPa) and supertoughness (&#8776;322.8&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3) that&#160;simultaneously features shape&#8208;memory effects, fatigue resistance, and clusterization&#8208;triggered emission properties,&#160;by regulating the reversible microphase&#8208;separation structure composed of the rigid unit and multiple hydrogen bonds and molecular weight of soft segment, is reported.








Abstract
To address the challenge of realizing multifunctional polymers simultaneously exhibiting high strength and high toughness through molecular engineering, ultrastrong and supertough shape&#8208;memory poly(urea&#8208;urethane) (PUU) is fabricated by regulating: i) the reversible cross&#8208;links composed of rigid units and multiple hydrogen bonds, and ii) the molecular weight of soft segments. The optimal material exhibits an unparalleled strength of 84.2&#160;MPa at a large elongation at a break of 925.6%, a superior toughness of 322.8&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, and remarkable fatigue resistance without fracture. The repeated stretching of this material induces an irreversible deformation, which, however, can be rapidly recovered by heating. Moreover, all samples are capable of temporary shape fixation at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C (recovering the original shape at 30&#160;&#176;C) and exhibit blue fluorescence when excited at the optimum wavelength, which is ascribed to clusterization&#8208;triggered emission (CTE) due to the formation of microphase&#8208;separation structures. Thus, the adopted approach provides a solution to a long&#8208;standing problem and paves the way to the realization of intrinsically luminescent shape&#8208;memory materials exhibiting both ultrahigh strength and ultrahigh toughness.

         <title>Ru&#8208;Doping&#8208;Induced Spin Frustration and Enhancement of the Room&#8208;Temperature Anomalous Hall Effect in La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ru&#8208;doping&#8208;enhanced anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in ferromagnetic La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 epitaxial films is explored, which circumvents the long&#8208;standing dilemma between large AHE and high Tc in transition&#8208;metal oxides. It is found that Ru doping can modulate the local exchange coupling and thus cause considerable spin frustration. The resultant spin frustration can dramatically enhance the skew&#8208;scattering and the extrinsic AHE.








Abstract
In transition&#8208;metal&#8208;oxide heterostructures, the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a powerful tool for detecting the magnetic state and revealing intriguing interfacial magnetic orderings. However, achieving a larger AHE at room temperature in oxide heterostructures is still challenging due to the dilemma of mutually strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling and magnetic exchange interactions. Here, Ru&#8208;doping&#8208;enhanced AHE in La2/3Sr1/3Mn1&#8722;xRuxO3 epitaxial films is exploited. As the B&#8208;site Ru doping level increases up to 20%, the anomalous Hall resistivity at room temperature can be enhanced from n&#937; cm to &#181;&#937;&#160;cm scale. Ru doping leads to strong competition between the ferromagnetic double&#8208;exchange interaction and the antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction. The resultant spin frustration and spin&#8208;glass state facilitate a strong skew&#8208;scattering process, thus significantly enhancing the extrinsic AHE. The findings can pave a feasible approach for boosting the controllability and reliability of oxide&#8208;based spintronic devices.

         <title>Novel (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) Nonbonding Active Structures on Defective Carbon from Oxygen&#8208;Rich Coal Tar Pitch for Efficient HER and ORR</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel atomic&#8208;scale (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure is designed and constructed by anchoring Pt single atoms and Co atomic clusters in defective carbon supports derived from oxygen&#8208;rich coal tar pitch. The (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active sites exhibit excellent catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction. The mass activity is far superior to commercial 20% Pt/C.








Abstract
Atomic&#8208;scale utilization and coordination structure of Pt electrocatalyst is extremely crucial to decrease loading mass and maximize activity for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs). A novel atomic&#8208;scale (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure is designed and constructed by anchoring Pt single atoms and Co atomic clusters on the defective carbon derived from oxygen&#8208;rich coal tar pitch (CTP). The Pt loading mass is extremely low and only 0.56&#160;wt%. A new nonbonding interaction phenomenon between Pt&#8208;Ox and Co&#8208;Oy is found and confirmed based on X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Based on the (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure, surface chemical field coupling with electrocatalysis for the HER and ORR is confirmed. It is found that the (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure exhibits high mass activities of 64.4 A cm&#8722;2 mgPt&#8722;1 (at an overpotential of 100&#160;mV) and 7.2 A cm&#8722;2 mgPt&#8722;1 (at 0.8&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) for the HER and ORR, respectively. The values are 6.5 and 11.6 times as much as those of commercial 20% Pt/C. The work provides innovative insight to design and understand efficient active sites of atomic&#8208;scale Pt on oxygen&#8208;rich CTP&#8208;derived carbon supports for electrocatalysis.

         <title>An Activity&#8208;Based Photosensitizer to Reverse Hypoxia and Oxidative&#160;Resistance for Tumor Photodynamic Eradication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activity&#8208;based photosensitizer for targeting histone deacetylases (HDACs) is designed based on a quinoxalinone scaffold through a pharmacophore migration strategy. The developed activity&#8208;based photosensitizer can inhibit HDACs, and overcome hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance, realizing its full potential for malignant tumor treatment.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been a well&#8208;accepted clinical treatment for malignant tumors owing to its noninvasiveness and high spatiotemporal selectivity. However, the treatment outcome of current PDT applications is hindered by hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance of solid tumors. Recent studies have shown that inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) can induce cell ferroptosis, reverse hypoxia, and elevate oxidative status. Theoretically, the design and synthesis of activity&#8208;based photosensitizers that target HDACs can address the bottlenecks of PDT. Herein, the concept of an activity&#8208;based photosensitizer is presented for targeting HDACs, which is designed based on a quinoxalinone scaffold through a pharmacophore migration strategy. The developed activity&#8208;based photosensitizer can inhibit HDACs, and overcome hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance, realizing the full potential of photosensitizers for malignant tumor treatment. The molecular design strategy proposed in this project should provide theoretical guidance for the development of ideal photosensitizers for practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;An activity-based photosensitizer for targeting histone deacetylases (HDACs) is designed based on a quinoxalinone scaffold through a pharmacophore migration strategy. The developed activity-based photosensitizer can inhibit HDACs, and overcome hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance, realizing its full potential for malignant tumor treatment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been a well-accepted clinical treatment for malignant tumors owing to its noninvasiveness and high spatiotemporal selectivity. However, the treatment outcome of current PDT applications is hindered by hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance of solid tumors. Recent studies have shown that inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) can induce cell ferroptosis, reverse hypoxia, and elevate oxidative status. Theoretically, the design and synthesis of activity-based photosensitizers that target HDACs can address the bottlenecks of PDT. Herein, the concept of an activity-based photosensitizer is presented for targeting HDACs, which is designed based on a quinoxalinone scaffold through a pharmacophore migration strategy. The developed activity-based photosensitizer can inhibit HDACs, and overcome hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance, realizing the full potential of photosensitizers for malignant tumor treatment. The molecular design strategy proposed in this project should provide theoretical guidance for the development of ideal photosensitizers for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Activity via Atom&#8208;Stepped Interfaces Architected with Kinetic Frustration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;energy yet stable interface architecture with abundant catalytically active atom steps can be facilely fabricated by utilizing the kinetic frustration effect in glass&#8208;forming alloys during rapid solidification. These atomic steps can be well stabilized due to the confinement effect imposed by the disordered glassy matrix and provide fast&#8208;catalytic kinetics for oxygen&#8208;evolving reaction.








Abstract
A highly active interface is extremely critical for the catalytic efficiency of an electrocatalyst; however, facilely tailoring its atomic packing characteristics remains challenging. Herein, a simple yet effective strategy is reported to obtain copious high&#8208;energy atomic steps at the interface via controlling the solidification behavior of glass&#8208;forming metallic liquids. By adjusting the chemical composition and cooling rate, highly faceted FeNi3 nanocrystals are in&#160;situ formed in an Fe&#63743;Ni&#63743;B metallic glass (MG) matrix, leading to the creation of order/disorder interfaces. Benefiting from the catalytically active and stable atomic steps at the jagged interfaces, the resultant free&#8208;standing FeNi3 nanocrystal/MG composite exhibits a low oxygen&#8208;evolving overpotential of 214&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 32.4&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1, and good stability in alkaline media, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. This approach is based on the manipulation of nucleation and crystal growth of the solid&#8208;solution nanophases (e.g., FeNi3) in glass&#8208;forming liquids, so that the highly stepped interface architecture can be obtained due to the kinetic frustration effect in MGs upon undercooling. It is envisaged that the atomic&#8208;level stepped interface engineering via the physical metallurgy method can be easily extended to other MG systems, providing a new and generic paradigm for designing efficient yet cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts.

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Amorphous Porous Polymers for Rapid Adsorption of Micropollutants and Solar&#8208;Powered Volatile Organic Compounds Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular engineering of amorphous covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) successfully generates hydrophilic porous materials, which exhibit an exceptional removal efficiency of micropollutants (&gt;99.9% of phenol derivatives) and excellent recyclability. The photothermal characteristics of oxidized CTFs show a high volatile organic compound (VOC) rejection rate (&#8776;98% of phenol). Synergistic interplay of high&#8208;performance adsorption and solar&#8208;driven evaporation enables complete removal (&gt;99.9%) of mixture of phenol derivatives.








Abstract
Freshwater shortage is becoming one of the most critical global challenges owing to severe water pollution caused by micropollutants and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, current purification technology shows slow adsorption of micropollutants and requires an energy&#8208;intensive process for VOCs removal from water. In this study, a highly efficient molecularly engineered covalent triazine framework (CTF) for rapid adsorption of micropollutants and VOC&#8208;intercepting performance using solar distillation is reported. Supramolecular design and mild oxidation of CTFs (CTF&#8208;OXs) enable hydrophilic internal channels and improve molecular sieving of micropollutants. CTF&#8208;OX shows rapid removal efficiency of micropollutants (&gt;99.9% in 10&#160;s) and can be regenerated several times without performance loss. Uptake rates of selected micropollutants are high, with initial pollutant uptake rates of 21.9&#160;g&#160;mg&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1, which are the highest rates recorded for bisphenol A (BPA) adsorption. Additionally, photothermal composite membrane fabrication using CTF&#8208;OX exhibits high VOC rejection rate (up to 98%) under 1 sun irradiation (1&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;2). A prototype of synergistic purification system composed of adsorption and solar&#8208;driven membrane can efficiently remove over 99.9% of mixed phenol derivatives. This study provides an effective strategy for rapid removal of micropollutants and high VOC rejection via solar&#8208;driven evaporation process.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Graded Electrodes Mitigate the Mismatch between Mechanical Reliability and Energy Density for Foldable Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechano&#8208;graded electrodes with gradient&#8208;distributed maximum allowable strain are proposed to mitigate the mismatch between mechanical reliability and energy density for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The up&#8208;graded&#8208;electrode&#8208;based LIBs enable a remarkable figure of merit (FOM) value of 121.3 mWh cm&#8722;3, proving the brilliant comprehensive performance of flexible high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs.








Abstract
Flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density are highly desirable for wearable electronics. However, difficult to achieve excellent flexibility and high energy density simultaneously via the current approaches for designing flexible LIBs. To mitigate the mismatch, mechano&#8208;graded electrodes with gradient&#8208;distributed maximum allowable strain are proposed to endow high&#8208;loading&#8208;mass slurry&#8208;coating electrodes with brilliant intrinsic flexibility without sacrificing energy density. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the up&#8208;graded LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 cathodes (&#8776;15&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, &#8776;70&#160;&#181;m) and graphite anodes (&#8776;8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, &#8776;105&#160;&#181;m) can tolerate an extremely low bending radius of 400 and 600&#160;&#181;m, respectively. Finite element analysis (FEA) reveals that, compared with conventionally homogeneous electrodes, the flexibility of the up&#8208;graded electrodes is enhanced by specifically strengthening the upper layer and avoiding crack initiation. Benefiting from this, the foldable pouch cell (required bending radius of &#8776;600&#160;&#181;m) successfully realizes a remarkable figure of merit (FOM, energy density vs bending radius) of 121.3 mWh cm&#8722;3. Moreover, the up&#8208;graded&#8208;electrodes&#8208;based pouch cells can deliver a stable power supply, even under various deformation modes, such as twisting, folding, and knotting. This work proposes new insights for harmonizing the mechanics and electrochemistry of energy storage devices to achieve high energy density under flexible extremes.

         <title>Synthetic Nanoarchitectonics of Functional Organic&#8211;Inorganic 2D Germanane Heterostructures via Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; synthetic approach is devised for covalently anchoring thiol&#8208;rich organic nanomaterials (i.e., carbon dots) onto commercially available 2D allyl germanane via the thiol&#8211;ene click reaction. Remarkably, the implanted characteristics provide new physicochemical features to the resulting 0D/2D heterostructure, making possible its implementation in yet unexplored optoelectronic tasks that are inaccessible to the pristine 2D germanane counterpart.








Abstract
Succeeding graphene, 2D inorganic materials made of reactive van der Waals layers, like 2D germanane (2D&#8208;Ge) derivatives, have attracted great attention because their physicochemical characteristics can be entirely tuned by modulating the nature of the surface substituent. Although very interesting from a scientific point of view, almost all the reported works involving 2D&#8208;Ge derivatives are focused on computational studies. Herein, a first prototype of organic&#8211;inorganic 2D&#8208;Ge heterostructure has been synthesized by covalently anchoring thiol&#8208;rich carbon dots (CD&#8211;SH) onto 2D allyl germanane (2D&#8208;aGe) via a simple and green &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; click chemistry approach. Remarkably, the implanted characteristics of the carbon nanomaterial provide new physicochemical features to the resulting 0D/2D heterostructure, making possible its implementation in yet unexplored optoelectronic tasks&#8212;e.g., as a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensing system triggered by supramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions&#8212;that are inaccessible for the pristine 2D&#8208;aGe counterpart. Consequently, this work builds a foundation toward the robust achievement of functional organic&#8211;inorganic 2D&#8208;Ge nanoarchitectonics through covalently assembling thiol&#8208;rich carbon nanoallotropes on commercially available 2D&#8208;aGe.

Remarkably, the implanted characteristics of the carbon nanomaterial provide new physicochemical features to the resulting 0D/2D heterostructure, making possible its implementation in yet unexplored optoelectronic tasks&#8212;e.g., as a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensing system triggered by supramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions&#8212;that are inaccessible for the pristine 2D-aGe counterpart. Consequently, this work builds a foundation toward the robust achievement of functional organic&#8211;inorganic 2D-Ge nanoarchitectonics through covalently assembling thiol-rich carbon nanoallotropes on commercially available 2D-aGe.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetic Ordering in a High&#8208;Spin Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of organic materials that magnetically order at room temperature remains a grand challenge central to integrating spin, magnetic, and quantum mechanical effects within emerging technologies. This work demonstrates that long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;correlations within a high&#8208;spin conjugated polymer provide a viable path toward spin&#8208;center generation, robust intermolecular exchange interactions, anisotropic spin ordering at elevated temperatures, and high chemical stability.








Abstract
The development of open&#8208;shell organic molecules that magnetically order at room temperature,which can be practically applied, remains a grand challenge in chemistry, physics, and materials science. Despite the exploration of vast chemical space, design paradigms for organic paramagnetic centers generally result in unpaired electron spins that are unstable or isotropic. Here, a high&#8208;spin conjugated polymer is demonstrated, which is composed of alternating cyclopentadithiophene and benzo[1,2&#8208;c;4,5&#8208;c&#8242;]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole heterocycles, in which macromolecular structure and topology coalesce to promote the spin center generation and intermolecular exchange coupling. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is consistent with spatially localized spins, while magnetic susceptibility measurements show clear anisotropic spin ordering and exchange interactions that persist at room temperature. The application of long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;correlations for spin center generation promotes remarkable stability. This work offers a fundamentally new approach to the implementation of this long&#8208;sought&#8208;after physical phenomenon within organic materials and the integration of manifold properties within emerging technologies.

         <title>Multiphase Morphology with Enhanced Carrier Lifetime via Quaternary Strategy Enables High&#8208;Efficiency, Thick&#8208;Film, and Large&#8208;Area Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quaternary strategy is used to achieve desirable carrier behaviors and optimized multiphase morphology; thus, the device shows an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.32% (certified 19.35%). Furthermore, the device with &#8776;300&#160;nm&#8208;thick film shows a high efficiency of 17.55%, and the large&#8208;area devices (1.05 and 72.25 cm2) deliver encouraging PCEs of 18.25% and 12.20%, which are among the highest values reported so far.








Abstract
With the continuous breakthrough of the efficiency of&#160;organic photovoltaics (OPVs), their practical applications are on the agenda. However, the thickness tolerance and upscaling in recently reported high&#8208;efficiency devices remains challenging. In this work, the multiphase morphology and desired carrier behaviors are realized by utilizing a quaternary strategy. Notably, the exciton separation, carrier mobility, and carrier lifetime are enhanced significantly, the carrier recombination and the energy loss (Eloss) are reduced, thus beneficial for a higher short&#8208;circuit density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of the quaternary system. Moreover, the intermixing&#8208;phase size is optimized, which is favorable for constructing the thick&#8208;film and large&#8208;area devices. Finally, the device with a 110&#160;nm&#8208;thick active layer shows an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.32% (certified 19.35%). Furthermore, the large&#8208;area (1.05 and 72.25 cm2) devices with 110&#160;nm thickness present PCEs of 18.25% and 12.20%, and the device with a 305&#160;nm&#8208;thick film (0.0473 cm2) delivers a PCE of 17.55%, which are among the highest values reported. The work demonstrates the potential of the quaternary strategy for large&#8208;area and thick&#8208;film OPVs and promotes the practical application of OPVs in the future.

         <title>Bimetallic Rechargeable Al/Zn Hybrid Aqueous Batteries Based on Al&#8211;Zn Alloys with Composite Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 5&#160;m Al(OTF)3&#160;+ 1&#160;m HOTF + 1&#160;m Zn(OTF)2 mixed electrolyte is designed in Al/Zn&#8211;MnO batteries. During charging&#8208;discharging, a topological transformation of MnO at the cathode avoids the collapse of the structure, the Al&#8211;Zn regional alloy at the anode avoids the corrosion of metal aluminum, and the intercalation of Zn ions makes it exhibit good electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Aluminum is abundant and exhibits a high theoretical capacity and volumetric energy density. Additionally, the high safety of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries makes them strong candidates for large&#8208;scale energystorage systems. However, the frequent collapse of the cathode material and passive oxide film results in the difficult development of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries. This work provides a novel battery system, namely, Al&#8211;Zn/Al(OTF)3+HOTF+Zn(OTF)2/AlxZnyMnO2&#183;nH2O, with a mixed electrolyte. The cathode applies MnO topology transformation to ensure that the cathode forms AlxMnO2&#183;nH2O. Topology transformation alters the structure of the cathode material so that Zn2+ can be intercalated into the AlxMnO2&#183;nH2O spinel structure to provide support for the material structure. Regarding the anode, Zn2+ in the electrolyte is deposited onto Al of the anode to produce a regional Al&#8211;Zn alloy. Zn2+ is reduced to Zn metal during discharging, which adds a platform for secondary discharge beneficial for battery capacity enhancement. This system can provide a 1.6&#160;V discharge platform, while the first cycle discharge can reach 554 mAh&#160;g&#8208;1, thereby maintaining a high capacity of 313 mAh&#160;g&#8208;1 after 100 cycles. This study provides a new idea for the further development of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AAIBs).

         <title>Ferritin&#8208;hijacking Nanoparticles Spatiotemporally Directing Endogenous Ferroptosis for Synergistic Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Existing ferroptosis as an iron&#8208;dependent form of regulated cell death primarily relies on importing exogenous iron. However, the excessive employment of toxic materials may cause potential adverse effects on human health. Herein, we fabricated a ferritin&#8208;hijacking nanoparticle (Ce6&#8208;PEG&#8208;HKN15) by conjugating the ferritin&#8208;homing peptide HKN15 with the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) for endogenous ferroptosis without introducing Fenton&#8208;reactive metals. Once internalized, the designed Ce6&#8208;PEG&#8208;HKN15 NPs could specifically accumulate around ferritin. With laser irradiation, the activated Ce6 in nanoparticles potently generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) surrounding ferritin. Abundant ROS not only help to destroy the iron storage protein and activate endogenous ferroptosis but also directly kill tumor cells. In turn, the released iron partially interacted with intracellular excess H2O2 to produce O2, thereby enhancing photodynamic therapy (PDT) and further amplifying oxidative stress. Overall, this work highlights the possibility of endogenous ferroptosis via spatiotemporally destroying ferritin, offering a paradigm for synergistic ferroptosis&#8208;photodynamic antitumor therapy.

         <title>Scalable Ultrathin All&#8208;Organic Polymer Dielectric Films for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>

Abstract
The miniaturization of electronic devices and power systems for capacitive energy storage under harsh environments including elevated temperatures requires scalable high&#8208;quality ultrathin high&#8208;temperature dielectric films. To the end, ultrasonic spraying coating (USC) can be used to fabricate high&#8208;quality ultrathin films. Novel commercial polyimides with a dipolar group &#8208;CF3 (F&#8208;PI) and all&#8208;organic composites with trace organic semiconductor can serve as models. These scalable high&#8208;quality ultrathin dielectric films (&#8764;2.6&#160;&#956;m and &#8764;5.2&#160;&#956;m) were successfully fabricated via USC. The high quality of the films was evaluated from the micromillimeter scale to the submillimeter and above. The high Tg (&#8764;340&#176;C) and concurrent large bandgap Eg (&#8764;3.53&#160;eV) induced by weak conjugating from considerable interchain distance (&#8764;6.2 &#197;) enables F&#8208;PI to be an excellent matrix delivering a discharge energy density with 90% discharge efficiency U&#951;90 of up to 2.85 J/cm3 at 200&#176;C. This is 11.4 times higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial dielectric polymers. Further, the incorporation of trace organic semiconductor leads to a record U&#951;90 of &#8764;4.39 J/cm3 at 200&#176;C due to the markedly enhanced breakdown strength caused by deep charge traps at an energy of &#8764;2&#160;eV. Also, a USC&#8208;fabricated multilayer F&#8208;PI foil capacitor with &#8764;85&#160;nF (six layers) had good performance at elevated temperature (150&#176;C). These results confirm that USC is an excellent technology to fabricate high&#8208;quality ultrathin dielectric films and capacitors with huge potential in industrial applications.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Engineered Nanozyme for Targeted NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>

Abstract
Multienzyme&#8208;mimic redox nanozymes, curated by defect engineering, in synergy with immunotherapy offer promising prospects for safe and efficient cancer therapy. However, the spatiotemporally precise immune response often gets challenged by off&#8208;target adverse effects and insufficient therapeutic response. We herein report a tumor cell membrane&#8208;coated redox nanozyme (CMO&#8208;R@4T1) for combinational second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal immunotherapy. CMO&#8208;R@4T1 consists of a Cu&#8208;doped MoOx (CMO) nanozyme as the core, which is cloaked with tumor cell derived fused membranes with immunostimulants immobilized in the membrane shell. In addition to the enhanced tumor accumulation, the nanozyme can cause oxidative damage to tumor cells by the production of reactive oxygen species and attenuation of the antioxidant mechanism. CMO&#8208;R@4T1 also mediates a photothermal effect under NIR&#8208;II photoirradiation to trigger tumor eradication and immunogenic cell death, where the liberated agonist elicits the immune activation. Such controlled therapeutic paradigm potentiates systemic primary tumor ablation, inhibits cancer metastasis to distant tumor, and procures long&#8208;term immunological memory. Thereby, this study takes advantage of defect engineering to illustrate a generic strategy to prepare cell membrane camouflaged nanozymes for targeted photo&#8208;immunotherapy of cancer.

         <title>Quantification of the electromechanical measurements by piezoresponse force microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) is a&#160;powerful non&#8208;destructive technique that has become one of the most widely used methods for characterization and exploration of the nanoscale properties in electromechanically active materials, primarily ferroelectrics. However, quantification of the PFM signal has been challenging due to the convolution of various extrinsic and intrinsic contributions with the genuine piezoelectric response of the sample. Although the quantification of the PFM amplitude signal has received considerable attention, the quantification of the PFM phase signal has not received much attention so far. A properly calibrated PFM phase signal can provide valuable information on the sign of the local piezoelectric coefficient &#8211; an important and non&#8208;trivial issue for emerging ferroelectric materials. In this work, we discuss two complementary methodologies to calibrate the PFM phase signal. The first approach is based on using a standard reference sample with well&#8208;known independently measured piezoelectric coefficients, while the second approach detects the electrostatic interactions between a sample and a cantilever to determine the parasitic phase offset. Application of these methodologies to the studies of the piezoelectric behavior in ferroelectric HfO2&#8208;based thin film capacitors revealed intriguing variations in the sign of the longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient, d33,eff. It has been shown that the piezoelectric properties of the HfO2&#8208;based capacitors are inherently sensitive to their thickness, electrodes as well as deposition methods and can exhibit wide variations including a d33,eff sign change within a single device.

         <title>Activating Organic Phosphorescence via Heavy Metal&#8208;&#960;&#8208;interaction Induced Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;containing clusters, nanocrystals, and other semiconductors can sensitize the triplet states of their surface&#8208;bonded chromophores, but the energy loss such as nonradiative deactivation often prevents the synergistic light emission in their solid&#8208;state co&#8208;assemblies. Cocrystallization allows new combinations of molecules with complementary properties for achieving functionalities not available in single components. Here we report on the cocrystal formation that employs platinum(II) acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)2) as a triplet sensitizer and electron&#8208;deficient 1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalene&#160;diimides (NDIs) as organic phosphors. The hybrid cocrystals exhibit room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence confined in the low&#8208;lying, long&#8208;lived triplet state of NDIs with photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (&#934;PL) exceeding 25% and a phosphorescence lifetime (&#964;Ph) of 156 &#956;s. This remarkable PL property benefits from the non&#8208;covalent electronic and spin&#8208;orbital coupling between the constituents.

         <title>Bioinspired Retinomorphic Device for Spontaneous Chromatic Adaptation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chromatic adaptation refers to the sensing and preprocessing of the spectral composition of incident light on the retina, and it is important for color image recognition. It is challenging to apply sensing, memory, and processing functions to color images via the same physical process using the complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor technology because of redundant data detection, complicated signal conversion processes, and requirement for additional memory modules. Inspired by the highly efficient chromatic adaptation of the human retina, we present a two&#8208;dimensional O2&#8208;mediated platinum diselenide (PtSe2) device to simultaneously apply sensing, memory, and processing functions to color images. The device exhibits a wavelength&#8208;dependent bipolar photoresponse and the linear pulse&#8208;number dependence of photoconductivity, which is dominated by the photon&#8208;mediated physical adsorption and desorption of O2 molecules on bilayer PtSe2. The proposed retinomorphic device shows superior image classification accuracy (over 90%) compared to an independent pseudocolor channel (less than 75%). Hence, it is promising for developing artificial vision perception systems with reduced architectural complexity.

         <title>Wide Bandgap Halide Perovskites&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Powered Blue Photodetector with 84.9% of External Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We report a self&#8208;powered, color filter&#8208;free blue photodetector (PD) based on halide perovskites. A high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 84.9%, which is the highest reported EQE in blue PDs, is achieved by engineering the A&#8208;site monovalent cations of wide bandgap perovskites. The optimized composition of formamidinium (FA)/methylammonium (MA) increases the heat of formation, yielding a uniform and smooth film. The incorporation of Cs+ ions into the FA/MA composition suppresses the trap density and increased charge carrier mobility, yielding the highest average EQE of 77.4%, responsivity of 0.280 A W&#8722;1, and detectivity of 5.08 &#215;&#8197;1012 Jones under blue light. Furthermore, Cs+ improves durability under repetitive operations and ambient atmosphere. The proposed device exhibits peak responsivity of 0.307 A W&#8722;1, which is higher than that of the commercial InGaN&#8208;based blue PD (0.289 A W&#8722;1). This study will promote the development of next&#8208;generation image sensors with vertically stacked perovskite PDs.

&lt;p&gt;We report a self-powered, color filter-free blue photodetector (PD) based on halide perovskites. A high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 84.9%, which is the highest reported EQE in blue PDs, is achieved by engineering the A-site monovalent cations of wide bandgap perovskites. The optimized composition of formamidinium (FA)/methylammonium (MA) increases the heat of formation, yielding a uniform and smooth film. The incorporation of Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions into the FA/MA composition suppresses the trap density and increased charge carrier mobility, yielding the highest average EQE of 77.4%, responsivity of 0.280 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and detectivity of 5.08 &#215;&#8197;10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; Jones under blue light.

         <title>Construction of Active Protein Materials: Manipulation on Morphology of Salmon Calcitonin Assemblies with Enhanced Bone Regeneration Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to improve the relatively low stability and fast degradation of protein drugs is proposed. &#8220;Active protein materials&#8221; can be constructed by regulating the self&#8208;assembly property of the protein drug itself via a small&#8208;molecular regulator, that is, the protein drug is not only the active drug, but also the drug carrier, which greatly increases the drug&#8208;loading efficiency of the biomaterial.








Abstract
The effect of protein drugs is always limited by their relatively low stability and fast degradation property; thus, various elegant efforts have been made to improve the bioactivity and biocompatibility of the protein drugs. Here, an alternative way is proposed to solve this problem. By simply adding a limited amount of small&#8208;molecular regulator, which tunes the subtle balance of protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) and disulfide bond formation, the self&#8208;assembly property of the protein drug can be regulated, forming an &#8220;active protein material&#8221; itself. This means that, the resulting biomaterial is dominated by the protein drug and water, with significantly enhanced bone regeneration effect compared to the virgin protein in vitro and in vivo, through multivalent effect between the protein and receptor and the retarded degradation of the assembled proteins. In this active protein material, the protein drug is not only the active drug, but also the drug carrier, which greatly increases the drug&#8208;loading efficiency of the biomaterial, indicating the advantages of the easy preparation, high efficiency, and low cost of the active protein material with a bright future in biomedical applications.

         <title>Recent Progress of Metal Sulfide Photocatalysts for Solar Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging unique properties of metal sulfide photocatalysts, including abundant active sites, light&#8208;harvesting ability, and expedited charge separation, endow them promising candidates for solar light conversion. This review aims to offer a full&#8208;scale lens to discuss the recent advances of metal sulfides photocatalysts, propose their challenges, and envision the prospects of the development of metal sulfides for photocatalytic redox reactions.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthetic solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical cycles enable an entire environment to operate in a more complex, yet effective, way to perform natural photosynthesis. However, such artificial systems suffer from a lack of well&#8208;established photocatalysts with the ability to harvest the solar spectrum and rich catalytic active&#8208;site density. Benefiting from extensive experimental and theoretical investigations, this bottleneck may be overcome by devising a photocatalytic platform based on metal sulfides with predominant electronic, physical, and chemical properties. These tunable properties can endow them with abundant active sites, favorable light utilization, and expedited charge transportation for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. Here, it is described how some vital lessons extracted from previous investigations are employed to promote the further development of metal sulfides for artificial photosynthesis, including water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 reduction, and pollutant removal. Their functions, properties, synthetic strategies, emerging issues, design principles, and intrinsic functional mechanisms for photocatalytic redox reactions are discussed in detail. Finally, the associated challenges and prospects for the utilization of metal sulfides are highlighted and future development trends in photocatalysis are envisioned.

         <title>Optical Signal Modulation in Photonic Waveguiding Heteroarchitectures with Continuously Variable Visible&#8208;To&#8208;Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Color</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An input&#8208;to&#8208;output photonic logic gate is fabricated based on supramolecular heterostructures by phosphorescent Pt, Pd, Au, and Cu organometallic complexes. It is based on the optical waveguiding effect and efficient energy transfer among different blocks. The photonic logic gates show high emission anisotropy, low optical waveguiding loss, and continuously varied emission colors in the visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared spectral region.








Abstract
Photonic circuit systems based on optical waveguiding heteroarchitectures have attracted considerable interest owing to their potential to overcome the speed limitation in electronic circuits by modulating the optical signal at the micro&#8208; or nanoscale. However, controlling the parameters, including the wavelength and polarization of the light outcoupling, as well as the sequence among different building blocks, remains a key issue. Herein, supramolecular heteroarchitectures made by phosphorescent organometallic complexes of Pt, Pd, Cu, and Au are applied as photonic logic gates that show continuously variable emission colors from 475 to 810&#160;nm, low waveguide losses down to 0.0077&#160;dB&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1, and remarkable excitation&#8208;light polarization&#8208;dependent photoluminescence with anisotropy ratios up to 0.68. The sequences among Pt, Pd, Au, and Cu building blocks in the heteroarchitectures are controlled by living supramolecular polymerization or crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly synthetic approaches. The results indicate the prospects for using organometallic complexes and supramolecular synthetic approaches to prepare photonic circuit systems with tunable emission color and controllable sequences among different blocks that achieve modulation of the optical signal in the visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared spectral region.

         <title>Filamented Light (FLight) Biofabrication of Highly Aligned Tissue&#8208;Engineered Constructs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Filamented Light (FLight) biofabrication is a new technology for the rapid biofabrication of highly aligned tissue&#8208;engineered constructs, like muscle and tendon. The filamentation of a light beam into a cell&#8208;laden photoresin results in a material composed of micrometer&#8208;scale hydrogel filaments acting as cell guiding cues. Cell migration into ultrahigh aspect ratio (&gt;700:1) voids induces alignment of cells and deposition of extracellular matrix.








Abstract
Cell&#8208;laden hydrogels used in tissue engineering generally lack sufficient 3D&#160;topographical guidance for cells to mature into aligned tissues. A new strategy called filamented light (FLight) biofabrication rapidly creates hydrogels composed of unidirectional microfilament networks, with diameters on the length scale of single cells. Due to optical modulation instability, a light beam is divided optically into FLight beams. Local polymerization of a photoactive resin is triggered, leading to local increase in refractive index, which itself creates self&#8208;focusing waveguides and further polymerization of photoresin into long hydrogel microfilaments. Diameter and spacing of the microfilaments can be tuned from 2 to 30&#160;&#181;m by changing the coherence length of the light beam. Microfilaments show outstanding cell instructive properties with fibroblasts, tenocytes, endothelial cells, and myoblasts, influencing cell alignment, nuclear deformation, and extracellular matrix deposition. FLight is compatible with multiple types of photoresins and allows for biofabrication of centimeter&#8208;scale hydrogel constructs with excellent cell viability within seconds (&lt;10 s per construct). Multidirectional microfilaments are achievable within a single hydrogel construct by changing the direction of FLight projection, and complex multimaterial/multicellular tissue&#8208;engineered constructs are possible by sequentially exchanging the cell&#8208;laden photoresin. FLight offers a transformational approach to developing anisotropic tissues using photo&#8208;crosslinkable biomaterials.

Abstract
Optical microcavity&#8208;enhanced light&#8208;matter interaction offers a powerful tool to develop fast and precise sensing techniques, spurring applications in the detection of biochemical targets ranging from cells, nanoparticles and large molecules. However, the intrinsic inertness of such pristine microresonators limits their spread in new fields such as gas detection. Here, we realize a functionalized microlaser sensor by depositing graphene in an erbium doped over&#8208;modal microsphere. By using a 980&#160;nm pump, multiple laser lines excited in different mode families of the microresonator are co&#8208;generated in one single device. The interference between these splitting mode lasers produce beat notes in the electrical domain (0.2&#8764;1.1&#160;MHz) with sub kHz accuracy, thanks to the graphene&#8208;induced intracavity backward scattering. This allows for lab&#8208;free multispecies gas identification from a mixture, and ultrasensitive gas detection down to individual molecule.

However, the intrinsic inertness of such pristine microresonators limits their spread in new fields such as gas detection. Here, we realize a functionalized microlaser sensor by depositing graphene in an erbium doped over-modal microsphere. By using a 980&#160;nm pump, multiple laser lines excited in different mode families of the microresonator are co-generated in one single device.

         <title>Tolerogenic nanovaccine for prevention and treatment of autoimmune encephalomyelitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We herein developed a tolerogenic nanovaccine and tested it an animal model of multiple sclerosis. The nanovaccine was constructed to deliver the self&#8208;antigen, MOG peptide, and dexamethasone on an abatacept&#8208;modified polydopamine core nanoparticle (AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG). AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG could target dendritic cells and undergo endocytosis followed by trafficking to lysosomes. AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG blocked the interaction between CD80/CD86 and CD28 in antigen&#8208;presenting cells and T cells, leading to decreased interferon gamma secretion. The subcutaneous administration of AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG to mice yielded significant biodistribution to lymph nodes and, in experimental&#8208;autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model mice, increased the integrity of the myelin basic sheath and minimized the infiltration of immune cells. EAE mice were treated with AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG before or after injection of the autoantigen, MOG. Pre&#8208;immunization of AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG before the injection of MOG completely blocked the development of clinical symptoms. Early treatment with AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG at 3 days after injection of MOG also completely blocked the induction of symptoms. Notably, treatment of EAE symptom&#8208;developed mice with AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG significantly alleviated the symptoms, indicating that the nanovaccine had therapeutic effects. Although we used AbaLDPN for MOG peptide delivery in the EAE model, the concept of AbaLDPN can be widely applied for the prevention and alleviation of other autoimmune diseases.

         <title>The Use of Exchange Coupled Atom Qubits as Atomic&#8208;Scale Magnetic Field Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Phosphorus atoms in silicon offer a rich quantum computing platform where both nuclear and electron spins can be used to store and process quantum information. While individual control of electron and nuclear spins has been demonstrated, the interplay between them during qubit operations has been largely unexplored. This study investigates the use of exchange&#8208;based operation between donor bound electron spins to probe the local magnetic fields experienced by the qubits with exquisite precision at the atomic scale. To achieve this, coherent exchange oscillations are performed between two electron spin qubits, where the left and right qubits are hosted by three and two phosphorus donors, respectively. The frequency spectrum of exchange oscillations shows quantised changes in the local magnetic fields at the qubit sites, corresponding to the different hyperfine coupling between the electron and each of the qubit&#8208;hosting nuclear spins. This ability to sense the hyperfine fields of individual nuclear spins using the exchange interaction constitutes a unique metrology technique, which reveals the exact crystallographic arrangements of the phosphorus atoms in the silicon crystal for each qubit. The detailed knowledge obtained of the local magnetic environment can then be used to engineer hyperfine fields in multi&#8208;donor qubits for high&#8208;fidelity two&#8208;qubit&#160;gates.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;assisted Cobalt&#8208;ditelluride Polyhedra Inducing Lattice Strain to Endow Efficient Adsorption&#8208;catalysis for High&#8208;energy Lithium&#8208;sulfur Batteries</title>

Abstract
Developing a conductive catalyst with high catalytic activity is considered to be an effective strategy for improving cathode kinetics of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, especially at large current density and lean electrolytes. Lattice strain engineering has been a strategy to tune the local structure of catalysts and to help understand the structure&#8208;activity relationship between strain and catalyst performance. Here, Co0.9Zn0.1Te2@NC has been constructed after Zinc atoms uniformly doped into the CoTe2 lattice. The experimental/theoretical results indicate that change of the coordination environment for the Cobalt atom by the lattice strain modulates the d&#8208;band center with more electrons occupied in antibonding orbitals, thus balancing the adsorption of polysulfides and the intrinsic catalytic effect, thereby activating the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. Benefiting from the merits, with only 4 wt% dosages of catalyst in the cathode, an initial discharge capacity of 1030 mAh g&#8722;1 could be achieved at 1 C and stable cycling performances are achieved for 1500/2500 cycles at 1 C/2 C. Upon sulfur loading of 7.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the areal capacity can reach 12.8 mAh cm&#8722;2. This work provides a guiding methodology for the design of catalytic materials and refinement of adsorption&#8208;catalysis strategies for the rational design of cathode in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Polymeric Single Ion Conductors with Enhanced Side Chains Motion for High&#8208;performance Solid Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Zn&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have enormous potential in realizing high&#8208;performance and safe zinc ion batteries. Polymeric single ion conductor (PSIC)&#8208;based SPEs can largely eradicate anion migration and side reactions of electrodes with decreased polarization, but the ionic conductivity of common PSICs is still unsatisfactory due to the tight localized ion interactions and sluggish polymer chain motion. Herein, by employing the heterocyclic tetrazole as the anionic center of the side chain, a novel PSIC was fabricated with optimized charge delocalization and enhanced side&#8208;chain motion, which was confirmed by the molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The as&#8208;prepared PSIC delivers an ionic conductivity up to 5.4 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 with an ultrahigh Zn2+ transference number of 0.94. Based on the PSIC, dendrite&#8208;free and hydrogen&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping cycling (2000&#160;h) was achieved with low polarization potentials. A further assembled Zn&#8214;V2O5 battery exhibits superior performances to other solid ZIBs, including a high discharge capacity (196 mAh g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability (64 mAh g&#8722;1 even at 6 C), and long cycling life (capacity retention 88.5% after 10000 cycles). In addition, a remarkable shelf&#8208;life (90 days), low self&#8208;discharge rate (capacity loss &#8764;0.18% per day), and good temperature adaptability of the solid battery can be achieved benefiting from the high stability of the SPE during operation. The PSIC&#8208;based SPEs with advanced ion transport structure endow solid ZIBs with significant performance improvement, high safety, and durability.

         <title>Transfer&#8208;Free Quasi&#8208;Suspended Graphene Grown on a Si Wafer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The direct growth of graphene affording wafer&#8208;scale uniformity on insulators is paramount to electronic and optoelectronic applications; however, it remains a challenge to date, because it entails an entirely different growth mode than that over metals. Herein, we demonstrate the metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free growth of quasi&#8208;suspended graphene on a Si wafer using an interface&#8208;decoupling chemical vapor deposition strategy. The employment of lower&#8208;than&#8208;conventional H2 dosage and concurrent introduction of methanol during growth can effectively weaken the interaction between the synthesized graphene and the underlying substrate. The growth mode can be thus fine&#8208;tuned, producing a predominantly monolayer graphene film with wafer&#8208;level homogeneity. Graphene thus grown on a 4&#8208;inch Si wafer enables the transfer&#8208;free fabrication of high&#8208;performance graphene&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor arrays that exhibit almost no shift in the charge neutral point, indicating a quasi&#8208;suspended feature of the graphene. Moreover, a carrier mobility up to 15000 cm2 V&#8210;1 s&#8210;1 can be attained. This study is anticipated to offer meaningful insights into the synthesis of wafer&#8208;scale high&#8208;quality graphene on dielectrics for practical graphene devices.

&lt;p&gt;The direct growth of graphene affording wafer-scale uniformity on insulators is paramount to electronic and optoelectronic applications; however, it remains a challenge to date, because it entails an entirely different growth mode than that over metals. Herein, we demonstrate the metal-catalyst-free growth of quasi-suspended graphene on a Si wafer using an interface-decoupling chemical vapor deposition strategy. The employment of lower-than-conventional H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dosage and concurrent introduction of methanol during growth can effectively weaken the interaction between the synthesized graphene and the underlying substrate. The growth mode can be thus fine-tuned, producing a predominantly monolayer graphene film with wafer-level homogeneity. Graphene thus grown on a 4-inch Si wafer enables the transfer-free fabrication of high-performance graphene-based field-effect transistor arrays that exhibit almost no shift in the charge neutral point, indicating a quasi-suspended feature of the graphene.

         <title>Stable Tetradentate Gold(III)&#8208;TADF Emitters with Close to Unity Quantum Yield and Radiative Decay Rate Constant of up to 2&#160;&#215; 106 s&#8722;1: High&#8208;Efficiency Green OLEDs with Operational Lifetime (LT90) Longer than 1800 hours at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2</title>

Abstract
High maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE), small efficiency roll&#8208;offs, and long operational lifetime at practical luminances are three crucial parameters for commercialization of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). To simultaneously achieve these goals, it is desirable to have the radiative decay rate constant (kr) as large as possible, which, for a thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitter, requires both a large S1&#8594;S0 radiative decay rate constant (krS) and a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST). Here, we report the design of a class of tetradentate gold(III) TADF complexes for narrowing the &#916;EST while keeping the krS large. The as&#8208;synthesized complexes display green emission with close to unity emission quantum yields and kr approaching 2&#160;&#215; 106 s&#8722;1 in thin films. The vacuum&#8208;deposited green OLEDs based on 1 and 4 demonstrate maximum EQEs of up to 24 and 27% with efficiency roll&#8208;offs of 5.5 and 2.2% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, respectively; the EQEs maintain high at 10,000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 (19% (1) and 24% (4)). A long LT90 device lifetime of 1820&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for complex 1 has been achieved, which is one of the longest device lifetimes of TADF&#8208;OLEDs reported in the literature.

         <title>Activating C&#8722;H Bond by Tuning Fe Site and Interfacial Effect for Enhanced Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The interaction mechanism between the reacting species and the active site of &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3&#8208;based photoanodes in photoelectrochemical methanol conversion reaction is still ambiguous. Herein, we demonstrate a simple two&#8208;step strategy to fabricate a porous &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/CoFe2O4 heterojunction for the methanol conversion reaction. The influence of the electronic structure of active site and interfacial effect on the reaction have been investigated by constructing two different FeO6 octahedral configurations and heterogeneous structures. The optimal sample ZnFeCo&#8208;2 affords high photocurrent density of 1.17 mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.5 V versus Ag/AgCl, which is 3.2 times than that of pure ZnFe (0.37 mA cm&#8722;2). Meanwhile, the ZnFeCo&#8208;2 also exhibits 97.8% Faraday efficiency of CH3OH to HCHO, and long&#8208;term stability over 40 h. Furthermore, Density functional theory calculations reveal that the heterostructured &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/CoFe2O4 with favorable electron transfer effectively lowers methanol adsorption, C&#8722;H bond activation and HCHO desorption energy relative to the pristine &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3, resulting in the excellent methanol conversion efficiency.

         <title>Coexistence of Urbach&#8208;Tail&#8208;Like Localized States and Metallic Conduction Channels in Nitrogen&#8208;Doped 3D Curved Graphene</title>

Abstract
Nitrogen (N) doping is one of the most effective approaches to tailor the chemical and physical properties of graphene. By the interplay between N dopants and three&#8208;dimensional curvature of graphene lattices, N&#8208;doped 3D graphene displays superior performances in electrocatalysis and solar energy harvesting for energy and environmental applications. However, the electrical transport properties and the electronic states, which are the key factors to understand the origins of the N doping effect in 3D graphene, are still missing. We systematically investigated the electronic properties of N&#8208;doped 3D graphene by an electric double&#8208;layer transistor method. We demonstrated that Urbach&#8208;tail&#8208;like localized states occupy around the neutral point of N&#8208;doped 3D graphene with the background metallic transport channels. The dual nature of electronic states, generated by the synergistic effect of N dopants and 3D curvature of graphene, could be the electronic origin of the high electrocatalysis, enhanced molecular adsorption and light absorption of N&#8208;doped 3D graphene.

         <title>Polarization Topology at the Nominally Charged Domain Walls in Uniaxial Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polarization domains in uniaxial ferroelectrics acquire a remarkable topological configuration of branching and crisscrossing domains. The domains are separated by the united domain wall spreading all over the sample and containing saddle&#8208;like singular nodes.








Abstract
Ferroelectric domain walls provide a fertile environment for novel materials physics. If a polarization discontinuity arises, it can drive a redistribution of electronic carriers and changes in band structure, which often result in emergent 2D conductivity. If such a discontinuity is not tolerated, then its amelioration usually involves the formation of complex topological patterns, such as flux&#8208;closure domains, dipolar vortices, skyrmions, merons, or Hopfions. The degrees of freedom required for the development of such patterns, in which dipolar rotation is a hallmark, are readily found in multiaxial ferroelectrics. In uniaxial ferroelectrics, where only two opposite polar orientations are possible, it has been assumed that discontinuities are unavoidable when antiparallel components of polarization meet. This perception has been borne out by the appearance of charged conducting domain walls in systems such as hexagonal manganites and lithium niobate. Here, experimental and theoretical investigations on lead germanate (Pb5Ge3O11) reveal that polar discontinuities can be obviated at head&#8208;to&#8208;head and tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail domain walls by mutual domain bifurcation along two different axes, creating a characteristic saddle&#8208;point domain wall morphology and associated novel dipolar topology, removing the need for screening charge accumulation and associated conductivity enhancement.

&#8220;Label&#8208;free sINgle&#8208;cell tracKing of 2D matErials by mass cytometry and MIBI&#8208;TOF Design&#8221; (LINKED) is a multiplexed label&#8208;free single&#8208;cell detection strategy enabling nanomaterial tracking and simultaneous measurement of multiple cell and tissue features. MXenes are designed to be detected within the mass cytometry range. Their detection and quantification are demonstrated in 15 human immune cell subpopulations and in different organs.








Abstract
There is a critical unmet need to detect and image 2D&#160;materials within single cells and tissues while surveying a high degree of information from single cells. Here, a versatile multiplexed label&#8208;free single&#8208;cell detection strategy is proposed based on single&#8208;cell mass cytometry by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (CyTOF) and ion&#8208;beam imaging by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (MIBI&#8208;TOF). This strategy, &#8220;Label&#8208;free sINgle&#8208;cell tracKing of 2D matErials by mass cytometry and MIBI&#8208;TOF Design&#8221; (LINKED), enables nanomaterial detection and simultaneous measurement of multiple cell and tissue features. As a proof of concept, a set of 2D materials, transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes), is selected to ensure mass detection within the cytometry range while avoiding overlap with more than 70 currently available tags, each able to survey multiple biological parameters. First, their detection and quantification in 15 primary human immune cell subpopulations are demonstrated. Together with the detection, mass cytometry is used to capture several biological aspects of MXenes, such as their biocompatibility and cytokine production after their uptake. Through enzymatic labeling, MXenes&#8217; mediation of cell&#8211;cell interactions is simultaneously evaluated. In vivo biodistribution experiments using a mixture of MXenes in mice confirm the versatility of the detection strategy and reveal MXene accumulation in the liver, blood, spleen, lungs, and relative immune cell subtypes. Finally, MIBI&#8208;TOF is applied to detect MXenes in different organs revealing their spatial distribution. The label&#8208;free detection of 2D materials by mass cytometry at the single&#8208;cell level, on multiple cell subpopulations and in multiple organs simultaneously, will enable exciting new opportunities in biomedicine.

         <title>Diffusive Memristors with Uniform and Tunable Relaxation Time for Spike Generation in Event&#8208;Based Pattern Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diffusive memristors with highly uniform and widely tunable relaxation time are demonstrated. The dynamic relaxation behavior of such diffusive memristors is used as exponential decay kernels to implement the hierarchy of time surfaces (HOTS) algorithm for high&#8208;accuracy event&#8208;based pattern recognition.








Abstract
A diffusive memristor is a promising building block for brain&#8208;inspired computing hardware. However, the randomness in the device relaxation dynamics limits the wide&#8208;range adoption of diffusive memristors in large arrays. In this work, the device stack is engineered to achieve a much&#8208;improved uniformity in the relaxation time (standard deviation &#963; reduced from &#8776;12 to &#8776;0.32&#160;ms). The memristor is further connected with a resistor or a capacitor and the relaxation time is tuned between 1.13 &#181;s and 1.25&#160;ms, ranging from three orders of magnitude. The hierarchy of time surfaces (HOTS) algorithm, to utilize the tunable and uniform relaxation behavior for spike generation, is implemented. An accuracy of 77.3% is achieved in recognizing moving objects in the neuromorphic MNIST (N&#8208;MNIST) dataset. The work paves the way for building emerging neuromorphic computing hardware systems with ultralow power consumption.

         <title>Modulating Hydrogen Adsorption via Charge Transfer at Semiconductor&#8208;Metal Heterointerface for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Designing and synthesizing highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is important for realizing hydrogen economy. Tuning the electronic structure of the electrocatalysts is essential to achieve optimal HER activity, and interfacial engineering is an effective strategy to induce electron transfer in a heterostructure interface to optimize HER kinetics. In this study, we synthesized ultrafine RhP2/Rh nanoparticles with a well&#8208;defined semiconductor&#8208;metal heterointerface embedded in N,P co&#8208;doped graphene (RhP2/Rh@NPG) via a one&#8208;step pyrolysis. RhP2/Rh@NPG exhibited outstanding HER performances under all pH conditions. Electrochemical characterization and first principles density functional theory calculations revealed that the RhP2/Rh heterointerface induced electron transfer from metallic Rh to semiconductive RhP2, which increased the electron density on the Rh atoms in RhP2 and weakened the hydrogen adsorption on RhP2, thereby accelerating HER kinetics. Moreover, the interfacial electron transfer activated the dual&#8208;site synergistic effect of Rh and P of RhP2 in neutral and alkaline environments, thereby promoting reorganization of interfacial water molecules for faster HER kinetics.

         <title>From Heterostructures to Solid&#8208;Solutions: Structural Tunability in Mixed Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The stability, reliability, and performance of halide perovskite&#8208;based devices depend upon the structure, composition, and particle size of the device&#8208;enabling materials. Indeed, the degree of ion mixing in multicomponent perovskite crystals, although challenging to control, is a key factor in determining properties. Herein, an emerging method termed evaporation&#8208;crystallization polymer pen lithography (EC&#8208;PPL) is used to synthesize and systematically study the degree of ionic mixing of Cs0.5FA0.5PbX3 (FA = formamidinium; X = halide anion, ABX3) crystals, as a function of size, temperature, and composition. These experiments have led to the discovery of a heterostructure morphology where the A&#8208;site cations, Cs and FA, are segregated into the core and edge layers, respectively. Simulation and experimental results indicate that the heterostructures form as a consequence of a combination of both differences in solubility of the two ions in solution and the enthalpic preference for Cs&#8208;FA ion segregation. This preference for segregation can be overcome to form a solid&#8208;solution by decreasing crystal size (&lt; 60&#160;nm) or increasing temperature. Finally, we utilized these tools to identify and synthesize solid&#8208;solution nanocrystals of Cs0.5FA0.5Pb(Br/I)3 that significantly suppress photo&#8208;induced anion migration compared to their bulk counterparts, offering a route to deliberately designed photostable optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Ethylene&#8208;Carbonate&#8208;Free Electrolytes for Rechargeable Li&#8208;Ion Pouch Cells at Sub&#8208;Freezing Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of ethylene carbonate (EC)&#8208;free electrolytes, based on methyl acetate and fluorinated ethers, is proposed for Li&#8208;ion batteries operating at sub&#8208;freezing temperatures. The EC&#8208;free electrolyte demonstrates all&#8208;round performance advantages over the traditional EC&#8208;based electrolyte and presents a viable solution to improve the capacity retention and rechargeability of metal&#8208;ion batteries in cold climates.








Abstract
Sub&#8208;freezing temperature presents a significant challenge to the survival of current Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) as it leads to low capacity retention and poor cell rechargeability. The electrolyte in commercial LIBs relies too heavily on ethylene carbonate (EC) to produce a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite (Gr) anodes, but its high melting point (36.4&#160;&#176;C) severely restricts ion transport below 0&#160;&#176;C, causing energy loss and Li plating. Here, a class of EC&#8208;free electrolytes that exhibits remarkable low&#8208;temperature performance without compromising cell lifespan is reported. It is found that at sub&#8208;zero temperatures, EC forms highly resistive SEI that seriously impedes electrode kinetics, whereas EC&#8208;free electrolytes create a highly stable, low&#8208;impedance SEI through anion decomposition, which boosts capacity retention and eliminates Li plating during charging. Pouch&#8208;type LiCoO2 (LCO)|Gr cells with EC&#8208;free electrolytes sustain 900 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C with 1 C charge/discharge, and LiNi0.85Co0.10Al0.05O2 (NCA)|Gr cells last 300 cycles at &#8722;15&#160;&#176;C with 0.3&#160;C charge, both among the best&#8208;performing in the literature under comparable conditions. Even at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C, the NCA|Gr cell with EC&#8208;free electrolytes still delivers 76% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity, outperforming EC&#8208;based electrolytes.

         <title>Continuous Color&#8208;Tunable Light&#8208;Emitting Devices Based on Compositionally Graded Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting diode is realized using compositionally graded monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide alloys. By controlling the light&#8208;emitting positions in the alloys, the composition gradient of the bandgap enables continuous and reversible light emission with energies ranging from 2.1 to 1.7&#160;eV. The results provide a new approach for exploring monolayer&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;alloy&#8208;based broadband optoelectronic device applications.








Abstract
The diverse series of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials has been employed in various optoelectronic applications, such as photodetectors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and lasers. Typically, the detection or emission range of optoelectronic devices is unique to the bandgap of the active material. Therefore, to improve the capability of these devices, extensive efforts have been devoted to tune the bandgap, such as gating, strain, and dielectric engineering. However, the controllability of these methods is severely limited (typically &#8776;0.1&#160;eV). In contrast, alloying TMDCs is an effective approach that yields a composition&#8208;dependent bandgap and enables light emissions over a wide range. In this study, a color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting device using compositionally graded TMDC alloys is fabricated. The monolayer WS2/WSe2 alloy grown by chemical vapor deposition shows a spatial gradient in the light&#8208;emission energy, which varies from 2.1 to 1.7&#160;eV. This alloy is incorporated in an electrolyte&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting device structure that can tune the recombination zone laterally. Thus, a continuous and reversible color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting device is successfully fabricated by controlling the light&#8208;emitting positions. The results provide a new approach for exploring monolayer semiconductor&#8208;based broadband optical applications.

         <title>Modular Nanostructures Facilitate Low Thermal Conductivity and Ultra&#8208;High Thermoelectric Performance in n&#8208;Type SnSe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formation of 2D modular intergrowth [(SnSe)1.05]m(MoSe2)n nanostructures with periodicity of 1.2&#8211;2.6&#160;nm in the bulk SnSe matrix significantly scatters the phonons and reduces the lattice thermal conductivity&#160; drastically to an ultra&#8208;low value of &#8776;0.26&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. Thereby, a record high thermoelectric figure of merit of 2.0 at &#8776;800 K is achieved in n&#8208;type polycrystalline SnSe.








Abstract
Single crystals of SnSe have gained considerable attention in thermoelectrics due to their unprecedented thermoelectric performance. However, polycrystalline SnSe is more favorable for practical applications due to its facile chemical synthesis procedure, processability, and scalability. Though the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of p&#8208;type bulk SnSe polycrystals has reached &gt;2.5, zT of n&#8208;type counterpart is still lower and lies around &#8776;1.5. Herein, record high zT of 2.0 in n&#8208;type polycrystalline SnSe0.92&#160;+ x mol% MoCl5 (x&#160;= 0&#8211;3) samples is reported, when measured parallel to the spark plasma sintering pressing direction due to the simultaneous optimization of n&#8208;type carrier concentration and enhanced phonon scattering by incorporating modular nano&#8208;heterostructures in SnSe matrix. Modular nanostructures of layered intergrowth [(SnSe)1.05]m(MoSe2)n like compounds embedded in SnSe matrix scatters the phonons significantly leading to an ultra&#8208;low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) of &#8776;0.26&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 798 K in SnSe0.92&#160;+ 3 mol% MoCl5. The 2D layered modular intergrowth compound resembles the nano&#8208;heterostructure and their periodicity of 1.2&#8211;2.6&#160;nm in the SnSe matrix matches the phonon mean free path of SnSe, thereby blocking the heat carrying phonons, which result in low &#954;lat and ultra&#8208;high thermoelectric performance in n&#8208;type SnSe.

Abstract
Here, the authors report a highly efficient integrated ideal&#8208;bandgap perovskite/bulk&#8208;heterojunction solar cell (IPBSC) with an inverted architecture, featuring a near infrared (NIR) polymer DTBTI&#8208;based bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) layer atop guanidinium bromide (GABr)&#8208;modified FA0.7MA0.3Pb0.7Sn0.3I3 perovskite film as the photoactive layer. The IPBSC shows cascade&#8208;like energy level alignment between the charge&#8208;extractionlayer/perovskite/BHJ and efficient passivation effect of BHJ on perovskite. Thanks to the well&#8208;matched energy level alignment and high&#8208;quality ideal bandgap&#8208;based perovskite film, an efficient charge transfer occurs between the charge&#8208;extraction&#8208;layer/perovskite/BHJ. Moreover, the NIR polymer DTBTI on the perovskite film leads to an improved NIR light response for the IPBSC. In addition, the O, S and N atoms in the DTBTI polymer yield a strong interaction with perovskite, which is conducive to reducing the defects of the perovskite and suppressing charge recombination. As a result, the solar cell achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.27% (certificated value at 23.4% with 0.283&#8208;volt voltage loss), currently the recorded efficiency for both IPBSCs and Pb&#8208;Sn alloyed PSCs, and which is over the highest efficiency of perovskite&#8211;organic tandem solar cell. Moreover, the thermal, humidity and long&#8208;term operational stabilities of the IPBSCs are also significantly improved compared with the control PSCs.

         <title>Tropocollagen&#8208;Inspired Hierarchical Spiral Structure of Organic Fibers in Epoxy Bulk for 3D High Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully organic yet 3D thermoconductive bulk material is fabricated via weaving the hierarchical spiral poly(p&#8208;phenylene benzobisoxazole) fibers into an epoxy matrix. Significantly, not only the hierarchical molecular, spiral, and weaving structure of poly(p&#8208;phenylene benzobisoxazole), but also the bridging noncrystalline chains enable spatially phonon transport. This paves the way for fully organic materials in the fields of advanced thermal management.








Abstract
Polymers are usually considered thermal insulators; however, significant enhancements in thermal conductivity (k) have been observed in oriented fibers and films. Despite being advantageous in real&#8208;world applications, extending the linear thermal&#8208;transport advantage of polymers into the 3D space in bulk materials is still limited due to the spatially interfacial phonon&#8208;conduction barriers. Herein, inspired by the structure of tropocollagen, it is discovered that weaving hierarchically arranged poly(p&#8208;phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) fibers with a spiral configuration into an epoxy matrix can yield a 3D continuous thermal pathway. This achieves both a through&#8208;plane k of 10.85&#160;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 and an in&#8208;plane k of 7.15&#160;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1. Theoretical molecular simulations in combination with classical nonlinear modeling attribute the above spatially thermally conductive achievement to not only the hierarchical molecular, spiral and weaving structure of PBO, but also the noncrystalline chains that carry overlapping phonon density of states, thus thermally bridging adjacent high&#8208;k crystals in the PBO fiber. Consequently, the interfacial thermal resistance among high&#8208;k PBO crystals is suppressed to be on the order of 10&#8722;10&#8201;m2&#8201;K&#8201;W&#8722;1 in both the through&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane directions. Other advantages include being lightweight, mechanically strong, flexible, and non&#8208;combustible. This material creates opportunities for organic polymers in high&#8208;performance thermal management applications.

&lt;p&gt;A fully organic yet 3D thermoconductive bulk material is fabricated via weaving the hierarchical spiral poly(&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-phenylene benzobisoxazole) fibers into an epoxy matrix. Significantly, not only the hierarchical molecular, spiral, and weaving structure of poly(&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-phenylene benzobisoxazole), but also the bridging noncrystalline chains enable spatially phonon transport. This paves the way for fully organic materials in the fields of advanced thermal management.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymers are usually considered thermal insulators; however, significant enhancements in thermal conductivity (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;) have been observed in oriented fibers and films. Despite being advantageous in real-world applications, extending the linear thermal-transport advantage of polymers into the 3D space in bulk materials is still limited due to the spatially interfacial phonon-conduction barriers. Herein, inspired by the structure of tropocollagen, it is discovered that weaving hierarchically arranged poly(&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) fibers with a spiral configuration into an epoxy matrix can yield a 3D continuous thermal pathway. This achieves both a through-plane &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; of 10.85&#160;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an in-plane &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; of 7.15&#160;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Theoretical molecular simulations in combination with classical nonlinear modeling attribute the above spatially thermally conductive achievement to not only the hierarchical molecular, spiral and weaving structure of PBO, but also the noncrystalline chains that carry overlapping phonon density of states, thus thermally bridging adjacent high-&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; crystals in the PBO fiber. Consequently, the interfacial thermal resistance among high-&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; PBO crystals is suppressed to be on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;10&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&#8201;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in both the through-plane and in-plane directions. Other advantages include being lightweight, mechanically strong, flexible, and non-combustible. This material creates opportunities for organic polymers in high-performance thermal management applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Wireless Miniature Magnetic Phase&#8208;Change Soft Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed wireless miniature phase&#8208;change soft actuators exhibit enhancing output force and work capacity, which are 106&#8211;107 times that of traditional magnetic soft actuators. This output performance enables the actuator to have the ability for angioplasty applications, locomotion in granular media, and programmable magnetic deformation, demonstrating its potential in medical and other robotic applications.








Abstract
Wireless miniature soft actuators are promising for various potential high&#8208;impact applications in medical, robotic grippers, and artificial muscles. However, these miniature soft actuators are currently constrained by a small output force and low work capacity. To address such challenges, a miniature magnetic phase&#8208;change soft composite actuator is reported. This soft actuator exhibits an expanding deformation and enables up to a 70&#160;N output force and 175.2&#160;J&#160;g&#8722;1 work capacity under remote magnetic radio frequency heating, which are 106&#8211;107 times that of traditional magnetic soft actuators. To demonstrate its capabilities, a wireless soft robotic device is first designed that can withstand 0.24&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1 fluid flows in an artery phantom. By integrating it with a thermally&#8208;responsive shape&#8208;memory polymer and bistable metamaterial sleeve, a wireless reversible bistable stent is designed toward future potential angioplasty applications. Moreover, it can additionally locomote inside and jump out of granular media. At last, the phase&#8208;change actuator can realize programmable bending deformations when a specifically designed magnetization profile is encoded, enhancing its shape&#8208;programming capability. Such a miniature soft actuator provides an approach to enhance the mechanical output and versatility of magnetic soft robots and devices, extending their medical and other potential applications.

         <title>Balanced Interfacial Ion Concentration and Migration Steric Hindrance Promoting High&#8208;Efficiency Deposition/Dissolution Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The important influence of interfacial ion effect on aqueous zinc&#8211;manganese batteries is proposed. The interfacial ion concentration and steric hindrance in the electric double layer are comprehensively balanced from the perspective of thermodynamics and kinetics, respectively, to achieve both high specific capacity and long cycle stability simultaneously.








Abstract
The solid&#8211;liquid transition reaction lays the foundation of electrochemical energy storage systems with high capacity, but realizing high efficiency remains a challenge. Herein, in terms of thermodynamics and dynamics, this work demonstrates the significant role of both interfacial H+ concentration and Mn2+ migration steric hindrance for the high&#8208;efficiency deposition/dissolution chemistry of zinc&#8211;manganese batteries. Specially, the introduction of formate anions can buffer the generated interfacial H+ to stabilize interfacial potential according to the Nernst equation, which stimulates high capacity. Compared with acetate and propionate anions, the formate anion&#160;also provides high adsorption density on the cathode surface to shield the electrostatic repulsion due to the small spatial hindrance. Particularly for the solvated Mn2+, the formate&#8208;anion&#8208;induced lower energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step during the step&#8208;by&#8208;step desolvation process results in lower polarization and higher electrochemical reversibility. In&#160;situ tests and theoretical calculations verify that the electrolyte with formate anions achieve a good balance between ion concentration and ion&#8208;migration steric hindrance. It exhibits both the high energy density of 531.26&#160;W&#160;h&#160;kg&#8208;1&#160;and long cycle life of more than 300&#160;cycles without obvious decay.

Abstract
The development of eco&#8208;friendly, ultralow&#8208;power and easy&#8208;to&#8208;process electronics is facing dominant challenges in emerging off&#8208;the&#8208;grid applications, such as the Internet of Things (IoTs) and extreme environment explorations at the south/north&#160;pole, in the deep sea, and in outer space. Eco&#8208;friendly, biodegradable, lightweight, and flexible paper&#8208;based electronics can provide many new possibilities for next&#8208;generation devices and circuits. Here, enhancement&#8208;mode (E&#8208;mode, remaining off state at zero gate voltages) carbon nanotube (CNT) complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) are built on paper substrates through a printing&#8208;based process. Benefitting from the CMOS circuit style and E&#8208;mode transistors, the fabricated CMOS inverters exhibit high voltage gains (more than 11) and noise margins (up to 75% 1/2 VDD at VDD of 0.4&#160;V), and rail&#8208;to&#8208;rail operation down to a VDD as low as 0.2&#160;V and record low power dissipation as low as 0.0124 pW &#956;m&#8722;1. Furthermore, the transistors and integrated circuits (ICs) show an excellent radiation tolerance of a total ionizing dose (TID) exceeding 2 Mrad with a high dose rate of 365&#8201;rad&#8201;s&#8722;1. The record power consumption and outstanding radiation tolerance behavior achieved in paper&#8208;based and easy&#8208;to&#8208;process CNT electronics are attractive for emerging energy&#8208;saving and environmentally friendly ICs in harsh environment (such as outer&#8208;space) applications.

         <title>Role of Moisture and Oxygen in Defect Management and Orderly Oxidation Boosting Carbon&#8208;Based CsPbI2Br Solar Cells to a New Record Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orderly oxidation of CsPbI2Br film in moist air leads to more efficient defect passivation in film by grain boundary oxidation, and higher hole extraction efficiency in device via the energy band coupling between CsPbI2Br and oxidation product CsPbIBr2. The champion cell achieves an efficiency of 15.27%, and a certified efficiency of 14.7%, which is a record efficiency for CsPbI2Br C&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Large energy loss (Eloss) caused&#160;by defect&#8208;assisted recombination makes the photovoltaic performance of carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) inferior to that of metal&#8208;electrode ones. Herein, the influence of environmental factors (moisture and oxygen) on defect management during re&#8208;annealing process of CsPbI2Br crystalline films is systematically studied. Density functional theory and experimental results indicate that moisture in the air can significantly reduce the oxidation kinetics of crystalline films, resulting in orderly oxidation. Concomitantly, the oxidation decomposition products PbO and CsPbIBr2 are enriched at grain boundaries, passivating surface defects efficiently. Simultaneously, energy band coupling between CsPbI2Br and CsPbIBr2 improves the hole extraction efficiency. The photovoltage of corresponding C&#8208;PSCs is increased from 1.05 to 1.32&#160;V, indicating a reduced Eloss derived from orderly oxidation strategy.

     alt="Role of Moisture and Oxygen in Defect Management and Orderly Oxidation Boosting Carbon-Based CsPbI2Br Solar Cells to a New Record Efficiency"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orderly oxidation of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br film in moist air leads to more efficient defect passivation in film by grain boundary oxidation, and higher hole extraction efficiency in device via the energy band coupling between CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br and oxidation product CsPbIBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The champion cell achieves an efficiency of 15.27%, and a certified efficiency of 14.7%, which is a record efficiency for CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br C-PSCs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large energy loss (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;loss&lt;/sub&gt;) caused&#160;by defect-assisted recombination makes the photovoltaic performance of carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) inferior to that of metal-electrode ones. Herein, the influence of environmental factors (moisture and oxygen) on defect management during re-annealing process of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br crystalline films is systematically studied. Density functional theory and experimental results indicate that moisture in the air can significantly reduce the oxidation kinetics of crystalline films, resulting in orderly oxidation. Concomitantly, the oxidation decomposition products PbO and CsPbIBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are enriched at grain boundaries, passivating surface defects efficiently. Simultaneously, energy band coupling between CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br and CsPbIBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; improves the hole extraction efficiency. The photovoltage of corresponding C-PSCs is increased from 1.05 to 1.32&#160;V, indicating a reduced &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;loss&lt;/sub&gt; derived from orderly oxidation strategy. Correspondingly, the champion cell achieves an efficiency of 15.27%, and a certified efficiency of 14.7%, which is a new record efficiency for CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br C-PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles as Controllable Two&#8208;Way Adaptors to Activate Macrophage Phagocytosis for Improved Tumor Immunotherapy</title>

An outer membrane vesicle (OMV)&#8208;based controllable PEG/Se@OMV&#8208;CD47nb remarkedly increase the dose that can be administered safely through intravenous injection. As two&#8208;way adaptors, OMV&#8208;CD47nb activate tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM) phagocytosis of tumor cells via inducing M1 polarization and blocking &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal. Moreover, this activation of TAMs results in the stimulation of T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity through effective antigen presentation.








Abstract
The most immune cells infiltrating tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) closely resemble immunosuppressive M2&#8208;polarized macrophages. Moreover, tumor cells exhibit high expression of CD47 &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal, which obstructs macrophage phagocytosis. The precise and efficient activation of TAMs is a promising approach to tumor immunotherapy; however, re&#8208;education of macrophages remains a challenge. Bacteria&#8208;derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are highly immunogenic nanovesicles that can robustly stimulate macrophages. Here, an OMV&#8208;based controllable two&#8208;way adaptor is reported, in which a CD47 nanobody (CD47nb) is fused onto OMV surface (OMV&#8208;CD47nb), with the outer surface coated with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) layer containing diselenide bonds (PEG/Se) to form PEG/Se@OMV&#8208;CD47nb. The PEG/Se layer modification not only mitigates the immunogenicity of OMV&#8208;CD47nb, thereby remarkedly increasing the dose that can be administered safely through intravenous injection, but also equips the formulation with radiation&#8208;triggered controlled release of OMV&#8208;CD47nb. Application of radiation to tumors in mice injected with the nanoformulation results in remodeling of TME. As two&#8208;way adaptors, OMV&#8208;CD47nb activates TAM phagocytosis of tumor cells via multiple pathways, including induction of M1 polarization and blockade of &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal. Moreover, this activation of TAMs results in the stimulation of T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity through effective antigen presentation.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Homogeneous Ru&#63743;Cu Alloy Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomic&#8208;scale homogeneous alloy of immiscible metals is first implemented in electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction (NRR) by a unique carbothermal shock method. Atomic&#8208;scale mixing of ruthenium and copper facilitates pivotal reaction steps in NRR, showing high selectivity and formation rate to ammonia. This paves the way for developing numerous potential homogeneous alloys of immiscible metal combinations for future efficient NRR electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is the most widely used metal as an electrocatalyst for nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (NRR) because of the relatively high N2 adsorption strength for successive reaction. Recently, it has been well reported that the homogeneous Ru&#8208;based metal alloys such as Ru&#63743;Rh, Ru&#63743;Pt, and Ru&#63743;Co significantly enhance the selectivity and formation rate of ammonia (NH3). However, the metal combinations for NRR have been limited to several miscible combinations of metals with Ru, although various immiscible combinations have immense potential to show high NRR performance. In this study, an immiscible combination of Ru and copper (Cu) is first utilized, and homogeneous alloy nanoparticles (Ru&#63743;Cu NPs) are fabricated by the carbothermal shock method. The Ru&#63743;Cu homogeneous NP alloys on cellulose/carbon nanotube sponge exhibit the highest selectivity and NH3 formation rate of &#8776;31% and &#8722;73&#160;&#956;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, respectively. These are the highest values of the selectivity and NH3 formation rates among existing Ru&#8208;based alloy metal combinations.

         <title>Universal Hopping Motion Protected by Structural Topology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Universal scaling behavior of hopping motion determined by the shape of the interface and its topology is discovered through the current&#8208;driven motion of magnetic skyrmions. This provides insights for implementing the skyrmionic devices and, for understanding the dynamics of moving bodies with a closed interface, which appears in a wide range of physical systems.








Abstract
A scaling law elucidates the universality in nature, presiding over many physical phenomena which seem unrelated. Thus, exploring the universality class of scaling law in a particular system enlightens its physical nature in relevance to other systems and sometimes unearths an unprecedented new dynamic phase. Here, the dynamics of weakly driven magnetic skyrmions are investigated, and its scaling law is compared with the motion of a magnetic domain wall (DW) creep. This study finds that the skyrmion does not follow the scaling law of the DW creep in 2D space but instead shows a hopping behavior similar to that of the particle&#8208;like DW in 1D confinement. In addition, the hopping law satisfies even when a topological charge of the skyrmion is removed. Therefore, the distinct scaling behavior between the magnetic skyrmion and the DW stems from a general principle beyond the topological charge. This study demonstrates that the hopping behavior of skyrmions originates from the bottleneck process induced by DW segments with diverging collective lengths, which is inevitable in any closed&#8208;shape spin structure in 2D. This work reveals that the structural topology of magnetic texture determines the universality class of its weakly driven motion, which is distinguished from the universality class of magnetic DW creep.

         <title>Large Room Temperature Anomalous Transverse Thermoelectric Effect in Kagome Antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kagome antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6 exhibits a maximum transverse thermoelectric effect of &#8776; 2.4 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at 200 K. More importantly, a large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) of &#8776; 2 &#181;V&#160;K&#8722;1 at 300 K is observed, which is the highest value for any antiferromagnetic material. This large ANE value can be attributed to the presence of a Dirac point and flat band close to the Fermi level with intrinsic Berry curvature.








Abstract
Kagome magnets possess several novel nontrivial topological features owing to the strong correlation between topology and magnetism that extends to their applications in the field of thermoelectricity. Conventional thermoelectric (TE) devices use the Seebeck effect to convert heat into electrical energy. In contrast, transverse thermoelectric devices based on the Nernst effect are attracting recent attention due to their unique transverse geometry, which uses a single material to eliminate the need for a multitude of electrical connections compared to conventional TE devices. Here, a large anomalous transverse thermoelectric effect of &#8776;2 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at room temperature in a kagome antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6 single crystal is obtained. The obtained value is larger than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art canted antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials and comparable with ferromagnetic systems. The large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) can be attributed to the net Berry curvature near the Fermi level. Furthermore, the ANE of the AFM YMn6Sn6 exceeds the magnetization scaling relationship of conventional ferromagnets. The results clearly illustrate that AFM material YMn6Sn6 is an ideal topological material for room&#8208;temperature transverse thermoelectric applications.

This large ANE value can be attributed to the presence of a Dirac point and flat band close to the Fermi level with intrinsic Berry curvature.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kagome magnets possess several novel nontrivial topological features owing to the strong correlation between topology and magnetism that extends to their applications in the field of thermoelectricity. Conventional thermoelectric (TE) devices use the Seebeck effect to convert heat into electrical energy. In contrast, transverse thermoelectric devices based on the Nernst effect are attracting recent attention due to their unique transverse geometry, which uses a single material to eliminate the need for a multitude of electrical connections compared to conventional TE devices. Here, a large anomalous transverse thermoelectric effect of &#8776;2 &#181;V K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature in a kagome antiferromagnet YMn&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; single crystal is obtained. The obtained value is larger than that of state-of-the-art canted antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials and comparable with ferromagnetic systems. The large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) can be attributed to the net Berry curvature near the Fermi level. Furthermore, the ANE of the AFM YMn&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; exceeds the magnetization scaling relationship of conventional ferromagnets. The results clearly illustrate that AFM material YMn&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is an ideal topological material for room-temperature transverse thermoelectric applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Simple Preheating&#8208;Pyrolysis Strategy Leading to Superior Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity in Fe&#8208;N/Carbon Black</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple pyrolysis strategy by mixing FeSO4, 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, and carbon black can impart high oxygen reduction reaction activities and stabilities to commercial carbon black; the catalyst obtained by this simple method has a stronger catalytic activity than metal&#8211;organic frameworks derived carbon, metal&#8208;loaded graphene, and single&#8208;atom sites catalysts. This approach can also be extended to other nitrogen&#8208;containing ligands.








Abstract
Maintaining the high catalytic activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) while reducing costs is a long&#8208;standing effort to promote the application of polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Here, the binding of nitrogen&#8208;containing ligands and carbon black is enhanced by controlling the pyrolysis conditions of a FeSO4, 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen), carbon black mixture, which significantly improves the ORR catalytic activity of the pyrolysis products. Preheating is proposed as a process improvement method using a heat treatment at a temperature between the melting and boiling points of phen before high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis, which achieves an effective combination of phen and carbon black, and enhances the interaction between phen and ferrous ions. This method substantially increases the number of FeNx active centers in the pyrolysis product, resulting in an impressive Fe&#8208;N/C catalyst with half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) up to 0.93&#160;V and a diffusion&#8208;limited current density (jL) of 5.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 and no obvious decay after 20&#160;000 cyclic voltammetry cycles in 0.1&#160;m&#160;KOH, which are all among the best&#8208;reported data known to date. The interaction between the ratio of Fe/phen and the pyrolysis conditions is also investigated. Under the right conditions, cheap raw materials can also generate highly catalytically active sites.

         <title>&#8220;Red Carbon&#8221;: A Rediscovered Covalent Crystalline Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon suboxide is a molecule spontaneously polymerizing into conjugated ladder oligomers composed of carbon and oxygen atoms only, and named &#8220;red carbon.&#8221; Herein, this partially forgotten chemistry is brought back to the attention of the community of covalent semiconductors. As&#8208;synthesized red carbon generates superoxide species upon light irradiation, acting as an efficient photocatalyst, with performance superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbon nitrides.








Abstract
Carbon suboxide (C3O2) is a unique molecule able to polymerize spontaneously into highly conjugated light&#8208;absorbing structures at temperatures as low as 0&#160;&#176;C. Despite obvious advantages, little is known about the nature and the functional properties of this carbonaceous material. In this work, the aim is to bring &#8220;red carbon,&#8221; a forgotten polymeric semiconductor, back to the community's attention. A solution polymerization process is adapted to simplify the synthesis and control the structure. This allows one to obtain this crystalline covalent material at low temperatures. Both spectroscopic and elemental analyses support the chemical structure represented as conjugated ladder polypyrone ribbons. Density functional theory calculations suggest a crystalline structure of AB stacks of polypyrone ribbons and identify the material as a direct bandgap semiconductor with a medium bandgap that is further confirmed by optical analysis. The material shows promising photocatalytic performance using blue light. Moreover, the simple condensation&#8211;aromatization route described here allows the straightforward fabrication of conjugated ladder polymers and can be inspiring for the synthesis of carbonaceous materials at low temperatures in general.

         <title>An Irradiance&#8208;Adaptable Near&#8208;Infrared Vertical Heterojunction Phototransistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared phototransistor using the graphene/lead sulfide quantum dots/graphene heterojunction as the conductive channel is fabricated. The device demonstrates an intense gate voltage&#8208;dependent photoresponse. The dynamic trapping and de&#8208;trapping processes in the quantum dot film enable the inhibition or potentiation of the photoresponse, based on which the photopic or scotopic adaptation behavior of the human retina is successfully mimicked, respectively.








Abstract
Bioinspired artificial visual perception devices with the optical environment&#8208;adaptable function have attracted significant attention for their promising potential in applications like robotics and machine vision. In this regard, a photodetector with in&#8208;sensor adaptability is longed for in terms of complexity, efficiency, and cost. Here, a near&#8208;infrared phototransistor with a benign light irradiance&#8208;adaptability is presented. The phototransistor uses a vertically stacking graphene/lead sulfide quantum dots/graphene heterojunction as the conductive channel. Compared with ordinary lead sulfide quantum dots&#8208;decorated graphene phototransistors, the present device demonstrates a faster photoresponse speed and an abnormal transfer characteristic. The latter characteristic is induced by the gate voltage&#8208;tunable Fermi level in the heterojunction and the abundant electron trap states in the quantum dot film, which jointly results in an intense dependence of the photoresponse on the gate voltage. The dynamic trapping and de&#8208;trapping processes in the quantum dot film enable the inhibition or potentiation of the photoresponse, based on which the photopic or scotopic adaptation behavior of the human retina is successfully mimicked, respectively. By providing an irradiance&#8208;adaptable photodetector with a spectral response beyond visible light, this work should inspire future research on artificial environment&#8208;adaptable perception devices.

         <title>An Electret&#8208;Powered Skin&#8208;Attachable Auditory Sensor that Functions in Harsh Acoustic Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electret&#8208;powered skin&#8208;attachable auditory sensor operating without a bulky battery is presented. The hole&#8208;patterned electret diaphragm array with elastomer nanodroplets facilitates high sensing performance and clear voice detection in a harsh acoustic environment. The acoustic sensor shows a strong potential of a communication tool for disaster response and quarantine activities, and of diagnosis tool for vocal healthcare applications.








Abstract
Auditory sensors have shortcomings with respect to not only personalization with wearability and portability but also detecting a human voice clearly in a noisy environment or when a mask covers the mouth. In this work, an electret&#8208;powered and hole&#8208;patterned polymer diaphragm is exploited into a skin&#8208;attachable auditory sensor. The optimized charged electret diaphragm induces a voltage bias of &gt;400&#160;V against the counter electrode, which reduces the necessity of a bulky power source and enables the capacitive sensor to show high sensitivity (2.2&#160;V&#160;Pa&#8722;1) with incorporation of an elastomer nanodroplet seismic mass. The sophisticated capacitive structure with low mechanical damping enables a flat frequency response (80&#8211;3000&#160;Hz) and good linearity (50&#8211;80&#160;dBSPL). The hole&#8208;patterned electret diaphragms help the skin&#8208;attachable sensor detect only neck&#8208;skin vibration rather than dynamic air pressure, enabling a person's voice to be detected in a harsh acoustic environment. The sensor operates reliably even in the presence of surrounding noise and when the user is wearing a gas mask. Therefore, the sensor shows strong potential of a communication tool for disaster response and quarantine activities, and of diagnosis tool for vocal healthcare applications such as cough monitoring and voice dosimetry.

         <title>Direct Exciton Harvesting from a Bound Triplet Pair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficacy of using bound triplet pairs directly for electrical and chemical work is demonstrated. In support of this it is shown that triplet pairs can be directly harvested and&#160;that significant benefit in the achievable quantum efficiency is achieved by utilizing the triplet pair before annihilation processes occur.








Abstract
Singlet fission is commonly defined as the generation of two triplet excitons from a single absorbed photon. However, ambiguities within this definition arise due to the complexity of the various double triplet states that exist in SF chromophores and the corresponding interconversion processes. To clarify this process, singlet fission is frequently depicted as sequential two&#8208;step conversion in which a singlet exciton decays into a bound triplet&#8208;pair biexciton state that dissociates into two &#8220;free&#8221; triplet excitons. However, this model discounts the potential for direct harvesting from the coupled biexciton state. Here, it is demonstrated that individual triplet excitons can be extracted directly from a bound triplet pair. It is demonstrated that due to the requirement for geminate triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation in intramolecular singlet fission compounds, unique spectral and kinetic signatures can be used to quantify triplet&#8208;pair harvesting yields. An internal quantum efficiency for triplet exciton transfer from the triplet pair of &gt;50%, limited only by the solubility of the compounds is achieved. The harvesting process is not dependent on the net multiplicity of the triplet&#8208;pair state, suggesting that an explicit, independent dissociation step is not a requirement for using triplet pairs to do chemical or electrical work.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Observation of Grain Boundary Dominated Unsynchronized Phase Transition in Polycrystalline Cu2Se</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The second&#8208;order phase transition behavior of the grains in the polycrystalline system is highly dependent on the surrounding grain boundaries environment. Atomic&#8208;scale observations show that the dominating effect of different grain boundaries leads to coexistence of high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature phases of Cu2Se in one grain.








Abstract
Phase transition is a physical phenomenon that attracts great interest of researchers. Although the theory of second&#8208;order phase transitions is well&#8208;established, their atomic&#8208;scale dynamics in polycrystalline materials remains elusive. In this work, second&#8208;order phase transitions in polycrystalline Cu2Se at the transition temperature are directly observed by in situ aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy. Phase transitions in microcrystalline Cu2Se start at the grain boundaries and extend inside the grains. This phenomenon is more pronounced in nanosized grains. Analysis of phase transitions in nanocrystalline Cu2Se with different grain boundaries demonstrates that grain boundary energy dominates unsynchronized phase transition behavior. This suggests that the energy of grain boundaries is the key factor influencing the energetic barrier for initiation of phase transition. The findings advance atomic&#8208;scale understanding of second&#8208;order phase transitions, which is crucial for the control of this process in polycrystalline materials.

         <title>Self&#8208;Formation CoO Nanodots Catalyst in Co(TFSI)2&#8208;Modified Electrolyte for High Efficient Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CoO nanodot (ND)&#8208;modified electrolyte is designed by employing cobalt bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Co(TFSI)2) as an electrolyte additive for Li&#8208;O2 batteries. The highly dispersed CoO NDs integrate both the high catalytic activity of solid catalyst and the good wettability of soluble catalyst, which can make a contribution to promoting the formation and decomposition of Li2O2, achieving a superior cyclability.








Abstract
The major challenges for Li&#8208;O2 batteries are sluggish reaction kinetics and large overpotentials due to the cathode passivation resulting from insulative and insoluble Li2O2. Here, a novel nanodot (ND)&#8208;modified electrolyte is designed by employing cobalt bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Co(TFSI)2) as an electrolyte additive. The Co(TFSI)2 additive can react with discharge intermediate LiO2 and product Li2O2 to form CoO NDs. The generated CoO NDs are well dispersed in electrolyte, which integrates both the high catalytic activity of solid catalyst and the good wettability of soluble catalyst. Under the catalytis of CoO NDs, Li2O2 is produced and deposits on the cathode together with them. At the recharge process, these well dispersed CoO NDs help to decompose solid Li2O2 at a lower overpotential. The Li&#8208;O2 cells with Co(TFSI)2 exhibit a long cycle life of 200 cycles at a current density of 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1 under a cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh g&#8722;1, as well as a superior reversibility associated with the Li2O2 formation and decomposition. The study is expected to broaden the range of electrolyte additives and provide a new view to developing highly dispersed NDs&#8208;based catalysts for Li&#8208;O2 batteries.

         <title>Unbreakable Hydrogels with Self&#8208;Recoverable 10&#8239;200% Stretchability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unbreakable networks are simply constructed in hydrogels via copolymerization of divinyl benzene micellar with acrylamide. The network provides both dynamic hydrophobic association for recoverable small deformations and homogeneous crosslinking for reversible alignment of polymer chains to resist ultra&#8208;large deformations without crack propagations. The resultant hydrogels exhibit self&#8208;recoverable 102 times stretchability, and superior resistance of fracture and fatigue.








Abstract
Design of tough hydrogels maintaining structural integrity under multivariable mechanical loads remains hugely challenging because the anticipated characteristics such as stretchability, strength, toughness, and fracture resistance can hardly be compatible. Herein, a simple but robust hydrogel network formed by copolymerization of divinyl benzene with acrylamide in micellar solutions for ultra&#8208;high fracture resistance and self&#8208;recoverable stretchability is proposed. The network provides dynamic association of hydrophobic domains and homogeneous crosslinking of hydrophilic chains, which shows step&#8208;by&#8208;step deformation process. The dynamic associations allow recoverable small deformations, then the homogeneous crosslinking ensures reversible unfolding and alignment of polymer chains to self&#8208;strengthen for ultra&#8208;large deformations without crack propagations. The resultant hydrogels exhibit comprehensive unbreakable feature with self&#8208;recoverable ultra&#8208;high stretchability (100% recovery from 10&#8239;200% strain), superior fracture resistance (toughness &gt; 26&#160;kJ m&#8722;2), and anticrack propagation and fatigue (fatigue threshold: &#8776;2.5&#160;kJ m&#8722;2). Even the prenotched hydrogels can undergo tens cyclic loads at 10&#8239;200% strain and thousands cyclic loads at 200% strain without noticeable changes in mechanical performance. The robust network prepared from homogeneous hydrophobic crosslinking provides a facile approach and a new mechanism to explore tough hydrogels with superior antifracture and extreme self&#8208;recoverable deformability for diverse applications.

A tumor microenvironment&#8208;enabled in situ silver&#8208;based electrochemical oncolytic bioreactor has been established to unlock anti&#8208;tumor Ag+ prodrugs for highly&#8208;efficient subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor recession via activating reactive oxygen species production, wherein reduced graphene oxide featuring 20&#8208;fold larger catalysis rate than graphene oxide allows intratumoral H2O2 as reductants to reduce Ag+ into silver nanoparticles especially after uniting with VitC&#8208;mediated H2O2 production.








Abstract
In this study, it is shown for the first time that a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) carrier has a 20&#8208;fold higher catalysis rate than graphene oxide in Ag+ reduction. Based on this, a tumor microenvironment&#8208;enabled in situ silver&#8208;based electrochemical oncolytic bioreactor (SEOB) which switched Ag+ prodrugs into in situ therapeutic silver nanoparticles with and above 95% transition rate is constructed to inhibit the growths of various tumors. In this SEOB&#8208;enabled intratumoral nanosynthetic medicine, intratumoral H2O2 and rGO act as the reductant and the catalyst, respectively. Chelation of aptamers to the SEOB&#8208;unlocked prodrugs increases the production of silver nanoparticles in tumor cells, especially in the presence of Vitamin C, which is broken down in tumor cells to supply massive amounts of H2O2. Consequently, apoptosis and pyroptosis are induced to cooperatively contribute to the considerably&#8208;elevated anti&#8208;tumor effects on subcutaneous HepG2 and A549 tumors and orthotopic implanted HepG2 tumors in livers of nude mice. The specific aptamer targeting and intratumoral silver nanoparticle production guarantee excellent biosafety since it fails to elicit tissue damages in monkeys, which greatly increases the clinical translation potential of the SEOB system.

         <title>Fully Textured, Production&#8208;Line Compatible Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells Approaching 29% Efficiency</title>

An ultrathin hybrid hole transporting layer&#160;employing NiOx/[2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) ethyl]phosphonic acid enables complete and uniform coverage on fully textured indium tin oxide (ITO)/silicon surface with pyramid structures of 2&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m sizes. As a result of the depleted shunt pathways between ITO and perovskite top cell, a certified record efficiency&#8212;28.84%&#8212;is achieved on perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with fully textured, production&#8208;line compatible bottom silicon wafers.








Abstract
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells are promising avenues for achieving high&#8208;performance photovoltaics with low costs. However, the highest certified efficiency of perovskite/silicon tandem devices based on economically matured silicon heterojunction technology (SHJ) with fully textured wafer is only 25.2% due to incompatibility between the limitation of fabrication technology which is not compatible with the production&#8208;line silicon wafer. Here, a molecular&#8208;level nanotechnology is developed by designing NiOx/2PACz ([2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) ethyl]phosphonic acid) as an ultrathin hybrid hole transport layer (HTL) above indium tin oxide (ITO)&#160;recombination junction, to serve as a vital pivot for achieving a conformal deposition of high&#8208;quality perovskite layer on top. The NiOx interlayer facilitates a uniform self&#8208;assembly of 2PACz molecules onto the fully textured surface, thus avoiding direct contact between ITO and perovskite top&#8208;cell for a minimal shunt loss. As a result of such interfacial engineering, the fully textured perovskite/silicon tandem cells obtain a certified efficiency of 28.84% on a 1.2&#8208;cm2 masked area, which is the highest performance to date based on the fully textured, production&#8208;line compatible SHJ. This work advances commercially promising photovoltaics with high performance and low costs by adopting a meticulously designed HTL/perovskite interface.

         <title>Visible Light Induced Ag&#8211;Polyoxometalate Coassembly into Single&#8208;Cluster Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A schematic diagram of single&#8208;cluster nanowires constructed by Ag&#8208;polyoxometalate (POM) coassembly is presented. Ag clusters are generated by visible light induced reduction, which are then connected with POM clusters to form 1D superstructures with alternative arrangement. Ag&#8208;P2W17 nanowires perform enhanced activities in both electrochemical sensing and catalytic gasoline desulfurization, due to the promoted electron transfer in nanowire heterojunctions.








Abstract
1D superlattices with long&#8208;ranged periodicity present extraordinary application properties due to their unique electronic structures. Here, the visible light driven synthesis of 1D single&#8208;cluster chains constructed by polyoxometalate (POM) and Ag clusters is reported, where two types of clusters align alternatively along the nanowire. Low symmetrical POM clusters of [P2W17O61]10&#8211;, [P2W15O56]12&#8211;, and [EuW10O36]9&#8211; can be used as building blocks. The directly bonding cluster units result in interactive electronic structures of Ag and POM clusters, as well as the greatly promoted electron transfer during the redox reaction. The Ag&#8211;P2W17 nanowires perform significantly enhanced activities in both electrochemical sensing and catalytic gasoline desulfurization compared with individual building blocks, demonstrating the extraordinary application properties and promising potentials of cluster&#8208;based heteroconstructions.

         <title>Multidimensional Perovskites for High Detectivity Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite thin films with a 2D&#8211;3D gradient result in graded electronic bandgap structures that are ideal for photodiode applications. Low&#8208;dimensional perovskite phases at the interface with the electron blocking layer increase the activation energy for thermal charge generation and thereby effectively lower the dark current density to a record&#8208;value of 10&#8211;9&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, resulting in maximized sensitivity.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional perovskites attract increasing interest due to tunable optoelectronic properties and high stability. Here, it is shown that perovskite thin films with a vertical gradient in dimensionality result in graded electronic bandgap structures that are ideal for photodiode applications. Positioning low&#8208;dimensional, vertically&#8208;oriented perovskite phases at the interface with the electron blocking layer increases the activation energy for thermal charge generation and thereby effectively lowers the dark current density to a record&#8208;low value of 5 &#215; 10&#8722;9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 without compromising responsivity, resulting in a noise&#8208;current&#8208;based specific detectivity exceeding 7 &#215; 1012 Jones at 600&#160;nm. These multidimensional perovskite photodiodes show promising air stability and a dynamic range over ten orders of magnitude, and thus represent a new generation of high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost photodiodes.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Anode&#8208;Less All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries via the Conversion Reaction of Metal Fluorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature anode&#8208;less all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery is reported by utilizing the conversion reaction of metal fluorides. Silver fluoride is identified as a seed component to induce uniform and reversible lithium plating via a conversion reaction that produces metallic silver nanodomains. These nanodomains, together with the lithium fluoride formed during the conversion reaction, enable sustainable cycling with an extremely high areal capacity.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) that employ anode&#8208;less electrodes have drawn attention from across the battery community because they offer competitive energy densities and a markedly improved cycle life. Nevertheless, the composite matrices of anode&#8208;less electrodes impose a substantial barrier for lithium&#8208;ion diffusion and inhibit operation at room temperature.

     alt="Room-Temperature Anode-Less All-Solid-State Batteries via the Conversion Reaction of Metal Fluorides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A room-temperature anode-less all-solid-state battery is reported by utilizing the conversion reaction of metal fluorides. Silver fluoride is identified as a seed component to induce uniform and reversible lithium plating via a conversion reaction that produces metallic silver nanodomains. These nanodomains, together with the lithium fluoride formed during the conversion reaction, enable sustainable cycling with an extremely high areal capacity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) that employ anode-less electrodes have drawn attention from across the battery community because they offer competitive energy densities and a markedly improved cycle life. Nevertheless, the composite matrices of anode-less electrodes impose a substantial barrier for lithium-ion diffusion and inhibit operation at room temperature. To overcome this drawback, here, the conversion reaction of metal fluorides is exploited because metallic nanodomains formed during this reaction induce an alloying reaction with lithium ions for uniform and sustainable lithium (de)plating. Lithium fluoride (LiF), another product of the conversion reaction, prevents the agglomeration of the metallic nanodomains and also protects the electrode from fatal lithium dendrite growth. A systematic analysis identifies silver (I) fluoride (AgF) as the most suitable metal fluoride because the silver nanodomains can accommodate the solid-solution mechanism with a low nucleation overpotential. AgF-based full cells attain reliable cycling at 25 &#176;C even with an exceptionally high areal capacity of 9.7 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (areal loading of LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;= 50&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;). These results offer useful insights into designing materials for anode-less electrodes for sulfide-based ASSBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetic Alignment for Plasmonic Control of Gold Nanorods Coated with Iron Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assembly of spherical, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles on gold nanorods yields magnetic gold nanorods (MagGNRs) that align in applied magnetic fields. Magnetic manipulation of the surface plasmon resonance of MagGNRs is comprehensively investigated through structural and optical characterization, and an analytical model provides a unified understanding of the magnetic alignment behavior. Dynamic alignment of MagGNRs is demonstrated in rotating magnetic fields.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanoparticles that can be manipulated with magnetic fields are of interest for advanced optical applications, diagnostics, imaging, and therapy. Alignment of gold nanorods yields strong polarization&#8208;dependent extinction, and use of magnetic fields is appealing because they act through space and can be quickly switched. In this work, cationic polyethyleneimine&#8208;functionalized superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) are deposited on the surface of anionic gold nanorods coated with bovine serum albumin. The magnetic gold nanorods (MagGNRs) obtained through mixing maintain the distinct optical properties of plasmonic gold nanorods that are minimally perturbed by the magnetic overcoating. Magnetic alignment of the MagGNRs arising from magnetic dipolar interactions on the anisotropic gold nanorod core is comprehensively characterized, including structural characterization and enhancement (suppression) of the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance and suppression (enhancement) of the transverse surface plasmon resonance for light polarized parallel (orthogonal) to the magnetic field. The MagGNRs can also be driven in rotating magnetic fields to rotate at frequencies of at least 17&#160;Hz. For suitably large gold nanorods (148&#160;nm long) and Fe3O4 NPs (13.4&#160;nm diameter), significant alignment is possible even in modest (&lt;500&#160;Oe) magnetic fields. An analytical model provides a unified understanding of the magnetic alignment of MagGNRs.

A zinc&#8208;ion battery (ZIB)&#160;pressuresensor where the rechargeable solid&#8208;state ZIB is&#160;itself designed as a flexible pressure sensor has excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance, endowing it with the real&#8208;time detection ability of human vital signs and ultrahigh stability. The sensor strategy provides a new solution for the future development of miniaturized wearable electronic devices.








Abstract
Accurate and continuous pressure signal detection without external power supply is a key technology to realize the miniaturization of wearable electronic equipment, the internet of things, and artificial intelligence. However, it is difficult to be achieved by using current sensor technologies. Here, a new one&#8208;body strategy, i.e., zinc&#8208;ion battery pressure (ZIB&#8208;P) sensor technology, which designs the rechargeable solid&#8208;state ZIB itself as a flexible pressure sensor is reported. In the device, an isolation layer is introduced into the sandwich configuration solid&#8208;state battery to realize the change of device internal resistance by pressure during the transformation of the mechanical signal to the electrical signal. This battery pressure sensor possesses good flexibility, fast response/recovery time (76.0/88.0&#160;ms), stable long&#8208;term response, excellent cycle stability (100&#8239;000 times), and wide pressure detection range (2.0 to 3.68 &#215; 105&#160;Pa). Especially, the excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance in the ZIB&#8208;P sensor endows it with the real&#8208;time detection ability of human vital signs (pulse, limb movement, etc.) and ultrahigh stability without degradation even under 100&#8239;000 times pressure stimulation. The ZIB&#8208;P sensor strategy provides a new solution for the future development of miniaturized wearable electronic devices.

         <title>Super&#8208;Linear&#8208;Threshold&#8208;Switching Selector with Multiple Jar&#8208;Shaped Cu&#8208;Filaments in the Amorphous Ge3Se7 Resistive Switching Layer in a Cross&#8208;Point Synaptic Memristor Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial neural network consisting of a hardware&#8208;based cross&#8208;point synaptic memristor array should employ selectors with two&#8208;terminal electrodes to prevent an undesired sneak current and to improve learning and inference efficiencies. Here, a highly reliable super&#8208;linear&#8208;threshold&#8208;switching selector with multiple jar&#8208;shaped Cu&#8208;filaments in the amorphous Ge3Se7 resistive switching layer by controlling the Cu ion concentration depth profile is developed.








Abstract
The learning and inference efficiencies of an artificial neural network represented by a cross&#8208;point synaptic memristor array can be achieved using a selector, with high selectivity (Ion/Ioff) and sufficient death region, stacked vertically on a synaptic memristor. This can prevent a sneak current in the memristor array. A selector with multiple jar&#8208;shaped conductive Cu filaments in the resistive switching layer is precisely fabricated by designing the Cu ion concentration depth profile of the CuGeSe layer as a filament source, TiN diffusion barrier layer, and Ge3Se7 switching layer. The selector performs super&#8208;linear&#8208;threshold&#8208;switching with a selectivity of &gt; 107, death region of &#8722;0.70&#8211;0.65 V, holding time of 300 ns, switching speed of 25 ns, and endurance cycle of &gt;&#160;106. In addition, the mechanism of switching is proven by the formation of conductive Cu filaments between the CuGeSe and Ge3Se7 layers under a positive bias on the top Pt electrode and an automatic rupture of the filaments after the holding time. Particularly, a spiking deep neural network using the designed one&#8208;selector&#8208;one&#8208;memory cross&#8208;point array improves the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology classification accuracy by &#8776;3.8% by eliminating the sneak current in the cross&#8208;point array during the inference process.

Phototransistors
In article number 2205679, Peiguang Yan, Zhenhua Sun, and co&#8208;workers report a near&#8208;infrared phototransistor with benign light&#8208;irradiance adaptability using a vertically stacking graphene/lead sulfide quantum dots/graphene heterojunction as the conductive channel. The dynamic trapping and detrapping processes in the quantum dot film enable the inhabitation or potentiation of the photoresponse, based on which the photopic or scotopic adaptation behavior of the human retina is successfully mimicked, respectively.

Skyrmion Motion
Understanding skyrmion motion is essential for the efficient operation of skyrmionic devices. In article number 2203275, Chanyong Hwang, Kyoung&#8208;Whan Kim, Albert Min Gyu Park, Kab&#8208;Jin Kim, and co&#8208;workers uncover a universal scaling behavior in the current&#8208;driven motion of skyrmions. The topology of the shape of the interface drags the skyrmions and causes them to show hopping properties distinct from the creep motion expected for magnetic domains. The universal scaling can provide insights for implementing skyrmion devices and understanding the dynamics of moving bodies with a closed interface.

Bioreactors
In article number 2109973, Liping Zhong, Kun Zhang, Yongxiang Zhao, and co&#8208;workers describe how a tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;enabled in situ silver&#8208;based electrochemical oncolytic bioreactor (SEOB) unlocks antitumor Ag+ prodrugs for highly efficient subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor recession via activating production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Reduced graphene oxide (rGO), featuring 20&#8208;fold larger catalysis rate than GO, allows intratumoral H2O2 as reductants to reduce Ag+ into silver nanoparticles especially after uniting with vitamin&#8208;C&#8208;mediated H2O2 production.

         <title>Necklace&#8208;Like Nanostructures: From Fabrication, Properties to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their intriguing and specific appearance and architecture, necklace&#8208;like nanostructures carry some unique features over simple 1D nanogeometries. In this review, necklace&#8208;like structures by focusing on their diverse synthetic strategies, distinctive properties, and applications, as well as future directions for fabricating and capitalizing on necklace&#8208;like structures are summarized.








Abstract
The shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of nanocrystals remains a hot research topic in nanotechnology. Particularly, the fabrication of 1D structures such as wires, rods, belts, and tubes has been an interesting and important subject within nanoscience in the last few decades. 1D necklace&#8208;like micro/nanostructures are a sophisticated geometry that has attracted increasing attention due to their anisotropic and periodic structure, intrinsic high surface area, abundant transport channels, exposure of each component to the surface, and multiscale roughness of the surface. These characteristics enable their unique electrical, optical, and catalytic properties. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the advanced research progress on the fabrication strategies, novel properties, and various applications of necklace&#8208;like structures. It begins with the main fabrication methods of necklace&#8208;like structures and subsequently details a variety of their properties and applications. It concludes with the authors&#8217; perspectives on future research and development of the necklace&#8208;like structures.

         <title>Amplifying Molecular Scale Rotary Motion: The Marriage of Overcrowded Alkene Molecular Motor with Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amplifying the molecular rotary motion of photoresponsive overcrowded alkene molecular motor (OAMM) by liquid crystal provides great opportunities in design and fabrication of advanced materials and functional systems. This review summarizes the recent progress of the OAMM triggered light&#8208;directed systems and the challenges and outlooks in the development of OAMM&#8208;liquid crystal composite system are concluded.








Abstract
Design and fabrication of macroscopic functional devices by molecular engineering is an emerging and effective strategy in exploration of advanced materials. Photoresponsive overcrowded alkene&#8208;based molecular motor (OAMM) is considered as one of the most promising molecular machines due to the unique rotary motion driven by light with high temporal and spatial precision. Amplifying the molecular rotary motions into macroscopic behaviors of photodirected systems links the molecular dynamics with macroscopic motions of materials, providing new opportunities to design novel materials and devices with a bottom&#8208;up strategy. In this review, recent developments of the light&#8208;responsive liquid crystal system triggered by OAMM will be summarized. The mechanism of amplification effect of liquid crystal matrix will be introduced first. Then progress of the OAMM&#8208;driven liquid crystal materials will be described including light&#8208;controlled photonic crystals, texture&#8208;tunable liquid crystal coating and microspheres, photoactuated soft robots, and dynamic optical devices. It is hoped that this review provides inspirations in design and exploration of light&#8208;driven soft matters and novel functional materials from molecular engineering to structural modification.

         <title>An Electrochemical&#8208;Electret Coupled Organic Synapse with Single&#8208;Polarity Driven Reversible Facilitation&#8208;to&#8208;Depression Switching</title>

Abstract
Neuromorphic engineering and artificial intelligence demands hardware elements that emulates synapse algorithms. During the last decay electrolyte&#8208;gated organic conjugated materials have been explored as a platform for artificial synapses for neuromorphic computing. Unlike biological synapses, in current devices the synaptic facilitation and depression are triggered by voltages with opposite polarity. To enhance the reliability and simplify the operation of synapse without lowering its sophisticated functionality, here we have devised an electrochemical&#8208;electret coupled organic synapse (EECS) possessing a reversible facilitation&#8208;to&#8208;depression switch. Electret charging counterbalances channel conductance changes due to electrochemical doping, inducing depression without inverting the gate polarity. Overall, EECS functions as a threshold&#8208;controlled synaptic switch ruled by its amplitude&#8208;dependent, dual&#8208;modal operation, which can well emulate information storage and erase as in real synapses. By varying energy level offset between channel material and electret, the EECS's transition threshold can be adjusted for specific applications, e.g. imparting additional light responsiveness to the device operation. Our novel device architecture represents a major step forward in the development of artificial organic synapses with increased functional complexity and it opens new perspectives towards the fabrication of abiotic neural networks with higher reliability, efficiency and endurance.

         <title>Shining Transparent Display with Stable Narrow&#8208;Band Blue&#8208;Emitting Phosphor in Layered Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Transparent display (TD) rendering &#8220;levitating&#8221; images on screen has appeared as an emerging technology towards augmented/mixed reality applications. However, the traditional phosphor design and screen construction have severely limited the TD performance owing to the lack of efficient narrow&#8208;band blue emitters and stable screen structure. Herein, we explore the novel narrow&#8208;band (full width at half maximum: 32&#160;nm) NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ phosphor with a peak at 467&#160;nm as a key blue emitter, and sandwich it in layered film as a unique screen design. The devised screen features decent transparency, high emission color purity and good reliability, and our TD prototype renders &#8220;floating&#8221; static images and vivid animation with broad viewing angle (15&#176;&#8764;165&#176;) and large color gamut (97% of National Television Standards Committee). Spectroscopic and micro&#8208;structural characterizations reveal the TD superior performance originates from synergistic contributions of moderate crystal field effect (&#949;c, ca. 1.13&#160;eV; &#949;cfs, ca. 1.60&#160;eV), weak vibronic coupling (S, ca. 3; &#295;&#969;, ca. 285 cm&#8722;1), and limited thermal ionization of 5d electrons (Ea, ca. 0.43&#160;eV) for NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ emission and layered architecture for screen film. These findings establish the fundamental guidelines for narrow&#8208;band emitting materials design and shine light on superior TD innovative development.

         <title>A Versatile Molten&#8208;Salt Induction Strategy to Achieve Efficient CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells with a High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage &gt;1.2 V</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature molten salt dimethylamine acetate is developed as the solvent for precursor solutions, which also regulates the phase conversion process of the CsPbI3 film. Consequently, 1.25 V of the open&#8208;circuit voltage and &gt;21% power conversion efficiency are achieved, which is the record highest for CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells reported so far.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite has emerged as an important photovoltaic material due to its high thermal stability and suitable bandgap for tandem devices. Currently, the cell performance of CsPbI3 solar cells is mainly subject to a large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit. Herein, a multifunctional room&#8208;temperature molten salt, dimethylamine acetate (DMAAc) is demonstrated, which not only directly acts as a solvent for precursor solutions, but also regulates the phase conversion process of the CsPbI3 film for high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaics. DMAAc can stabilize the DMAPbI3 structure and eliminate the Cs4PbI6 intermediate phase, which is easily spatially segregated. Meanwhile, a new homogeneous intermediate phase DMAPb(I,Ac)3 is formed, which finally affords high&#8208;quality CsPbI3 films. With this approach, the charge capture activity of defects in the CsPbI3 film is significantly suppressed. Consequently, a VOC of 1.25&#160;V and &gt;21% power conversion efficiency are achieved, which is the record highest reported thus far. This intermediate phase&#8208;regulation strategy is believed to be applicable to other perovskite material systems.

         <title>Triarylboron&#8208;doped Acenethiophenes as Organic Sonosensitizers for Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Therapy with Low Phototoxicity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of efficient organic sonosensitizers is crucial for sonodynamic therapy (SDT) in the field of cancer treatment. Herein, we present a new strategy for the development of efficient organic sonosensitizers based on triarylboron&#8208;doped acenethiophene scaffolds. The attachment of boron to the linear acenethiophenes lowers the LUMO energy, resulting in red&#8208;shifted absorptions and emissions. After encapsulation with the amphiphilic polymer DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000, we find that the nanostructured BAnTh&#8208;NPs and BTeTh&#8208;NPs shows efficient hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) generation under ultrasound (US) irradiation in aqueous solution with almost no phototoxicity, which can overcome the shortcomings of O2&#8208;dependent SDT and avoid the potential cutaneous phototoxicity issue. In vitro and in vivo therapeutic results validate that boron&#8208;doped acenethiophenes as sonosensitizers enable high SDT efficiency with low phototoxicity and good biocompatibility, indicating that boron&#8208;functionalization of acenes is a promising strategy toward organic sonosensitizers for SDT.

         <title>V&#8208;Doped Cu2Se Hierarchical Nanotubes Enabling Flow&#8208;Cell CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol with High Efficiency and Selectivity</title>

Abstract
CO2 electrocatalytic reduction (CO2ER) to multicarbon (C2+) products are heavily pursued because of their commercial values, whose efficiency and selectivity have both attracted tremendous attention. Flow&#8208;cell is a device configuration that can greatly enhance the conversion efficiency but requires catalysts to possess high electrical conductivity and gas permeability; meanwhile, the catalysts should enable the reaction pathway to specific products. Herein, we report that V&#8208;doped Cu2Se nanotubes with a hierarchical structure can be perfectly compatible with flow&#8208;cell and fulfil such a task, achieving CO2 electroreduction to ethanol with high efficiency and selectivity. As revealed by our experimental characterization and theoretical calculation, the substitutional vanadium doping alters the local charge distribution of Cu2Se and diversifies the active sites. The unique active sites promote the formation of bridge *COB and its further hydrogenation to *COH, and as such, the subsequent coupling of *COH and *COL eventually generates ethanol. As a result, the optimal Cu1.22V0.19Se nanotubes can electrocatalyze CO2 to ethanol with a Faradaic efficiency of 68.3% and a partial current density of &#8722;207.9&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 for the single liquid product of ethanol at &#8722;0.8&#160;V in a flow&#8208;cell. This work provides insights into the materials design for steering the reaction pathway toward C2+ products, and opens the avenue for flow&#8208;cell CO2ER toward a single C2+ liquid fuel.

         <title>A Non&#8208;Flammable High&#8208;Voltage 4.7 V Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries employ in&#8208;situ lithium plated current collectors as negative electrodes to afford optimal mass and volumetric energy densities. The main challenges to such batteries include their poor cycling stability and safety issues of flammable organic electrolytes. Here, we report a high&#8208;voltage 4.7&#160;V anode&#8208;free lithium metal battery using a Cu foil coated with a layer (&#8764; 950&#160;nm) of silicon&#8208;polyacrylonitrile (Si&#8208;PAN, 25.5&#160;&#956;g cm&#8722;2) as the negative electrode, a high&#8208;voltage cobalt&#8208;free LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) as the positive electrode and a safe, non&#8208;flammable ionic liquid electrolyte comprised of 4.5&#160;M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) salt in N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;propyl pyrrolidiniumbis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (Py13FSI) with 1 wt% lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) as additive. The Si&#8208;PAN coating was found to seed the growth of lithium during charging, and reversibly expand/shrink during lithium plating/stripping over battery cycling. The wide voltage&#8208;window electrolyte containing a high concentration of FSI&#8722; and TFSI&#8722; facilitated the formation of stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, affording a 4.7&#160;V anode&#8208;free Cu@Si&#8208;PAN/LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 battery with a reversible specific capacity of &#8764; 120 mAh g&#8722;1 and high cycling stability (80% capacity retention after 120 cycles). These results represent the first anode&#8208;free Li battery with a high 4.7&#160;V discharge voltage and high safety.

         <title>Perovskite Photodetector Crossbar Array by Vapor Deposition for Dynamic Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
With the development of perovskite photodetectors, integrating photodetectors into array image sensor is the next target to pursue. The major obstacle of integrating perovskite photodiodes for dynamic imaging is the optoelectrical crosstalk among the pixels. Herein, a perovskite photodiode&#8208;blocking diode (PIN&#8208;BD) crossbar array with pixel&#8208;wise rectifying property by vapor deposition method is presented. The PIN&#8208;BD shows a large rectification ratio of 3.3&#215;102 under illumination, suppressing the electrical crosstalk to as small as 8.0% in the imaging array. The fast response time of 72.8&#160;ns allows the real&#8208;time image acquisition by over 25 frames per seconds. The imaging sensor exhibit excellent imaging capability with a large linear dynamic range of 112&#160;dB with 4096 grey levels, and weak light sensitivity under 1.2 lux.

         <title>Biomineralized Two&#8208;Enzyme Nanoparticles Regulated Tumor Glycometabolism Inducing Tumor Cell Pyroptosis and Robust Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Currently, immune checkpoint therapy combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy is a useful strategy for improving immunotherapy's therapeutic efficacy. However, chemotherapy and radiotherapy cause serious side effects, so finding safe and effective methods to combine with immunotherapy is critical. Our research found that regulating tumor glycometabolism could induce tumor cell pyroptosis and regulate the degree of expression of programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1). Therefore, this article looked at how to treat tumors by regulating tumor glycometabolism in combination with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 therapy. First, the biomineralization&#8208;like method was used to construct nanoparticles with two&#8208;enzymatic activity by hybridizing nanozymes and glucose oxidase (GOx). It had the ability to self&#8208;amplify and regulate the glycolytic activity of tumor cells. It could also induce tumor cell pyroptosis and increase the expression of PD&#8208;L1 in tumor cells. To treat tumors, we further combined nanoparticles with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1, which substantially inhibited tumor development and significantly increased mice survival time. Combination therapy also had a significant immunological memory effect, successfully preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study that combines tumor glycometabolism with immune checkpoints in cancer therapy. This innovative, safe, low&#8208;toxic, and highly effective anti&#8208;tumor strategy will have good prospects in clinical applications.

         <title>Engineered Extracellular Vesicles with SHP2 High Expression Promote Mitophagy for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a fundamental pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, toxicity and poor brain enrichment of existing mitophagy inducers limit their further applications. In this study, we develops a platform for AD therapy using nanosized mesenchymal stem cells&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles with tyrosine phosphatase&#8208;2 (SHP2) high&#8208;expression (MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2). The high blood&#8208;brain barrier penetration ability of MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2 is demonstrated in AD&#8208;mice, facilitating SHP2 delivery to the brain. In addition, MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2 significantly induces mitophagy of neuronal cells, which alleviates mitochondrial damage&#8208;mediated apoptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Mitophagy further diminishes neuronal cells apoptosis and neuroinflammation, culminating with rescued synaptic loss and cognitive decline in an AD mouse model. Our EV&#8208;engineering technology provide a potential platform for effective AD therapy by inducing mitophagy.

Abstract
Topological materials discovery has emerged as an important frontier in condensed matter physics. While theoretical classification frameworks have been used to identify thousands of candidate topological materials, experimental determination of materials' topology often poses significant technical challenges. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a widely&#8208;used materials characterization technique sensitive to atoms' local symmetry and chemical bonding, which are intimately linked to band topology by the theory of topological quantum chemistry. Moreover, as a local structural probe, XAS is known to have high quantitative agreement between experiment and calculation, suggesting that insights from computational spectra can effectively inform experiments. In this work, we&#160;leverage computed X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) spectra of more than 10,000 inorganic materials to train a neural network classifier that predicts topological class directly from XANES signatures, achieving F1 scores of 89% and 93% for topological and trivial classes, respectively. Given the simplicity of the XAS setup and its compatibility with multimodal sample environments, the proposed machine learning&#8208;augmented XAS topological indicator has the potential to discover broader categories of topological materials, such as non&#8208;cleavable compounds and amorphous materials, and may further inform field&#8208;driven phenomena in situ, such as magnetic field&#8208;driven topological phase transitions.

         <title>Ultrathin Piezoelectric Resonators Based on Graphene and Free&#8208;Standing Single&#8208;Crystal BaTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric resonators are ubiquitous elements for frequency filtering in telecom devices. A piezoelectric resonator consisting of a suspended van der Waals heterostructure of ultrathin single&#8208;crystal free&#8208;standing BaTiO3 sandwiched between graphene sheets is reported. The heterostructure is piezoelectrically driven into a flexural motion and the resulting mechanics shows ferroelectric switching. The bulk&#8208;mode resonance at 233 GHz is the highest reported.








Abstract
Suspended piezoelectric thin films are key elements enabling high&#8208;frequency filtering in telecommunication devices. To meet the requirements of next&#8208;generation electronics, it is essential to reduce device thickness for reaching higher resonance frequencies. Here, the high&#8208;quality mechanical and electrical properties of graphene electrodes are combined with the strong piezoelectric performance of the free&#8208;standing complex oxide, BaTiO3 (BTO), to create ultrathin piezoelectric resonators. It is demonstrated that the device can be brought into mechanical resonance by piezoelectric actuation. By sweeping the DC bias voltage on the top graphene electrode, the BTO membrane is switched between the two poled ferroelectric states. Remarkably, ferroelectric hysteresis is also observed in the resonance frequency, magnitude and Q&#8208;factor of the first membrane mode. In the bulk acoustic mode, the device vibrates at 233 GHz. This work demonstrates the potential of combining van der Waals materials with complex oxides for next&#8208;generation electronics, which not only opens up opportunities for increasing filter frequencies, but also enables reconfiguration by poling, via ferroelectric memory effect.

         <title>Nanopatterning Technologies of 2D Materials for Integrated Electronic and Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanopatterning bridges the microstructure of 2D materials and integrated chip devices, essentially enabling and prompting their successful application in industry. A critical summary on the recent development of key nanopatterning technologies of 2D materials, with the aim of realizing large&#8208;scale device integration, is provided. This contribution offers a pioneering reference and guidelines to promote 2D materials from laboratory research to practical use.








Abstract
With the reduction of feature size and increase of integration density, traditional 3D semiconductors are unable to meet the future requirements of chip integration. The current semiconductor fabrication technologies are approaching their physical limits based on Moore's law. 2D materials such as graphene, transitional metal dichalcogenides, etc., are of great promise for future memory, logic, and photonic devices due to their unique and excellent properties. To prompt 2D materials and devices from the laboratory research stage to the industrial integrated circuit&#8208;level, it is necessary to develop advanced nanopatterning methods to obtain high&#8208;quality, wafer&#8208;scale, and patterned 2D products. Herein, the recent development of nanopatterning technologies, particularly toward realizing large&#8208;scale practical application of 2D materials is reviewed. Based on the technological progress, the unique requirement and advances of the 2D integration process for logic, memory, and optoelectronic devices are further summarized. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of nanopatterning technologies of 2D materials for future integrated chip devices are prospected.

         <title>Beyond Human Touch Perception: An Adaptive Robotic Skin Based on Gallium Microgranules for Pressure Sensory Augmentation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptive robotic skin with augmented pressure sensing ability is introduced. Integrated tunable pressure sensors built with uniform gallium microgranules provide high sensitivity and bandwidth and excellent sensor&#8208;to&#8208;sensor uniformity, enabling a large&#8208;scale robotic skin with sensing performance superior to human skin. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstrations show its unique sensing capability and versatility covering a broad range of pressure.








Abstract
Robotic skin with human&#8208;skin&#8208;like sensing ability holds immense potential in various fields such as robotics, prosthetics, healthcare, and industries. To catch up with human skin, numerous studies are underway on pressure sensors integrated on robotic skin to improve the sensitivity and detection range. However, due to the trade&#8208;off between them, existing pressure sensors have achieved only a single aspect, either high sensitivity or wide bandwidth. Here, an adaptive robotic skin is proposed that has both high sensitivity and broad bandwidth with an augmented pressure sensing ability beyond the human skin. A key for the adaptive robotic skin is a tunable pressure sensor built with uniform gallium microgranules embedded in an elastomer, which provides large tuning of the sensitivity and the bandwidth, excellent sensor&#8208;to&#8208;sensor uniformity, and high reliability. Through the mode conversion based on the solid&#8211;liquid phase transition of gallium microgranules, the sensor provides 97% higher sensitivity (16.97 kPa&#8722;1) in the soft mode and 262.5% wider bandwidth (&#8776;1.45&#160;MPa) in the rigid mode compared to the human skin. Successful demonstration of the adaptive robotic skin verifies its capabilities in sensing a wide spectrum of pressures ranging from subtle blood pulsation to body weight, suggesting broad use for various applications.

         <title>An Integrated 3D Hydrophilicity/Hydrophobicity Design for Artificial Sweating Skin (i&#8208;TRANS) Mimicking Human Body Perspiration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile surface modification method for fibrous materials is developed to fabricate artificial sweating skin, based on an integrated 3D hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity design. With the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity contrast in both the lateral and vertical directions, the constructed &#8220;skin&#8221; can transport &#8220;sweat&#8221; directionally without trapping undesired excess water and attain uniform &#8220;secretion&#8221; of sweat droplets on the top, decently mimicking human skin perspiration situation.








Abstract
Artificial skins reproducing properties of human skin are emerging and significant for study in various areas, such as robotics, medicine, and textiles. Perspiration, as one of the most imperative thermoregulation functions of human skin, is gaining increasing attention, but how to realize ideal artificial skin for perspiration simulation remains challenging. Here, an integrated 3D hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity design is proposed for artificial sweating skin (i&#8208;TRANS). Based on normal fibrous wicking materials, the selective surface modification with gradient of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) creates hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity contrast in both lateral and vertical directions. With the additional help of bottom hydrophilic Nylon 6 nanofibers, the constructed i&#8208;TRANS is able to transport &#8220;sweat&#8221; directionally without trapping undesired excess water and attain uniform &#8220;secretion&#8221; of sweat droplets on the top surface, decently mimicking human skin perspiration situation. This fairly comparable simulation not only presents new insights for replicating skin properties, but also provides proper in vitro testing platforms for perspiration&#8208;relevant research, greatly avoiding unwanted interference from the &#8220;skin&#8221; layer. In addition, the facile, fast, and cost&#8208;effective fabrication approach and versatile usage of i&#8208;TRANS can further facilitate its application.

The large steric hindrance of its fluorohydrocarbon chains and the electron&#8208;withdrawing &#63743;CF2&#63743; segments endow 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether with prominently weak solvating power and high reduction stability. The weakening solvating power of fluorohydrocarbon solvent leads the formation of encapsulating&#8208;lithium polysulfide electrolyte for lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells with long cycling lifespan.








Abstract
Long cycling lifespan is a prerequisite for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries yet is restricted by side reactions between soluble polysulfides and the lithium&#8208;metal anode. The regulation on solvation structure of polysulfides renders encapsulating polysulfides electrolytes (EPSE) as a promising solution to suppress the parasitic reactions. The solvating power of the solvents in the outer solvent shell of lithium polysulfides is critical for the encapsulation effect of EPSE. Herein, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether&#160;(HFE) is demonstrated as a superior outer&#8208;shell solvent to construct EPSE. Based on the&#160;large steric hindrance of the fluorohydrocarbon chains, the electron&#8208;withdrawing perfluoro segment (&#63743;CF2&#63743; further endows HFE with prominently weak solvating power. The HFE&#8208;EPSE improves the lifespan from 54 to 135 cycles for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with an ultrathin lithium&#8208;metal anode (50&#160;&#181;m) and high&#8208;areal&#8208;loading sulfur cathode (4.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, a 334&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cell (2.4 Ah level) with HFE&#8208;EPSE stably undergoes 25 cycles. This work demonstrates the role of weakening solvating power of outer&#8208;shell solvents to construct superior EPSE and inspires the significance of the solvation chemistry of polysulfides to achieve practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Long cycling lifespan is a prerequisite for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries yet is restricted by side reactions between soluble polysulfides and the lithium-metal anode. The regulation on solvation structure of polysulfides renders encapsulating polysulfides electrolytes (EPSE) as a promising solution to suppress the parasitic reactions. The solvating power of the solvents in the outer solvent shell of lithium polysulfides is critical for the encapsulation effect of EPSE.

         <title>Regulating the Coordination Environment of Mesopore&#8208;Confined Single Atoms from Metalloprotein&#8208;MOFs for Highly Efficient Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalized strategy to construct highly active ferric&#8208;centered SACs (Fe&#8208;SACs) via a biomineralization strategy that enables the homogeneous encapsulation of metalloproteins within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) followed by pyrolysis is developed. The enhanced catalytic activity of the Fe&#8208;SACs benefits from the highly dispersed atoms, mesopores, as well as the regulated coordination environment of single&#8208;atom active sites induced by metalloproteins.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit unparalleled atomic utilization and catalytic efficiency, yet it is challenging to modulate SACs with highly dispersed single&#8208;atoms, mesopores, and well&#8208;regulated coordination environment simultaneously&#160;and ultimately maximize their catalytic efficiency. Here, a generalized strategy to construct highly active ferric&#8208;centered SACs (Fe&#8208;SACs) is developed successfully via a biomineralization strategy that enables the homogeneous encapsulation of metalloproteins within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) followed by pyrolysis. The results demonstrate that the constructed metalloprotein&#8208;MOF&#8208;templated Fe&#8208;SACs achieve up to 23&#8208;fold and 47&#8208;fold higher activity compared to those using metal ions as the single&#8208;atom source and those with large mesopores induced by Zn evaporation, respectively, as well as up to a 25&#8208;fold and 1900&#8208;fold higher catalytic efficiency compared to natural enzymes and natural&#8208;enzyme&#8208;immobilized MOFs. Furthermore, this strategy can be generalized to a variety of metal&#8208;containing metalloproteins and enzymes. The enhanced catalytic activity of Fe&#8208;SACs benefits from the highly dispersed atoms, mesopores, as well as the regulated coordination environment of single&#8208;atom active sites induced by metalloproteins. Furthermore, the developed Fe&#8208;SACs act as an excellent and effective therapeutic platform for suppressing tumor cell growth. This work advances the development of highly efficient SACs using metalloproteins&#8208;MOFs as a template with diverse biotechnological applications.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Bioactive Nanomicelle&#8208;Based &#8220;One Stone for Multiple Birds&#8221; Strategy for Precision Therapy of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;one stone for multiple birds&#8221; strategy is proposed for therapy of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Three engineered conjugates can assemble into nanomicelles capable of inhibiting migration/activation of inflammatory cells and protecting smooth muscle cells from oxidative stress, calcification, and apoptosis. Intravenously delivered nanomicelles efficiently accumulate in aneurysms of rats and distribute in multiple pathological cells, thereby alleviating AAA progression.








Abstract
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains a lethal aortic disease in the elderly. Currently, no effective drugs can be clinically applied to prevent the development of AAA. Herein, a &#8220;one stone for multiple birds&#8221; strategy for AAA therapy is reported. As a proof of concept, three bioactive conjugates are designed and synthesized, which can assemble into nanomicelles. Cellularly, these nanomicelles significantly inhibit migration and activation of inflammatory cells as well as protect vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from induced oxidative stress, calcification and apoptosis, with the best effect for nanomicelles (TPTN) derived from a conjugate defined as TPT. After intravenous delivery, TPTN efficiently accumulates in the aneurysmal tissue of AAA rats, showing notable distribution in neutrophils, macrophages and VSMCs, all relevant to AAA pathogenesis. Whereas three examined nanomicelles effectively delay expansion of AAA in rats, TPTN most potently prevents AAA growth by simultaneously normalizing the pro&#8208;inflammatory microenvironment and regulating multiple pathological cells. TPTN is effective even at 0.2&#160;mg&#160;kg&#8722;1. Besides, TPTN can function as a bioactive nanoplatform for site&#8208;specifically delivering and triggerably releasing anti&#8208;aneurysmal drugs, affording synergistic therapeutic effects. Consequently, TPTN is a promising multi&#8208;bioactive nanotherapy and bioresponsive targeting delivery nanocarrier for effective therapy of AAA and other inflammatory vascular diseases.

         <title>A Smart Photothermal Nanosystem with an Intrinsic Temperature&#8208;Control Mechanism for Thermostatic Treatment of Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart photothermal nanosystem with an intrinsic temperature&#8208;control mechanism is established for thermostatic treatment of bacterial infections. In contrast to conventional photothermal therapy with severe thermal damage, the reported smart photothermal nanosystem provides an internal protection mechanism on healthy tissues and/or organs, which remarkably accelerates the recovery of bacteria&#8208;infected wounds.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted extensive attention in disease treatments. However, conventional photothermal systems do not possess a temperature&#8208;control mechanism, which poses a serious risk to healthy tissues and/or organs due to inevitable thermal damage. Herein, a smart photothermal nanosystem with an intrinsic temperature&#8208;control mechanism for thermostatic treatment of bacterial infections is reported. The smart photothermal nanosystem is constructed by loading a thermochromic material into a hollow&#8208;structured silica nanocarrier, in which the thermochromic material is composed of naturally occurring phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs), a proton&#8208;responsive spirolactone, and a proton source. The resulting nanosystem shows strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and efficient photothermal conversion in solid PCMs but becomes NIR&#8208;transparent when PCMs are melted upon NIR irradiation. Such an attractive feature can precisely regulate the photothermal equilibrium temperature to the melting point of PCMs, regardless of the variation in external experimental parameters. In contrast to conventional PTT with severe thermal damage, the reported smart photothermal nanosystem provides an internal protection mechanism on healthy tissues and/or organs, which remarkably accelerates the recovery of bacteria&#8208;infected wounds. The smart photothermal nanosystem is a versatile PTT platform, holding great promise in the safe and efficient treatment of bacterial infections and multimodality synergistic therapy.

         <title>Janus Helical Ribbon Structure of Ordered Nanowire Films for Flexible Solar Thermoelectric Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solar thermoelectric generator is fabricated with outstanding temperature difference and the property of synergistic utilization of solar energy and waste heat by in situ redox reaction to construct n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type, and photothermal sides in one nanowire film that is the reverse side of passive radiative cooling film. The ordered nanowire film also imparts the solar thermoelectric generator with better thermoelectrical performance.








Abstract
Solar thermoelectric devices play a significant role in addressing the problem of global warming, owing to their unique features of converting both waste heat and solar energy directly into electricity. Herein, a flexible 3D Janus helical ribbon architecture is designed, starting from well&#8208;aligned tellurium (Te) nanowire film, using an in situ redox process reacting with Ag+ and Cu2+ resulting in n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type, and photothermal sides in one film. Remarkably, the device shows all&#8208;day electricity generation and large temperature gradient by coupling the cold side with a passive radiative cooling technique and the hot side with a selective solar absorption technique, showing a temperature gradient of 29.5 K, which is much higher than previously reported devices under a low solar radiation of only 614 W m&#8722;2. Especially, the device can still generate electricity even at night. The present strategy offers a new way for heat management by efficiently utilizing solar energy and the cold of the universe.

Herein, a flexible 3D Janus helical ribbon architecture is designed, starting from well-aligned tellurium (Te) nanowire film, using an in situ redox process reacting with Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; resulting in n-type, p-type, and photothermal sides in one film. Remarkably, the device shows all-day electricity generation and large temperature gradient by coupling the cold side with a passive radiative cooling technique and the hot side with a selective solar absorption technique, showing a temperature gradient of 29.5 K, which is much higher than previously reported devices under a low solar radiation of only 614 W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Especially, the device can still generate electricity even at night. The present strategy offers a new way for heat management by efficiently utilizing solar energy and the cold of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Local Diverse Polarization Optimized Comprehensive Energy&#8208;Storage Performance in Lead&#8208;Free Superparaelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent energy&#8208;storage properties with an ultrahigh recoverable energy storage density &#8776;10.59 J cm&#8722;3 and a large efficiency &#8776;87.6% are realized in lead&#8208;free relaxor ferroelectrics, which is responsible by the local diverse polarization design, leading to the ultrasmall polar nanoregions, reduced heat loss, substantially enhanced polarization, and breakdown electric field compared to single polarization configuration.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free dielectric ceramics with ultrahigh energy&#8208;storage performance are the core components used in next&#8208;generation advanced pulse power capacitors. However, the low energy storage density largely hinders their development towards miniaturization, lightweight, and integration. Here, an effective strategy of constructing local diverse polarization is designed in superparaelectrics to realize an ultrahigh energy storage density of &#8776;10.59 J cm&#8722;3 as well as a large efficiency of &#8776;87.6%. The excellent comprehensive energy&#8208;storage performance is mainly attributed to the design of ultrasmall polar nanoregions with local diverse polarization configuration, confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy, leading to the reduced heat loss, substantially enhanced polarization, and breakdown electric field compared to ceramics with single polarization configuration. Benefiting from these features, outstanding temperature/frequency/cycling stability and superior charge/discharge performance (power density &#8776;187.5 MW cm&#8722;3, discharge energy density &#8776;3.52 J cm&#8722;3, discharge rate &#8776;77&#160;ns) are also achieved. This work demonstrates that local diverse polarization is a super strategy to design new dielectric materials with high energy&#8208;storage performance.

         <title>Metal Confined in 2D Membranes for Molecular Recognition and Sieving towards Ethylene/Ethane Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rationally confining metal into 2D&#160;sub&#8208;nanometer channels, a graphene oxide (GO) interlayer with size&#8208;sieving property and molecular recognition effect can efficiently discriminate ethylene over ethane. The GO membrane exhibits outstanding separation performance far exceeding the ethylene/ethane upper&#8208;bound. The metal confined in the 2D nanostructure will be of interest in other fields such as single&#8208;atom catalysis, sensors, and energy conversion.








Abstract
Membranes with nanochannels have exhibited great potential in molecular separations, while it remains a great challenge to separate molecules with very close physical properties and kinetic diameters (e.g., ethylene/ethane) owing to the lack of size&#8208;sieving property and specific affinity. Herein, a metal confined 2D&#160;sub&#8208;nanometer channel is reported to successfully discriminate ethylene over ethane via molecular recognition and sieving. Transition metal cations are paired with polyelectrolyte anions to achieve high dissociation activity, forming reversible complexation with ethylene. Aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy observes that the metals with size of &#8776;2&#160;nm are uniformly confined in graphene oxide (GO) interlayer channels with average height of &#8776;0.44&#160;nm, thereby cooperating the size&#8208;sieving effect with a molecular recognition ability toward ethylene and stimulating its selective transport over ethane. The resulting ultrathin (&#8776;60&#160;nm) membrane exhibits superior ethylene/ethane separation performance far beyond the polymeric upper&#8208;bound. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the metal@2D interlayer channel provides a molecular recognition pathway for selective gas transport. The proposed metal confined in 2D channel with molecular recognition and sieving properties would have broad application in other related fields such as single&#8208;atom catalysis, sensor and energy conversion.

         <title>A Optically Controlled Virtual Microsensor for Biomarker Detection In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new technique for biomarker detection in vivo, named as &#8220;optically controlled virtual microsensor&#8221; (OCViM), is developed by employing a specially shaped laser beam as a virtual handle and a fluorescent nanoprobe as the sensor tip. With the advantages of noninvasiveness, active control, and high resolution, OCViM demonstrates great potential for studying thrombosis in living zebrafish.








Abstract
Current technologies for the real&#8208;time analysis of biomarkers in vivo, such as needle&#8208;type microelectrodes and molecular imaging methods based on exogenous contrast agents, are still facing great challenges in either invasive detection or lack of active control of the imaging probes. In this study, by combining the design concepts of needle&#8208;type microelectrodes and the fluorescence imaging method, a new technique is developed for detecting biomarkers in vivo, named as &#8220;optically controlled virtual microsensor&#8221; (OCViM). OCViM is established by the organic integration of a specially shaped laser beam and fluorescent nanoprobe, which serve as the virtual handle and sensor tip, respectively. The laser beam can trap and manipulate the nanoprobe in a programmable manner, and meanwhile excite it to generate fluorescence emission for biosensing. On this basis, fully active control of the nanoprobe is achieved noninvasively in vivo, and multipoint detection can be realized at sub&#8208;micrometer resolution by shifting a nanoprobe among multiple positions. By using OCViM, the overexpression and heterogenous distribution of biomarkers in the thrombus is studied in living zebrafish, which is further utilized for the evaluation of antithrombotic drugs. OCViM may provide a powerful tool for the mechanism study of thrombus progression and the evaluation of antithrombotic drugs.

Industry&#8211;academia cooperative activities have decreased in South Korea, despite the government's expansion of R&amp;D investment, presenting challenges as cutting&#8208;edge technologies develop rapidly. A new policy of &#8220;3N&#8221;, National Lab, National Facility, and National Research Team in the field of materials, has been launched recently, to enhance the cooperative networks. More diversity in activating the open innovation ecosystem is needed.








Abstract
The current status and policy directions of Republic of Korea's industry&#8211;academia cooperation in materials research are introduced. Industry&#8211;academia cooperation has various forms, such as contract research, joint research, technology transfer, technology assistance, as well as talent development between universities and industry. The actual characteristics of industry&#8211;academia cooperation are differentiated, depending on research models such as curiosity&#8208;driven research, market&#8208;driven research, and scenario&#8208;driven research. In addition, there are diverse forms of cooperation, ranging from attaining one&#8208;off cooperation goals, to implementing a series of cooperation, to forging sustainable partnership through sharing of values. The efforts and tasks supporting industry&#8211;academia cooperation, and the diverse industry&#8211;academia cooperative activities, are considered herein from the perspective of the Korean government's policy. Policy recommendations for the industry&#8211;academia cooperation, based on the current state and tasks of materials field, are also suggested.

         <title>Morphology&#8208;Control Growth of Graphene Islands by Nonlinear Carbon Supply</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional nonlinear&#8208;carbon&#8208;supply growth strategy for synthesizing hexagonal graphene with specific sizes is presented. The dynamic adjustment of the carbon supply and precise control of the growth and etching processes result in the direct growth of graphene&#8208;based tunnel&#8208;junction structures and small&#8208;gapped quasi&#8208;monolayer films. This study provides a foundation for directly synthesizing 2D materials for applications in highly integrated electronics.








Abstract
Controlling the morphology of graphene and other 2D materials in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth is crucial because the morphology reflects the crystal quality of as&#8208;synthesized nanomaterials in a certain way, and consequently it indirectly represents the physical properties of 2D materials such as bandgap, selective ion transportation, and impermeability. However, precise control of the morphology is limited by the complex formation mechanism and sensitive growth&#8208;environment factors of graphene. Therefore, the CVD synthesis of single&#8208;crystal hexagonal&#8208;shaped graphene islands with specific sizes is challenging. Herein, an unconventional nonlinear&#8208;carbon&#8208;supply growth strategy is proposed to realize controllable CVD growth of desired hexagonal graphene islands with specific sizes on Cu substrates. Large&#8208;area graphene films of isolated islands with desired densities, sizes, and distances between the islands are&#160;successfully synthesized. Subsequently, the direct growth of a planar&#8208;tunnel&#8208;junction structure based on two parallel gapped graphene islands is&#160;achieved by specific adjustment of the growth and etching processes of graphene CVD synthesis. It is therefore demonstrated that the nonlinear&#8208;carbon&#8208;supply growth strategy is a reliable method for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality graphene and can facilitate the direct growth of graphene&#8208;based nanodevices in the future.

The dynamic adjustment of the carbon supply and precise control of the growth and etching processes result in the direct growth of graphene-based tunnel-junction structures and small-gapped quasi-monolayer films. This study provides a foundation for directly synthesizing 2D materials for applications in highly integrated electronics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling the morphology of graphene and other 2D materials in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth is crucial because the morphology reflects the crystal quality of as-synthesized nanomaterials in a certain way, and consequently it indirectly represents the physical properties of 2D materials such as bandgap, selective ion transportation, and impermeability. However, precise control of the morphology is limited by the complex formation mechanism and sensitive growth-environment factors of graphene. Therefore, the CVD synthesis of single-crystal hexagonal-shaped graphene islands with specific sizes is challenging. Herein, an unconventional nonlinear-carbon-supply growth strategy is proposed to realize controllable CVD growth of desired hexagonal graphene islands with specific sizes on Cu substrates. Large-area graphene films of isolated islands with desired densities, sizes, and distances between the islands are&#160;successfully synthesized. Subsequently, the direct growth of a planar-tunnel-junction structure based on two parallel gapped graphene islands is&#160;achieved by specific adjustment of the growth and etching processes of graphene CVD synthesis. It is therefore demonstrated that the nonlinear-carbon-supply growth strategy is a reliable method for the synthesis of high-quality graphene and can facilitate the direct growth of graphene-based nanodevices in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctionality of Li2SrNb2O7: Memristivity, Tunable Rectification, Ferroelasticity, and Ferroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered perovskite Li2SrNb2O7&#160;bulk single crystals are synthesized. At room temperature, Li ions show significant intralayer activities, which creates a giant memristivity and a rectification effect combining with a relaxation upon time. At low temperature, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity and in&#8208;plane antiferroelectricity develop, and the rectification state becomes robust. The results demonstrate a selectively controlling of the ferroic orders and ionic migration.








Abstract
Layered Li2SrNb2O7, an inorganic oxide in its bulk single&#8208;crystalline form, is experimentally demonstrated to exhibit multiple structural facets such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, and antiferroelectricity. The transition from a room temperature (RT) centrosymmetric structure to a low&#8208;temperature out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric and in&#8208;plane antiferroelectric structure and the low&#8208;temperature (LT) ferroelectric domain configuration are unveiled in TEM, piezoresponse force microscopy, and polarization loop studies. Li2SrNb2O7&#160;also exhibits highly tunable ferroelasticity and excellent Li+ in&#8208;plane conduction, which leads to a giant in&#8208;plane memristor behavior and an in&#8208;plane electronic conductivity increase by three orders of magnitude by electric poling at room RT). The accumulation of Li+ vacancies at the crystal&#8211;electrode interface is visualized using in&#160;situ optical microscopy. The Li&#8208;ionic biased state shows a clear in&#8208;plane rectification effect combined with a significant relaxation upon time at RT. Relaxation can be fully suppressed at LTs such as 200&#160;K, and utilizing an electric field cooling, a stable rectification can be achieved at 200&#160;K. The results shed light on the selective control of multifunctionalities such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, and ionic&#8208;migration&#8208;mediated effects (a memristor effect and rectification) in a single&#8208;phase bulk material utilizing, for example, different directions, temperatures, frequencies, and magnitudes of electric field.

         <title>Efficient Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Heavy&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient In(Zn)As&#8211;In(Zn)P&#8211;GaP&#8211;ZnS colloidal quantum dot (CQD) light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) that operate with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 13.3% at 1006 nm are reported. The implementation of a thin hole&#8208;transporting poly(vinylcarbazole) (PVK) layer at the electron&#8208;injecting side of the device gives rise to improved charge balance and luminescence efficiencies.








Abstract
Short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) light emission is important for a diverse range of modern applications, such as eye&#8208;safe depth sensing, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), facial recognition, eye tracking, optical communication, and health&#8208;monitoring technologies. However, there are a very limited number of known semiconductors that can emit efficiently in the SWIR spectral range. Presently, SWIR light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on colloidal quantum dots (CQD) are dominated by lead chalcogenide systems, despite the presence of heavy metal and modest efficiencies. Here, a highly efficient SWIR LED based on heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free indium arsenide (InAs) core&#8211;shell CQDs is presented. In the LED design, the implementation of an otherwise hole&#8208;transporting poly(vinylcarbazole) (PVK) layer on the electron&#8208;injecting side of the device stack leads to a surprising enhancement in device performance, giving remarkably high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 13.3% at 1006 nm. Single&#8208;carrier device and optical investigations reveal the origins of enhancement to be the electronic decoupling of the CQD layer with the electron&#8208;injecting zinc oxide (ZnO) layer, which mitigates luminescence quenching and improves charge balance. This work marks one of the highest efficiencies reported for heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free solution&#8208;processed LEDs in the SWIR spectral region, and can find significant applications in emerging consumer electronic technologies.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Design of Molybdenum&#8211;Selenium Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical role of the synergy between nonmetallic single atoms and transition&#8208;metal single atoms for the promotion of electrochemical CO2 reduction performance is highlighted. This is similar to the synergy of nonmetallic elements and metal active centers in enzymes. More importantly, the distance effect between nonmetallic single atoms and transition&#8208;metal single atoms is clarified.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) is becoming an increasingly important technology for achieving carbon neutrality. Inspired by the structure of naturally occurring Mo&#8208;dependent enzymes capable of activating CO2, a heteronuclear Mo&#8211;Se dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom electrocatalyst (MoSA&#8211;SeSA) for ECR into CO with a Faradaic efficiency of above 90% over a broad potential window from &#8722;0.4 to &#8722;1.0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode is demonstrated here. Both operando characterization and theoretical simulation results verify that MoSA acts as central atoms that directly interact with the ECR feedstock and intermediates, whereas the SeSA adjacent to MoSA modulates the electronic structure of MoSA through long&#8208;range electron delocalization for inhibiting MoSA poisoning caused by strong CO adsorption. In addition, the SeSAs far from MoSA help suppress the competing hydrogen evolution side reaction and accelerate the CO2 transport by repelling H2O. This work provides new insight into the precise regulation and in&#8208;depth understanding of multisite synergistic catalysis at the atomic scale.

         <title>A Honeycomb&#8208;Like Porous Crystalline Hetero&#8208;Electrocatalyst for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of honeycomb&#8208;like metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)@covalent organic framework (COF) heterostructures with integrated porous MOF template and ultrathin COF coating are synthesized and successfully applied in efficient CO2 electroreduction to CH4.








Abstract
Porous heterostructured electrocatalysts with multifunctionality and synergistic effect have much benefit for efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet it still remains a daunting challenge to explore heterostructures based on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in this field. Here, a series of honeycomb&#8208;like porous crystalline hetero&#8208;electrocatalysts (MCH&#8208;X, X&#160;= 1&#8211;4, X stands for the numbered sample obtained from different MOF doses in the synthesis of the MCH) are synthesized, and these are successfully applied in electrocatalytic CO2RR. The specially designed heterostructures with integrated porous MOF&#8208;template and ultrathin COF&#8208;coating enable efficient CO2 adsorption/activation and conversion into CH4. The best of them, MCH&#8208;3, shows greatly inhibited H2 evolution, excellent current density (&#8722;398.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), and superior FECH4${\rm{F}}{{\rm{E}}_{{\rm{C}}{{\rm{H}}_4}}}$ (76.7%) to the physical mixture (38.0%), the MOF@COF without the honeycomb&#8208;like morphology (47.7%), and the bare COF (37.5%) and MOF (15.9%) at &#8722;1.0&#160;V. Based on the density functional theory calculations and various characterizations, the vital roles of the MOF in facilitating CO2 adsorption/activation, stabilizing intermediates, and conquering the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step are intensively studied.

         <title>Chemical Welding of the Electrode&#8211;Electrolyte Interface by Zn&#8208;Metal&#8208;Initiated In Situ Gelation for Ultralong&#8208;Life Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ gel electrolyte initiated by Zn metal produces chemical welding between the anode and the electrolyte, enabling a well&#8208;bonded and water&#8208;poor electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface that suppresses the growth of Zn dendrites and side reactions while improving the Zn utilization up to 87%. The as&#8208;prepared cells showcase superior cycling stability, with an ultralong life of over 212&#160;days.








Abstract
A compatible and robust electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface is favorable in resolving the severe dendritic growth and side reactions of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries toward commercial&#8208;standard lifespan and charging&#8211;discharging rate. Herein, a chemical welding strategy through in&#160;situ construction of a gel electrolyte that enables Zn&#8208;ion batteries to achieve ultralong life and reversibility is reported. The gel electrolyte is spontaneously formed on the Zn anode surface by redox polymerization with the initiation of Zn metal. The direct participation of the Zn anode in the chemical synthesis of the gel electrolyte brings a well&#8208;bonded and water&#8208;poor electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, which not only alleviates side reactions but also enables preferential (002) Zn deposition. The in&#160;situ symmetric cell thus prepared delivers an ultralong lifespan of 5100&#160;h (&gt;212&#160;days), and a hybrid capacitor with the in&#160;situ electrolyte runs smoothly over 40&#160;000&#160;cycles at 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Even at an ultrahigh current density of 40&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;and capacity of 40&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, the cell still operates stably for 240&#160;h, alongside a high Zn utilization with 87% depth of discharge. The in&#160;situ gel electrolyte integrating robust interface and preparation of all&#8208;in&#8208;one cells demonstrate a commercializable path for aqueous Zn&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Strong Electronic Metal&#8211;Support Interaction between Iridium Single Atoms and a WO3 Support Promotes Highly Efficient and Robust CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir single atoms are stably anchored on the WO3 support via a strong electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI). The catalyst demonstrates an excellent activity and stability for the CO2 cycloaddition of styrene oxide to styrene carbonate at relatively low temperatures, superior to most other heterogeneous competitors. Such a great performance is understood as a direct result of the strong EMSI effect.








Abstract
The carbon dioxide (CO2) cycloaddition of epoxides to cyclic carbonates is of great industrial importance owing to the high economical values of its products. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have great potential in CO2 cycloaddition by virtue of their high atom utilization efficiency and desired activity, but they generally suffer from poor reaction stability and catalytic activity arising from the weak interaction between the active centers and the supports. In this work, Ir single atoms stably anchored on the WO3 support (Ir1&#8211;WO3) are developed with a strong electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI). Superior CO2 cycloaddition is realized in the Ir1&#8211;WO3 catalyst via the EMSI effect: 100% conversion efficiency for the CO2 cycloaddition of styrene oxide to styrene carbonate after 15&#160;h at 40 &#176;C and excellent stability with no degradation even after ten reaction cycles for a total of more than 150&#160;h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the EMSI effect results in significant charge redistribution between the Ir single atoms and the WO3 support, and consequently lowers the energy barrier associated with epoxide ring opening. This work furnishes new insights into the catalytic mechanism of CO2 cycloaddition and would guide the design of stable SACs for efficient CO2 cycloaddition reactions.

         <title>Triple&#8208;Function Electrolyte Regulation toward Advanced Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn&#8208;battery issues in aqueous media are fundamentally studied, revealing that besides the well&#8208;known H2 evolution and dendrite growth, Zn electrodes also face an O2&#8208;involving corrosion reaction. Thus, a one&#8208;off electrolyte regulation is proposed by introducing the triple&#8208;function C3H7Na2O6P additive, which can take effects to suppress the O2&#8208;involving corrosion reaction, water decomposition, and dendritic deposition during the shelf time.








Abstract
The poor Zn reversibility has been criticized for limiting applications of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs); however, its behavior in aqueous media is not fully uncovered yet. Here, this knowledge gap is addressed, indicating that Zn electrodes face a O2&#8208;involving corrosion, besides H2 evolution and dendrite growth. Differing from aqueous Li/Na batteries, removing O2 cannot enhance ZIB performance because of the aggravated competing H2 evolution. To address Zn issues, a one&#8208;off electrolyte strategy is reported by introducing the triple&#8208;function C3H7Na2O6P, which can take effects during the shelf time of battery. It regulates H+ concentration and reduces free&#8208;water activity, inhibiting H2 evolution. A self&#8208;healing solid/electrolyte interphase (SEI) can be triggered before battery operation, which suppresses O2 adsorption corrosion and dendritic deposition. Consequently, a high Zn reversibility of 99.6% is achieved under a high discharge depth of 85%. The pouch full&#8208;cell with a lean electrolyte displays a record lifespan with capacity retention of 95.5% after 500 cycles. This study not only looks deeply into Zn behavior in aqueous media but also underscores rules for the design of active metal anodes, including Zn and Li metals, during shelf time toward real applications.

A flexible and robust quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (QSSE) with a &#8220;tree&#8208;trunk&#8221; structure is designed for ultralong&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries, in which an in&#8208;situ&#8208;grown metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer covers the cellulose&#8208;based framework to form hierarchical ion&#8208;channels, enabling rapid ionic transfer kinetics and excellent durability.








Abstract
The construction of robust (quasi)&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) for flexible lithium&#8208;metal batteries is desirable but extremely challenging. Herein, a novel, flexible, and robust quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (QSSE) with a &#8220;tree&#8208;trunk&#8221; design is reported for ultralong&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). An in&#8208;situ&#8208;grown metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer covers the cellulose&#8208;based framework to form hierarchical ion&#8208;channels, enabling rapid ionic transfer kinetics and excellent durability. A conductivity of 1.36&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, a transference number of 0.72, an electrochemical window of 5.26&#160;V, and a good rate performance are achieved. The flexible LMBs fabricated with as&#8208;designed QSSEs deliver areal capacity of up to 3.1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at the initial cycle with high mass loading of 14.8&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 in Li&#8208;NCM811 cells and can retain &#8776;80% capacity retention after 300 cycles. An ultralong&#8208;life of 3000 cycles (6000&#160;h) is also achieved in Li&#8208;LiFePO4 cells. This work presents a promising route in constructing a flexible QSSE toward ultralong&#8208;life LMBs, and also provides a design rationale for material and structure development in the area of energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Universal Metasurfaces for Complete Linear Control of Coherent Light Transmission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is proved&#160;that a bilayer nanostructure array is sufficient to completely control amplitudes, polarizations, and phases of coherent light transmission. Universal metasurfaces with such full control are realized with silicon nanostructures. A new kind of 3D&#160;vector hologram and a general platform for arbitrary optical transformation are demonstrated. This work provides another degree of freedom in light transmission control.








Abstract
Recent advances in metasurfaces and optical nanostructures have enabled complex control of incident light with optically thin devices. However, it has thus far been unclear whether it is possible to achieve complete linear control of coherent light transmission, that is, independent control of polarization, amplitude, and phase for both input polarization states, with just a single, thin nanostructure array. Here, it is proved possible, and a universal metasurface is proposed, a bilayer array of high&#8208;index elliptic cylinders&#160;that possesses a complete degree of optical freedom with fully designable chirality and anisotropy. The completeness of achievable light control is mathematically shown with corresponding Jones matrices, new types of 3D&#160;holographic schemes that&#160;were&#160;formerly impossible are experimentally demonstrated, and a systematic way of realizing any input&#8208;state&#8208;sensitive vector linear optical device is presented. The results unlock previously inaccessible degrees of freedom in light transmission control.

         <title>Quantum&#8208;Engineered Devices Based on 2D Materials for Next&#8208;Generation Information Processing and Storage</title>

2D layered materials, exhibiting exotic structural, electrical, and magnetic properties, provide a superior platform for implementing novel quantum devices&#8212;from tunneling diodes and transistors, to spin&#8208;FETs, valley&#8208;FETs, and qubits. The physics are highlighted and the opportunities and challenges of exploiting the unique quantum properties of 2D materials to enable revolutionary ultra&#8208;energy&#8208;efficient quantum devices are analyzed.








Abstract
As an approximation to the quantum state of solids, the band theory, developed nearly seven decades ago, fostered the advance of modern integrated solid&#8208;state electronics, one of the most successful technologies in the history of human civilization. Nonetheless, their rapidly growing energy consumption and accompanied environmental issues call for more energy&#8208;efficient electronics and optoelectronics, which necessitate the exploration of more advanced quantum mechanical effects, such as band&#8208;to&#8208;band tunneling, spin&#8211;orbit coupling, spin&#8211;valley locking, and quantum entanglement. The emerging 2D layered materials, featured by their exotic electrical, magnetic, optical, and structural properties, provide a revolutionary low&#8208;dimensional and manufacture&#8208;friendly platform (and many more opportunities) to implement these quantum&#8208;engineered devices, compared to the traditional electronic materials system. Here, the progress in quantum&#8208;engineered devices is reviewed and the opportunities/challenges of exploiting 2D materials are analyzed to highlight their unique quantum properties that enable novel energy&#8208;efficient devices, and useful insights to quantum device engineers and 2D&#8208;material scientists are provided.

         <title>Nonequilibrium Lattice Dynamics in Photoexcited 2D Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonequilibrium structures of 2D perovskites are studied using ultrafast X&#8208;ray diffraction. Diffraction peaks post&#8208;photoexcitation increase in intensity and narrow over 1 ns, suggesting an increase in long&#8208;range order within the lead iodide octahedra. These results are corroborated using ultrafast photoluminescence, which shows redshifting and narrowing of photoluminescence peaks on the same timescale as transient X&#8208;ray diffraction.








Abstract
Interplay between structural and photophysical properties of metal halide perovskites is critical to their utility in optoelectronics, but there is limited understanding of lattice response upon photoexcitation. Here, 2D perovskites butylammonium lead iodide, (BA)2PbI4, and phenethylammonium lead iodide, (PEA)2PbI4, are investigated using ultrafast transient X&#8208;ray diffraction as a function of optical excitation fluence to discern structural dynamics. Both powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence linewidths narrow over 1 ns following optical excitation for the fluence range studied, concurrent with slight redshifting of the optical bandgaps. These observations are attributed to transient relaxation and ordering of distorted lead iodide octahedra stimulated mainly by electron&#8211;hole pair creation. The c axis expands up to 0.37% over hundreds of picoseconds; reflections sampling the a and b axes undergo one tenth of this expansion with the same timescale. Post&#8208;photoexcitation appearance of the (110) reflection in (BA)2PbI4 would suggest a transient phase transition,&#160;however, through new single&#8208;crystal XRD, reflections are found that violate glide plane conditions in the reported Pbca structure. The static structure space group is reassigned as P212121. With this, a nonequilibrium phase transition is ruled out. These findings offer increased understanding of remarkable lattice response in 2D perovskites upon excitation.

         <title>Sprayable Hydrogel for Instant Sealing of Vascular Anastomosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bleeding related complications following vascular surgery represent a real challenge for patients and their clinicians. Commercially available materials force clinicians to choose between adequate performance or adequate biocompatibility. An adhesive hydrogel approach, combining oxidized dextran, oxidized alginate, and polyamidoamine (PAMAM) allows sealing at the tissue:graft interface while maintaining biocompatibility. The biocompatibility and functionality of this family of materials is been tested in small and large animal models.








Abstract
Bleeding&#8208;related complications following vascular surgeries occur in up to half of the patients&#8212;500&#8201;000 cases annually in the United States alone. This results in additional procedures, increased mortality rate, and prolonged hospitalization, posing a burden on the healthcare system. Commercially available materials rely, in large, on forming covalent bonds between the tissue and the biomaterial to achieve adhesion. Here, it is shown that a biomaterial based on oxidized alginate and oxidized dextran together with polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer amine provides simultaneous electrostatic and covalent interactions between the biomaterial and the tissue, maximizing adhesion. This study finds that the material withstands supraphysiological pressures (&#8776;300&#160;mmHg) and prevents bleeding in a rabbit aortic puncture model and in a pig carotid bilateral poly(tetrafluoroethylene) graft model&#8212;achieving superior performance to commercially available materials such as Tisseel and BioGlue. Material biocompatibility is validated in comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines, including in vitro neutral red uptake test, subcutaneous implantation in rabbits, ames genotoxicity, and guinea pig maximization test. This material has the potential to provide with adequate seal and reduced complications following complex vascular surgeries, including hard&#8208;to&#8208;seal tissue&#8211;graft interfaces.

         <title>Over 200 &#176;C Broad Temperature Lasers Reconstructed from Blue Phase Polymer Scaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Blue phase liquid crystal (BPLC) lasers have received extensive attention and potential applications in sensors, displays, and anticounterfeiting, owing to their unique three&#8208;dimensional photonic bandgap. However, the working temperature range of such BPLC lasers is insufficient and investigations are required to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Herein, a broad temperature reconstructed laser is successfully achieved in dye&#8208;doped polymer&#8208;stabilized blue phase liquid crystals (DD&#8208;PSBPLCs) with an unprecedented working temperature range of 25&#176;C &#8764; 230&#176;C based on a robust polymer scaffold, which combines the thermal stability and the tunability from the system. The broad temperature lasing stems from the high thermal stability of the robust polymerized system used there, which affords enough reflected and matached fluorescent signals. While the temperature&#8208;tunable lasing behavior of the DD&#8208;PSBPLCs is associated with the phase transition of the unpolymerized content (&#8764; 60 wt%) in the system, which endows with a reconstructed characteristic of BP lasers including a U&#8208;shaped lasing threshold, a reversible lasing wavelength and an obvious lasing enhancement at about 70 &#176;C. This work not only provides a new idea for the design of broad temperature BPLCs lasers, but also sets out important insight in innovative microstructure changes for novel multi&#8208;functional organic optic devices.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Sustainable Defect&#8208;Passivation for Stable Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>

Abstract
The generation of photoinduced defects and freely moving halogen ions is dynamically updated in real time. Accordingly, most reported strategies are static and short&#8208;term, which make their improvements in photostability very limited. Therefore, seeking for new passivation strategies to match the dynamic characteristics of defect generation is very urgent. Without newly generated defects, the passivation molecule should exist in the configuration which would not become the initiation sites for defect generation. With newly generated defects, the passivation molecule should transfer into the other configuration which owns the passivation sites. Herein, we adopted a classical photoisomeric molecule spiropyran, whose pre and post isomeric forms meet the requirements for two different configurations, to realize the state transition once the photo induced defects appear during subsequent operation and dynamic capture for continuous renewal defects. Consequently, spiropyrans worked as the light&#8208;triggered and self&#8208;healing sustainable passivation sites to realize continuous defects repairing. The target devices kept 93% and 99% of their initial power conversion efficiencies after 456&#160;h aging under ultraviolet illumination and 1200&#160;h aging under full&#8208;spectrum illumination, respectively. This work provides a novel concept of sustainable passivation strategy to realize continuous defect&#8208;passivation and film&#8208;healing in perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelled Nanomotors with Alloyed Engine for Emergency Rescue of Traumatic Brain Injury</title>

Abstract
In severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI), acute oxidative stress and inflammatory cascades rapidly spread to cause irreversible brain damage and low survival rate within minutes. Therefore, developing feasible solution for the quick&#8208;treatment of life&#8208;threatening emergency is urgently demanded to earn time for hospital treatment. We herein carefully constructed Janus catalysis&#8208;driven nanomotors (JCNs) via plasma&#8208;induced alloying technology and sputtering&#8208;caused half coating strategy. The theoretical calculation and experiment results indicated that heteroatom&#8208;doping alloyed engine endowed JCNs much higher catalytic activity for removing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) than common Pt&#8208;based engine. When JCNs were dropped to the surface of ruptured skull, they can effectively catalyze endogenous hydrogen peroxide, which induces movement as fuels to promote JCNs to deep brain lesions for further nanocatalysts&#8208;mediated cascade&#8208;blocking therapy (CBT). Results demonstrated that JCNs successfully blocked the inflammatory cascades, thereby reversing multiple behavioral defects and dramatically declining the mortality of sTBI mice. Together, this work provides a revolutionary nanomotors&#8208;based strategy to sense brain injury and scavenge oxidative stress. Meanwhile, our JCNs provide a feasible strategy to adapt various first aid scenarios due to their self&#8208;propelled movement combined with highly multienzymes&#8208;like catalytic activity, exhibiting tremendous therapeutic potential to help people for emergency pretreatment.

         <title>Strong and Tough Supramolecular Microneedle Patches with Ultrafast Dissolution and Rapid&#8208;onset Capabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dissolving microneedle (DMN) patches are emerging as a minimally&#8208;invasive and efficient transdermal drug delivery platform. Generally, noncrystalline, water&#8208;soluble, and high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers are employed in DMN because their sufficient intermolecular interactions can endow DMN with necessary mechanical strength and toughness. However, high viscosity and heavy chain entanglement of polymer solutions greatly hinder processing and dissolution of polymeric DMNs. Here, we describe a strong and tough supramolecular DMN made of highly water&#8208;soluble cyclodextrin (CD) derivatives. Due to the synergy of multiple supramolecular interactions, CD DMN patch exhibits robust mechanical strength outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymeric DMNs. CD DMN displays ultrafast dissolution (&lt; 30 s) in skin models by virtue of the dynamic and weak noncovalent bonds, which also enables CD DMN and its payloads to diffuse rapidly into the deep skin layer. Moreover, the unique supramolecular structure of CD allows CD DMN to load not only hydrophilic drugs (e.g., rhodamine B as model) but also hydrophobic model drugs (e.g., ibuprofen). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, CD DMN loading ibuprofen shows a rapid onset of therapeutic action in a xylene&#8208;induced acute inflammation model in mice. This work opens a new avenue for the development of mechanically robust supramolecular DMN and broadens the applications of supramolecular materials.

         <title>Decoupled Electrochemical Hydrazine &#8220;Splitting&#8221; via Rechargeable Zn&#8208;Hydrazine Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Hydrogen generation via electrochemical splitting plays an important role to achieve hydrogen economy. However, the large&#8208;scale application is highly limited by high cost and low efficiency. Herein, a new type of rechargeable Zn&#8208;Hydrazine (Zn&#8208;Hz) battery is proposed and realized by a bifunctional electrocatalyst based on two separate cathodic reactions of hydrogen evolution (discharge: 2H2O + 2e&#8722; &#8594; H2 + 2OH&#8722;) and hydrazine oxidation (charge: 1/2N2H4 + 2OH&#8722; &#8594; 1/2N2 + 2H2O + 2e&#8722;). This Zn&#8208;Hz battery, driven by temporally decoupled electrochemical hydrazine splitting on cathode during discharge and charge processes, can generate separated hydrogen without purification. When the highly active bifunctional cathode of three&#8208;dimensional Mo2C/Ni@C/CS is paired with Zn foil, the Zn&#8208;Hz battery can achieve efficient hydrogen generation with low energy input of less than 0.4&#160;V (77.2&#160;kJ/mol) and high energy efficiency of 96%. Remarkably, this battery exhibits outstanding long&#8208;term stability for 600 cycles (200&#160;h), getting continuous hydrogen production on demand, which presents great potential for practical application.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Homojunction Organic Nonfullerene Photovoltaics Featuring Fundamentals Distinct from Bulk Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In contrast to classical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) in organic solar cells (OSCs), quasi&#8208;homojunction (QHJ) with extremely low donor contents (&#8804; 10 wt%) is unusual and generally yields much lower device efficiency. Here, we select representative polymer donors and nonfullerene acceptors to fabricate QHJ OSCs, and illustrate a complete picture for the operation mechanisms of high&#8208;efficiency QHJ devices. PTB7&#8208;Th:Y6 QHJ devices at donor: acceptor (D:A) ratios of 1:8 or 1:20 can achieve 95% or 64% of the efficiency obtained from its BHJ counterpart at the optimal D:A ratio of 1:1.2, respectively, whereas QHJ devices with other donors or acceptors suffer from rapid roll&#8208;off of efficiency when the donors are diluted. Moreover, these QHJ devices show superior thermal stability compared to their BHJ counterparts. We use a suite of electronic device measurements, current&#8208;sensing atomic force microscopy, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray scattering morphology characterization to elucidate the fundamentals of the high&#8208;performance QHJ devices. A large portion of free charges can be intrinsically generated in the neat Y6 domains rather than at the D/A interface. Y6 also serves as an ambipolar transport channel, so that hole transport can be realized with small amounts of donor PTB7&#8208;Th. The key role of the small amount of PTB7&#8208;Th is primarily to reduce charge recombination, likely assisted by enhancing quadrupolar fields within the Y6 itself, rather than the previously thought principal roles of light absorption, exciton splitting and hole transport.

Abstract
Fully aromatic conjugated covalent organic frameworks (FAC&#8208;COFs) with excellent physicochemical stability have been emerging as active semiconductors for diverse potential applications. Developing efficient synthesis methods for fabricating FAC&#8208;COFs will significantly facilitate the exploration over their material and photonic/electronic functionalities. Herein, a facile solvent&#8208;free strategy was developed for the synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional phthalocyanine&#8208;based FAC&#8208;COFs (FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COFs). Cyclopolymerization of benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8216;]bis[1,4]benzodioxin&#8208;2,3,9,10&#8208;tetracarbonitrile and quinoxalino[2&#8220;,3&#8221;:9,10]phenanthro[4,5&#8208;abc]phenazine&#8208;6,7,15,16&#8208;tetracarbonitrile in ZnCl2 leads to the fast formation and isolation of BB&#8208;FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COF and QPP&#8208;FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COF, respectively. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and electron microscopy analysis reveal their crystalline nature with sql topology and AA stacking configuration. Thermogravimetric analysis and immersion experiment indicate their excellent stability. The conductivity test demonstrates their high conductivity of 0.93&#8208;1.94&#215;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 owing to the fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated electronic structural nature. In particular, the as&#8208;prepared FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COFs show high&#8208;performance K+ storage in potassium&#8208;ion batteries due to their excellent conductivity, highly ordered and robust structure, and N/O&#8208;rich framework nature. Impressively, QPP&#8208;FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COF shows a record&#8208;large reversible capacity of 424&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 among organic electrodes after 100 cycles at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and the capacity retention of nearly 100% at 2000&#160;mA g&#8722;1 for over 10000 cycles. The present result should be helpful for designing and fabricating fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic frameworks towards energy storage.

&lt;p&gt;Fully aromatic conjugated covalent organic frameworks (FAC-COFs) with excellent physicochemical stability have been emerging as active semiconductors for diverse potential applications. Developing efficient synthesis methods for fabricating FAC-COFs will significantly facilitate the exploration over their material and photonic/electronic functionalities.

         <title>Overcoming the Outcoupling Limit of Perovskite Light&#8208;emitting Diodes with Artificially Formed Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art planar&#8208;structure perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is mainly limited by the outcoupling efficiency, which is around 20% and decreases significantly with the perovskite thickness. Here, we report an approach to artificially form textured perovskite films to boost the outcoupling limit of the PeLEDs. By manipulating the dwell time of antisolvents, the perovskite phase precipitation mechanism, film forming process, and surface texture can be finely controlled. The film surface roughness can be tuned from 15.3 to 241 nanometers, with haze increasing accordingly from 6% to &gt;90% for films with an average thickness of 1.5 micrometers. The light outcoupling limit increases accordingly from 11.7% for the flat PeLEDs to 26.5% for the textured PeLEDs due to photon scattering at the interface. Consequently, the EQE is boosted significantly from around 10% to 20.5% with an extraordinarily thick emissive layer of 1.5 micrometers. This study provides a novel way of forming light extraction nanostructures for perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Dielectric Polymer with Designable Large Motion under Low Electric Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dielectric elastomers can perform fast and large in&#8208;plane expansion/contraction due to electric field induced Maxwell stress. For robotic applications, it is often necessary that the in&#8208;plane actuation is converted into out&#8208;of&#8208;plane motions with mechanical frames. Despite their performance appeal, their high driving electric field (20&#8208;100&#160;V/&#956;m) demands bulky power accessories and severely compromises the durability. Here, we report a dielectric polymer that can be programmed into diverse motions actuated under a low electric field (2&#8208;10&#160;V/&#956;m). The material is a crystalline dynamic covalent network that can be reconfigured into arbitrary 3D geometries. This gives rise to a geometric effect that markedly amplifies the actuation, leading to designable large motions when the dielectric polymer is heated above its melting temperature to become a dielectric elastomer. Additionally, the crystallization transition enables dynamic multi&#8208;modal motions and active deployability. These attributes result in unique design versatility for soft robots.

         <title>Self&#8208;powered, Implantable, and Wirelessly&#8208;Controlled NO Generation System for Intracranial Neuroglioma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Gas therapy has been emerging technology for improving cancer therapy with high efficiency and low side effects. However, due to the existence of the gatekeeper of blood &#8211; brain barrier (BBB) and limited availability of current drug delivery systems, there still have no reports on gas therapy for intracranial neuroglioma. Herein, we report an integrated, self&#8208;powered and wirelessly&#8208;controlled gas therapy system composed of a self&#8208;powered triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and implantable nitric oxide (NO) releasing device for intracranial neuroglioma therapy. In the system, the patient self&#8208;driven TENG converts the mechanical energy of body movements into electricity as a sustainable and self&#8208;controlled power source. When delivering the energy to lighten LED light in the implantable NO releasing device via wireless control, the encapsulated NO donor s&#8208;nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) can generate NO gas to locally kill the glioma cells. We verify the efficacy of the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept system in subcutaneous 4T1 breast cancer model in mice and intracranial glioblastoma multiforme in rats. This self&#8208;powered gas therapy system has great potential to be an effective adjuvant treatment modality to inhibit tumor growth, relapse, and invasion via teletherapy.

         <title>Vacancy Defects in 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Electrocatalysts: From Aggregated to Atomic Configuration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Vacancy defect engineering has been well leveraged to flexibly shape comprehensive physicochemical properties of diverse catalysts. In particular, growing research effort has been devoted to engineering chalcogen anionic vacancies (S/Se/Te) of two&#8208;dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) towards the ultimate performance limit of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In spite of remarkable progress achieved in the past decade, systematic and in&#8208;depth insights into the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art vacancy engineering for 2D TMDs&#8208;based electrocatalysis are still lacking. Herein, this review delivers a full picture of vacancy engineering evolving from aggregated to atomic configurations covering their development background, controllable manufacturing, thorough characterization and representative HER application. Of particular interest, the deep&#8208;seated correlations between specific vacancy regulation routes and resulted catalytic performance improvement are logically clarified in terms of atomic rearrangement, charge redistribution, energy band variation, intermediate adsorption&#8208;desorption optimization, and charge/mass transfer facilitation. Beyond that, a broader vision is cast into the cutting&#8208;edge research fields of vacancy engineering based single&#8208;atom catalysis and dynamic structure&#8208;performance correlations across catalyst service lifetime. Together with critical discussion on residual challenges and future prospects, this review sheds new light on the rational design of advanced defect catalysts and navigate their broader application in high&#8208;efficiency energy conversion and storage fields.

         <title>Large Exchange Coupling Between Localized Spins and Topological Bands in Magnetic Topological Insulator MnBi2Te4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Magnetism in topological materials creates phases exhibiting quantized transport phenomena with potential technological applications. The emergence of such phases relies on strong interaction between localized spins and the topological bands, and the consequent formation of an exchange gap. However, this remains experimentally unquantified in intrinsic magnetic topological materials. Here, this interaction is quantified in MnBi2Te4, an intrinsic antiferromagnetic topological insulator. To achieve this, a multimodal ultrafast approach is employed to interrogate optically induced nonequilibrium spin dynamics. Momentum&#8208;resolved ultrafast electron scattering and magneto&#8208;optic measurements show that Bi&#8208;Te p&#8208;like states comprising the bulk topological bands demagnetize via electron&#8208;phonon scattering at picosecond timescales. Localized Mn 3d spins, probed by ultrafast resonant X&#8208;ray scattering, are found to disorder concurrently with the p&#8208;like spins, despite being energetically decoupled from the optical excitation. These results, together with atomistic simulations, reveal that the exchange coupling between localized spins and the bulk topological bands is at least 100 times larger than the primary superexchange interaction, implying an optimal exchange gap of at least 25 meV in the topological surface states. By directly quantifying this exchange coupling, the study validates the materials&#8208;by&#8208;design strategy of utilizing localized magnetic order to create and manipulate magnetic topological phases, spanning static to ultrafast timescales.

Here, this interaction is quantified in MnBi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, an intrinsic antiferromagnetic topological insulator. To achieve this, a multimodal ultrafast approach is employed to interrogate optically induced nonequilibrium spin dynamics. Momentum-resolved ultrafast electron scattering and magneto-optic measurements show that Bi-Te &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-like states comprising the bulk topological bands demagnetize via electron-phonon scattering at picosecond timescales. Localized Mn &lt;i&gt;3d&lt;/i&gt; spins, probed by ultrafast resonant X-ray scattering, are found to disorder concurrently with the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-like spins, despite being energetically decoupled from the optical excitation. These results, together with atomistic simulations, reveal that the exchange coupling between localized spins and the bulk topological bands is at least 100 times larger than the primary superexchange interaction, implying an optimal exchange gap of at least 25 meV in the topological surface states. By directly quantifying this exchange coupling, the study validates the materials-by-design strategy of utilizing localized magnetic order to create and manipulate magnetic topological phases, spanning static to ultrafast timescales.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Oral Supramolecular Adsorbent for Preventing Chemo&#8208;Induced Gastrointestinal Mucositis &amp; Microbial Dysbiosis and for Enhancing Chemoimmunotherapy</title>

Abstract
The addition of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to cytotoxic chemotherapy has emerged as the first&#8208;line treatment for multiple cancers. Paradoxically, cytotoxic chemotherapy may limit the therapeutic potential of ICB by significantly impairing the largest immune organ, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and driving gut microbial dysbiosis. Here, we report an orally administered polymeric adsorbent containing a supramolecular motif (named SPORA&#8208;SN9) that can selectively remove chemotherapeutics from the GI tract, thereby preventing chemotherapy&#8208;induced GI mucositis and microbial dysbiosis and providing better chemoimmunotherapy synergy. By theoretical design and experimental screening of the molecular recognition motifs, SPORA&#8208;SN9 exhibits superior complexation capacity for doxorubicin and irinotecan and high selectivity over a range of commonly used combinational medications. In mouse models of chemotherapy&#8208;induced GI mucositis, SPORA&#8208;SN9 protected the integrity of the GI tissues and the homeostasis of the gut microbiota. Finally, the addition of SPORA&#8208;SN9 enhanced the efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. SPORA&#8208;SN9 offers a translational approach for supramolecular chemistry to modulate complex biosystems by selectively removing target substrates from the GI tract.

         <title>Dopant&#8208;free Bithiophene Imide&#8208;based Polymeric Hole Transporting Materials for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The development of hole transport materials (HTMs) with high mobility, long&#8208;term stability and comprehensive passivation is of vital significance for simultaneously improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Herein, two donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugated polymers PBTI and PFBTI with alternated benzodithiophene (BDT) and bithiophene imide (BTI) units are successfully developed with desirable hole mobilities due to the good planarity and extended conjugation of molecular backbone. Both copolymers can be employed as HTMs with suitable energy levels and efficient defect passivation. Shortening the alkyl chain of the BTI unit and introducing fluorine atoms on the BDT moiety can effectively enhance the hole mobility and hydrophobicity of the HTMs, leading to improved efficiency and stability of PVSCs. As a result, the organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid PVSCs with PFBTI as HTM deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.1% with much enhanced long&#8208;term operational and ambient stability, which is one of the best efficiencies reported for the PVSCs with dopant&#8208;free polymeric HTMs to date. Moreover, PFBTI can also be applied in inorganic PVSCs and perovskite/organic tandem solar cells, achieving a record high PCE of 17.4% and 22.2%, respectively. These results illustrate the great potential of PFBTI as an efficient and widely applicable HTM for the fabrication of cost&#8208;effective and stable PVSCs.

         <title>Oxygen Evolution Activity of Amorphous Cobalt Oxyhydroxides: Interconnecting Precatalyst Reconstruction, LongRange Order, Buffer&#8208;Binding, Morphology, Mass Transport, and Operation Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanocrystalline or amorphous cobalt oxyhydroxides (CoCat) are promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). While having the same shortrange order, CoCat phases possess different electrocatalytic properties. This phenomenon is not conclusively understood, as multiple interdependent parameters affect the OER activity simultaneously. Herein, a layered cobalt borophosphate precatalyst, Co(H2O)2[B2P2O8(OH)2]&#8729;H2O, is fully reconstructed into two different CoCat phases. In marked contrast to previous reports, this reconstruction is not initiated at the surface but at the electrodesubstrate to catalyst interface. Ex&#8208; and quasi in&#8208;situ investigations of the two borophosphate derived CoCats, as well as the prominent CoPi and CoBi identify differences in the Tafel slope/range, buffer binding and content, long&#8208;range order, number of accessible edge sites, redox activity, and morphology. Considering and interconnecting these aspects together with proton mass transport limitations, we provide a comprehensive picture explaining the different OER activities. The most decisive factors are the buffers used for reconstruction, the number of edge sites that are not inhibited by irreversibly bond buffers, and the morphology of the catalysts. With this acquired knowledge, an optimized OER system is realized operating in nearneutral potassium borate media at 1.62&#177;0.03 VRHE yielding 250&#160;mA/cm2 at 65&#176;C for one month without degrading performance.

         <title>Multifunctional 4D&#8208;printed Sperm&#8208;hybrid Microcarriers for Assisted Reproduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Remotely controllable microrobots are appealing for various biomedical in vivo applications. In particular, our group has focused in the last years in developing sperm&#8208;microcarriers to assist sperm cells with motion deficiencies or low count (two of the most prominent male infertility problems) to reach the oocyte towards in vivo assisted fertilization. Different sperm carriers considering their motion in realistic media and confined environments have been optimized. However, the already reported sperm carriers have been mainly designed to transport single sperm cells, with limited functionality. Thus, to take a step forward, here we propose the development of a 4D&#8208;printed multifunctional microcarrier containing soft and smart materials, which can not only transport and deliver multiple sperm cells, but also release heparin and mediate local enzymatic reactions by hyaluronidase&#8208;loaded polymersomes (HYAL&#8208;Psomes). These multifunctional facets enable in&#8208;situ (i) sperm capacitation/hyperactivation, and (ii) local degradation of the cumulus complex that surrounds the oocyte, both to facilitate the sperm&#8208;oocyte interaction for the ultimate goal of in vivo assisted fertilization.

         <title>Organic Hole&#8208;Transport Layers for Efficient, Stable, and Scalable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) attract great attention due to their low&#8208;temperature processing, negligible hysteresis, and superior stability. For these devices, hole&#8208;transport layers play a decisive role in carrier extraction, transport, and perovskite crystallization. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the structural engineering of organic hole&#8208;transport layers utilized in inverted PSCs including conductive polymers, small molecules, and emerging self&#8208;assembled monolayers.








Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting layers (HTLs) are an essential component in inverted, p&#8211;i&#8211;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs) where they play a decisive role in extraction and transport of holes, surface passivation, perovskite crystallization, device stability, and cost. Currently, the exploration of efficient, stable, highly transparent and low&#8208;cost HTLs is of vital importance for propelling p&#8211;i&#8211;n PSCs toward commercialization. Compared to their inorganic counterparts, organic HTLs offer multiple advantages such as a tunable bandgap and energy level, easy synthesis and purification, solution processability, and overall low cost. Here, recent progress of organic HTLs, including conductive polymers, small molecules, and self&#8208;assembled monolayers, as utilized in inverted PSCs is systematically reviewed and summarized. Their molecular structure, hole&#8208;transport properties, energy levels, and relevant device properties and resulting performances are presented and analyzed. A summary of design principles and a future outlook toward highly efficient organic HTLs in inverted PSCs is proposed. This review aims to inspire further innovative development of novel organic HTLs for more efficient, stable, and scalable inverted PSCs.

         <title>Wet&#8208;Adhesive On&#8208;Skin Sensors Based on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Wireless Monitoring of Metabolites in Sweat</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Materials and techniques are demonstrated to achieve wearable and breathable sensing devices by integrating conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks with a flexible nanocellulose membrane. This robust sensor can self&#8208;adhere to sweaty skin for the wireless and in situ monitoring of vitamin C in human sweat.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with well&#8208;defined porous structures and tailored functionalities have been widely used in chemical sensing. However, the integration of MOFs with flexible electronic devices for wearable sensing is challenging because of their low electrical conductivity and fragile mechanical properties. Herein, a wearable sweat sensor for metabolite detection is presented by integrating an electrically conductive Ni&#8208;MOF with a flexible nanocellulose substrate. The MOF&#8208;based layered film sensor with inherent conductivity, highly porous structure, and active catalytic properties enables the selective and accurate detection of vitamin C and uric acid. More importantly, the lightweight sensor can conformably self&#8208;adhere to sweaty skin and exhibits high water&#8208;vapor permeability. Furthermore, a wireless epidermal nutrition tracking system for the in situ monitoring of the dynamics of sweat vitamin C is demonstrated, the results of which are comparable to those tested by high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography. This study opens a new avenue for integrating MOFs as the active layer in wearable electronic devices and holds promise for the future development of high&#8208;performance electronics with enhanced sensing, energy production, and catalytic capabilities through the implementation of multifunctional MOFs.

         <title>Structural Design and Fabrication of Multifunctional Nanocarbon Materials for Extreme Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocarbon materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene have provided a variety of unique extreme environmental properties. The recent advances on nanocarbon materials for extreme environments are summarized from the feature of individual nanocarbon components, principles of structural design, fabrication technologies, while examples of their extreme environmental applications with the underlying working mechanism are given.








Abstract
Extreme environments represent numerous harsh environmental conditions, such as temperature, pressure, corrosion, and radiation. The tolerance of applications in extreme environments exemplifies significant challenges to both materials and their structures. Given the superior mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, thermal stability, and chemical stability of nanocarbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene, they are widely investigated as base materials for extreme environmental applications and have shown numerous breakthroughs in the fields of wide&#8208;temperature structural&#8208;material construction, low&#8208;temperature energy storage, underwater sensing, and electronics operated at high temperatures. Here, the critical aspects of structural design and fabrication of nanocarbon materials for extreme environments are reviewed, including a description of the underlying mechanism supporting the performance of nanocarbon materials against extreme environments, the principles of structural design of nanocarbon materials for the optimization of extreme environmental performances, and the fabrication processes developed for the realization of specific extreme environmental applications. Finally, perspectives on how CNTs and graphene can further contribute to the development of extreme environmental applications are presented.

         <title>Ultrathin Covalent Organic Framework Membranes Prepared by Rapid Electrophoretic Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel two&#8208;cell electrophoretic deposition strategy to assemble covalent organic frameworks (COFs) nanosheets into ultrathin COF membranes with homogenous structures within several minutes is reported. The constructed COF membranes exhibit outstanding separation performance toward the negatively charged probe molecules with a dimension larger than 1&#160;nm due to their uniform architecture and unique chemical composition.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a disruptive material platform for various novel applications including nanofiltration for water purification due to their excellent physicochemical features. Nevertheless, the currently available approaches for preparing COF membranes need stringent synthesis conditions, prolonged fabrication time, and tedious post&#8208;processing, leading to poor productivity. Herein, a simple and efficient layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking assembly strategy is developed based on electrophoretic deposition (EPD) to rapidly generate ionic COF membranes due to the uniform driving force for nanosheet assembly. A new two&#8208;cell EPD design avoids the usual EPD problems such as bubbles and acidic/alkaline microenvironments in the near&#8208;electrode region in aqueous EPD processes. Ultrathin COF membranes with homogenous structures can be produced within several minutes. Consequently, the prepared COF membranes exhibit outstanding permselectivity and possess good stability and anti&#8208;pressure ability due to their uniform architecture and unique chemical composition.

         <title>Tailoring Materials for Epilepsy Imaging: From Biomarkers to Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A framework for understanding potential biomarkers of epilepsy is provided and they are classified them into three categories: functional, molecular, and structural aberrances during epileptogenesis. Then, the materials used to fabricate the imaging probes and their performances in defining the epileptic foci are highlighted. Imaging strategies overcoming the heterogenous nature of epilepsy are thoroughly discussed.








Abstract
Excising epileptic foci (EF) is the most efficient approach for treating drug&#8208;resistant epilepsy (DRE). However, owing to the vast heterogeneity of epilepsies, EF in one&#8208;third of patients cannot be accurately located, even after exhausting all current diagnostic strategies. Therefore, identifying biomarkers that truly represent the status of epilepsy and fabricating probes with high targeting specificity are prerequisites for identifying the &#8220;concealed&#8221; EF. However, no systematic summary of this topic has been published. Herein, the potential biomarkers of EF are first summarized and classified into three categories: functional, molecular, and structural aberrances during epileptogenesis, a procedure of nonepileptic brain biasing toward epileptic tissue. The materials used to fabricate these imaging probes and their performance in defining the EF in preclinical and clinical studies are highlighted. Finally, perspectives for developing the next generation of probes and their challenges in clinical translation are discussed. In general, this review can be helpful in guiding the development of imaging probes defining EF with improved accuracy and holds promise for increasing the number of DRE patients who are eligible for surgical intervention.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Robust Full&#8208;Color Organic Afterglow through 2D Superlattices Embedment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and universal strategy is proposed to prepare high&#8208;performance and robust organic afterglow with high figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit by 2D&#160;hydrogen&#8208;bonded superlattices embedment of phosphors. Deep&#8208;blue organic afterglow with high efficiency up to 65%, ultralong lifetime over 1300 ms, and robust emission that can resist the quenching effects from oxygen, solvent, stress, and heat is achieved.








Abstract
Purely organic afterglow (POA) originating from the slow radiative decay of stabilized triplet excited states has shown amazing potential in many fields. However, achieving highly stable POA with high phosphorescent quantum yield (PhQY) and long lifetime is still a formidable challenge owing to the intrinsically active and sensitive nature of triplet excitons. Here, triplet excitons of phosphors are protected and stabilized by embedding in tricomponent trihapto self&#8208;assembled 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded superlattices, which not only enables deep&#8208;blue POA with high PhQY (up to 65%), ultralong lifetime (over 1300&#160;ms) and the highest figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit at room temperature, but also achieves excellent stability capable of resisting quenching effects of oxygen, solvent, pressure, light, and heat. In addition, the POA color is tuned from deep&#8208;blue to red via efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the deep&#8208;blue POA emitters to the fluorophores. Moreover, with the high&#8208;performance, robust, and full&#8208;color POA materials, flexible anti&#8208;counterfeit displays and direct&#8208;current (DC)&#8208;driven lifetime&#8208;encrypted color Morse Code applications are facilely realized.

Abstract
Exploring high&#8208;efficiency reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;elimination materials is of great importance for combating oxidative stress in diverse diseases, especially stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based biotherapeutics. By mimicking the Fe&#63743;N active centers of natural catalase, here, an innovative concept to design ROS&#8208;elimination artificial biocatalysts with Ru catalytic centers for stem&#8208;cell protection is reported. The experimental studies and theoretical calculations have systematically disclosed the activity merits and structure diversities of different Ru sites when serving as ROS&#8208;elimination artificial biocatalysts. Benefiting from the metallic electronic structures and synergetic effects of multiple sites, the artificial biocatalysts with Ru cluster centers present exceptional ROS&#8208;elimination activity; notably, it shows much higher catalytic efficiency per Ru atom on decomposing H2O2 when compared to the isolated single&#8208;atom Ru sites, which is more efficient than that of the natural antioxidants and recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ROS&#8208;scavenging biocatalysts. The systematic stem&#8208;cell protection studies reveal that the catalase&#8208;like artificial biocatalysts can provide efficient rescue ability for survival, adhesion, and differentiation functions of human mesenchymal stem cells in high ROS level conditions. It is suggested that applying these artificial biocatalysts with Ru cluster centers will offer a new pathway for engineering high&#8208;performance ROS&#8208;scavenging materials in stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based therapeutics and many other ROS&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing of Prussian Blue Analogues with Electrochemically Driven Morphological Rejuvenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phenomenon of self&#8208;healing can be determined through kinetic dynamics under an electric field in terms of an &#8220;electrochemically driven dissolution&#8211;recrystallization process&#8221; for the periodic morphology variations in Prussian blue analogue electrodes.








Abstract
Maintaining the morphology of electrode materials with high invertibility contributes to the prolonged cyclic stability of battery systems. However, the majority of electrode materials tend to degrade during the charge&#8211;discharge process owing to the inevitable increase in entropy. Herein, a self&#8208;healing strategy is designed to promote morphology rejuvenation in Prussian blue analogue (PBA) cathodes by cobalt doping. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations demonstrate that a trace amount of cobalt can decelerate the crystallization process and restore the cracked areas to ensure perfect cubic structures of PBA cathodes. The electric field controls the kinetic dynamics, rather than the conventional thermodynamics, to realize the &#8220;electrochemically driven dissolution&#8211;recrystallization process&#8221; for the periodic self&#8208;healing phenomenon. The properties of electron transportation and ion diffusion in bulk PBA are also improved by the doping strategy, thus boosting the cyclability with 4000 cycles in a diluent electrolyte. This discovery provides a new paradigm for the construction of self&#8208;healing electrodes for cathodes.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Socketed Sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Copper for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to C2+</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing perovskite&#8211;Cu heteronanostructures through in situ socketing sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Cu onto perovskite backbones provides a favorable platform for efficient and stable CO2 electroreduction (CER) to C2+ products. Within such heteronanostructures, the significant strong metal&#8211;support interactions, which modulate electronic structure of active Cu and strengthen perovskite&#8211;Cu adhesion, play key roles in simultaneously enhancing CER activity, selectivity for C2+ products, and stability.








Abstract
In situ socketing metal nanoparticles onto perovskite oxides has shown great potential in heterogeneous catalysis, but its employment in boosting ambient CO2 electroreduction (CER) is unexplored. Here, a CER catalyst of perovskite&#8208;socketed sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Cu equipped with strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSIs) is constructed to promote efficient and stable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion. For such a catalyst, plentiful sub&#8208;3&#160;nm ellipsoid Cu particles are homogeneously and epitaxially anchored on the perovskite backbones, with concomitant creation of significant SMSIs. These SMSIs are able to not only modulate electronic structure of active Cu and facilitate adsorption/activation of key intermediates, but also to strengthen perovskite&#8211;Cu adhesion and intensify resistance to structural degradation. Beneficial from these advantageous merits, when evaluated in CER, it performs comparably to or better than most reported Cu&#8208;based heteronanostructures. Relative to a physical&#8208;mixture counterpart, it features marked improvements (up to 6.2 folds) in activity and selectivity for C2+, together with greatly boosted stability (&gt;80&#160;h). This work gives a new avenue to rationally design more advanced Cu&#8208;based heteronanostructures for CER.

Phenethylammonium bromine&#8208;modified CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are successfully introduced into perovskite film to passivate the intrinsic defects and accelerate the energy&#8208;transfer process. Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate/poly[9,9&#8208;dioctylfluoreneco&#8208;N&#8208;[4&#8208;(3&#8208;methylpropyl)]diphenylamine]:black phosphorus is also constructed to enhance carrier injection and charge&#8208;transport ability. Consequently, a champion external quantum efficiency of 25.32% and a maximal brightness of 128&#8239;842 cd m&#8722;2 are successfully achieved.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D perovskites have emerged as a promising luminescent material for perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (Pe&#8208;LEDs). However, efficiency and stability are still obstacles to practical application due to numerous defects and inefficient energy transfer of perovskite films. Herein, functional phenethylammonium bromine&#8208;modified CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3 NCs) are first introduced as multifunctional additive to simultaneously improve abovementioned problems. PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3 NCs not only serve as heteronuclear seeds and trigger growth, thus greatly reducing leakage current, but also deliver Cs+ and Br&#8722; to passivate the intrinsic defects inside film. More importantly, the PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3 construct a new carrier&#8208;transfer pathway from the small&#8208;n phase of the quasi&#8208;2D perovskite to the PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3, which not only accelerates the energy&#8208;transfer process but also promotes radiation recombination of carriers due to stronger quantum confinement effect. Afterward, the poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate/poly[9,9&#8208;dioctylfluoreneco&#8208;N&#8208;[4&#8208;(3&#8208;methylpropyl)]diphenylamine]:black phosphorus quantum dot double hole&#8208;transport layer is successfully constructed to enhance its carrier&#8208;injection and charge&#8208;transport abilities. Consequently, a champion external quantum efficiency of 25.32% and maximal brightness of 128&#8239;842&#160;cd m&#8722;2 are achieved, which is the record efficiency of the quasi&#8208;2D Pe&#8208;LED with pure green emission at 530&#160;nm. Moreover, an impressive 174&#160;min lifetime is obtained at T50, which is about five times longer than the control device.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Production of Rectorite Nanosheets and their Co&#8208;Assembly with Aramid Nanofibers for High&#8208;Performance Electrical Insulating Nanopapers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gram&#8208;scale rectorite nanosheets (RNs) with ultrathin thickness (&#8776;5 nm) are efficiently prepared from raw rectorite microplatelets via a scalable exfoliation approach and rapidly separated from their suspension by an efficient poly(dienedimethylammonium chloride)&#8208;assisted sedimentation strategy. Then, the RNs are co&#8208;assembled with aramid nanofibers into large&#8208;scale nacre&#8208;mimetic nanopapers, achieving considerably enhanced mechanical, electrical insulating, and high&#8208;temperature resistant properties.








Abstract
Compared with raw rectorite microplatelets (RMs), rectorite nanosheets (RNs) have considerably greater application prospects in the preparation of advanced composite materials because of their larger aspect ratio, higher surface reactivity, and intrinsically superior mechanical and physical properties. However, the difficulty in the efficient preparation of RNs significantly limits their large&#8208;scale applications. Here, a scalable poly(vinylpyrrolidone)&#8208;assisted stirring approach is developed to prepare ultrathin RNs from the abundant natural RMs. A higher production rate (&#8776;0.675&#160;g h&#8722;1) is achieved compared with that of most other nanosheets. Additionally, instead of using conventional time&#8208; and energy&#8208;consuming high&#8208;speed centrifugation, an efficient poly(dienedimethylammonium chloride)&#8208;assisted sedimentation strategy is proposed here to rapidly separate the exfoliated RNs from the RN dispersion. Then, the RNs are co&#8208;assembled with aramid nanofibers (ANFs) into large&#8208;scale nacre&#8208;mimetic ANF&#8208;RN nanopapers with considerably enhanced mechanical, electrical insulating, and high&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant&#160;properties compared with pure ANF nanopapers and ANF&#8208;RM micropapers. Moreover, these properties are superior to those of previously reported ANF&#8208;based nanopapers and commercial insulating micropapers.

     alt="Large-Scale Production of Rectorite Nanosheets and their Co-Assembly with Aramid Nanofibers for High-Performance Electrical Insulating Nanopapers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gram-scale rectorite nanosheets (RNs) with ultrathin thickness (&#8776;5 nm) are efficiently prepared from raw rectorite microplatelets via a scalable exfoliation approach and rapidly separated from their suspension by an efficient poly(dienedimethylammonium chloride)-assisted sedimentation strategy. Then, the RNs are co-assembled with aramid nanofibers into large-scale nacre-mimetic nanopapers, achieving considerably enhanced mechanical, electrical insulating, and high-temperature resistant properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with raw rectorite microplatelets (RMs), rectorite nanosheets (RNs) have considerably greater application prospects in the preparation of advanced composite materials because of their larger aspect ratio, higher surface reactivity, and intrinsically superior mechanical and physical properties. However, the difficulty in the efficient preparation of RNs significantly limits their large-scale applications. Here, a scalable poly(vinylpyrrolidone)-assisted stirring approach is developed to prepare ultrathin RNs from the abundant natural RMs. A higher production rate (&#8776;0.675&#160;g h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is achieved compared with that of most other nanosheets. Additionally, instead of using conventional time- and energy-consuming high-speed centrifugation, an efficient poly(dienedimethylammonium chloride)-assisted sedimentation strategy is proposed here to rapidly separate the exfoliated RNs from the RN dispersion. Then, the RNs are co-assembled with aramid nanofibers (ANFs) into large-scale nacre-mimetic ANF-RN nanopapers with considerably enhanced mechanical, electrical insulating, and high-temperature-resistant&#160;properties compared with pure ANF nanopapers and ANF-RM micropapers. Moreover, these properties are superior to those of previously reported ANF-based nanopapers and commercial insulating micropapers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vertical Growth of 2D Covalent Organic Framework Nanoplatelets on Macroporous Scaffold for High&#8208;Performance Electrodes</title>

Abstract
Hierarchically structural engineering of electrodes is critical to achieving high energy density and high power density in electrochemical energy storage (EES). However, rational regulation of the mesoscopic structure that coordinates microscopic and macroscopic structural features simultaneously remains a significant challenge. Here, we report the construction of electrodes with well&#8208;defined hierarchical pores spanning multiple length scales from 1&#160;nm to 50&#160;&#956;m. Vertically aligned two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) nanoplatelets with a thickness around 30&#160;nm were in&#8208;situ grown on macroporous graphene aerogel scaffold by a reversible polycondensation&#8208;termination strategy. The obtained electrode thus combines abundant accessible active sites and efficient transport expressways for both ions and electrons. When used for supercapacitors, a superior gravimetric capacitance of 289 F&#183;g&#8722;1 as well as outstanding capacitance retention at both high charge/discharge rates of 77% from 0.5 A&#183;g&#8722;1 to 50 A&#183;g&#8722;1 and high mass loading of 74% from 1.2 mg&#183;cm&#8722;2 to 10.4 mg&#183;cm&#8722;2 are achieved. Hierarchical engineering of mesostructured 2D COF units on the macroporous scaffold will bring unprecedented structural designability and performance enhancement for EES electrodes.

         <title>Regulation of Outer Solvation Shell toward Superior Low&#8208;temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries are well regarded among the next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies due to their low cost and high safety. However, the unstable stripping/plating process leading to severe dendrite growth under high current density and low temperature impede their practical application. Herein, we demonstrate that the addition of 2&#8208;propanol can regulate the outer solvation shell structure of Zn2+ by replacing water molecules to establish a &#8220;eutectic solvation shell&#8221;, which provides strong affinity with the Zn (101) crystalline plane and fast desolvation kinetics during the plating process, rendering homogeneous Zn deposition without dendrite formation. As a result, the Zn anode exhibits promising cycle stability over 500 hours under an elevated current density of 15&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and high depth of discharge of 51.2%. Furthermore, remarkable electrochemical performance was achieved in a 150 mAh Zn|V2O5 pouch cell over 1000 cycles at low temperature of &#8208;20&#176;C. This work not only offers a new strategy to achieve excellent performance of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries under harsh conditions, but also reveals electrolyte structure designs that can be applied in related energy storage and conversion fields.

         <title>Visualized Gallium/Lyticase&#8208;Integrated Antifungal Strategy for Fungal Keratitis Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fungal keratitis has been one of the common corneal infections that causes blindness, but an effective antifungal strategy remains a challenge. The exopolysaccharides both in fungal cell walls and biofilms are a key that acts as a permeation barrier to weaken the therapeutic effect of antifungal agents. Herein, we present lyticase and gallium ions co&#8208;integrated nanosystems (MLPGa) that could degrade exopolysaccharides and then effectively eradicate both the planktonic C. albicans and mature biofilms. The potential antifungal mechanism involves ROS production and metabolic interference of antioxidant&#8208;related genes, exopolysaccharide&#8208;related genes, iron ion utilization&#8208;related genes, fungal/biofilm development&#8208;related genes, and virulence genes. Meanwhile, the Raman signals generated by the chelation between nanosystems and gallium ions provide a real&#8208;time visualization tool to monitor Ga release. Finally, the MLPGa&#8208;based antifungal strategy with good biocompatibility achieves a satisfactory therapeutic effect in a fungal keratitis mouse model. This study provides a unique approach to the effective treatment of fungal keratitis in clinical practice.

         <title>Machine learning&#8211;accelerated development of efficient mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides as the air electrodes for protonic ceramic cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Currently, the development of high&#8208;performance protonic ceramic cells (PCCs) is limited by the scarcity of efficient mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides that can act as air electrodes to satisfy the high protonic conductivity of electrolytes. Despite the extensive research efforts in the past decades, the development of mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides still remains in a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error process, which is extremely time&#8208;consuming and high&#8208;cost. Herein, based on the data acquired from published literature, the machine learning (ML) method is introduced to accelerate the discovery of efficient mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides. Accordingly, the hydrated proton concentration (HPC) of 3200 oxides is predicted to evaluate the proton conduction that is essential for enhancing the electrochemical performances of PCCs. Subsequently, feature importance for HPC is evaluated to establish a guideline for rapid and accurate design and development of high&#8208;efficiency mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides. Thereafter, screened (La0.7Ca0.3)(Co0.8Ni0.2)O3 (LCCN7382) is prepared, and the experimental HPC adequately corresponds with the predicted results. Moreover, the PCC with LCCN7382 exhibited satisfactory electrochemical performances in electrolysis and fuel cell modes. In addition to the development of a promising air electrode for PCC, this study establishes a new avenue for ML&#8208;based development of mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;conjugated N&#8208;heteroaromatic Material for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Organic Batteries with Ultrahigh Rate and Extremely Long Life</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electroactive organic materials with tailored functional groups are of great importance for aqueous Zn&#8208;organic batteries due to their green and renewable nature. Herein, we designed and synthesized a completely new N&#8208;heteroaromatic material, hexaazatrinaphthalene&#8208;phenazine (HATN&#8208;PNZ), by an acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation reaction, and demonstrated its use as an ultrahigh performance cathode for Zn ion batteries. Compared with a phenazine monomer, we reveal that the &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure of N&#8208;heteroaromatics can effectively increase electron delocalization, thereby improving its electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the enlarged aromatic structure noticeably suppresses its dissolution in aqueous electrolytes, thus enabling high structural stability. As expected, the HATN&#8208;PNZ cathode delivers a large reversible capacity of 257 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1, ultrahigh rate capability of 144 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 A g&#8722;1, and extremely long cycle life of 45,000 cycles at 50 A g&#8722;1. Charge storage mechanism investigation demonstrated the synergistic coordination of both Zn2+ and H+ cations with phenanthroline groups, with Zn2+ first followed by H+, accompanying the reversible formation of zinc hydroxide sulfate hydrate. Our work provides a molecular engineering strategy for superior organic materials and add new insights to understand the charge storage behavior of aqueous Zn&#8208;organic batteries.

As expected, the HATN-PNZ cathode delivers a large reversible capacity of 257 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ultrahigh rate capability of 144 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 100 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and extremely long cycle life of 45,000 cycles at 50 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Charge storage mechanism investigation demonstrated the synergistic coordination of both Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations with phenanthroline groups, with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; first followed by H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, accompanying the reversible formation of zinc hydroxide sulfate hydrate. Our work provides a molecular engineering strategy for superior organic materials and add new insights to understand the charge storage behavior of aqueous Zn-organic batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Developing fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8208;air battery is crucial for widening its application but remains challenging owing to the limitation of sluggish OER kinetics and insufficient active sites of electrocatalysts. To solve this issue, the reconstructed amorphous FeCoNiSx electrocatalyst with high&#8208;density efficient active sites, yielding low OER overpotentials of 202, 255 and 323&#160;mV at 10, 100 and 500&#160;mA/cm2, respectively, was developed for fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8208;air battery with low charging voltages at 100&#8211;400&#160;mA/cm2. Furthermore, the fabricated 3241.8 mAh (20&#160;mA/cm2, 25&#160;&#176;C) quasi&#8208;solid Zn&#8208;air battery shows long lifetime of 500&#160;h at &#8208;10 and 25&#160;&#176;C as well as 150&#160;h at 40&#160;&#176;C under charging 100&#160;mA/cm2. The detailed characterizations combine with DFT calculation indicate that the defect&#8208;rich crystalline /amorphous ternary metal (oxy) hydroxide formed by the reconstruction of amorphous multi&#8208;metallic sulfide, where the electron coupling effect among multi active sites and migration of intermediate O* from Ni site to Fe site breaks the scaling relationship to lead to a low theoretical OER overpotential of 170&#160;mV, accounting for the outstanding fast&#8208;charging property. This work not only provides insights into designing advanced OER catalysts by the self&#8208;reconstruction of pre&#8208;catalyst but also pioneers the pathway for the practical fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8208;air battery.

         <title>Solution Processed Ternary Tin (II) Alloy as Hole&#8208;Transport Layer of Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells for Enhanced Efficiency and Stability</title>

Abstract
Tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) narrow bandgap (NBG) perovskites show great potential in both single&#8208;junction and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still limited by low charge collection efficiency and poor stability. Here, we report a ternary Sn (II) alloy of SnOCl as the hole&#8208;transport material (HTM) with a work function of 4.95&#160;eV for Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs. The solution processed SnOCl layer has a texture structure which not only reduces the optical loss of the devices but also changes grain growth of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites and boosts the carrier diffusion length to 3.63&#160;&#956;m. The formation of small perovskite grains at the HTM/perovskite interface is suppressed. These result in an almost constant internal quantum efficiency of 96 &#177; 2% across the absorption spectrum of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites. The SnOCl HTM significantly enhances the stability of Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs with 87% of its initial efficiency retained after 1&#8208;sun illumination for 1,200&#160;h, and keep 85% efficiency under 85&#176;C thermal stress for 1,500&#160;h. The hybrid HTM further improve the stabilized efficiencies of single&#8208;junction Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells to 23.2% and 25.9%, respectively. This discovery opens an avenue to the multi&#8208;component metal alloys as HTM in PSCs.

         <title>Quantum Advantage in A Molecular Spintronic Engine that Harvests Thermal Fluctuation Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recent theory and experiments have showcased how to harness quantum mechanics to assemble heat/information engines with efficiencies that surpass the classical Carnot limit. So far, this has required atomic engines that are driven by cumbersome external electromagnetic sources. Here, using molecular spintronics, we propose an implementation that is both electronic and autonomous. Our spintronic quantum engine heuristically deploys several known quantum assets by having a chain of spin qubits formed by the paramagnetic Co centers of phthalocyanine (Pc) molecules electronically interact with electron&#8208;spin selecting Fe/C60 interfaces. Density functional calculations reveal that transport fluctuations across the interface can stabilize spin coherence on the Co paramagnetic centers, which host spin flip processes. Across vertical molecular nanodevices, we measure enduring dc current generation, output power above room temperature, two quantum thermodynamical signatures of the engine's processes, and a record 89% spin polarization of current across the Fe/C60 interface. It is crucially this electron spin selection that forces, through demonic feedback and control, charge current to flow against the built&#8208;in potential barrier. Further research into spintronic quantum engines, insight into the quantum information processes within spintronic technologies, and retooling the spintronic&#8208;based information technology chain, could help accelerate the transition to clean energy.

         <title>Information Storage Expansion Enabled by a Resilient Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Active Nanocomposite Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Advanced materials with high performance and distinctive function are one of the main driving forces for the development of human society. The selection of appropriate materials and adequately utilizing their features to apply them in a specific area rationally are of great significance but remain challenging. Herein, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active nanocomposite (NC) hydrogel is developed by introducing a pH&#8208;responsive AIE luminogen (AIEgen) into a Laponite XLS/polyacrylamide&#8208;based NC hydrogel. The AIEgen can protonate to interact with the negatively charged clay through the electrostatic interaction, which results in a drastic fluorescence enhancement due to the restriction of intramolecular motion by the rigid clay to the protonated AIEgen. This behavior facilitates the input of fluorescent information with a high contrast ratio in the hydrogel by acid stimulation. What's more, by utilizing the excellent resilience of the hydrogel, hierarchically inputting and displaying the information in the original and stretched states of the hydrogel film is realized, which achieves information storage expansion and dual&#8208;encryption via switching between stretching and restoring the film. This work showcases fully and synergistically utilizing the superiorities of various advanced materials to achieve superior applications and should guide the future development of advanced materials in emerging areas.

         <title>Ion Migration Mechanism: An Overall Understanding of Anionic Redox Activity in Metal Oxide Cathodes of Li/Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Anionic redox reaction (ARR) has attracted extensive attention in recent years due to its potential to enhance the reversible capacity of cathode materials in Li/Na&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). However, the understanding of its activation mechanism is still limited by the insufficient mastering of the underlying thermodynamics and kinetics. In this work, a series of Mg/Li/Zn&#8208;substituted NaxMnO2 and LixMnO2 cathode materials are designed to investigate their ARR behaviors. It is found that ARR can be activated in only Li&#8208;substituted LixMnO2 but not for Mg and Zn&#8208;substituted ones, while all Mg/Li/Zn&#8208;substituted NaxMnO2 cathode materials exhibit ARR activities. Combining ab initio calculations with experimental XRD refinements, such a huge difference between Li and Na cathodes, with Mg substituted compounds as a proof of concept, was revealed to be closely related to the migration of Mg2+ from the transition metal (TM) layer to the alkali metal (AM) layer in a kinetic aspect. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane migration of Mg2+ ions can merely occur in the Na compound but not in Li one, thus generating unique Na&#8208;O&#8208;&#9633;TM and/or &#9633;Na&#8208;O&#8208;&#9633;TM configurations and reducing reaction activation energy to trigger the ARR. Based on these findings, an ion migration mechanism is proposed for the first time to explain the different ARR behaviors between the NaxMnO2 and LixMnO2, which can not only reveal the origin of ARR in the kinetic aspect, but also provide a new insight for the development of high&#8208;capacity metal oxide cathode materials for LIBs/SIBs.

&lt;/i&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but not for Mg and Zn-substituted ones, while all Mg/Li/Zn-substituted Na&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode materials exhibit ARR activities. Combining ab initio calculations with experimental XRD refinements, such a huge difference between Li and Na cathodes, with Mg substituted compounds as a proof of concept, was revealed to be closely related to the migration of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from the transition metal (TM) layer to the alkali metal (AM) layer in a kinetic aspect. The out-of-plane migration of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions can merely occur in the Na compound but not in Li one, thus generating unique Na-O-&#9633;&lt;sub&gt;TM&lt;/sub&gt; and/or &#9633;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;-O-&#9633;&lt;sub&gt;TM&lt;/sub&gt; configurations and reducing reaction activation energy to trigger the ARR. Based on these findings, an ion migration mechanism is proposed for the first time to explain the different ARR behaviors between the Na&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Li&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which can not only reveal the origin of ARR in the kinetic aspect, but also provide a new insight for the development of high-capacity metal oxide cathode materials for LIBs/SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electro&#8208;thermal Characterization of Dynamical VO2 Memristors via Local Activity Modeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Translating the surging interest in neuromorphic electronic components, such as those based on nonlinearities near Mott transitions, into large&#8208;scale commercial deployment faces steep challenges in the current lack of means to identify and design key material parameters. These issues are exemplified by the difficulties in connecting measurable material properties to device behavior via circuit element models. Here we use the principle of Local Activity to build a model of VO2 / SiN Mott threshold switches by sequentially accounting for constraints from a minimal set of quasi&#8208;static and dynamic electrical and high spatial resolution thermal data obtained via in&#8208;situ thermoreflectance mapping. By combining independent data sets for devices with varying dimensions, we distill the model to measurable material properties and established device scaling laws. The model can accurately predict electrical and thermal conductivities and capacitances and locally active dynamics (especially persistent spiking self&#8208;oscillations). The systematic procedure by which we develop this model has been a missing link in predictively connecting neuromorphic device behavior with their underlying material properties, and should enable rapid screening of material candidates before employing expensive manufacturing processes and testing procedures.

         <title>Functional Coating from Amyloid Superwetting Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tailoring the hydrophilicity of solid surfaces with a strong affinity to water has been extensively explored in the last 20 years, but studies have been limited to the single function of wettability. Here, we extend the multifunctional properties of tailored surface films from exhibiting superwettability to facilitating biological activities. We show that amyloid fibrils can be universally coated onto various substrates, such as fabrics (non&#8208;woven organic masks), metal meshes, polyethersulfone (PES), glass and more, endowing the resulting surfaces with excellent performance in oil/water mixture and emulsion separation, antifouling, and antifogging. Moreover, the biocompatible crosslinked amyloid fibrils coatings can serve as a platform for biocatalytic activities by immobilizing enzymes, as we show in the ABTS oxidation and RB5 degradation by laccase from Trametes versicolor. The study provides a universal approach to modifying surface morphology and chemical properties via fibrous protein templates, opening the way to unexplored bio&#8208;based applications and functionalities.
