         <title>Li&#8208;Well ZnO Memtransistors: High Reliability for Neuromorphic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel lithium (Li)&#8208;well ZnO memtransistor integrates&#160;transistor switching and nonvolatile memory, akin to ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors (FeFETs) and floating gates, while enabling low&#8208;power operation via Li&#8314; ion migration. Li&#8314; ion migration and switching mechanisms were&#160;confirmed by 3D secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). A 21 &#215; 21 crossbar array achieves 99.31% yield, and this scalable design supports neuromorphic computing and artificial neural network accelerators. 








Abstract
Memtransistors are active analog memory devices utilizing ionic memristive materials as channel layers. Since their introduction, the term &#8220;memtransistor&#8221; has widely been adopted for transistors exhibiting nonvolatile memory characteristics. Currently, memtransistor devices possessing both transistor on/off functionality and nonvolatile memory characteristics include ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors (FeFETs) and charge&#8208;trap flash (floating gate), yet ionic memtransistors have not matched their performance. Here a facile and extendable lithium (Li)&#8208;well oxide memtransistor (LWOM) is reported as a promising candidate. Forming a Li well, analogous to an n+ well beneath electrodes in n&#8208;metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistor (MOSFET) processes, induces Li&#8314;&#8208;ion migration via write VDS, achieving analog memory characteristics through Schottky barrier modulation. LWOM enables low&#8208;voltage weight updates and precise gate&#8208;controlled weight update characteristics. Analysis via 3D secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) confirms Li&#8208;ion redistribution and the resistance&#8208;switching mechanism. A 21 &#215; 21 crossbar array demonstrates 99.31% operational yield and successful weight updates to target conductance values. Fabricated using mature oxide semiconductor technology with a 230&#160;&#176;C thermal budget and a simple process, LWOM stands as a strong contender for next&#8208;generation nonvolatile memory and artificial neural network (ANN) acceleration hardware.

         <title>High Light Utilization and Color Rendering in Vacuum&#8208;Deposited Semitransparent Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, low bandgap (&#8776;1.55 eV) semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs) having thin (thickness &lt; &#8776;100 nm) perovskite layers and transparent conductive oxide&#8208;based rear electrodes are fabricated using vacuum&#8208;deposition methods. Two different ST&#8208;PSCs demonstrated a high light utilization efficiency value of 4.2 (PCE: 9.26% and AVT: 45.3%) and a high color rendering index of 82.4, respectively.








Abstract
Formamidinium lead iodide perovskite compositions have a low open circuit voltage deficit and thus a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) potential. However, their low bandgap makes it difficult to achieve a semitransparent perovskite solar cell (ST&#8208;PSC) with a high average visible transmittance (AVT) and thus, a high light utilization efficiency (LUE). Attaining a high AVT in such low bandgap perovskite&#8209;based semitransparent solar cells requires the perovskite layer to be very thin (thickness &lt; &#8776;100 nm) and the rear electrode to be made of a transparent conductive oxide. Moreover, both the front and rear electrodes should exhibit minimal reflectance losses. In this work, meeting these requirements, fully vacuum&#8208;deposited, low bandgap (&#8776;1.55&#160;eV, &#8776;100 nm thick) semitransparent perovskite solar cells are fabricated that demonstrate a high LUE value of 4.2 (PCE: 9.26% and AVT: 45.3%). Additionally, a high color rendering index of 82.4 along with a high AVT of &#8776;48.5% is achieved in a ST&#8208;PSC via modulation of the device reflectance by tuning both the perovskite layer thickness and the rear electrode stack. The ST&#8209;PSCs retained &gt; 90% of their efficiency for &gt;1000 h&#160;when thermally stressed at 85&#160;&#176;C in N2 atmosphere.

         <title>Manipulating Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Rechargeable Metal&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Fundamental Principles and Universal Methodologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review uncovers the commonalities of rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries in aspects of sulfur redox reactions (electrochemical fundamentals, reaction mechanisms, innate challenges, and key influence factors) and advanced targeted methodologies to boost sulfur redox reactions in rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries. The existing shackles confronted by rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries and their future development directions are prospected as well.








Abstract
The profound understanding of chemical reaction essence and kinetic behaviors is crucial to develop rechargeable battery technologies. Based on multi&#8208;electron conversion, sulfur redox reactions hold great promise for establishing low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, and longstanding rechargeable batteries. However, the sulfur redox reaction processes suffer from a series of common daunting cruxes, leading to incomplete redox reactions and inferior battery performance when working in rechargeable batteries. These innate challenges of sulfur redox reactions include poor sulfur reactivity, sluggish charge transmission, severe polysulfide shuttling, high redox energy barrier, and undesirable reaction reversibility. Accordingly, it becomes a consensus to effectively manipulate sulfur redox kinetics for developing competent rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries. Herein, this review centers on sulfur redox reactions, within the compass of understanding electrochemical fundamentals, principles, thermodynamics, dynamics, and kinetics as well as emphatically presents universal methodologies to boost sulfur redox reaction kinetics in rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries. The unique viewpoint on sulfur redox reactions in rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries can provide a deepened understanding of sulfur electrochemistry and lead to new insights into the sulfur cathode designs and battery configurations, thus accelerating reaction kinetics of sulfur cathodes and promoting practical progress on high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery technologies.

         <title>Thermionics in Topological Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermionics is one of the fundamental energy conversion mechanisms in solid state systems. Recent development in topological materials opens new avenues in developing thermionic systems and devices. Due to the linear energy dispersion and topological protection of charge transport, these new materials are promising candidates for high efficiency thermionic energy generation, cooling and other applications.









Abstract
Thermionic emission is fundamental to many technologies and devices, including thermionic energy converters, X&#8208;ray tubes, scanning electron microscopes, and transmission electron microscopes. The discovery of topological materials, particularly graphene, has significantly advanced thermionics research. Thermionic emission in these materials deviates from the Richardson&#8208;Dushman equation due to their linear energy dispersion. Various models are developed to accurately describe thermionic emission. Graphene, with its dangling bond&#8208;free surface, can be stacked either vertically or laterally with materials to form heterostructures. The Schottky barrier height at the interface of heterostructures can be tuned from a few millielectronvolts to several electronvolts by selecting appropriate materials or adjusting the Fermi level of graphene. This low and tunable barrier height gives rise to a great potential in developing thermionic energy converters and photodetectors. While free&#8208;standing single&#8208;layer graphene exhibits high electron mobility, its thermionic emission capability is constrained by the low density of states. This constraint can be alleviated by using 3D Dirac materials, which also possess linear energy dispersion. Thermionic emission in 3D Dirac materials is further enhanced by the emergence of nodal&#8208;ring semimetals and Weyl semimetals that exhibit linear&#8208;like energy dispersion. This review highlights recent progress in thermionic emission and devices in graphene structures and other topological materials.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Materials for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimulus&#8208;responsive materials (SRMs) hold great promise for use in a wide range of biomedical applications. This review covers four stimulus modalities, namely, electrical, optical, magnetic, and ultrasound, and their associated SRMs. It provides a summary of the materials in each modality, their development, and current research perspectives. This review also provides a detailed analysis of the key challenges for translating these SRM technologies into clinical use.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials (SRMs) are materials that change properties when exposed to external or internal stimuli. They respond to physiological changes within cells and tissues, as well as external triggers including light, magnetic fields, ultrasound, and electricity. In medicine, SRMs have diverse applications spanning drug delivery, tissue engineering, and diagnostics. They enable targeted drug release at specific times and locations, facilitate tissue generation and repair, and enhance disease detection capabilities. Beyond medical uses, SRMs are employed in smart coatings and artificial muscle systems. The breadth of biomedical applications for SRMs is extensive, generating substantial research into novel and innovative material development. Challenges in creating safe and efficient SRMs for medical treatments have driven innovative approaches in two key areas: functionalizing and modifying naturally occurring materials and developing new synthetic nanomaterials. The complexity of producing effective SRMs has necessitated creative solutions to overcome safety and efficiency barriers in medical applications. This ongoing research continues to expand the potential therapeutic uses of these responsive materials. This review examines literature focused on SRM development for external stimuli responses, particularly light, magnetic fields, ultrasound, and electricity, rather than covering the complete spectrum of stimuli&#8208;responsive applications.

         <title>3D Printing of Conducting Polymer Hydrogels for Electrostimulation&#8208;Assisted Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights nanosized inherently conducting polymers (ICPs) as promising ink constituents for 3D printing of conducting hydrogel (CH)&#8208;based electrostimulation (ES) devices. ICP&#8208;based ink formulation, 3D printing, and solidification strategies are discussed, along with the application of 3D&#8208;printed ICP&#8208;based CHs as ES platforms for regulating cell activities such as proliferation, differentiation, and maturation, ultimately supporting tissue regeneration.








Abstract
Electrostimulation (ES) is at the cutting edge of contemporary medicine, effectively promoting tissue regeneration and wound healing by applying small electrical cues to stimulate specific cellular responses. The 3D printing of electronically conducting hydrogels (CHs) offers a transformative strategy for developing ES platforms. These hydrogels integrate conformal, customizable geometries, mechanical compliance, adequate electrical conductivity, and biocompatibility, enabling seamless interaction with native tissues. Nanosized inherently conducting polymers (ICPs) are promising conductive ink constituents for 3D printing, owing to their straightforward preparation, electrical conductivity, and printability. However, 3D printing of ICP&#8208;based CHs faces several challenges. Controlling the tendency of ICPs to aggregate and achieving the rheological properties required by specific 3D printing modalities are vital for achieving uniform and precise printed structures. Furthermore, post&#8208;printing solidification of ICPs often uses harsh curing conditions, e.g., high temperatures or toxic solvents, rendering encapsulation of biological components and cells infeasible. This review critically assesses strategies for synthesizing ICP nanostructures, preparing ICP&#8208;based CHs, and applicable 3D printing techniques. Progress in tissue regeneration utilizing 3D&#8208;printed ICP&#8208;based CHs as ES devices is highlighted, along with future perspectives regarding the development of bio&#8208;functional ICPs and integrated powering mechanisms for closed&#8208;loop ES systems.

Nanosized inherently conducting polymers (ICPs) are promising conductive ink constituents for 3D printing, owing to their straightforward preparation, electrical conductivity, and printability. However, 3D printing of ICP-based CHs faces several challenges. Controlling the tendency of ICPs to aggregate and achieving the rheological properties required by specific 3D printing modalities are vital for achieving uniform and precise printed structures. Furthermore, post-printing solidification of ICPs often uses harsh curing conditions, e.g., high temperatures or toxic solvents, rendering encapsulation of biological components and cells infeasible. This review critically assesses strategies for synthesizing ICP nanostructures, preparing ICP-based CHs, and applicable 3D printing techniques. Progress in tissue regeneration utilizing 3D-printed ICP-based CHs as ES devices is highlighted, along with future perspectives regarding the development of bio-functional ICPs and integrated powering mechanisms for closed-loop ES systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Playing Hard with Si: Challenges and Opportunities for New Materials in Radiation Therapy Dosimetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon has been a cornerstone material of radiation therapy dosimetry for many decades, providing somewhat unchallenged performance. However, there are caveats to its use, requiring complex designs and, often, correction factors to provide accurate measurements. Alternative materials may provide previously unachievable capabilities, ushering in a new generation of radiation detectors suitable for the ever&#8208;changing landscape of radiation&#160;therapy.








Abstract
The sophistication and diversity of radiation medicine modalities continue to increase significantly in both cancer imaging and cancer radiation therapy. With over 50% of cancer patients receiving some form of radiation procedure as part of their cancer management plan, the importance and impact of quantitative radiation detector systems for quality assurance in radiation medicine should not be underestimated. There are numerous challenges faced by silicon&#8208;based detector systems used for dosimetry in radiation therapy that are discussed in this review article, especially considering emerging radiation therapy modalities that incorporate ultra&#8208;high irradiation dose&#8208;rates (e.g., MRT, FLASH&#8208;RT, VHEE&#8208;RT), while others utilize mixed radiation fields (e.g., proton&#8208;RT, heavy ion therapy) or diffusion&#8208;based dose delivery techniques (e.g., Alpha DaRT). Such challenges create exciting opportunities for new radiation detector materials. This concise review paper explores the role of silicon in radiation detection applications and highlights the challenges it faces in achieving optimal performance. Additionally, this review discusses new materials that are emerging as strong candidates for the next generation of radiation detectors, emphasizing both the opportunities and challenges associated with these&#160;materials.

Abstract
Biomolecular condensates, a ubiquitous class of biomaterials found in living cells, have been shown to be responsible for key physiological processes, such as gene regulation, signal transduction, and stress response. Since their discovery, extensive efforts have been devoted to this field to better understand the underlying mechanisms using both computational and experimental techniques. While great progress has been achieved, the key challenges still exist. With advancements in computational power and methods and improvements in experimental precision, the gap between computation and experimentation is gradually narrowing. By integrating these approaches, researchers can elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing biomolecular condensates. This review summarizes the recent progress in utilizing computational and experimental techniques to study biomolecular condensates. Detailed discussions are provided on the key advantages and limitations of each technique, along with their successful applications to specific systems. Moreover, further discussions are focused on the possibility of utilizing biomolecular condensates as a versatile platform for drug delivery and novel bioreactor design with the help of these techniques. Finally, future directions are outlined for technique development to better understand the role of biomolecular condensates in health and disease and enable their applications as tunable&#160;biomaterials.

         <title>Separator Engineering for Sodium Metal Batteries: Challenges, Rational Design and Recent Modification Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers advances in sodium metal battery separators, focusing on interfacial stabilization, dendrite suppression, and ion transport. It analyzes diverse materials, proposes comprehensive evaluation methods, and discusses simulations and future directions for high&#8208;performance, safe, and practical separators.








Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) have emerged as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems, leveraging their high theoretical capacity and the natural abundance of Na resources. Nevertheless, critical challenges, including dendritic growth, side reactions, and pronounced volume fluctuations during cycling, continue to impede their commercialization. Conventional separators, including polyolefin or glass fiber types, suffer from poor wettability, uneven ion flux, and a rough surface. To tackle these challenges, functional separator engineering encompassing interfacial chemistry regulation, multiscale structural design, and hybrid integration of advanced materials has demonstrated remarkable progress in regulating Na&#8314; flux, stabilizing SEI, and suppressing dendrite propagation. This review systematically provides a comprehensive summary of recent developments in separator engineering for SMBs, including modified polyolefin separators, enhanced glass fiber frameworks, cellulose&#8208;based separators, MOFs/COFs&#8208;based, and emerging separators. In addition, a comprehensive electrochemical evaluation framework encompassing CE in half&#8208;cells is proposed, the lifespan of symmetric cells, full cell performance, and safety validation to assess practical applicability. Furthermore, computational simulations for mechanism elucidation and predictive design, as well as future separator perspectives, have been also discussed to guide the development of next&#8208;generation separators for high&#8208;performance and commercially viable SMBs.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Polarized Antiferromagnets for Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in anomalous and spin transport phenomena in spin&#8208;polarized antiferromagnets. Key effects&#8212;including the anomalous Hall, Nernst, and magneto&#8208;optical effects&#8212;are discussed across various antiferromagnetic platforms. The roles of spin texture, symmetry, and interlayer interactions are emphasized, offering new opportunities for spintronic applications beyond conventional ferromagnets.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarized antiferromagnets (AFMs), including altermagnets, noncollinear AFMs, and 2D layer&#8208;polarized AFMs, have emerged as transformative materials for next&#8208;generation spintronic and optoelectronic technologies. These systems uniquely combine spin&#8208;polarized electronic states with vanishing net magnetization, enabling ultrafast spin dynamics, high&#8208;density integration, and robustness against stray magnetic fields. Their unconventional symmetry&#8208;breaking mechanisms&#8212;governed by crystal symmetry, chiral spin textures, or interlayer potential control&#8212;give rise to emergent phenomena previously exclusive to ferromagnets: nonrelativistic spin&#8208;momentum locking, spontaneous anomalous transport phenomena, gate&#8208;tunable magneto&#8208;optical responses, nonrelativistic spin&#8208;polarized current, and tunneling magnetoresistance effect. This review systematically examines the fundamental principles linking symmetry, band topology, and transport properties across these material classes, synthesizing recent breakthroughs in both theory and experiment.

     alt="Spin-Polarized Antiferromagnets for Spintronics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review highlights recent advances in anomalous and spin transport phenomena in spin-polarized antiferromagnets. Key effects&#8212;including the anomalous Hall, Nernst, and magneto-optical effects&#8212;are discussed across various antiferromagnetic platforms. The roles of spin texture, symmetry, and interlayer interactions are emphasized, offering new opportunities for spintronic applications beyond conventional ferromagnets.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin-polarized antiferromagnets (AFMs), including altermagnets, noncollinear AFMs, and 2D layer-polarized AFMs, have emerged as transformative materials for next-generation spintronic and optoelectronic technologies. These systems uniquely combine spin-polarized electronic states with vanishing net magnetization, enabling ultrafast spin dynamics, high-density integration, and robustness against stray magnetic fields. Their unconventional symmetry-breaking mechanisms&#8212;governed by crystal symmetry, chiral spin textures, or interlayer potential control&#8212;give rise to emergent phenomena previously exclusive to ferromagnets: nonrelativistic spin-momentum locking, spontaneous anomalous transport phenomena, gate-tunable magneto-optical responses, nonrelativistic spin-polarized current, and tunneling magnetoresistance effect. This review systematically examines the fundamental principles linking symmetry, band topology, and transport properties across these material classes, synthesizing recent breakthroughs in both theory and experiment. Critical challenges are further identified in achieving room-temperature functionality, scalable N&#233;el vector control, and coherent spin-current manipulation, while outlining pathways to harness these materials for ultra-low-power memory, spin-logic architectures, and quantum information technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atmospheric Water Sorption&#8211;Desorption as a Pathway for Green Energy Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive discussion on the energy conversion from the process of sorption and desorption of water molecules. By detailing the mechanism studies, guidelines are provided for the performance enhancement in the sequence of energy conversion. It provides insights into understanding the recent advances of hydrovoltaic technology and leads to future improvement of the harnessed energy.








Abstract
Beyond the indispensable resource for living creatures, water has recently been explored as an eco&#8208;friendly source of energy, known as the hydrovoltaic technology. Of significant interest, the cyclic sorption/desorption of water molecules physically and chemically induces the gaseous/liquid&#8211;solid interactions with the substances, demonstrating potential for harnessing electricity. Existing efforts have focused on materials engineering and structural design of the energy generators, enhancing the generated electricity for real&#8208;life applications. Despite the substantial achievements, the principal interpretation of the process from water molecules to electricity establishes the foundation and serves as the guidance for device modification and performance enhancement. Herein, this review thoroughly discusses the energy conversion, from the introduction of water molecules to the generation of electricity, starting with an understanding of the sorption/desorption of water molecules. Mechanisms in charge creation from the interaction are then elucidated, where water molecules themselves serve as ions or stimulate ion dissociation from the substances. It continues with an overview of the existing advancements in sorption/desorption&#8208;induced electricity generation and practical demonstrations of the developed electricity. Based on the conversion procedure, insights for upcoming generator designs are proposed subsequently. Finally, present challenges to be addressed and perspectives on future development in the sorption/desorption&#8208;induced electricity are discussed in detail.

         <title>Sustainable Hard Carbon for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Precursor Design and Scalable Production Roadmaps</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review emphasizes sodium&#8208;ion batteries' potential, highlighting hard carbon anodes, precursor selection by volatility, and sustainable strategies (e.g., bamboo&#8208;based materials) for scalable, high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) emerge as a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the abundant and widely distributed nature of sodium resources. Hard carbon anodes, characterized by their pseudo&#8208;graphitic layered structures and nanoporosity, are key to achieving high&#8208;performance SIBs. However, the commercialization of hard carbon is hindered by significant challenges in precursor design, carbonization optimization, and sustainability. This review focuses on the critical role of precursor selection and introduces a classification system based on volatile content. High&#8208;volatility biomass precursors, such as bamboo, require pretreatments like acid/alkali leaching or hydrothermal processing to optimize pyrolysis. Medium&#8208;volatility resins and plastics benefit from crosslinking strategies, while low&#8208;volatility materials such as biochar and petroleum coke rely on nanochannel engineering to improve sodium storage performance. Bamboo&#8208;based precursors are highlighted as a promising pathway due to their renewability and environmental advantages, though challenges such as impurity control and structural engineering persist. By integrating precursor design with carbonization strategies, this review provides a comprehensive framework for understanding microstructural regulation and performance enhancement. The insights presented offer valuable guidance for developing scalable and sustainable approaches to produce high&#8208;performance hard carbon materials, paving the way for the next generation of SIB technologies.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Materials for Water Splitting: An Atomic Nanoengineering Approach to Sustainable Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs), typically composed of five or more principal elements in near&#8208;equimolar ratios, offer significant potential due to their unique properties. This review outlines the emergence and structural evolution of HEMs, followed by an in&#8208;depth discussion of the elemental roles (active sites, promoters, or stabilizers) for water splitting. Last, future research directions in this evolving field are discussed.









Abstract
Green hydrogen production via water electrolysis is pivotal for achieving energy sustainability. However, the inherently sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction impede the progress of water&#8208;splitting technology. Recently, high&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) composed of at least five elements have garnered significant attention as promising electrocatalysts for water splitting, owing to their compositional versatility, structural robustness, and synergistic interactions among elements. This review comprehensively explores the development of HEMs, tracing their emergence and structural evolution via atomic nanoengineering strategies (i.e., from bulk to nanostructuring, from random distributions to relatively ordered architectures, from bare HEMs to reconstructed HEMs, from intact HEMs to defective structures, from pristine HEMs to functionalized variants) and revealing how these evolutionary steps contribute to the properties and enhance catalytic performance in water splitting. The fundamental roles of individual elements (e.g., active sites, promoters, stabilizers) in shaping the structure, stability, and catalytic activity of HEMs are examined, laying a foundation for the rational design of efficient HEM&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The review also highlights recent advances in HEM&#8208;based catalysts for water splitting, emphasizing desirable properties and elemental contributions. Finally, the remaining challenges and perspectives on the future directions of HEM&#8208;based materials in energy conversion technologies are discussed.

         <title>Paving the Way for Next&#8208;Generation All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries: Dry Electrode Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dry&#8208;electrode process offers a highly efficient solution to the key challenges faced by all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, including complex processing, high CO2 emissions, interfacial instability, toxicity, and limited energy density. This perspective outlines the critical challenges of implementing the dry electrode process from material fundamentals to processing, providing a guiding framework to bridge current research and future development.








Abstract
For the effective implementation of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), the progress of dry electrode technology is essential. Considering the urgent challenges posed by global warming, advancing affordable ASSBs is crucial for reliable and sustainable electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems. Despite the substantial progress in research on solid electrolytes, ASSBs continue to face fundamental challenges, including high manufacturing costs, considerable environmental impact, and insufficient interfacial stability. The dry electrode processing methodology presents a highly promising alternative to conventional wet electrode fabrication techniques, effectively addressing these limitations while facilitating scalable production capabilities. Although research on dry&#8208;electrode&#8208;based ASSBs has gained significant traction in recent years, the overall challenges are recognized as intricate due to the presence of multiple electrode components with diverse requirements and limitations. For the comprehensive review, the dry processing approach is systematically examined from the perspective of materials science and electrode processing. An electrode&#8208;component&#8208;level framework is adopted as well. Furthermore, crucial technical barriers are identified, and prospective research directions for the advancement of solid&#8208;state battery technology are delineated.

         <title>Designing an Anionic Layer in Low&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes to Promote In&#8208;Plane Ion Diffusion for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optimization model for zinc anodes centered on anion traction in a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte system is proposed. The fluoride&#8208;ion enriched interfacial layer on the zinc anode surface enhances the concentration of Zn2+ in a lateral direction through electrostatic forces, thereby facilitating horizontal zinc plating. Moreover, the repulsion between the anion&#8208;rich layer and sulfate ions can effectively inhibit the formation of byproducts.








Abstract
In contrast to high&#8208;concentration electrolyte systems, low&#8208;concentration electrolytes provide a cost&#8208;effective strategy to advance the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, such electrolytes frequently exhibit severe dendrite formation caused by localized Zn2+ concentration gradients, which critically compromise the cycling stability and operational safety of AZIBs. In this work, an innovative approach is proposed that involves the in situ construction of a fluoride&#8208;ion (F&#8722;) enriched interfacial layer on zinc anodes. This method facilitates in&#8208;plane diffusion of zinc ions at the anode interface, resulting in accelerated lateral growth of zinc deposits rather than dendritic formation. The results indicate that this orientated growth is closely associated with an anionic layer that effectively reduces random and irregular deposition as well as undesirable side reactions. The proposed system exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance within a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte framework, achieving a battery lifespan exceeding 1500 h at a current density of 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, it maintains Coulombic efficiency above 99% after 800 h of cycling. Additionally, the Na2V6O16&#183;3H2O (NVO)//Zn full battery incorporating this additive showcases enhanced long&#8208;term cycling performance and improved capacity retention, further confirming the excellent reversibility of the plating/stripping processes for zinc anode.

         <title>Tailoring Robust Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect via Entropy&#8208;Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bandstructure renormalization, without (w/o) spin&#8208;orbit interaction (SOI) (left) and with SOI (right), in the low&#8208;energy Dirac bands of zero&#8208;entropy (purple) and entropic (green) VCl3 monolayer (ML) with long&#8208;range ordering (LRO). 








Abstract
The development of quantum materials and the tailoring of their functional properties is of fundamental interest in materials science. Here, a new design concept is proposed for the robust quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect via entropy engineering in 2D magnets. As a prototypical example, the configurational entropy of monolayer transition metal trihalide VCl3 is manipulated by incorporating four different transition&#8208;metal cations [Ti,Cr,Fe,Co] into the honeycomb structure made of vanadium, such that all in&#8208;plane mirror symmetries, inversion and/or roto&#8208;inversion are broken. Monolayer VCl3 is a ferromagnetic Dirac half&#8208;metal&#160;in which spin&#8208;polarized Dirac dispersion at valley momenta is accompanied by bulk states at the &#915;&#8208;point and thus the spin&#8208;orbit interaction&#8208;driven QAH&#160;phase does not exhibit fully gapped bulk band dispersion. Entropy&#8208;driven bandstructure renormalization, especially band flattening in combination with red&#8208; and blue&#8208;shifts at different momenta of the Brillouin zone and crystal&#8208;field effects, transforms Dirac half&#8208;metal to a Dirac spin&#8208;gapless semiconductor and leads to a robust QAH phase with fully gapped bulk band dispersion and, thus, a purely topological edge state transport without mixing with dissipative bulk channels. These findings provide a paradigm for designing entropy&#8208;engineered 2D materials for the realization of robust QAH effect and quantum device&#160;applications.

         <title>Fluoroether Design Enables High&#8208;Voltage All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A durable high&#8208;voltage all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte is developed by incorporating a novel organic/inorganic hybrid porous component with a fluoroether design. Due to the weakened Li+ coordination structure, the proposed high&#8208;voltage SSE exhibits durable antioxidation. The optimized electrolytes show ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance in Li||Li cells, LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||Li cells, and LiMn0.6Fe0.4PO4||Li cells even under 4.5V.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;voltage all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) holds transformative potential for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies but remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a new prototype design is presented that integrates fluorinated ether segments into the traditional oxide nanocomposite phase, enabling poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based composite electrolytes with exceptional anti&#8208;oxidation durability and enhance overall electrochemical performance. Through a combination of experimental and computational analyses, it is demonstrated that the superior performance is attributed to the formation of reconstructed Li&#8314; solvation with weakly coordinating environments. The proposed formulation exhibits excellent Li&#8208;metal compatibility, enabling stable cycling in symmetric Li||Li cells for over 9500 h. The solid&#8208;state electrolyte also exhibits outstanding high&#8208;voltage stability with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes, extending the operational voltage from 4.0 to 4.5 V. Moreover, the LiMn1&#8208;xFexPO4||Li cells have delivered remarkable cycling performance, achieving over 1200 cycles with 99% capacity retention after 500 cycles. This work establishes an innovative platform for designing electrolytes with superior antioxidation properties and enhance structural durability, paving the way for the advancement of high&#8208;voltage all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Unraveling the Impact of Electrosorbed Ions on the Scaling Behavior of Fast&#8208;Charging Dynamics of Nanoporous Electrodes Toward Digital Design of Iontronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrosorbed ions under nanoconfinement (see TOC figure) critically reshape electrochemical potentials and impact ion transport in porous electrodes. By integrating modified Poisson&#8211;Nernst&#8211;Planck simulations with multilayered graphene membrane experiments, this study establishes a scaling relation and reveals electrosorption&#8208;enhanced transport, offering a computationally efficient framework for designing high&#8208;performance, fast&#8208;charging electrochemical and iontronic devices.








Abstract
Electrolyte&#8208;filled nanoporous electrodes with fast&#8208;charging capability are critical for advanced energy storage and iontronic devices. However, experiments and simulations consistently show that increasing electrode thickness degrades performance by limiting ion access to effective electrode/electrolyte interfaces, especially under fast&#8208;charging conditions. While often attributed to sluggish ion transport, the underlying mechanisms and the quantitative link between thickness and performance remain unclear due to complex pore structures and nanoconfined ion dynamics. Here, using multilayered graphene membranes as a model system, modified Poisson&#8211;Nernst&#8211;Planck simulations with experiments are combined to reveal how electrosorbed ions reshape local electrical and chemical potentials, particularly as the surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio increases with reduced pore size. It is shown that electrosorbed ions substantially influence the scaling behavior of capacitance across electrode thicknesses, causing marked deviations from classical transmission line models as pores approach nanometric dimensions. Despite the complexity introduced by nanoconfinement, introducing a correction factor enables capacitance&#8211;scan rate relationships to collapse into a unified curve across various electrode architectures, allowing computationally efficient design of high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging electrochemical and iontronic devices. This work highlights the unique role of 2D nanomaterials as a versatile platform for bridging experiments and theory to address long&#8208;standing challenges in ion transport dynamics.

Abstract
Designing 2D mesoporous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets to overcome the limitations of bulk MOF counterparts, with a focus on enabling smooth mass transport, presents an attractive yet challenging endeavor. Here, a novel bottom&#8208;up interface&#8208;directed co&#8208;assembly method is presented for the synthesis of ultrathin 2D mesoporous UiO&#8208;66(Ce) nanosheets. The method utilizes an interface&#8208;directed co&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic perfluorooctanoic acid&#8208;induced lipid bilayers and spherical micelles from PS&#8208;b&#8208;PEO block copolymers to form unique 2D sandwich&#8208;like assemblies that guide the creation of 2D mesoporous UiO&#8208;66(Ce). The resultant 2D mesoporous UiO&#8208;66(Ce), with &#8776;23&#160;nm pore diameters and a thickness that can be tuned from 3 to 150&#160;nm, represents a substantial advancement in the application of MOFs for environmental remediation. As a model reaction, the U(VI) photoreduction benefits from the through&#8208;mesopores of its 2D morphology, which are absent in previously reported UiO&#8208;66(Ce), as they shorten the diffusion path, thereby improving mass transport and accessibility to active sites. This report demonstrates the significant role of existing mesopores in MOFs and the shape control of MOFs.

         <title>Constructing Asymmetric Sn&#8208;Cu&#8208;C Interface via Defective Carbon Trapped Atomic Clusters for Efficient Neutral Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work constructs asymmetric Sn&#8208;Cu&#8208;C interface via anchoring SnCu atomic clusters on carbon defects. Such as&#8208;synthesized SnCu&#8208;DG catalyst achieves a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency (99.5%) and a record intrinsic activity of 2.61 &#215; 10&#8722;17 mmol h&#8722;1 siteCu&#8722;1 at neutral electrolyte condition. This work reveals that the electronic asymmetry enhanced by carbon defects is the key for multi&#8208;step electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;atom cluster (MACs) catalysts have recently attracted significant research interest for their potential to catalyze multi&#8208;electron reactions through cooperative interactions among adjacent active sites. However, the controllable synthesis of MACs and the electrocatalytic mechanism understanding of their synergistic effects remain challenging. Herein, we develop a defect engineering strategy to anchor bimetallic SnCu atomic clusters at defective graphene (SnCu&#8208;DG) via carbon defect&#8208;mediated atomic trapping, wherein edge defects act as confined reactors for cluster nucleation. Taking nitrate reduction as an example, the SnCu&#8208;DG catalyst achieves a high NH3 Faradaic efficiency (99.5%) at neutral electrolyte condition, accompanied by a record intrinsic activity of 2.61 &#215; 10&#8722;17 mmol h&#8722;1 siteCu&#8722;1, surpassing Cu&#8208;DG and SnCu&#8208;G counterparts by 16.0&#8208; and 7.8&#8208;fold, respectively. X&#8208;ray adsorption spectra and theoretical calculations reveal the electrons transfer between Cu and carbon defect sites while Sn incorporation intensifies asymmetric charge polarization across the Sn&#8208;Cu&#8208;C interface. This dual modulation collaboratively optimizes the catalytic microenvironment, simultaneously enhancing *NO2&#8722; adsorption, accelerating water dissociation kinetics, and breaking the intrinsic linear scaling between intermediate adsorption and hydrogenation.

         <title>3D Printing for Neural Repair: Bridging the Gap in Regenerative Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 36, September 11, 2025. </description>

This perspective article discusses how 3D bioprinting is advancing the development of neural tissue models and implants. It highlights recent progress in fabricating complex, multicellular neural constructs, examines current technical barriers, and outlines future applications in disease modeling, neurotoxicity testing, and regenerative therapies. Bioprinting offers new opportunities for personalized approaches to neurological repair.








Abstract
Neurological disorders impose a substantial global health burden, compounded by the limited regenerative capacity of neural tissues and the absence of curative therapies. 3D bioprinting offers a transformative tool to model, replace, and regenerate neural tissues through the precise spatial organization of cells and biomaterials. In this perspective article, recent advances are examined in: i) the development of in vitro neural platforms for disease modeling and drug screening; ii) bioprinted acellular scaffolds designed to guide endogenous neural repair; and iii) cell&#8208;laden constructs that aim to replace or reconstruct damaged neural circuits. Key translational challenges are critically evaluated, including vascularization, immune integration, functional maturation, and replicating the complex cytoarchitectures of native neural tissues. Highlighting representative preclinical studies and emerging biofabrication technologies, we discuss how innovations in biomaterials, scaffold design, stem cell biology, and neuroengineering are converging to overcome existing limitations. Through tailored strategies and interdisciplinary collaboration, 3D bioprinting is poised to redefine therapeutic paradigms and drive the development of next&#8208;generation, personalized regenerative therapies for neurological diseases and injuries.

         <title>Pure&#8208;Green Circularly Polarized Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Enantiomers with Discontinuous Fused Benzene Rings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A circularly polarized multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF) molecular engineering composed of discontinuous fused benzene rings is proposed, and obtains a pair of green BN[7]helicene&#8208;based emitters (P/M)&#8208;DBN&#8208;mICz. (P) and (M)&#8208;DBN&#8208;mICz&#8208;based electroluminescence devices deliver pure&#8208;green emission peaking at 516&#160;nm, with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.17, 0.72), electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gELs) of +5.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3/&#8722;8.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 37.3%/36.6%, respectively.








Abstract
Helicene&#8208;based circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials suffer from severely low color purity in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Here, a novel molecular engineering strategy is introduced by replacing helicene containing continuous fused benzene rings with a multiple resonance (MR) framework comprising discontinuous fused benzene rings. This approach effectively suppresses high&#8208;frequency C&#9472;C bond stretching vibrations and enhances short&#8208;range charge transfer, enabling high color purity, CPL activity, and efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept green BN[7]helicene&#8208;based emitters (P/M)&#8208;DBN&#8208;mICz display bright and narrowband green emission peaking at 512&#160;nm with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 25&#160;nm. Notably, the enantiomers (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;DBN&#8208;mICz exhibit narrowband CPL spectra with FWHMs of 26 and 25&#160;nm, the Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.14, 0.72) and (0.15, 0.72), and photoluminescence dissymmetry factors of +2.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and &#8722;2.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;DBN&#8208;mICz&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs deliver pure&#8208;green emission, characterized by a peak wavelength of 516&#160;nm, a narrow FWHM of 27&#160;nm, and CIE coordinates of (0.17, 0.72), representing the purest green CP&#8208;OLEDs reported to date. Furthermore, these devices exhibit high electroluminescence dissymmetry factors of +5.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3/&#8722;8.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, and maximum external quantum efficiencies of 37.3% and 36.6%, respectively.

         <title>Phase Stabilization of In2Se3 by Disordered Ni Intercalation and its Enhanced Thermoelectrical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that disordered Ni intercalation in In2Se3 stabilizes the phase structure, enhances electrical conductivity, and reduces thermal conductivity. This strategy improves the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT by 86% (in&#8208;plane) and 222% (out&#8208;of&#8208;plane) at 500&#160;&#176;C, providing new insights for optimizing layered thermoelectric materials.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) layered materials have gained significant attention owing to their distinctive structure and unique properties. The weak interlayer bonding in vdW layered materials enables guest atom intercalation, allowing precise tuning of their physical and chemical properties. In this work, a ternary compound, NixIn2Se3 (x = 0&#8211;0.3), with Ni randomly occupying the interlayers of In2Se3, is synthesized via an intercalation route driven by electron injection. The intercalated Ni atoms act as &#8220;anchor points&#8221; within the interlayer of In2Se3, which effectively suppresses the phase transition of In2Se3 at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the disordered Ni intercalation significantly enhanced the electrical conductivity of In2Se3 through electron injection, while reducing the thermal conductivity due to the interlayer phonon scattering, leading to an improved thermoelectric performance. For instance, the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of Ni0.3In2Se3 increased by 86% (in&#8208;plane) and 222% (out&#8208;of&#8208;plane) compared to In2Se3 at 500&#160;&#176;C. These findings not only provide an effective strategy to enhance the performance of layered thermoelectric materials but also demonstrate the potential of intercalation chemistry for expanding the application scope of van der Waals (vdW) layered materials.

         <title>A New Family of Ternary Intermetallic Compounds with Dualistic Atomic Ordering &#8211; The ZIP Phases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ZIP phases are ternary intermetallic compounds with dualistic atomic ordering, i.e., they exhibit one face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc; space group Fd3&#175;$\bar 3$m) variant and one hexagonal (space group P63/mmc) variant. The ZIP phases in the Nb&#8208;Si&#8208;Ni system are the Nb3SiNi2 (fcc) and Ni3SiNb2 (hexagonal) ternary IMCs, crystal structure schematics of which are pasted on the yin&#8208;yang Chinese cosmological symbol of duality.








Abstract
A new family of nanostructured ternary intermetallic compounds &#8722; named the ZIP phases &#8722; is introduced in this work. The ZIP phases exhibit dualistic atomic ordering, i.e., they form two structural variants: one with the fcc diamond cubic structure (space group Fd3&#175;$\bar 3$m) and one with the hexagonal structure (space group P63/mmc). They are also characterized by metallic behavior, ionic bonding, and atomic zigzagging. Powder metallurgical routes involving pressure&#8208;assisted densification are adopted to demonstrate ZIP phase synthesis in the Nb&#8208;Si&#8208;Ni, Nb&#8208;Si&#8208;Co, Ta&#8208;Si&#8208;Ni, V&#8208;Si&#8208;Ni, and Nb&#8208;Si&#8208;Fe ternary systems. Crucially, reactive hot pressing is capable of producing high&#8208;purity ZIP phase materials after the judicious, elemental system&#8208;specific optimization of the processing route. Synthesis of phase&#8208;pure materials &#8211; demonstrated in the Nb&#8208;Si&#8208;Ni ternary system by the synthesis of quasi phase&#8208;pure Nb3SiNi2 and Ni3SiNb2 ZIP phase&#8208;based materials &#8211; is a steppingstone to the prospective exploitation of the ZIP phases. Characterization of Nb3SiNi2 and Ni3SiNb2 involves crystal structure determination, spatially resolved chemical analysis, and determination of select thermal, electrical, magnetic, mechanical, and physical properties. Density functional theory is used to assess the stability of Nb3SiNi2 &amp; Ni3SiNb2 and derivative binary compounds at different temperatures, also exploring the exfoliation of these two ZIP phases along specific surfaces to produce 2D derivatives.

         <title>Enabling Ultra&#8208;High Work Capacity and Scalable Processability of Liquid Crystal Actuators through Densely Entangled Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight linear liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) with densely entangled structures are designed and synthesized. These entanglements significantly enhance the mechanical properties, resulting in an unprecedented work capacity during thermal actuation. The reversible nature of the entanglements makes the material easy to process, similar to conventional thermoplastic materials. This combination achieves both high work capacity and scalable processability for LCEs.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are important soft actuators that show strong promise in many fields where traditional rigid actuators or robotics are impractical. However, their real&#8208;world applications are lacking primarily due to inadequate actuation performance and complicated fabrication processes. Here, a novel design is reported that significantly enhances actuation performance while simplifying the fabrication process. The design involves constructing densely entangled structures by synthesizing high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight linear LCEs (&gt;180&#160;kDa) with a moderate number of side groups in a single step. These entangled structures greatly enhance mechanical strength while maintaining toughness, resulting in an ultra&#8208;high actuation work capacity (1427&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3). By applying melt shearing or solvent treatment, these entanglements can be temporarily disrupted, providing thermoplastic&#8208;like processability. With these properties, lightweight wearable devices (&lt;10 g) capable of generating over 30&#160;N of contractile force are developed, which is sufficient to reversibly lift an adult male's arm. This work employs a single fabrication step to develop densely entangled LCEs with exceptional actuation performance and thermoplastic&#8208;like processability, signaling a bright future for their applications in rehabilitation devices, wearables, and beyond.

&lt;p&gt;High-molecular-weight linear liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) with densely entangled structures are designed and synthesized. These entanglements significantly enhance the mechanical properties, resulting in an unprecedented work capacity during thermal actuation. The reversible nature of the entanglements makes the material easy to process, similar to conventional thermoplastic materials. This combination achieves both high work capacity and scalable processability for LCEs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are important soft actuators that show strong promise in many fields where traditional rigid actuators or robotics are impractical. However, their real-world applications are lacking primarily due to inadequate actuation performance and complicated fabrication processes. Here, a novel design is reported that significantly enhances actuation performance while simplifying the fabrication process. The design involves constructing densely entangled structures by synthesizing high-molecular-weight linear LCEs (&amp;gt;180&#160;kDa) with a moderate number of side groups in a single step. These entangled structures greatly enhance mechanical strength while maintaining toughness, resulting in an ultra-high actuation work capacity (1427&#160;kJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). By applying melt shearing or solvent treatment, these entanglements can be temporarily disrupted, providing thermoplastic-like processability. With these properties, lightweight wearable devices (&amp;lt;10 g) capable of generating over 30&#160;N of contractile force are developed, which is sufficient to reversibly lift an adult male's arm. This work employs a single fabrication step to develop densely entangled LCEs with exceptional actuation performance and thermoplastic-like processability, signaling a bright future for their applications in rehabilitation devices, wearables, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optically Controlled Memristor Enabling Synergistic Sensing&#8208;Memory&#8208;Computing for Neuromorphic Vision Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel optically controlled KNbO3 memristor is developed. This device utilizes light&#8208;modulated oxygen vacancies to regulate the formation of conductive filaments, enabling nonvolatile switching behavior. The memristor demonstrated a high switching ratio (&gt;102), endurance 6 &#215; 106 cycles, extended retention (&gt;104 s), and pronounced light/dark contrast. These characteristics significantly enhance the visual perception capabilities under complex lighting conditions. The implementation achieved 96% image recognition accuracy, demonstrating substantial progress in bioinspired vision chip technology.








Abstract

Neuromorphic Visual Devices hold considerable promise for integration into neuromorphic vision systems that combine sensing, memory, and computing. This potential arises from their synergistic benefits in optical signal detection and neuro&#8208;inspired computational processes. However, current devices face challenges such as insufficient light/dark resistance ratios, mismatched transient photo&#8208;response, and volatile retention characteristics, limiting their adaptability to complex artificial vision systems. Here, a novel optically controlled memristor is developed by leveraging the unique properties of KNbO3, where resistive switching originates from the dynamic reconstruction of conductive filaments controlled by light&#8208;modulated oxygen vacancy charges. Experimental results reveal exceptional reconfigurable electrical characteristics across the 405&#8211;650 nm visible spectrum: optically triggered nonvolatile resistive switching, dual&#8208;modal dark&#8208;state operation, switching ratio &gt;102, endurance 6 &#215; 106 cycles, retention &gt;104 s, photo&#8208;to&#8208;dark current ratio &gt;102, and self&#8208;powered capability. The enhanced light/dark resistance contrast significantly improves visual perception in complex illumination environments, whereas the synergistic interplay between the dynamic photo&#8208;response and nonvolatile storage balances transient signal processing with persistent information retention. In integrated sensing&#8208;memory&#8208;computing tasks, the devices achieved recognition accuracies of 96% and 85% on the standard Jellyfish dataset and its low&#8208;illumination variant, demonstrating technical feasibility and providing a theoretically grounded solution with practical implications for the development of bioinspired vision chips.

         <title>Diatom&#8208;Inspired Scaffold for Infected Bone Defect Therapy: Achieving Stable Photothermal Properties and Coordinated Antibacterial&#8208;Osteogenic Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the hierarchical structure of diatoms, this work presents a biomimetic bone repair scaffold based on copper&#8208;doped iron goethite (Fe(Cu)OOH) nanoparticles and a mesoporous SiO2 protective layer, achieving simultaneously efficient antibacterial performance at low temperatures, immune modulation, and bone regeneration.









Abstract

Bone defect therapy frequently encounters bacterial infections and chronic inflammation, which impair bone regeneration and threaten implant stability. Iron oxide nanoparticles have attracted attention due to cost&#8208;effectiveness, biocompatibility, and metabolic safety. However, iron oxide nanoparticles still struggle to balance low&#8208;temperature efficient antibacterial activity, effective immunomodulation, and bone regeneration. Therefore, inspired by diatoms, a multifunctional bone repair scaffold based on chitosan&#8208;hydroxyapatite (CH) is developed by integrating the multifunctional properties of copper&#8208;doped iron goethite (Fe(Cu)OOH) nanoparticles and a mesoporous SiO2 protective layer (CH/FeCu@SiO2). The &#8220;cytoskeleton&#8221; CH scaffold stabilizes the nanoparticles and supports tissue growth. The &#8220;chloroplast&#8221; Fe(Cu)OOH and the &#8220; frustule&#8221; SiO2 layer synergistically capture near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light to generate localized mild hyperthermia (&#8776;42&#160;&#176;C), with the release of Cu2+ to achieve antibacterial effects (&gt;99%). In addition, Fe(Cu)OOH exhibits enzyme&#8208;like antioxidant activity, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) (69.20%) and thereby promoting M2 macrophage polarization (1.64&#8208;fold), which protects stem cells and creates osteogenic immune microenvironment. Moreover, the mild hyperthermia and ion release upregulate the TGF&#8208;&#946; signaling pathway and inhibit osteoclast differentiation, promoting vascularized bone regeneration and defect repair (1.3&#8208;fold). Overall, this biomimetic scaffold, enabling synergistic antibacterial, immunomodulatory, and osteogenic activities, offers a promising therapeutic strategy for infectious bone defects treatment.

         <title>Competing Grain Growth Pathways in Anisotropic Bi2Te3&#8208;Based Thermoelectric Nanoplates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using in situ microscopy and simulations, this study unravels competing grain growth pathways in Bi2Te3&#8208;based nanoplates. It is found that pure Bi2Te3 nanoplates undergo predominantly surface&#8208;driven reshaping, while Sb&#8208;doping alters interfacial chemistry to promote collective grain merging. This work demonstrates how grain boundary modification can rationally steer microstructural evolution for advanced thermoelectric materials.








Abstract
Thermoelectric nanoplates derived from anisotropic van der Waals (vdW) materials such as Bi2Te3 are pivotal for flexible electronics and microscale thermal management. Their performance critically depends on grain boundary (GB) microstructure, but the atomic&#8208;scale mechanisms governing grain growth in these highly anisotropic systems remain elusive. This particularly concerns the competition between individual nanoplate reshaping driven by facet stabilization and collective merging at GBs. Integrating in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), density functional theory (DFT), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, these competing pathways in pure Bi2Te3 (BT) and Sb&#8208;doped (BST) systems are unraveled. Undoped BT nanoplates preferentially undergo atomically localized reshaping, with atoms migrating from high&#8208;energy edges to stabilize low&#8208;energy facets. Conversely, Sb doping introduces Sb&#8208;Te interfacial phases that thermodynamically favor GB coalescence, thereby shifting the dominant pathway to collective merging. This work reveals how chemical modification steers GB evolution, determining whether reshaping or merging predominates. Such understanding is crucial for rationally designing anisotropic layered materials for applications in flexible electronics, topological materials, and energy&#8208;efficient devices.

         <title>Interstitial Cobalt in Pt Shell of Pd@Pt Mesoporous Core&#8211;Shell Nanospheres with Strong d&#8211;d Orbital Hybridization for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Ammonia Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates an interstitial Co in Pt shell of Pd@Pt catalyst for ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR). Pt&#8208;Co d&#8208;d orbital hybridization optimizes Pt's electronic structure, lowering the energy barrier for N&#8208;N coupling. The catalyst exhibits 4.8&#8208;fold higher AOR activity than commercial Pt/C and enables stable operation of a Zn&#8208;NH3 battery while maintaining a high hydrogen production Faradaic efficiency of 96.8%. 








Abstract
Ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) is critical for efficient ammonia utilization as a hydrogen carrier, yet state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt&#8208;based catalysts suffer significant activity loss due to strong *NOx species (*NO, *NO2) adsorption. Herein, Pd@Pt mesoporous core&#8208;shell nanospheres with interstitial Co in Pt shell (Pd@Pt&#8208;Co MCSN) are demonstrated as an excellent AOR electrocatalyst, which achieves a mass activity of 293.6 A g&#8722;1 at 0.7&#160;V versus RHE, 4.8&#8208;fold higher than commercial Pt/C. The interstitial Co dopant tunes the d&#8208;d orbital hybridization state, optimizes the Pt d&#8208;band center position, and facilitates electron transfer from Co to Pt, which effectively weakens the adsorption of toxic *NOx and lowers the energy barrier for N&#8208;N coupling. When integrated into a Zn&#8208;NH3 battery, the catalyst enables efficient NH3&#8208;to&#8208;H2 conversion with a Faradaic efficiency of 96.8% and stable operation for 30 hours at 12&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The work may provide a new design concept to develop advanced electrocatalysts for AOR.

When integrated into a Zn-NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; battery, the catalyst enables efficient NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-to-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion with a Faradaic efficiency of 96.8% and stable operation for 30 hours at 12&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The work may provide a new design concept to develop advanced electrocatalysts for AOR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Driven Weak Electrostatic Interaction of Polybenzimidazole&#8208;Based Membrane for Alkaline Zinc&#8208;Iron Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AlF3&#8208;PBI membranes with Lewis acid&#8208;modulated electronic structure enable high&#8208;performance alkaline zinc&#8208;iron flow batteries. By reducing electron density on benzimidazole rings, AlF3 weakens interactions between charge&#8208;balance ions and polymer, achieving enhanced ionic conductivity. The optimized membrane delivers a high power density of 1000 mW cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over cycles at 140 mA cm&#8722;2, offering a novel strategy for durable grid&#8208;scale energy storage.








Abstract
Alkaline zinc&#8208;iron flow batteries (AZIFBs) are one of the promising aqueous redox chemistries for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their intrinsic safety and low cost. However, the energy efficiency (EE) and power density of batteries with low&#8208;cost polybenzimidazole (PBI) membranes are still limited due to the relatively poor ionic conductivity of PBI in an alkaline medium. Here, this study proposes a novel chemical approach for regulating the chemical environment of the PBI membrane. Specifically, AlF3, as a representative Lewis acid, is employed to reduce the electron cloud density of the benzimidazole (BI) ring, weaken the electrostatic interactions between the BI ring and charge&#8208;balancing ions, and thereby accelerate the diffusion of charge&#8208;balancing ions. Characterizations on the AlF3&#8208;PBI membranes reveal that the enhanced ion transport can be ascribed to decreased electron cloud density of BI rings and reduced ion diffusion resistance. Charge density difference analysis further illustrates the electron&#8208;withdrawing feature of AlF3 as a Lewis acid. AZIFBs using AlF3&#8208;PBI membrane demonstrate excellent rate capability from 40 to 240 mA cm&#8722;2 with EE of more than 80%, and an outstanding power density of nearly 1000 mW cm&#8722;2. The battery also performs decent cycle stability of 500 cycles at a high current density of 140 mA cm&#8722;2 with EE over 80%, resulting from the robust stability of the AlF3&#8208;PBI membrane and the reliability of the strategy. This study highlights the potential of Lewis acid&#8208;based chemical regulation to optimize PBI&#8208;based membranes, offering a new perspective for enhancing the performance of AZIFBs.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Stress&#8208;Free Percutaneous Bioelectrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structurally adaptive soft microneedle bioelectrode is developed with an effervescent sacrificial core that dissolves after insertion, leaving an ultrathin and highly compliant electrode integrated with skin. This design enables ultra&#8208;flexible, cell&#8208;stress&#8208;free, stable, and high&#8208;fidelity electrophysiological monitoring under dynamic conditions such as sweat and dehydration, surpassing conventional film and gel electrodes in both long&#8208;term signal stability and mechanical compatibility.








Abstract
Wearable bioelectronics have advanced dramatically over the past decade, yet remain constrained by their superficial placement on the skin, which renders them vulnerable to environmental fluctuations and mechanical instability. Existing microneedle (MN) electrodes offer minimally invasive access to dermal tissue, but their rigid, bulky design&#8212;often 100 times larger and 10,000 times stiffer than dermal fibroblasts&#8212;induces pain, tissue damage, and chronic inflammation, limiting their long&#8208;term applicability. Here, a cell&#8208;stress&#8208;free percutaneous bioelectrode is presented, comprising an ultrathin (&lt;2&#160;&#181;m), soft MN (sMN) that dynamically softens via an effervescent structural transformation after insertion. The sMN exhibits near&#8208;zero Poisson's ratio deformation, preserving cellular morphology and minimizing immune activation over multiple days of use in rats and humans. Synchrotron imaging and histological analysis reveal reduced tissue disruption, while electrophysiological measurements demonstrate stable signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios under sweat, dehydration, and extended use. This architecture shifts the biosensing interface from the epidermis to the dermis, establishing a mechanically and electrically stable platform for environment&#8208;independent signal acquisition. The findings establish dermal electronics as a next&#8208;generation paradigm for long&#8208;term, biocompatible wearable sensing.

         <title>High Performance Transmission&#8208;Type Daytime Radiative Cooling Film with a Simple and Scalable Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative, scalable method fabricates transmission&#8208;type radiative cooling textiles by blending mid&#8208;infrared (mid&#8208;IR) transparent styrene ethylene butylene styrene (SEBS) with polyethylene, then selectively dissolving SEBS to create pores. The textile achieves 95% solar reflectivity, 80% mid&#8208;IR transmittance, and sub&#8208;ambient cooling of 4&#176;C. This process reduces production costs by 68% and CO2 emissions by 92% versus conventional methods.








Abstract
Transmission&#8208;type radiative cooling textiles represent a vital strategy for personal thermal management. However, traditional preparation methods based on heat&#8208;induced phase separation face significant challenges regarding cost, environmental impact, and optical performance. Herein, a novel preparation method is devloped by blending mid&#8208;IR transparent solid styrene ethylene butylene styrene (SEBS) with solid polyethylene (PE), enabling the creation of pores through dissolving SEBS. Consequently, large&#8208;scale production of transmission&#8208;type radiative cooling films at the meter scale are achieved, exhibiting 95% solar reflectivity and 80% mid&#8208;IR transmittance. Moreover, this method reduces costs by 68% and diminishes CO2 emissions by 92%. Under sunny and cloudy conditions (solar irradiance &#8776;730 and 280&#160;Wm&#8722;2, respectively), the film&#8208;covered simulated skin demonstrates sub&#8208;ambient cooling effects of &#8776;4 and 3&#160;&#176;C. Given its exceptional passive cooling capabilities, low&#8208;cost, and scalability, this film holds great potential for industrial and personal applications.

         <title>Diverse Perovskite Solar Cells: Progress, Challenges, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress, challenges, and perspectives for diverse categories of perovskite solar cells classified according to composition, dimension, and crystallinity are overviewed.








Abstract
Perovskite materials have revolutionized optoelectronics by virtue of their tunable bandgaps, exceptional optoelectronic properties, and structural flexibility. Notably, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance of perovskite solar cells has reached 27%, making perovskite materials a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technology. Although numerous reviews regarding perovskite materials have been published, the existing reviews generally focus on individual material systems (e.g., organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites) and specific optimizations in one particular optoelectronic application (e.g., stability engineering for solar cells), lacking a systematic overview of the progress and challenges across diverse perovskite types. This review breaks this limitation by providing a systematic overview of all perovskite categories used in solar cells classified by different criteria, including composition (organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, all&#8208;inorganic perovskites, lead&#8208;free perovskites, and metal&#8208;free perovskites), dimensionality (3D and low&#8208;dimensional perovskitoids), and crystallinity (poly&#8208;crystal thin film and single&#8208;crystal perovskites). The recent progress and future perspectives for each category of perovskite solar cells are focused on, aiming to establish a holistic roadmap for perovskite solar cells toward technological innovations and industrial viability.

         <title>Mechanoluminescent Aluminum Nitride Crystal for Super&#8208;Sensitive Optical Manometry, Thermometry and Force Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the first discovery of intrinsic mechanoluminescence in undoped AlN crystals, accompanied by pronounced photoluminescence and persistent luminescence. It further demonstrates a defect&#8208;emission&#8211;driven multifunctional optical sensing platform for force, pressure, and temperature detection, achieving exceptional sensitivities.








Abstract
AlN is a core material widely used as a substrate and heat sink in various electronic and optoelectronic devices. Introducing luminescent properties into intrinsic AIN opens new opportunities for next&#8208;generation intelligent sensors, self&#8208;powered displays, and wearable electronics. In this study, the first evidence is presented of AlN crystals exhibiting satisfactory mechanoluminescence (ML), photoluminescence (PL), and afterglow performance, demonstrating their potential as novel multifunctional optical sensors. A series of undoped AlN crystals (ranging from &#181;m to mm scale) is successfully synthesized on tungsten substrates via physical vapor transport. A multimodal optical sensing platform is developed, showing afterglow and PL for temperature and pressure sensing, and ML for force detection. Despite minimal structural deformation under extreme conditions, attributed to the high bulk modulus of AIN, the optical sensors, driven by intrinsic defect&#8208;related emissions, exhibited excellent sensitivity to temperature and pressure. Notably, significant and previously unreported differences in the PL and ML spectra are observed in response to light and mechanical stimuli, respectively. These spectral variations are attributed to the activation of distinct defect states during PL and ML processes. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study represents a significant step forward in the development of optical sensing technologies for extreme environments and force detection applications.

         <title>On Refining Exciton Dissociation and Charge Transport of Nonfullerene Organic Photovoltaics: from Star&#8208;Shaped Acceptors to Molecular Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two seminal strategies&#8211;star&#8208;shaped structure and molecular doping are highlighted in this perspective, which can reconcile the intricacy of exciton dissociation and charge transport through optimization of molecular characteristics, morphology, and energy landscape.








Abstract
Nonfullerene acceptor&#8208;based organic solar cells have recently taken a milestone leap with power conversion efficiencies approaching 20%. A key to further boost the efficiencies up to the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit rests upon attaining a delicate balance between exciton dissociation and charge transport. This perspective presents two seminal and reciprocal strategies developed by our group and others to reconcile the intricacy of charge carrier dynamics, spanning from intrinsic molecular structure design to extrinsic dopant exploitation. Emerging star&#8208;shaped nonfullerene structures are highlighted by their favorable impacts of 3D molecular characteristics, aggregation&#8208;state attributes, and donor:acceptor miscibility on exciton dissociation. Complementarily, n&#8208;type molecular doping is implemented on the nonfullerene photoactive layers by finely optimizing energy landscape to facilitate charge transport and manipulating the blend film morphology, especially in donor&#8208;dilute semitransparent organic solar cells. The remaining challenges to these two modular approaches are elucidated, and further deployments are envisioned with insightful viewpoints on leveraging exciton and charge dynamics.

         <title>Toward Rational Electrocatalyst Design: Dynamic Insights from Liquid Environmental Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing efficient electrocatalysts relies on a deep understanding of electrocatalytic processes under realistic reaction conditions&#8212;an area that has long remained a &#8220;black box.&#8221; This review highlights how liquid environmental transmission electron microscopy (LETEM) addresses fundamental challenges in electrocatalytic research. By bridging &#8220;material and environmental gaps&#8221;, LETEM provides unprecedented insights into the underlying mechanism and dynamic structure&#8208;activity relationship for electrocatalysis.









Abstract
Electrocatalysis, a pivotal field at the intersection of physical chemistry and materials science, plays a crucial role in advancing energy conversion and storage technologies through rational catalyst design. However, understanding reaction mechanisms at the atomic level remains a great challenge due to the intricate interplay between catalysts, reactants, and complex environments (e.g., electric fields, liquid electrolytes). This complexity has led to persistent &#8220;material&#8221; and &#8220;environment&#8221; gaps between conventional electrocatalytic research and the practical behavior of catalysts under realistic operating conditions. The emergence of liquid environmental transmission electron microscopy (LETEM) enables the characterization of the electrocatalysts coupled with precise electrochemical measurements under operando conditions with both high spatial and temporal resolutions. Recent breakthroughs in atomic&#8208;scale characterization of dynamic processes of electrocatalysts under realistic reaction environments have demonstrated the exceptional potential of LETEM for elucidating the nature of electrocatalysis and establishing robust atomic&#8208;level structure&#8208;activity relationships. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the research progress in the dynamic evolution of electrocatalysts via LETEM, with a particular focus on the structural evolution of electrocatalysts under electro&#8208;liquid coupled environments. This review is expected to provide insights for unlocking fundamental mechanisms and the rational design of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Air&#8208;Stable Polymer Monolayer Transistors for Monolithic 3D CMOS logics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fibrillar polymer monolayer with a self&#8208;confinement effect is demonstrated, in which aligned chains parallel the nanofiber axis. Employing a top&#8208;gate CYTOP dielectric, this monolayer transistor achieves high mobility (7.12 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and exceptional stability over 1260 days in air. Furthermore, monolithic 3D integration with n&#8208;type oxide transistors is achieved, enabling hybrid complementary inverters with reasonable voltage amplification capability.








Abstract
The monolayer transistor, where the semiconductor layer is a single molecular layer,&#160;offers an ideal platform for exploring transport mechanisms both theoretically and experimentally by eliminating the influence of spatially correlated microstructure.&#160;However, the structure&#8208;property relations in polymer monolayers remain poorly understood, leading to low transistor performance to date. Herein, a&#160;self&#8208;confinement effect is demonstrated in the polymer monolayer with nanofibrillar microstructures and&#160;edge&#8208;on orientation, as characterized by the 4D scanning confocal electron diffraction&#160;method. The polymer chains align parallel to the nanofiber long axis, while the &#960;&#8208;stacking direction aligns perpendicular to this axis. To reduce the trap density at the&#160;semiconductor/dielectric interface, a top&#8208;gate configuration is employed with CYTOP as gate dielectric, and the resulting monolayer transistors achieve a field&#8208;effect mobility&#160;of 7.12 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, an on/off ratio of 10&#8312;, and a subthreshold swing of 0.21&#160;V&#160;dec&#8722;1, among the performance records for polymer monolayer transistors. Notably, the top&#8208;gate&#160;architecture allows self&#8208;encapsulation, and the monolayer network induces the morphologic lock effect, contributing to a remarkable device stability over 1260 days. Additionally, the low thermal budget of this polymer monolayer transistor enables the monolithic 3D integration with n&#8208;type oxide transistor, resulting in hybrid&#160;complementary inverters with reasonable voltage amplification capabilities.

         <title>Intensifying D&#8208;Orbitals Energy Level Splitting of Local Co Atoms in CoO Lattice for Accelerated Iodine Redox Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduced oxygen vacancies in CoO lattice induce low&#8208;to&#8208;high spin state transition at adjacent Co active sites, which optimizes spin&#8208;orbital coupling with I2/I&#8210; molecular orbitals to enable faster electron donation/acceptance during iodine redox reactions on cathode, thus achieving enhanced energy efficiency of the assembled Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.









Abstract
Modulating the electronic structure of catalysts to maximize their power holds the key to address the challenges faced by zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (ZIBs), including the shuttle effect and slow redox kinetics at the iodine cathode. Herein, oxygen vacancies is innovatively introduced into CoO lattice to create high&#8208;spin&#8208;state Co active sites in nonstoichiometric CoO1&#8331;x nanocrystals supported by carbon nanofibers (H&#8208;CoO1&#8331;x/CNFs). This simple strategy intensifies crystal field splitting of Co 3d orbitals, optimizing the spin&#8208;orbital coupling between Co 3d orbitals and iodine species. The resulting enhanced availability of more unpaired electrons in non&#8208;degenerate eg orbitals facilitates faster electron donation/acceptance during iodine redox reactions, thus improved reaction kinetics. Therefore, the assembled ZIBs employing H&#8208;CoO1&#8331;x/CNFs/I2 cathode acquires a narrower overpotential gap (37 mV), higher initial capacity (203.0 mAh g&#8210;1), and better cycling stability (96.0% capacity retention after 2200 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8210;1) compared to the CoO/CNFs/I2 cathode without experiencing defect engineering (109 mV/192.6 mAh g&#8210;1/74.7% after 1000 cycles). This work opens new avenues for maximizing the potential power of cathode host catalysts, making immediate contributions to the advancement of aqueous halogen batteries.

Therefore, the assembled ZIBs employing H-CoO&lt;sub&gt;1&#8331;x&lt;/sub&gt;/CNFs/I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode acquires a narrower overpotential gap (37 mV), higher initial capacity (203.0 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and better cycling stability (96.0% capacity retention after 2200 cycles at 0.5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;1&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to the CoO/CNFs/I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode without experiencing defect engineering (109 mV/192.6 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;1&lt;/sup&gt;/74.7% after 1000 cycles). This work opens new avenues for maximizing the potential power of cathode host catalysts, making immediate contributions to the advancement of aqueous halogen batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Localized Gradient Conductivity Enabled Ultrasensitive Flexible Tactile Sensors with Ultrawide Linearity Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A design of localized gradient conductivity is presented, combining low&#8208;&#963; CPDMS (carbon/Polydimethylsiloxane) and high&#8208;&#963; AgNWs (silver nanowires) to resolve the mutual restriction between sensitivity and linearity of piezoresistive tactile sensors. The derived series&#8208;parallel switching enables the ultrawide linear range (0&#8211;3000&#160;kPa) and ultrahigh sensitivity (1546.35 kPa&#8722;1). The work opens up promising strategies for future high&#8208;performance flexible tactile sensors toward diverse application scenarios.








Abstract
The high sensitivity and wide linearity are crucial for flexible tactile sensors in adapting to diverse application scenarios with high accuracy and reliability. However, conventional optimization strategies of constructing microstructures suffer from the mutual restriction between the high sensitivity and wide linearity. Herein, a novel design of localized gradient conductivity (LGC) with partly covered low&#8208;conductivity (low&#8208;&#963;) carbon/Polydimethylsiloxane layer on high&#8208;conductivity (high&#8208;&#963;) silver nanowires film upon the micro&#8208;dome structure is proposed. The LGC configuration enables a unique pressure&#8208;motivated series&#8208;parallel switching to allow the low&#8208;&#963; and high&#8208;&#963; components to separately take dominant effects in different pressure ranges. The ultrawide linearity can thus be realized by customizing the segmented linear current variation via the rationally associated coverage degree and conductivity gradient of the low&#8208;&#963; and high&#8208;&#963; components. Moreover, the ultrahigh sensitivity can be originally endowed by the conductivity difference between the low&#8208;&#963; and high&#8208;&#963; components without compromising linearity. The optimized sensor exhibits an ultrahigh sensitivity of 1546.35 kPa&#8722;1 within an ultrabroad linear sensing range of 0&#8211;3000&#160;kPa, which is first reported. With such an excellent sensing performance, the potential applications, e.g., reliable healthcare monitoring, convenient smart home control, and ground detection of intelligent vehicles, are successfully demonstrated.

         <title>Direct Imaging of Hydrogen&#8208;Driven Dislocation and Strain Field Evolution in a Stainless Steel Grain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using in situ Bragg coherent X&#8208;ray diffraction imaging, 3D nanoscale strain maps of a stainless steel grain were&#160;measured during hydrogen charging. Results show dislocation relaxation and climb, elucidating the role of point defects in hydrogen&#8208;modified deformation behavior. Detailed strain measurements reveal shielding of dislocation strain fields. These experimental results validate theoretical predictions and provide new insights into embrittlement mechanisms.








Abstract
Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) poses a significant challenge to the durability of materials used in hydrogen production and utilization. Disentangling the competing nanoscale mechanisms driving HE often relies on simulations and electron&#8208;transparent sample techniques, limiting experimental insights into hydrogen&#8208;induced dislocation behavior in bulk materials. This study employs in situ Bragg coherent X&#8208;ray diffraction imaging to track three&#8208;dimensional (3D) dislocation and strain field evolution during hydrogen charging in a bulk grain of austenitic 316 stainless steel. Tracking a single dislocation reveals hydrogen&#8208;enhanced mobility and relaxation, consistent with dislocation dynamics simulations. Subsequent observations reveal dislocation unpinning and climb processes, likely driven by osmotic forces. Additionally, nanoscale strain analysis around the dislocation core directly measures hydrogen&#8208;induced elastic shielding. These findings experimentally validate theoretical predictions and offer mechanistic insights into hydrogen&#8208;driven dislocation behavior. The quantified nanoscale phenomena serve as critical inputs for multiscale modeling frameworks to predict bulk material responses and accelerate the development of HE&#8208;resistant&#160;alloys.

         <title>Decoupling Transport of Salt Ions and Water in Hierarchically Structured Hydrogel for High Salinity Desalination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchically structured hydrogel evaporator enables controlled decoupling of salt&#8208;ion and water transport pathways for efficient solar desalination in hypersaline environments. Engineered radial and vertical channels direct salt away from the evaporative interface, enhancing water evaporation and ambient energy harvesting via a cold&#8208;surface effect. This integrated design supports a scalable zero&#8208;liquid&#8208;discharge desalination platform.








Abstract
Global water scarcity demands next&#8208;generation desalination technologies that transcend the limitations of energy&#8208;intensive processes and salt accumulation. Herein, a groundbreaking interfacial solar steam generation system capable of simultaneous hypersaline desalination and ambient energy harvesting is introduced. Through hierarchical hydrogel architecture incorporating a central vertical channel and radial channels with gradient apertures, the design effectively decouples salt transport and water evaporation: solar&#8208;driven fluid convection directs water outward for evaporation, while inward salt migration prevents surface crystallization and redistributes excess heat. The heat dissipation induces a sub&#8208;ambient &#8220;cold evaporation&#8221; effect, lowering the evaporative interface temperature and enhancing ambient energy utilization. The system achieves a remarkable water evaporation rate exceeding 12&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 in a 20 wt% hypersaline environment and operates continuously for 15 h without salt accumulation. Outdoor testing demonstrates a daily water production of 67.2 L m&#8722;2, with scalable potential for sustainable desalination and industrial brine treatment.

The macro&#8208;experiences of aging are the result of an accumulation of micro&#8208;changes that occur over time.








Abstract
The disparity between the global increase in life expectancy and the steady decline in health outcomes with age has been a major driver for developing new ways to research aging. Although this current tools for studying aging outside of the human body&#8212;such as animal models and cells in a dish&#8212;have improved this fundamental understanding of the markers and key mechanisms underlying this process, several limitations remain. Animal models are poor biological representations of humans and have a weak track record of translating pre&#8208;clinical results into successful clinical applications. Similarly, current 2D cellular models do not recapitulate the dynamic 3D environment of human tissue. This gap between the need for accurate biological mimicry and the limitations of current aging models presents an exciting opportunity for the field of biofabrication. Over the past decade, the combination of biofabrication and advanced biomaterials has shown potential to engineer high&#8208;resolution features that change over time or respond to specific stimuli. In this perspective, the current state of in vitro aging models is reflected, identify the key features that new models must emulate, discuss the technologies available to meet these complex specifications, and consider some of the potential challenges facing the field.

         <title>All&#8208;3D&#8208;Printed Multi&#8208;Environment Modular Microrobots Powered by Large&#8208;Displacement Dielectric Elastomer Microactuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully 3D&#8208;printed modular microrobots capable of performing a broad range of tasks across diverse environments are demonstrated. The key breakthrough lies in the development of a large&#8208;displacement microactuator for multi&#8208;environment navigation and a mesoscale multimaterial 3D printing platform for on&#8208;demand module fabrication. Together, these innovations advance the adaptability, versatility, and scalability of microrobotic systems.








Abstract
Microrobots are expected to push the boundaries of robotics by enabling navigation in confined and cluttered environments due to their sub&#8208;centimeter scale. However, most microrobots perform best only in the specific conditions for which they are designed and require complete redesign and fabrication to adapt to new tasks and environments. Here, fully 3D&#8208;printed modular microrobots capable of performing a broad range of tasks across diverse environments are introduced. For multi&#8208;environment navigation, large&#8208;displacement dielectric elastomer microactuators with a soft&#8208;stiff hybrid structure are developed, capable of powering microrobots to stride over obstacles on various terrestrial terrain and rapidly propel themselves across aquatic terrain. To further expand their capabilities beyond mere navigation, ten task&#8208;specific modules for the microrobots are developed. All modules are fabricated using a digital light processing multimaterial 3D printer capable of simultaneously printing multiple photocurable resins, providing a broadly applicable platform for fabricating mesoscale robotic components. The microrobots navigate across smooth, rough, granular, and aquatic environments, demonstrating tasks such as controlling the movements of nearby robots, interacting with humans to avoid collisions, and collaboratively dragging heavy objects through multi&#8208;unit operation. The study addresses key limitations hindering the integration of modular design into microrobots, enabling adaptation to new environments and tasks.

&lt;p&gt;Fully 3D-printed modular microrobots capable of performing a broad range of tasks across diverse environments are demonstrated. The key breakthrough lies in the development of a large-displacement microactuator for multi-environment navigation and a mesoscale multimaterial 3D printing platform for on-demand module fabrication. Together, these innovations advance the adaptability, versatility, and scalability of microrobotic systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microrobots are expected to push the boundaries of robotics by enabling navigation in confined and cluttered environments due to their sub-centimeter scale. However, most microrobots perform best only in the specific conditions for which they are designed and require complete redesign and fabrication to adapt to new tasks and environments. Here, fully 3D-printed modular microrobots capable of performing a broad range of tasks across diverse environments are introduced. For multi-environment navigation, large-displacement dielectric elastomer microactuators with a soft-stiff hybrid structure are developed, capable of powering microrobots to stride over obstacles on various terrestrial terrain and rapidly propel themselves across aquatic terrain. To further expand their capabilities beyond mere navigation, ten task-specific modules for the microrobots are developed. All modules are fabricated using a digital light processing multimaterial 3D printer capable of simultaneously printing multiple photocurable resins, providing a broadly applicable platform for fabricating mesoscale robotic components. The microrobots navigate across smooth, rough, granular, and aquatic environments, demonstrating tasks such as controlling the movements of nearby robots, interacting with humans to avoid collisions, and collaboratively dragging heavy objects through multi-unit operation. The study addresses key limitations hindering the integration of modular design into microrobots, enabling adaptation to new environments and tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrasound Active Piezoelectric Nanostimulators for Long&#8208;Acting Wireless Deep Brain Electric Stimulation to Inhibit Epileptic Seizures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine&#8208;coated barium titanate piezoelectric nanoparticles are explored as wireless nanostimulators for deep brain electrical stimulation. These nanostimulators can adhere to the neuronal membrane and generate electrical signals under low&#8208;intensity ultrasound to precisely activate neurons and associated neural circuits through triggering voltage&#8208;gated calcium channels. Piezoelectric nanostimulator&#8208;based stimulation can effectively suppress epileptic seizures in both optogenetic and pilocarpine&#8208;induced epilepsy rat models.








Abstract
Electrical deep brain stimulation is effective for epilepsy suppression, but will lead to neural tissue damage and inflammation due to implantation of electrodes and a pulse generator. Transcranial magnetic and transcranial ultrasound stimulation cannot directly generate effective electrical signals in deep brain regions. Here, the use of piezoelectric nanoparticles is proposed as wireless nanostimulators for deep brain electrical stimulation and minimally invasive suppression of epilepsy. Polydopamine&#8208;coated barium titanate piezoelectric nanostimulators can adhere to neuronal membrane and generate pulsed electrical signals under ultrasound irradiation, effectively activating neurons through modulating voltage&#8208;gated calcium channels on the membrane. These nanostimulators can be minimal&#8208;invasively implanted into target deep brain regions, such as the hippocampal CA1, through stereotactic microinjection and remain stable for at least 14 weeks with negligible inflammatory reactions. These implanted nanostimulators precisely and effectively activate surrounding neurons and associated neural circuits in vivo under a portable low&#8208;intensity ultrasound transducer. This piezoelectric nanostimulator&#8208;based wireless deep brain electrical stimulation effectively suppresses epileptic seizures in both optogenetic and pilocarpine&#8208;induced epilepsy rat models. By combining the deep penetration of ultrasound with the efficacy of piezoelectric stimulation, this minimally invasive method holds great promise for effective suppression of epileptic seizures and management of other neural disorders.

         <title>Defect Engineering&#8208;Driven Electron Spin Polarization and Charge Transfer in MOFs for Enhanced Sonocatalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a new paradigm for MOF&#8208;based sonocatalysts, where metal node substitution induces linker defects to optimize the electron transfer pathway and modulate the spin state of the catalytic center, enhancing sonocatalytic performance and enabling efficient tumor therapy.








Abstract
Sonocatalytic therapy (SCT) is a non&#8208;invasive tumor treatment modality that utilizes ultrasound (US)&#8208; activated sonocatalysts to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), whose production critically dependent on the electronic structural properties of the catalytic sites. However, the spin state, which is a pivotal descriptor of electronic properties, remains underappreciated in SCT. Herein, a Ti&#8208;doped zirconium&#8208;based MOF (Ti&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, denoted as UTN) with ligand&#8208;deficient defects is constructed for SCT, revealing the important role of the electronic spin state in modulating intrinsic catalytic activity. The defect&#8208;driven sonocatalytic mechanism is elucidated as follows: 1) structural defects alleviate the limitations of ligand&#8208;metal charge transfer, achieving a 2.1&#8208;fold enhancement in charge transfer efficiency; 2) spin polarization at Ti active sites reconfigures the d&#8208;orbital electron distribution, thereby increasing the density of spin&#8208;polarized electronic states near the Fermi level. Furthermore, Ti 3d&#8208;O 2p orbital hybridization lowers the adsorption energies of H2O and O2 by 2.5&#8208;fold and 1.6&#8208;fold, respectively, thereby facilitating interfacial redox reactions and leading to enhanced ROS generation. Notably, UTN combined with US achieves 86.07% tumor inhibition efficiency. This work establishes novel insights into defect engineering, spin&#8208;state modulation, and surface interfacial adsorption in SCT, providing a theoretical paradigm framework for designing of high&#8208;performance sonocatalysts.

         <title>Hybrid Superconducting&#8208;Magnetic Van der Waals Heterostructures: Physics and Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively surveys van der Waals superconducting&#8208;magnetic heterostructures, including superconductor&#8208;magnet bilayers, superconductor&#8208;magnet&#8208;superconductor Josephson junctions, and magnet&#8208;superconductor&#8208;magnet spin valves. It summarizes recent progress in proximity effects, spin&#8208;orbit interaction, nonreciprocity, topological superconductivity, 0&#8208;&#960; transition, and superconducting spin valves, while highlighting device functionalities and challenges. The work underscores their potential for future superconducting spintronic and quantum applications.








Abstract
Superconductivity and magnetism are two of the most extensively studied ordered systems in condensed matter physics. Recent advancements in the fabrication of van der Waals (vdW) layered materials have significantly advanced the exploration of both fundamental physics and practical applications within their heterostructures. The focus not only lies on the coexisting mechanism between superconductivity and magnetism, but also highlights the potential of these atomically thin layers to serve as crucial components in future superconducting circuits. In this review, the latest research is summarized on hybrid superconducting&#8208;magnetic (SC&#8208;M) vdW heterostructures, encompassing new theoretical predictions, experimental performances, and device applications. The content is organized based on its distinct architectural configurations, including SC&#8208;M bilayers, SC&#8208;M&#8208;SC trilayers, and M&#8208;SC&#8208;M trilayers. Finally, the remaining challenges are discussed and also propose future directions for non&#8208;dissipative vdW spintronic devices.

         <title>Current&#8208;Induced Magnetization Switching via 180&#176; N&#233;el Vector Reversal in Pt/Cr2O3/Co Trilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT)&#8208;induced switching of the perpendicular N&#233;el vector offers strong potential for ultrafast SOT&#8208;MRAM, though its mechanism remains debated. Here, such switching is reported in antiferromagnetic Cr2O3 within a Pt/Cr2O3/Co trilayer. The switching occurs via antiferromagnetic domain wall motion, leading to unconventional SOT behaviors in the Co layer, including reversed polarity, current&#8208;induced exchange bias modulation, and field&#8208;cooling&#8208;dependent switching ratios.








Abstract
The 180&#176; switching of the perpendicular N&#233;el vector induced by the spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) presents significant potential for ultradense and ultrafast antiferromagnetic SOT&#8208;magnetoresistive random&#8208;access memory. However, its experimental realization remains a topic of intense debate. Here, unequivocal evidence is provided for the SOT&#8208;induced 180&#176; switching of the perpendicular N&#233;el vector in collinear antiferromagnetic Cr2O3 in a Pt/Cr2O3/Co trilayer structure. It is demonstrated that the 180&#176; switching of the perpendicular N&#233;el vector in Cr2O3 can lead to the unconventional switching behavior of the Co layer on top of it. The switching polarity of the Co layer can be reversed after the insertion of the Cr2O3 layer. Moreover, the exchange bias directions are switched simultaneously with the Co layer. The switching ratio of the Co layer is sensitive to the antiferromagnetic states of Cr2O3 and can be tuned by field cooling. The results not only underpin the electrical switching of the perpendicular N&#233;el vector in Cr2O3 but are also beneficial for the development of antiferromagnetic&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Photoactivation of 2&#8208;Nitrobenzyl Caged Doxorubicin Anticancer Prodrugs on Gold Nanostars</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal chemistry was applied to intracellularly photoactivate Doxorubicin (Dox) using gold nanostars (AuNSt) and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. Two prodrugs were used: one photoactivatable, masked with 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl carbamate (proDox1) and another photolabile, masked with 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl diol (proDox2), which was attached to the AuNSt surface. NIR irradiation induced local electromagnetic field enhancement, which triggered Dox release and cancer cell death.








Abstract
Bioorthogonal chemistry that can be controlled through near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light is a promising route to therapeutics. This study proposes a method to intracellularly photoactivate prodrugs using plasmonic gold nanostars (AuNSt) and NIR irradiation. Two strategies are followed. On one hand, doxorubicin (Dox) masked with a 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl carbamate (proDox1) is used as a photoactivatable prodrug. In the second strategy, a photolabile Dox prodrug (proDox2) obtained by modification of Dox with 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl diol bearing a disulfide is attached to the AuNSt surface. Under NIR irradiation AuNSt induce local electromagnetic field enhancement, leading to photocleavage of the 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl moiety in both proDox1 and proDox2, and subsequent Dox release. Near field enhancement by excitation of surface plasmons in AuNSt is sufficient to record the surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra of proDox1 and proDox2. The therapeutic potential of this bioorthogonal photoactivation strategy is confirmed in vitro and in vivo using a mouse model of human melanoma. NIR&#8208;activated AuNSt induce in vivo the intracellular release of Dox and subsequent cancer cell death, thus reducing tumor growth at low irradiation power density to avoid undesired photothermal effects. These results demonstrate that AuNSt are suitable platforms for NIR light&#8208;triggered drug delivery in cancer therapy.

         <title>Sacrificial Biofabrication for Vascularization: Concept, Materials, Technologies, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vasculature is indispensable for tissue viability in regenerative medicine. The sacrificial biofabrication enables precise fabrication of vascular channels by using temporary templates that are subsequently removed. This review defines the concept and delves into sacrificial materials, surrounding materials, fabrication technologies, and biomedical applications, offering insights into current advancements and future prospects in vascular engineering through sacrificial biofabrication.









Abstract
Vasculature plays a crucial role in tissue engineering since it is essential for maintaining tissue viability by efficient nutrient and oxygen exchange as well as waste removal. The creation of biomimetic vascular networks is therefore critical for the development of functional tissue constructs. Sacrificial biofabrication has emerged as an effective method for engineering vascular structures by creating temporary templates that are subsequently removed to form well&#8208;defined vascular channels. In this review, the concept of sacrificial biofabrication is introduced and defined, with a focus on vascularization. Then, a comprehensive overview of the commonly used sacrificial materials based on different types of external stimuli is provided, and the classification and design principles of surrounding materials are briefly introduced. Additionally, various fabrication technologies employed to process sacrificial materials are summarized, and the diverse applications of sacrificial biofabrication in disease models and regenerative medicine are discussed. Finally, the current challenges are highlighted, and the future perspectives for advancing sacrificial biofabrication are explored to address the demand for vasculature manufacturing.

         <title>Role of Liquid Composition in the Transient Liquid Assisted Growth of Superconducting YBa2Cu3O7&#8208;&#948; Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Y supersaturation in the [Ba&#8208;Cu(I/II)&#8208;O] transient liquid composition is the driving force toward YBCO nucleation and growth in TLAG. Tuning the initial (Ba:Cu) molar ratio in the ink composition determines the YBCO epitaxial nucleation through supersaturation control. Highly epitaxial YBCO films derive from ink compositions with high copper content, which finally enable high&#8208;performance superconducting properties.








Abstract
The unparalleled loss&#8208;less electrical current conduction of high&#8208;temperature superconducting (HTS) materials encourages research on YBa2Cu3O7&#8722;&#120575; (YBCO) to unravel opportunities toward numerous applications. Nonetheless, production costs and throughput of the commercialized HTS Coated Conductors (CCs) are still limiting a worldwide spread. Transient liquid assisted growth (TLAG) is a non&#8208;equilibrium process displaying ultrafast growth rate which, when combined with chemical solution deposition (CSD), is emerging as a strong candidate to reduce the cost/performance ratio of YBCO superconductors. This study explores the influence of the (Ba:Cu) molar ratio of the transient liquid composition on the nucleation and growth mechanisms of TLAG. This enables an in&#8208;depth analysis of the critical role of the yttrium supersaturation in the transient liquids considering the out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium kinetic character of TLAG. Advanced characterization techniques, including in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, coupled to a multi&#8208;parameter analysis of the contributions to the physical performance, elucidate the influence of transient liquid supersaturation as driving force toward YBCO nucleation and growth. Understanding the fundamental role played by the initial ink composition allows to disentangle how to reach high superconducting performance. The fabrication of high&#8208;performance YBCO films through this novel, high&#8208;throughput growth methodology promotes the use of HTS materials in large scale power applications.

         <title>Molecular Extrusion Drives Polymer Dynamic Soft Encapsulation to Inhibit Lead Leakage for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(dipropylene adipate) (PPA) enables grain&#8208;level perovskite encapsulation, suppressing lead leakage by 95.0% (cell) and 91.4% (module) while reducing biotoxicity 93.1% versus control. The PPA&#8208;modified inverted perovskite solar cell (0.04 cm2) achieves 26.37% efficiency; the 30 &#215; 30 cm2 module (651.42 cm2) reaches 20.06% (certified 19.68%), demonstrating high&#8208;efficiency, eco&#8208;friendly photovoltaic devices.








Abstract
Polymer additives exhibit unique advantages in suppressing lead leaching from perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, polymers tend to excessively aggregate in the perovskite film, which hinders comprehensive encapsulation and disrupts charge transport efficiency, degrading lead leakage inhibition and device performance. Herein, a polymer dynamic soft encapsulation strategy driven by molecular extrusion is introduced to mitigate lead leakage in PSCs, achieved through the incorporation of poly(propylene adipate) (PPA) as a multifunctional additive in the perovskite formulation. The PPA&#8208;modified inverted perovskite solar cell (aperture area: 0.04 cm2) and module with dimensions of 30 &#215; 30 cm2 (aperture area: 651.42 cm2) achieve superior power conversion efficiencies of 26.37% and 20.06% (certified 19.68%), respectively. Furthermore, the PPA anchors Pb2+ via chemical coordination and physically blocks moisture ingress, resulting in lead leakage suppression efficiencies of 95.0% in the perovskite solar cell and 91.4% in the module, with a concomitant 93.1% reduction in environmental biotoxicity compared to the control device. This work addresses the critical challenge of lead leakage in PSCs and offers a scalable strategy for advancing the development of environmentally friendly and high&#8208;performance perovskite photovoltaic technology.

         <title>A Universal Strategy for BBB Transport Mediated by an Inflammatory Receptor Antagonist for Neuroprotection in Ischemic Stroke</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic illustration of the design and mechanism of receptor antagonist&#8208;guided polyphenol nanoparticles for ischemic stroke treatment. Leveraging the ischemia&#8208;induced upregulation of inflammatory receptors, receptor antagonists act both as targeting ligands and therapeutic agents, enabling BBB transcytosis, lysosomal escape, and ferroptosis suppression through LOXs inhibition and ROS reduction, ultimately contributing to endothelial restoration and neuronal protection in ischemic brain injury.








Abstract
Delivering therapeutics across the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) remains a major challenge in ischemic stroke therapy. Ischemic stroke induces upregulation of various inflammatory membrane receptors on brain endothelial cells, offering potential entry points for receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis. This study proposes a universal targeting strategy by employing inflammatory pathway antagonists as targeting ligands, which broadens the spectrum of available ligands beyond traditional receptor&#8208;binding molecules. Notably, many antagonists not only confer receptor&#8208;targeting ability but also actively participate in downstream anti&#8208;inflammatory, antioxidant, or cellular repair signaling pathways. A multifunctional polyphenol&#8208;based nanoparticle system is developed by co&#8208;assembling oligomerized cyanidin&#8208;3&#8208;glucoside (C3G) with a series of receptor&#8208;specific antagonists as targeting ligands, including those for thromboxane A2 receptor (TxA2R), Toll&#8208;like receptors 4 and 7 (TLR4 and TLR7), and purinergic receptors (e.g., P2X4). The nanoparticles demonstrate a bifurcated intracellular fate: Golgi&#8208;mediated transcytosis into brain parenchyma or endothelial repair via upregulation of tight junction proteins. Nanoparticles loaded with Seratrodast (CCS) are selected as a representative formulation for in&#8208;depth evaluation. Upon entering the ischemic microenvironment, CCS nanoparticles are degraded by reactive oxygen species, releasing catechol&#8208;containing metabolites for potent inhibition of lipoxygenase (LOX) activity, thereby blocking ferroptosis and promoting neuroprotection.

     alt="A Universal Strategy for BBB Transport Mediated by an Inflammatory Receptor Antagonist for Neuroprotection in Ischemic Stroke"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schematic illustration of the design and mechanism of receptor antagonist-guided polyphenol nanoparticles for ischemic stroke treatment. Leveraging the ischemia-induced upregulation of inflammatory receptors, receptor antagonists act both as targeting ligands and therapeutic agents, enabling BBB transcytosis, lysosomal escape, and ferroptosis suppression through LOXs inhibition and ROS reduction, ultimately contributing to endothelial restoration and neuronal protection in ischemic brain injury.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delivering therapeutics across the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) remains a major challenge in ischemic stroke therapy. Ischemic stroke induces upregulation of various inflammatory membrane receptors on brain endothelial cells, offering potential entry points for receptor-mediated transcytosis. This study proposes a universal targeting strategy by employing inflammatory pathway antagonists as targeting ligands, which broadens the spectrum of available ligands beyond traditional receptor-binding molecules. Notably, many antagonists not only confer receptor-targeting ability but also actively participate in downstream anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, or cellular repair signaling pathways. A multifunctional polyphenol-based nanoparticle system is developed by co-assembling oligomerized cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) with a series of receptor-specific antagonists as targeting ligands, including those for thromboxane A2 receptor (TxA2R), Toll-like receptors 4 and 7 (TLR4 and TLR7), and purinergic receptors (e.g., P2X4). The nanoparticles demonstrate a bifurcated intracellular fate: Golgi-mediated transcytosis into brain parenchyma or endothelial repair via upregulation of tight junction proteins. Nanoparticles loaded with Seratrodast (CCS) are selected as a representative formulation for in-depth evaluation. Upon entering the ischemic microenvironment, CCS nanoparticles are degraded by reactive oxygen species, releasing catechol-containing metabolites for potent inhibition of lipoxygenase (LOX) activity, thereby blocking ferroptosis and promoting neuroprotection. These findings highlight the dual functionality of antagonists as both targeting ligands and therapeutic modulators, offering a highly translatable design paradigm for intelligent stroke therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solubility&#8208;pKa Coupling Effect Tailored Nanoporous Nylon Aerogel Family with Multiple Thermomechanical Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal solubility&#8208;pKa coupling effect to engineer a high&#8208;performance thermoplastic nylon aerogel family with excellent thermomechanical processing performance is proposed. By controlling nylon crystallization assembly, various nylon aerogels with robust nanofiber skeletons are developed comparable to traditional high&#8208;performance aerogels, while possessing unique thermoplastic characteristics for functional aerogel thermomechanical processing.








Abstract
Despite significant advancements in aerogels science, the fabrication of high&#8208;performance aerogels with their plastic processability remains unexplored owing to their inherent trade&#8208;off between skeletal rigidity and transformable processability. Herein, a universal solubility&#8208;pKa coupling&#8208;effect to engineer high&#8208;performance thermoplastic nylon aerogel family with excellent thermomechanical processing performance is proposed. By modulating solubility parameters and acid dissociation constants in nylon&#8208;solvent systems, it is precisely control crystallization to assemble interlaced 1D nanofiber skeletons, yielding nylon aerogels that integrate a high specific surface area (226&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1), exceptional compressive modulus (12.6&#160;MPa), and ultralow thermal conductivity (0.034&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1). Notably, beyond achieving performance comparable to aramid and other high&#8208;performance aerogels, these nylon aerogels uniquely incorporate thermoplastic properties enabling multiple thermomechanical processing for aerogel functionalization, including protective barrier via thermal encapsulating, reassembly of aerogel unmanned aerial vehicle through thermal cutting and welding, and biomimetic hydrophobic surfaces with lotus and petal effects through precise thermal imprinting. Surprisingly, thermomechanical processing also induces fluorescence of aerogels, suggesting applications in thermal&#8208;recording, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, etc. This research overcomes the critical skeletal rigidity&#8208;transformable processability trade&#8208;off in aerogels, enabling novel manufacturing approaches and broader engineering applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviews the technology of high&#8208;operating&#8208;temperature mid&#8208; and long&#8208;wavelength infrared photodiodes, focuses on strategies for suppressing dark current to elevate operating temperatures, and summarizes the current development status and future directions in various material systems, including epitaxial semiconductors, quantum dots, 2D materials, and amorphous or polycrystalline thin films.








Abstract
High&#8208;operating&#8208;temperature (HOT) mid&#8208;wavelength and long&#8208;wavelength infrared photodetectors have emerged as critical enablers for eliminating bulky cryogenic cooling systems, offering transfromative potential in developing compact, energy&#8208;efficient infrared technologies with reduced size, weight, power, and cost. Focusing on infrared photodiodes, this review first discusses the fundamental mechanisms limiting performance at elevated operating temperatures. Subsequently, the progress in conventional epitaxial semiconductors, such as HgCdTe, InAsSb, and III&#8208;V type&#8208;II superlattice is reviewed, highlighting the evolution of device architectures designed to effectively suppress dark currents and approach background&#8208;limited performance. The review then surveys recent advancements in emerging material systems for HOT infrared photodiodes, including colloidal quantum dots, 2D materials, and amorphous or polycrystalline thin films. Finally, a comparative analysis of the high&#8208;temperature performance of devices from both conventional and emerging material systems is presented to enable benchmarked evaluation, followed by an outlook on future research directions.

This review focuses on formic acid (FA) dehydrogenation from perspectives of coordination structure design, catalytic performances, and reaction mechanisms. The design strategies, characterization technologies, activity evaluation and mechanism insights are presented in detail. These contents will provide a guidance for precise design of high&#8208;efficiency catalysts to enhance catalytic performance towards FA decomposition.








Abstract
Formic acid (FA) has attracted significant interest as a renewable liquid&#8208;phase hydrogen carrier. Hydrogen generation from FA decomposition is essential for the development of hydrogen economy. Designing highly efficient catalysts with different coordination environments for FA dehydrogenation is crucial for fuel&#8208;cell applications. Here, FA dehydrogenation from the perspectives of coordination structure design, activity evaluation, and mechanisms is focused. In particular, the structural design of active sites and dominant factors that determine the catalytic activity/selectivity and reaction mechanism are highlighted. Strategies to design catalysts are proposed based on the aspects of electronic effects, component regulation and synergistic effects, interface effects, and reaction active site design to boost the catalytic activity, selectivity, stability, rate&#8208;determining step activity, and overall performance. Simultaneously, it is important to investigate the structure&#8211;activity relationship during hydrogen generation. In addition, the experimental protocol (hydrogen generation from FA or FA&#8208;SF, SF: sodium formate), calculation of reaction parameters, and determination of products during hydrogen generation are summarized. Finally, challenges, conclusions, and developments based on FA decomposition are presented. Here, guidance for the precise design of high&#8208;efficiency catalysts is provided to enhance catalytic performance toward FA decomposition and satisfy the requirements for hydrogen generation in the future.

         <title>Levetiracetam&#8208;Assisted Perovskite Crystallization and Tripartite Lead Iodide Reduction in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and effective method for suppressing residual PbI2: Add chiral LEV molecules to the PbI2 precursor solution to regulate the crystallization of perovskite, release intracellular stress, passivate vacancies and defects, reduces the tripartite residual PbI2 in the perovskite film, including multi&#8208;interfaces and bulk, and achieve highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Sequential deposition technique is widely used to fabricate perovskite films with large grain size in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Residual lead halide (PbI2) in the perovskite film tends to be decomposed into metallic lead (Pb0) under long&#8208;term heating or light soaking. Here, a chiral levetiracetam (LEV) dopant containing &#945;&#8208;amide and pyrrolidone groups is introduced into the PbI2 precursor solution. The carbonyl oxygen (labeled O1) and amide oxygen (labeled O2) in the pyrrolidone ring have significant electronegativity and form coordination bonds with Pb2+ ions through electron transfer, thereby regulating the nucleation and crystallization process of perovskite. The chirality of LEV induces spatial selectivity in perovskite precursor coordination, promoting oriented growth along the (100) crystallographic facet. Additionally, it enables selective defect passivation, preferentially addressing Pb and I vacancies. Ultimately, LEV doping reduces the tripartite residual PbI2 in the perovskite film, including multi&#8208;interfaces and bulk. Besides, the resulted PSCs achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 26% with a stabilized power output of 25.8% and maintained 90% of its initial PCE after maximum power point tracking for 1000 h. This study offers a novel research paradigm to advance the development of perovskite photovoltaics.

&lt;p&gt;A simple and effective method for suppressing residual PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: Add chiral LEV molecules to the PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; precursor solution to regulate the crystallization of perovskite, release intracellular stress, passivate vacancies and defects, reduces the tripartite residual PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the perovskite film, including multi-interfaces and bulk, and achieve highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sequential deposition technique is widely used to fabricate perovskite films with large grain size in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Residual lead halide (PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the perovskite film tends to be decomposed into metallic lead (Pb&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) under long-term heating or light soaking. Here, a chiral levetiracetam (LEV) dopant containing &#945;-amide and pyrrolidone groups is introduced into the PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; precursor solution. The carbonyl oxygen (labeled O1) and amide oxygen (labeled O2) in the pyrrolidone ring have significant electronegativity and form coordination bonds with Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions through electron transfer, thereby regulating the nucleation and crystallization process of perovskite. The chirality of LEV induces spatial selectivity in perovskite precursor coordination, promoting oriented growth along the (100) crystallographic facet. Additionally, it enables selective defect passivation, preferentially addressing Pb and I vacancies. Ultimately, LEV doping reduces the tripartite residual PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the perovskite film, including multi-interfaces and bulk. Besides, the resulted PSCs achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 26% with a stabilized power output of 25.8% and maintained 90% of its initial PCE after maximum power point tracking for 1000 h. This study offers a novel research paradigm to advance the development of perovskite photovoltaics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Janus MXene Fiber Constructed via Flake Orientation Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Janus&#8208;oriented MXene fiber is developed, featuring vertically and horizontally oriented MXene flakes on opposite sides. This Janus&#8208;orientation design integrates electrical conductivity, strength, and water&#8208;responsive deformation. The resulting large curling actuation enables an event&#8208;triggered logic gate for dual&#8208;mode water&#8208;immersion signaling. This work advances the orientation engineering of MXene flakes and MXene&#8208;based intelligent information devices.








Abstract
The orientation of MXene flakes has received increasing research attention as it plays a critical role in determining the performance of MXene&#8208;based assemblies. Engineering MXene flakes into horizontal or vertical orientations can offer distinct advantages such as higher electrical conductivity, higher mechanical strength, and more efficient ion/molecule transport across the flakes. However, the benefits of horizontal and vertical orientations are mutually exclusive, and both of them possess structural symmetry that restricts their ability for stimuli&#8208;responsive deformation. Herein, a Janus&#8208;oriented MXene fiber is reported, consisting of vertically oriented flakes on one side and horizontally oriented ones on the other. The unique Janus orientation endows the fiber with good mechanical properties, high electrical conductivity, and asymmetric volume expansion capability. Interestingly, such asymmetric volume expansion between the two orientations induces a pronounced curling deformation under water stimuli, leading to a high length change of up to 2100%. Due to such a strong deformation response, the Janus MXene fiber is used to construct an event&#8208;triggered logic gate, which enables the operation of a dual&#8208;mode water immersion warning system featuring both light and Bluetooth signaling. This work is believed to provide inspiration for future orientation engineering of MXene flakes and the design of advanced MXene&#8208;based information devices.

         <title>A Readily Synthesized All&#8208;In&#8208;One Nanowire Hydrogel: Toward Inhibiting Tumor Recurrence and Postoperative Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled vanadium hydrogel integrates multienzyme&#8208;mimetic V2O5 nanowires and bactericidal THPS via one&#8208;step nanoconstruction. This TME&#8208;responsive platform combines catalytic tumor suppression, infection prevention, and dynamic mechanoadaptivity to surgical niches. By reprogramming immunosuppressive microenvironments via M1 macrophage polarization and cytotoxic T&#8208;cell recruitment, the hydrogel pioneers a paradigm for precision postsurgical therapy through synergistic immunomodulation and localized intervention.








Abstract
Surgical resection remains the frontline intervention for cancer; however, postoperative tumor recurrence and wound infection remain critical unmet challenge in surgical oncology. Herein, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one nanowired hydrogel (V&#8208;Hydrogel) is developed through a facile one&#8208;step assembly employing enzyme&#8208;mimetic V2O5 nanowires and bactericidal crosslinker THPS. The V&#8208;Hydrogel reserves the glutathione peroxidase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;, catalase&#8208;, and oxidase&#8208;mimetic enzymatic activities derived from vanadium oxide nanowires, thereby exhibiting efficient tumor&#8208;specific catalytic therapy. Simultaneously, the introduction of bactericide THPS endows the potent antibacterial capabilities of V&#8208;Hydrogel against surgical site infections. This hydrogel exhibits dynamic mechanical adaptability to the tumor microenvironment (f), ensuring conformal coverage of irregular resection cavities for precise therapy. Additionally, the V&#8208;Hydrogel can reprogram the immunosuppressive TME via polarizing macrophages into antitumor M1 phenotypes and recruiting cytotoxic T cells, thereby establishing systemic antitumor immunity. This multifunctional vanadium&#8208;integrated hydrogel platform, designed based on the pathological characteristics of postoperative tumors, addresses key limitations in conventional postoperative therapies, offering a strategy for postoperative adjuvant tumor therapy.

         <title>Lanthanum&#8208;Induced Gradient Fields in Asymmetric Heterointerface Catalysts for Enhanced Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uncontrolled atomic migration during the pyrolysis of metal&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts often leads to disordered coordination environments, active site loss, and poor oxygen electrocatalytic activities. Herein, a La&#8208;mediated atomic migration strategy enables the fabrication of a well&#8208;defined asymmetric heterostructure (LaN/LaFe&#8208;NC) featuring a built&#8208;in electric field. This architecture stabilizes the Fe active sites, enhances interfacial charge transport, and delivers an outstanding oxygen electrocatalysis performance.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) catalysts display considerable potential as cost&#8208;effective alternatives to noble metals in oxygen electrocatalysis. However, uncontrolled atomic migration and random structural rearrangement during pyrolysis often lead to disordered coordination environments and sparse active sites, fundamentally limiting their intrinsic catalytic activities and long&#8208;term durability. Herein, a novel strategy is reported for use in directionally regulating atomic migration pathways via the incorporation of a foreign metal (La). By exploiting the differences in the atomic migration priorities via the Kirkendall effect, directional control of atomic diffusion is achieved to fabricate a well&#8208;defined asymmetric multiphase heterointerface catalyst (LaN/LaFe&#8208;NC). The presence of high&#8208;density, structurally well&#8208;defined active sites &#8211; along with a built&#8208;in directional electric field across the heterointerface &#8211; substantially enhances the efficiency of interfacial charge transport, thus improving the intrinsic activity and stability in oxygen electrocatalysis. When incorporated into a rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery, LaN/LaFe&#8208;NC delivers a high power density of 211 mW cm&#8722;2, with an exceptional cycling stability of &gt;240 h. This study establishes a generalizable atomic&#8208;level design strategy for use in engineering robust heterointerface catalysts and offers valuable insights for application in advancing next&#8208;generation renewable energy conversion and storage systems.

         <title>Smart Skin for Zero Energy Buildings: A Review of Thermoresponsive Spectral&#8208;Adaptive Envelopes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in thermoresponsive spectral&#8208;adaptive building envelopes that passively regulate light and heat across multiple wavelengths. Focusing on smart windows and radiative coatings, it explores material systems, spectral mechanisms, and architectural integration, while identifying key challenges in achieving scalable, durable, and comfort&#8208;centered solutions for next&#8208;generation climate&#8208;responsive buildings.








Abstract
Buildings are increasingly being conceived as dynamic systems that interact with their surroundings to optimize energy performance and enhance occupant comfort. This evolution in architectural thinking draws inspiration from biological systems, where the building envelope functions like a thermally responsive &#8220;skin&#8221; that can autonomously adjust its optical and thermal properties in response to environmental temperature changes. Among the many approaches developed for smart building envelopes, passive thermoresponsive spectral modulation systems have attracted growing interest due to their structural simplicity and low energy demand. By dynamically tuning solar radiation transmission and thermal emission across different spectral ranges, these systems reduce the reliance of buildings on mechanical heating, cooling, and lighting, thereby enhancing overall energy efficiency and climate responsiveness. This review offers a comprehensive and unified perspective on thermoresponsive building envelope technologies, bridging transparent and opaque components&#8212;including thermochromic smart windows and tunable radiative wall coatings&#8212;within the architectural context. It places particular emphasis on multiband spectral control, material&#8208;structure integration, and performance under diverse environmental conditions. Finally, it outlines key challenges and future research directions in advancing spectral control capabilities, aesthetic integration, all&#8208;weather adaptability, user&#8208;centered design, and practical applicability of thermoresponsive envelopes for next&#8208;generation sustainable buildings.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

A molecular hybrid bridging strategy is developed by doping (2&#8208;aminothiazole&#8208;4&#8208;yl)acetic acid (ATAA) and 4&#8208;(2,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylacridin&#8208;10(9H)&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (DMAcPA) into the perovskite precursor, enabling in situ formation of a perovskite/hole&#8208;selective&#8208;contact interface during fabrication. The ATAA not only suppresses DMAcPA self&#8208;aggregation but also enhances hole extraction. Leveraging this approach, the PSC without a pre&#8208;deposited HTL achieves a certified PCE of 26.34% and excellent operational stability. 








Abstract
Establishing a low&#8208;resistance perovskite/ITO contact using self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) is crucial for efficient hole transport in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) without a pre&#8208;deposited hole&#8208;transporting layer. However, SAMs at the buried interface often encounter issues like nonuniform distribution and molecular aggregation during the extrusion process, leading to significant energy loss. Herein, a molecular hybrid bridging strategy by incorporating a novel small molecule is proposed, (2&#8208;aminothiazole&#8208;4&#8208;yl)acetic acid (ATAA), featuring a thiazole ring and carboxylic acid group, along with the commonly used SAM, 4&#8208;(2,7&#8208;dibromo&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylacridin&#8208;10(9H)&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (DMAcPA), into the perovskite precursor to synergistically optimize the buried interface. Composition analysis demonstrates that both molecules are effectively extruded to the bottom of the perovskite layer and form a well&#8208;oriented hole&#8208;selective contact interface through strong coordination between the anchoring groups and ITO substrate. The intermolecular interaction, along with the small molecular size of ATAA, enables its uniform dispersion among large DMAcPA, facilitating a compact molecular arrangement, effectively suppressing aggregation, and enhancing hole&#8208;transporting efficiency. As a result, the inverted PSC employing this molecular hybrid strategy exhibits a power conversion efficiency as high as 26.64% (certified at 26.34%) and maintains 98.5% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous operation under 1&#8208;sun illumination at the maximum power point.

         <title>Preventing Glioblastoma Relapse by Igniting Innate Immunity through Mitochondrial Stress in the Surgical Cavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work synthesizes a charge&#8208;inversion nanodrug (INSTNA) that can activate innate immunity by interfering with the mitochondrial electron transport chain of tumor cells in the surgical cavity of GBM. Mechanistically, INSTNA coordinated tumor treatment fields (TTF) induce mitochondrial stress and release damage&#8208;related molecular patterns (DAMP) that amplify innate immunity and further activate adaptive immunity to kill GBM cells.








Abstract
Innate immunity is crucial in orchestrating the brain immune response, however, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has evolved sophisticated mechanisms to evade innate immune surveillance, posing significant challenges for current immunotherapies. Here, a therapeutic strategy is reported that aims at reactivating innate immune responses in GBM via targeted induction of mitochondrial stress, thereby enhancing tumor immunogenicity. Specifically, innate immune&#8208;stimulating nanoparticles (INSTNA) are developed, encapsulating positively charged iridium&#8208;based complexes (Ir&#8208;mito) and small interfering RNA against Methylation&#8208;Controlled J protein (si&#8208;MCJ) to attenuate mitochondrial respiration. This combination effectively disrupts mitochondrial function of GBM cells, particularly when combined with tumor&#8208;treating fields. The engineered charge&#8208;reversal INSTNA impair the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), inducing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) stress and subsequent mitochondrial matrix release. Furthermore, hydrogel&#8208;mediated delivery of INSTNA in a postoperative GBM mouse model significantly remodeled the immunosuppressive microenvironment, resulting in pronounced tumor regression. In sum, these findings highlight that targeted induction of mitochondrial stress in postoperative GBM can potentiate innate immune activation and enhance adaptive immunity, offering a promising avenue for mitigating GBM recurrence.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Orthogonal Engineering of Neural Stem Cells with Membrane&#8208;Bound Microsatellites for Enhanced Brain Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyaluronic acid methacryloyl microsatellites are bio&#8208;orthogonally conjugated to the cell membrane of neural stem cells to create engineered stem cells. These microsatellites can migrate together with the engineered cells and continuously release differentiation regulators around the cells to precisely regulate their neuronal differentiation in vivo, improving the tissue repair and behavioral recovery of traumatic brain injury rats.








Abstract
Regulating the differentiation of implanted stem cells into neurons is crucial for stem cell therapy of traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, due to the migratory nature of implanted stem cells, precise and targeted regulation of their fate remains challenging. Here, neural stem cells (NSCs) are bio&#8208;orthogonally engineered with hyaluronic acid methacryloyl (HAMA) microsatellites capable of sustained release of differentiation modulators for targeted regulation of their neuronal differentiation and advanced TBI repair. By employing bio&#8208;orthogonal covalent reactions and optimizing the microsatellite size, HAMA microsatellites can stay on membranes for over 10 days owing to the minimal detachment or endocytosis. These microsatellites can thus migrate together with engineered NSCs and release modulators around the cells, actively inducing 45.1% of NSCs to differentiate into neurons compared to only 18.8% for normal NSCs. These microsatellite&#8208;engineered stem cells improve brain tissue repair and enhance behavioral recovery in TBI rats after implantation. This strategy holds promise for the advanced treatment of TBI and other neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Strain Responsive Near&#8208;Infrared Mechanoluminescence for Potential Nondestructive Artificial Joint Stress Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ and real&#8208;time stress sensing during total knee replacement procedure is expected to be realized based on near&#8208;infrared mechanoluminescent phosphor of Sr3Sn1.98Sb0.02O6.99, which has the lowest strain sensitivity as low as 50&#160;&#181;st. 








Abstract
Recently, joint replacement surgery is facing significant challenges of patient dissatisfaction and the need for revision procedures. In&#8208;situ monitoring of stress stability at the site of artificial joint replacement during postoperative evaluation is important. Mechanoluminescence (ML), a novel &#8220;force to light&#8221; conversion technology, may be used to monitor such bio&#8208;stress within tissues. However, this is hindered by ultraviolet&#8211;visible ML emission wavelength, low ML intensity, and high strain response sensitivity. Here, by incorporating Sb3+ ions into Sr3Sn2O7 crystals, a highly strain&#8208;responsive&#160;material, with ML originating from intrinsic defect emissions is obtained. The Sr3Sn1.98Sb0.02O6.99 film produces detectable ML signals under compressive strain as low as 50&#160;&#181;st in the absence of biological tissue. After pre&#8208;irradiating with red light through 15&#160;mm of porcine tissue, ML signals can still be detected through the same tissue thickness. Notably, this material enabled real&#8208;time stress imaging through 4&#160;mm of porcine skin during mild finger joint bending. This work presents a novel methodological framework and proposes a new mechanism to defect ML. It offers a fresh perspective for designing high&#8208;performance ML materials and lays the foundation for innovative research to enhance the functionality of artificial tissues and joints in living organism.

         <title>Interactions Between Active Matters and Endogenous Fields</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review synthesizes endogenous field information and computational methods in contexts such as cancer, wounds, and biofilms. It organizes NAMs and AAMs by sensing, transmitting, and executing functions, compares their limitations, and from these contrasts proposes design strategies for next&#8208;generation AAMs, offering perspectives to foster interdisciplinary dialogue and future research.








Abstract
Active matter, encompassing both natural and artificial systems, utilizes environmental energy to sustain autonomous motion, exhibiting unique non&#8208;equilibrium behaviors. Artificial active matter (AAM), such as nano/micromotors, holds transformative potential in precision medicine by enhancing drug delivery and enabling targeted therapeutic interventions. Under the demand for increasing intelligence in AAM, controlling their non&#8208;equilibrium processes within complex in vivo environments presents significant challenges. Endogenous fields&#8212;biological fields generated within living systems&#8212;play a pivotal role in guiding natural active matter's (NAM) directional migration and collective transformations, offering a strategy for in vivo control of non&#8208;equilibrium systems. Research in NAMs&#8208;inspired AAMs spans biology, chemistry, materials science, engineering, and physics, yet communication barriers among disciplines often impede progress. This review seeks to bridge these gaps by summarizing the key characteristics of chemical and physical endogenous fields in biological contexts such as tumors, wounds, and inflammation. It explores how natural and artificial active matter sense, transmit, and execute responses to these fields, and discusses how insights from natural systems can inform the design of synthetic counterparts. Potential issues and prospects of this research direction are also discussed. It is hoped that this review fosters interdisciplinary collaborations and propels the development of intelligent active matter for biomedical applications.

It explores how natural and artificial active matter sense, transmit, and execute responses to these fields, and discusses how insights from natural systems can inform the design of synthetic counterparts. Potential issues and prospects of this research direction are also discussed. It is hoped that this review fosters interdisciplinary collaborations and propels the development of intelligent active matter for biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Activated Piezoelectric Nanoparticles Targeting and Activating NK Cells for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional &#945;NK1.1/&#945;CD56&#8208;Polydopamine@Barium titanate (&#945;NK1.1/&#945;CD56&#8208;P@BT) piezoelectric nanoparticles are designed and synthesized to target NK cells via mussel&#8208;inspired chemistry and targeted antibody modification strategies. The &#945;NK1.1/&#945;CD56&#8208;P@BT enhances the cytotoxicity and cytokine&#8208;producing ability of NK cells with external ultrasonic stimulation. Upon transfer therapy, NK cells loaded with &#945;NK1.1/&#945;CD56&#8208;P@BT exhibit superior antitumor efficacy in mice with different solid tumor models under ultrasonic treatment.








Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cells can swiftly and efficiently kill tumor cells with low toxicity and show great potential as anticancer agents. However, the hostile tumor microenvironment (TME) reduces the number and functionality of NK cells, leading to tumor progression and the limited therapeutic effect of adoptively transferred NK cells, especially in solid tumors. Here, via mussel&#8208;inspired chemistry and targeted antibody modification strategies, functional piezoelectric nanoparticles are designed to target NK cells, named as &#945;CD56&#8208;P@BT (for human) or &#945;NK1.1&#8208;P@BT (for mouse). With external ultrasonic stimulation, &#945;CD56&#8208;P@BT or &#945;NK1.1&#8208;P@BT can enhance the cytotoxicity and cytokine&#8208;producing ability of NK cells. Mechanistically, the synergistic mechanical and electrical signals generated by ultrasound&#8208;irritated P@BT activate the TRP ion channel&#8208;mediated calcium ion influx and cytoskeleton rearrangement, in turn improving NK cell migration, infiltration, and function. Upon transfer therapy, NK cells loaded with &#945;NK1.1&#8208;P@BT exhibit superior antitumor efficacy in mice with subcutaneous melanoma or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma under ultrasonic treatment. Moreover, transfer of &#945;CD56&#8208;P@BT loaded NK&#8208;92 cells retard the growth of human hepatoma xenograft in immunodeficient mice. This work establishes a wireless electrostimulation strategy integrating ultrasound&#8208;responsive nanomaterials to potentiate the cytotoxic activity of NK cells, thereby advancing the clinical translation of NK cell adoptive immunotherapy for solid tumors.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Tunable Fluorinated Polyester Electrolytes with Enhanced Interfacial Stability for Recyclable Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated polyesters are shown to regulate lithium&#8208;ion coordination and promote stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. The rational structural design enables uniform lithium deposition, suppressed dendrite growth, and enhanced cycling performance in lithium&#8208;metal batteries. This work highlights the importance of molecular engineering in developing high&#8208;performance and sustainable electrolytes.








Abstract
Polyesters, with their tunable chemical structures and environmental sustainability, have drawn growing attention as solid polymer electrolytes for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs). Through a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study involving the systematic variation of carbon chain lengths in the flexible (diol) and coordinating (diacid) segments, along with selective fluorination at distinct positions along the polymer backbone, 18 types of polyester are fabricated and demonstrate that fluorination at the coordinating segment significantly enhances ionic conductivity by suppressing crystallinity. In contrast, fluorination at the flexible segment reduces ionic migration barriers by providing more homogeneous coordinating sites, thereby improving the lithium&#8208;ion transference number, despite increasing chain rigidity and a reduction in overall ionic conductivity. The optimized fluorinated polyesters exhibit excellent interfacial stability with lithium metal by facilitating the formation of a LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, as supported by experimental and theoretical simulation analysis. More importantly, to enhance cost&#8208;effectiveness and sustainability, a solvent&#8208;based recycling route has been developed, achieving substantial recovery yields and notable environmental benefits. This work provides a versatile molecular design and closed&#8208;loop recovery strategy for fluorinated polyester electrolytes, advancing their practical application in high&#8208;energy and sustainable SSLMBs.

         <title>Gbits/s&#8208;Level Encrypted Spectral Wireless Communication Enabled by High&#8208;Performance Flexible Organic Hyperspectrometer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#160;novel spectral wireless communication (SWC) technology based on an organic hyperspectrometer is proposed. By analyzing the spectrum of information&#8208;carrying light in the time domain, binary information encoded in different wavelengths can be extracted. The theoretical communication rate reaches up to 9.1 Gbits s&#8722;1, representing the highest value reported to date for wireless optical communication based on organic photodetectors.








Abstract
The exponential growth of data in the information era has pushed conventional optical communication technology to its limitations, including inefficient spectral utilization, slow data rate, and inherent security vulnerabilities. Here, a transformative high&#8208;speed organic spectral wireless communication (SWC) technology enabled by a flexible, miniaturized, and high&#8208;performance organic hyperspectrometer is proposed that integrates ultrahigh&#8208;speed data transmission with hardware&#8208;level encryption. By synergistically combining organic photodetector arrays with tunable responsivities and spectral&#8208;tunable organic filters, the organic hyperspectrometer achieves a broad spectral detection range of 400 to 900 nm, resolution of 1.08 nm, accuracy of 0.60 nm, and response time of 684 ns. Unlike prior optical wireless communication systems, the organic hyperspectrometer&#8208;based SWC platform uniquely decodes high&#8208;speed encrypted data at the hardware level, which is a breakthrough in secure, high&#8208;speed, and high&#8208;capacity communication. Harnessing the full visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared spectrum, the SWC system achieves a theoretical data rate of 9.1 Gbits s&#8722;1, ranking as the highest&#8208;speed organic optical communication system. Furthermore, the intrinsic flexibility and bandgap&#8208;tunability of organic materials enable unparalleled portability, adaptability, and scalability of organic SWC, establishing a scalable framework for terahertz&#8208;scale data transmission. These advancements mark a pivotal leap toward secure, high&#8208;speed, and ultracompact optical networks for the future data&#8208; and AI&#8208;driven era.

         <title>Hydridoborate&#8208;Based Solid Electrolytes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydridoborate&#8208;based materials have recently emerged as promising candidates for solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Herein, the hydridoborate&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte systems are categorized into five distinct classes based on their anionic structure. These materials exhibit varied stability and anode compatibility attributed to their different polycrystalline or open&#8208;network clusters. The unique anion&#8208;mediated ionic conduction mechanisms further underscore their potential for practical implementation in solid&#8208;state electrolytes.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) utilizing solid electrolytes, which replace flammable liquid electrolytes, are regarded as one of the most promising prospective energy storage devices due to their inherent safety advantages and high energy density potential. As an emerging class of electrolytes for ASSBs, hydridoborates have attracted research interest because of their attractive material properties, including superior compatibility with metal anodes, low gravimetric density, and excellent solution processability. In this review, hydridoborate&#8208;based solid electrolytes (SEs) for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, including boranuide&#8208;based SEs, arachno&#8208;hydridoborate&#8208;based SEs, nido&#8208;hydridoborate&#8208;based SEs, closo&#8208;hydridoborate&#8208;based SEs, and conjuncto&#8208;hydridoborate&#8208;based SEs, are comprehensively summarized. Specifically, the strategies to improve ion conductivity, the ion conduction mechanism, and the performance of hydridoborate&#8208;based SEs in ASSBs are discussed. Finally, the practical challenges for the application of hydridoborate SEs in ASSBs and the future development in the field are proposed. This review provides a detailed account of the advancements in hydridoborate&#8208;based solid electrolytes, not only mapping the progress made in this field but also proposing an effective strategy for researchers to innovate efficiently to realize the practical applications of hydridoborate&#8208;based SEs for the next generation of rechargeable batteries.

In this study, a viable approach is demonstrated for generating coherent DUV radiation at 177 nm and below using a classically ferroelectric and readily growable crystal, LPS. Under 355 nm nanosecond pumping from a Nd:YAG laser, an x&#8208;cut LPS crystal produced SHG output at 177 nm with a pulse energy of 3.1 &#181;J and a conversion efficiency of 0.11%.








Abstract
The generation of coherent deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) radiation via nonlinear frequency conversion remains a major scientific and technological challenge in modern optics. To date, only a very limited number of nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals&#8212;such as KBBF, ABF, and quartz&#8212;have been experimentally demonstrated to support measurable direct second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) at wavelengths of 177&#160;nm or shorter. There is a pressing need to develop alternative materials or strategies that enable efficient frequency conversion in the DUV region. In this work, it is reported that LiKSO4 (LPS), a ferroelectric sulfate crystal with z&#8208;aligned needle&#8208;like domains, forms an intrinsically disordered &#967;2 structure that enables DUV random quasi&#8208;phase matching (RQPM) down to 163&#160;nm across a broad spectral range. Remarkably, under nanosecond pulsed pumping at 355&#160;nm, an SHG output at 177&#160;nm with an energy of 3.1 &#181;J and a conversion efficiency of 0.11% is achieved using an x&#8208;cut LPS crystal. This study provides experimental evidence that selecting NLO crystals compatible with RQPM offers a feasible new route for DUV frequency conversion.

         <title>Revealing the Neglected Role of Passivation Layers of Current Collectors for Solid&#8208;State Anode&#8208;Free Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy experiment revealed that the surface passivation layers on copper and stainless steel interact with the sulfide&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte upon contact, leading to the formation of various interfacial species. This study provides insights into interfacial chemistry evolution during lithium plating and stripping.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs), which eliminate the need for a lithium metal anode during fabrication, offer superior energy density, enhanced safety, and simplified manufacturing. Their performance is largely influenced by the interfacial properties of the current collectors. Although previous studies have investigated the degradation of sulfide electrolytes on commonly used copper (Cu) and stainless steel (SS) current collectors, the impact of spontaneously formed surface oxides, such as copper oxide (Cu2O/CuO) and chromium oxide (Cr2O3), on interfacial stability remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates the neglected role of passivation layers of both Cu and SS. Results demonstrate that Cu facilitates more stable lithium deposition. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) reveals that interfacial resistance on SS is consistently higher than on Cu during cycling. In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and computational modelling confirm the formation of phosphate (PO43&#8722;) and sulfate (SO42&#8722;) species at both interfaces, attributed to reactions between the sulfide electrolyte and surface oxides. On SS, partial reversible formation of transition metal chlorides is also detected. Based on these findings, an artificial interface is engineered on Cu, significantly improving lithium plating/stripping efficiency. These insights contribute to solid&#8208;solid interface engineering strategies and advance the fundamental understanding of anode&#8208;free ASSLMBs.

         <title>Nanomedicine Reimagined: Translational Strategies for Precision Tumor Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective review critically examines key challenges and emerging strategies for translating cancer nanomedicines into clinical practice. Integrating mechanistic insights, design principles, and regulatory considerations, it highlights biological, toxicological, and manufacturing barriers, while outlining innovative solutions, including multimodal imaging, AI&#8208;driven analytics, and human&#8208;relevant models, to advance precision nanotheranostics toward clinical impact.








Abstract
Nanomedicine has shown remarkable promise in advancing tumor imaging and therapy through its ability to achieve targeted delivery, precision imaging, and therapeutic efficacy. However, translating these preclinical successes into clinical practice remains fraught with challenges, including inconsistent tumor targeting, off&#8208;target organ accumulation, and a lack of comprehensive understanding of in vivo behavior of nanomedicines. In this perspective, the current state of nanomedicine research is critically analyzed, emphasizing the translational bottlenecks and offering a forward&#8208;looking view on potential solutions. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect are revisited, dissecting its variable relevance across small animals, large animals, and human patients. Emerging strategies are also discussed to overcome its limitations, such as active targeting and bioengineered delivery systems. Highlighting the need for multimodal imaging, it is proposed to combine nuclear imaging for deep&#8208;tissue penetration with high&#8208;resolution optical imaging to refine our understanding of nanomedicine biodistribution and tumor targeting. Additionally, nonspecific uptake in organs like the liver and spleen is examined, advocating for strategies such as carrier surface modification and biomimetic design to enhance tumor specificity. Moving forward, integrate advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;driven data analytics and humanized in vitro and in vivo models are proposed to better predict clinical outcomes. By critically synthesizing the current knowledge and proposing transformative directions, this review aims to inspire innovative approaches that will pave the way for nanomedicines to achieve their full clinical potential in tumor theranostics.

         <title>Bifunctionally Driven Organic Photonic Conversion Devices Facilitated by Minimalistic Synthesis&#8208;Based Interfacial Energetic Alignment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzene&#8208;phosphonic acid self&#8208;assembled monolayer (BPA) simultaneously optimizes hole extraction and noise suppression, enabling bifunctional organic photovoltaics&#8211;photodetectors that deliver superb indoor performance and commercial viability. BPA&#8208;devices achieve 28.6% PCE at 1000 lx, retain 93% efficiency on large&#8208;scaled devices, and reach 584 fW NEP with a 103 kHz 3dB bandwidth, while cutting production costs by 720%.








Abstract
Bifunctional integration of indoor organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and photodetectors (OPDs) faces fundamental challenges because of incompatible interfacial thermodynamics: indoor OPVs require unimpeded charge extraction under low&#8208;light conditions (200&#8211;1000&#160;lx), whereas OPDs require stringent suppression of noise current. Conventional hole transport layers (HTLs) fail to satisfy these opposing charge&#8208;dynamic requirements concurrently with commercial practicality (large&#8208;area uniformity, photostability, and cost&#8208;effective manufacturability). This study introduces benzene&#8208;phosphonic acid (BPA)&#8212;a minimalist self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM)&#8208;based HTL with a benzene core and phosphonic acid anchoring group&#8212;enabling cost&#8208;effective synthesis and excellent ITO interfacial properties such as energy alignment, uniform monolayer, and stability. This molecular design resolves core limitations and achieves high indoor OPV efficiency (28.6% PCE at 1000&#160;lx LED 2700 K), maintains 93% PCE retention when scaled by &#8776;220&#215; area, and delivers competitive self&#8208;powered (V = 0&#160;V) OPD performance (noise equivalent power = 584 fW at bandwidth = 1&#160;Hz and wavelength = 730&#160;nm; 3&#160;dB frequency = 103&#160;kHz). Simplified synthesis of BPA reduces production costs by 720% ($0.042 cm&#8722;2) and achieves 9&#215; higher power&#8208;per&#8208;cost ratio (19.25 mW&#8729;$&#8722;1) relative to its&#160;counterpart SAM. Synergy between performance and commercial practicality positions BPA&#8208;HTL as a transformative enabler for self&#8208;powered IoT and wearable optoelectronics.

         <title>Microenvironment&#8208;Programmed siRNA&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Spatiotemporal Gene Silencing in Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an intelligent, dual&#8208;response hydrogel system for chronic wounds. By delivering siRMMP&#8208;9, the system effectively silences MMP&#8208;9, thereby preventing excessive ECM degradation. The SS&#8208;HPT structure enables efficient binding of siRMMP&#8208;9 and controlled release triggered by GSH. Moreover, the OR&#8208;S gel, formed by Fc/&#946;&#8208;CD self&#8208;assembly, exhibits ROS&#8208;responsive properties and ROS&#8208;scavenging capabilities, thereby promoting wound healing.








Abstract
Excessive inflammation and overexpressed matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are significant factors in the prolonged healing of chronic diabetic wounds. Here, a precise gene therapy strategy is proposed utilizing siRNA and employing intelligent responsive materials for controlled release to mechanistically intervene in the pathological process of chronic non&#8208;healing wounds. The system employs a cationic hyperbranched aminoglycoside with disulfide bonds (SS&#8208;HPT) as its core delivery mechanism. These SS&#8208;HPT/siRMMP&#8208;9 complexes are incorporated into a hyaluronic acid&#8208;based hydrogel with redox&#8208;responsive properties (OR&#8208;S gel), allowing dual regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the wound microenvironment. The hydrogel network actively scavenges excess ROS, mitigating oxidative stress damage to tissue repair. Simultaneously, ROS&#8208;mediated hydrogel degradation enables the controlled release of siRMMP&#8208;9, enhancing the treatment's spatiotemporal precision and biocompatibility. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirm that this treatment system effectively down&#8208;regulates MMP&#8208;9 expression, remodels the extracellular matrix, and enhances the wound repair microenvironment, thereby significantly accelerating the healing of chronic diabetic wounds. This study introduces an innovative intervention targeting the mechanisms underlying non&#8208;healing diabetic wounds and offers a theoretical foundation for applying intelligent responsive gene delivery systems in tissue repair, demonstrating promising translational potential and clinical prospects.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive inflammation and overexpressed matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are significant factors in the prolonged healing of chronic diabetic wounds. Here, a precise gene therapy strategy is proposed utilizing siRNA and employing intelligent responsive materials for controlled release to mechanistically intervene in the pathological process of chronic non-healing wounds. The system employs a cationic hyperbranched aminoglycoside with disulfide bonds (SS-HPT) as its core delivery mechanism. These SS-HPT/siRMMP-9 complexes are incorporated into a hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel with redox-responsive properties (OR-S gel), allowing dual regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the wound microenvironment. The hydrogel network actively scavenges excess ROS, mitigating oxidative stress damage to tissue repair. Simultaneously, ROS-mediated hydrogel degradation enables the controlled release of siRMMP-9, enhancing the treatment's spatiotemporal precision and biocompatibility. In vitro and in vivo experiments confirm that this treatment system effectively down-regulates MMP-9 expression, remodels the extracellular matrix, and enhances the wound repair microenvironment, thereby significantly accelerating the healing of chronic diabetic wounds. This study introduces an innovative intervention targeting the mechanisms underlying non-healing diabetic wounds and offers a theoretical foundation for applying intelligent responsive gene delivery systems in tissue repair, demonstrating promising translational potential and clinical prospects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fully Erasable Amphibious Adhesives Derived from Soybean Oil with Record&#8208;High Underwater Adhesion Strength</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphibious and fully erasable adhesives with record&#8208;high underwater adhesion are fabricated by reversibly cross&#8208;linking epoxidized soybean oil with boroxine and hydrogen&#8208;bonded hydrophobic nanodomains. These adhesives exhibit outstanding adhesion to a wide range of substrates in both dry and underwater environments, without requiring any post&#8208;curing. They are biocompatible, reusable, and can be completely removed from the adherend surface simply by rinsing with ethanol.








Abstract
Developing amphibious adhesives that combine high adhesion strength with on&#8208;demand erasability in both dry and wet environments remains a significant challenge. In this study, biomass&#8208;derived, amphibious, and erasable adhesives are fabricated by grafting 3&#8208;aminobenzoic acid and 3&#8208;aminobenzeneboronic acid onto epoxidized soybean oil (ESO), yielding ESO&#8208;Am adhesives. These adhesives are dynamically cross&#8208;linked with boroxines, hydrogen bonds, and hydrogen&#8208;bonded hydrophobic nanodomains. ESO&#8208;Am adhesives exhibit strong and durable adhesion to a wide range of substrates under dry conditions, with adhesion strengths comparable to those of commercial counterparts. Remarkably, they also demonstrate exceptional underwater adhesion without the need for post&#8208;curing, achieving an adhesion strength of 5.2&#160;MPa on iron, surpassing previously reported underwater adhesives. This outstanding performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of dynamic boroxine linkages and hydrogen&#8208;bonded hydrophobic nanodomains, which enhance both cohesive strength and interfacial interactions. Importantly, the dynamic cross&#8208;links allow for complete and on&#8208;demand removal of the adhesive by simple ethanol rinsing. In addition, ESO&#8208;Am adhesives are biocompatible, degradable in soil, and reusable, retaining 96% of their original adhesion strength after ten cycles of reuse. The combination of strong amphibious adhesion, full erasability, biodegradability, and reusability makes ESO&#8208;Am adhesives highly promising for a wide range of sustainable and advanced applications.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Quantum Coherence From a High&#8208;Spin Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;spin donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymers demonstrate newly realized quantum functionalities such as long solid&#8208;state spin relaxation times, coherent control of the superposition state, and single qubit operations. These attributes coupled with high chemical tunability, robust stability, interrelated optoelectronic properties, and solution processability offer a fundamentally new approach to readily integrating quantum phenomena within functional device platforms.








Abstract
Molecular spin systems that can be chemically tuned, coherently controlled, and readily integrated within devices remain central to the realization of emerging quantum technologies. Organic high&#8208;spin materials are prime candidates owing to their similarity in electronic structure to leading solid&#8208;state defect&#8208;based systems, light element composition, and the potential for entanglement and qubit operations mediated through spin&#8208;spin exchange. However, the inherent instability of these species precludes their rational design, development, and application. Here, the first example of an organic high&#8208;spin qubit based on a conjugated polymer semiconductor comprised of alternating dithienosilole and thiadiazoloquinoxaline heterocycles is demonstrated. It is shown that electron spins within the macromolecule demonstrate high&#8208;fidelity coherent control of the superposition state with room temperature coherence and solid&#8208;state relaxation times that are competitive with or exceed other synthetic molecular qubits. These attributes, along with robust stability, chemical tunability, rich interrelated optoelectronic functionalities, and solution processability, offer a fundamentally new approach to integrating quantum phenomena within functional device platforms.

         <title>Boosting the Efficiency of 1.84&#160;eV Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites Photovoltaics Beyond 19% via Yb3+ Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially those with a bandgap &#8776;1.84&#160;eV, are pivotal for tandem photovoltaics. However, severe halide phase segregation and ion migration critically limit their efficiency and operational stability. In this work, these challenges are addressed through an innovative Yb3&#8314;&#8208;based additive engineering strategy. Based on this strategy, the champion Yb(TFSI)3&#8208;modified PSCs achieved a PCE of 19.06%.








Abstract
Phase segregation remains one of the most critical challenges limiting the performance and long&#8208;term operational stability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This issue is especially pronounced in 1.84&#160;eV wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites, where severe halide phase segregation leads to compositional heterogeneity and accelerated device degradation. In this work, a comprehensive investigation of halide ion distribution across the surface and bottom interfaces of 1.84&#160;eV perovskite films is conducted, revealing significant Br&#8722;/I&#8722; halide phase segregation that severely impairs device efficiency and stability. To address this, Ytterbium (III) trifluoromethanesulfonate (Yb(TFSI)3) is introduced as a multifunctional additive in the perovskite precursor. The strong coordination between Yb3+ ions and halide anions not only modulates the crystallization kinetics but also homogenizes the spatial distribution of Br&#8208;rich and I&#8208;rich domains, resulting in high&#8208;quality perovskite films with reduced compositional heterogeneity. Furthermore, Yb3+ significantly suppresses halide migration and ion exchange processes, thereby enhancing phase stability. Depth&#8208;resolved characterizations, including grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, confirm improved crystallinity, structural uniformity, and suppressed phase segregation across the film depth. As a result, the champion device achieves an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.06% and retains 85% of its initial efficiency after 1500&#160;h in a nitrogen atmosphere (10% RH, 25&#160;&#176;C).

The conductive phosphorus (P)&#8208;doped iron telluride (FeTe2) nanoparticles with engineered Te vacancies anchored on nitrogen (N)&#8208;doped carbon (C) (P&#8208;FeTe2&#8208;x@NC) network facilitates rapid electron/lithium ion (Li+)transport, while Te vacancies generate electron&#8208;deficient Fe sites that strengthen polysulfide adsorption via iron&#8208;sulfur (Fe&#9472;S) covalent interactions. Concurrently, P doping upshifts the Fe d&#8208;band center toward the Fermi level, enhancing intermediate affinity through d&#8208;p orbital hybridization.

Abstract
The polysulfide shuttling and sluggish sulfur redox kinetics hinder the commercialization of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. Herein, the fabrication of phosphorus (P)&#8208;doped iron telluride (FeTe2)&#160;nanoparticles with engineered Te vacancies anchored on nitrogen (N)&#8208;doped carbon (C)&#160;(P&#8208;FeTe2&#8208;x@NC) is presented as a multifunctional sulfur host. Theoretical and experimental analyses show that Te vacancies create electron&#8208;deficient Fe sites, which chemically anchor polysulfides through enhanced Fe&#9472;S covalent interactions. Additionally, P doping shifts the Fe d&#8208;band center toward the Fermi level, increasing the affinity for polysulfide intermediates through d&#8208;p orbital hybridization. This dual modulation strengthens the built&#8208;in electric field at the P&#8208;FeTe2&#8208;x/NC interface, effectively suppressing the shuttle effect and accelerating redox kinetics. The optimized P&#8208;FeTe2&#8208;x@NC host enables Li&#8208;S batteries to achieve an initial capacity of 1475.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C and remarkable cycling stability, exhibiting only a 0.031% capacity decay per cycle over 1000 cycles at 1 C. High sulfur utilization is evidenced by attaining 6.51 mAh cm&#8722;2 areal capacity under a loading of 7.80 mg cm&#8722;2, while a 2.67 Ah pouch cell delivers an energy density of 326.6 Wh kg&#8722;1. This work establishes a vacancy&#8208;doping synergy strategy for coordinating adsorption and conversion processes in sulfur electrochemistry, offering new insights into the design of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Suppressing Metal Dissolution in Multi&#8208;Grained Catalysts Through Intragrain Atomic Ordering for Stable Fuel Cells (Adv. Mater. 35/2025)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>

Stable Fuel Cells
In article number 2504059, Hanuel Jin, Hyesung Jo, Yongsoo Yang, Dong Won Chun, Sung Jong Yoo, and co&#8208;workers present the synthesis of dome&#8208;hollow NiPt nanocatalysts incorporating ordered Ni3Pt5 phases via ultrasound&#8208;assisted atomic transposition at room temperature. Atomic ordering within multi&#8208;grained structure effectively suppresses metal dissolution in chemical and electrochemical environments, enabling high catalytic activity and long&#8208;term durability in PEMFCs under both light&#8208;duty and heavy&#8208;duty operations.

CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol over Earth&#8208;Abundant Catalysts
Hybrid Cu/Cu2P2O7 catalysts, formed by discharging Li&#8208;ion batteries, steer CO2 electroreduction decisively toward methanol, a key chemical for a sustainable future. The noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free hybrids achieve Faradaic efficiencies of 48.8 % in KHCO3 and 70.1 % in CsHCO3, operate steadily for 48 h, and sustain &gt; 100 mA cm&#8722;2 on gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes. More details can be found in article number 2501021 by Aloysius Soon, Jongsoon Kim, Jungki Ryu, and co&#8208;workers.

Novel Strain Indicator
In article number 2419414, Mun Seok Jeong and co&#8208;workers identify a new strain indicator in monolayer WSe2 using tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy. The strain sensitivity of the newly revealed Raman&#8208;inactive out&#8208;of&#8208;plane A2&#8243;(&#915;) mode was clearly demonstrated through both experimental and theoretical approaches. Specifically, density functional theory (DFT)&#8208;based analysis elucidating the origin of selection rule relaxation (attributed to strain&#8208;induced polarizability changes) provides robust support for establishing this mode as a novel phonon&#8208;based strain indicator.

Bioinspired Heterogeneous Spheres
Inspired by the morphology and helical motion of Phacus helicoides, millimeter&#8208;sized spheres with an inner helical structure can imitate the micro&#8208;mixing and metabolic processes, including the adsorption, catalysis, and release capacity of Phacus helicoides. They can effectively absorb the glucose, catalyzed glucose, and eventually released the hypoglycemic drugs. More details can be found in article number 2504878 by Tao Chen, Chaobo Huang and co&#8208;workers.

Hydrogel&#8208;Based Synthetic Chromatophores
In article number 2505104, Stephen A. Morin and co&#8208;workers use dyed arrays of microscale hydrogels to emulate biological chromatophores found in cephalopods. These synthetic chromatophores expand and contract when stimulated, enabling skins with dynamic colors and patterns. By combining the optical and mechanical properties of the chromatophores, the team produced actuation systems that signal their environmental condition through color and morphology, simultaneously.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nano&#8208;Islands: Unlocking New Horizons in Catalytic Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom nano&#8208;islands (SANIs) are innovative confined&#8208;space single&#8208;atom systems composed of single atoms, nano&#8208;islands, and support. Due to their confined space, multiple active sites, interfacial interactions, and tunable coordination structure, SANIs catalysts exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity, stability, and selectivity. This review comprehensively analyzes recent advancements in SANIs catalysts, and the challenges and opportunities for their development in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, and accelerating their transformation to industrial applications are discussed.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), renowned for their maximized atomic utilization, tunable coordination environments, and unique electronic structures, are critical to energy conversion and storage. However, obstacles to their practical performance include atomic agglomeration (caused by high surface free energy) and active site passivation (due to overly strong metal&#8211;support chemical bonds). Single&#8208;atom nano&#8208;islands (SANIs) catalysts, characterized by confined spaces and innovative structural designs, have better electrocatalytic activity and stability. This review comprehensively analyzes recent advancements in SANIs catalysts, highlighting their contributions to catalytic activity, stability, structural optimization, and selectivity. We systematically summarize the design principles and strategies for SANIs electrocatalysts by focusing on material selection, metal&#8211;support interactions, and coordination structures. Finally, the challenges and opportunities associated with SANIs catalysts to promote their development in heterogeneous catalysis and accelerate their transition into industrial applications are discussed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review on artificial intelligence and semiconductor materials aims to discuss the impact of artificial intelligence on accelerating semiconductor materials discovery, synthesis, characterization, and device optimization, addressing critical scaling and power limitations. Moreover, challenges regarding data size and quality, artificial intelligence model generalization, and autonomous experimentation are discussed to inspire more research.








Abstract
To address the persistent challenges of scaling and power consumption in integrated circuits and chips, recent research has focused on exploring novel semiconductor materials beyond silicon and designing new device architectures. The vastness of the material and parameter space poses significant challenges in terms of cost and efficiency for traditional experimental and computational methods. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) offers a highly promising avenue for accelerating semiconductor technology development. AI&#8208;driven methods demonstrate significant advantages in analyzing and interpreting large datasets, potentially freeing researchers to focus on more creative endeavors. This review provides a detailed and timely overview of how AI&#8208;driven approaches are assisting researchers across the entire semiconductor research pipeline, encompassing materials discovery, semiconductor screening, synthesis, characterization, and device performance optimization, highlighting how their integration facilitates a holistic understanding of the entire processing&#8208;structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance (PSPP) relationship. Remain challenges related to dataset quality, model generalizability, and autonomous experimentation, as well as the under&#8208;application of AI to critical needs are discussed in the semiconductor field, such as wafer&#8208;scale growth of high&#8208;quality, single&#8208;crystal semiconductor thin films beyond silicon. Addressing these challenges requires collaborative efforts from researchers across various organizations and disciplines, and represents a key focus for future research.

         <title>Food Nanozymology: Nanozyme Engineering Toward Future Food</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes are rapidly emerging in food research as a next&#8208;generation enzymatic toolkit. By proposing a transdisciplinary paradigm called food nanozymology, this work systematically elucidates its fundamental principles, diverse applications across the food supply chain, and key developmental challenges and future prospects. It establishes a clear theoretical framework to inform and guide future food research in this burgeoning interdisciplinary field.








Abstract
Enzymes have historically served as critical biocatalysts in the food supply chain, yet their industrial applicability remains constrained by intrinsic limitations such as poor stability, low availability, and high production costs. Nanozymes, synthetic nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities, offer a compelling alternative owing to their superior physicochemical properties and tunable functionalities. This review conceptualizes food nanozymology as a new interdisciplinary field that combines enzymological principles with nanotechnology to reimagine catalytic strategies in food systems. It provides a critical overview of current progress across multiple application fronts, including detection, detoxification, preservation, processing, food fortification and nutritional intervention, and resource recovery, etc. By framing food nanozymology as both a conceptual and technological shift, this work highlights its potential to catalyze innovation and improve the sustainability, efficiency, and resilience of the global food supply chain.

         <title>AI&#8208;Driven Defect Engineering for Advanced Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents how AI accelerates the design of defect&#8208;tuned thermoelectric materials. By integrating machine learning with high&#8208;throughput data and physics&#8208;informed representations, it enables efficient prediction of thermoelectric performance from complex defect landscapes. It also outlines emerging directions where machine learning may assist inverse design and promote sustainability in next&#8208;generation thermoelectric&#160;materials.








Abstract
Thermoelectric materials offer a promising pathway to directly convert waste heat to electricity. However, achieving high performance remains challenging due to intrinsic trade&#8208;offs between electrical conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity, which are further complicated by the presence of defects. This review explores how artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming thermoelectric materials design. Advanced ML approaches including deep neural networks, graph&#8208;based models, and transformer architectures, integrated with high&#8208;throughput simulations and growing databases, effectively capture structure&#8208;property relationships in a complex multiscale defect space and overcome the &#8220;curse of dimensionality&#8221;. This review discusses AI&#8208;enhanced defect engineering strategies such as composition optimization, entropy and dislocation engineering, and grain boundary design, along with emerging inverse design techniques for generating materials with targeted properties. Finally, it outlines future opportunities in novel physics mechanisms and sustainability, highlighting the critical role of AI in accelerating the discovery of thermoelectric&#160;materials.

         <title>Spin Engineering of Dual&#8208;Atom Site Catalysts for Efficient Electrochemical Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent progress in spin engineering of dual&#8208;atom site catalysts (DASCs), emphasizing how spin&#8208;related properties enhance electrocatalytic activity, selectivity, and stability. It summarizes cutting&#8208;edge developments in dual&#8208;atom catalysis, discusses the underlying spin&#8208;catalysis mechanisms and structure&#8211;performance relationships, and proposes high&#8208;throughput screening strategies to guide the rational design of spin&#8208;optimized DASCs for small&#8208;molecule conversion reactions.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom site catalysts (DASCs) provide more advantages than single&#8208;atom systems in improving energy conversions, owing to their unique features. For example, the coupling effect may align the spin of two adjacent dual&#8208;atom active centers in parallel or antiparallel via electron exchange interactions, thereby altering reaction mechanisms and overall efficiency. While numerous reviews have explored spin&#8208;dependent electrocatalysis, there remains a lack of a comprehensive, spin&#8208;focused framework for understanding the catalytic behavior of DASCs. This review emphasizes the role of spin in dual&#8208;atom site centers for electrocatalysis research. First, spin fundamentals in electrocatalysts, including spin&#8208;selective orbital occupation, spin ordering, and spin coupling, are comprehensively summarized to provide a solid foundation for subsequent discussions. Then, spin engineering strategies of DASCs are reviewed, including manipulating the spin configuration of the central atoms, modulating coordination environments, and tuning metal&#8211;support interactions. Next, recent developments in spin engineering of DASCs are reviewed, with a focus on structure&#8211;performance relationships. Furthermore, high&#8208;throughput screening techniques integrated with machine learning are discussed for developing highly efficient DASCs based on spin engineering. The challenges and opportunities of DASCs and spin engineering are thoroughly discussed to promote the advancement of new energy applications.

         <title>Immobilization of H2O in Diffusion Channel of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Long&#8208;Term CO2 Capture from Humid Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to immobilize water molecules within a robust metal&#8211;organic framework significantly enhances CO2 adsorption at low concentrations. The optimized channels by functional group regulation and water molecules immobilization in this unique MOF material facilitate the long&#8208;term viability of CO2 capture in humid flue gas. This counter&#8208;intuitive approach transforms the presence of water into favorable conditions for CO2 capture.








Abstract
Utilizing physisorption for CO2 capture in humid flue gas presents challenges, with H2O molecules either damaging the adsorbent or competing with CO2 for adsorption, compromising long&#8208;term stability. Herein, a counter&#8208;intuitive strategy is proposed to address this issue by immobilizing H2O into metal&#8211;organic framework (TYUT&#8208;ATZ, TYUT = Taiyuan University of Technology, ATZ = 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole) as binding sites for CO2 capture from humid airflow. Through tailoring the &#8208;NH2 group numbers and pore sizes creates ingenious H2O sites, preserving CO2 adsorption space and enhancing CO2 adsorption interactions in 1D channels. The well&#8208;constructed TYUT&#8208;ATZ&#8208;&#946; demonstrates a high CO2 adsorption capacity (62.7 cm3 cm&#8722;3) at 0.15&#160;bar and outstanding CO2/N2 (15/85) selectivity (2031) at 298 K, while also exhibits the highest CO2/H2O uptake ratio in humid flue gas due to its excellent water stability and unique H2O site. Consequently, it shows top&#8208;performing CO2 enrichment ability with easy regeneration in long&#8208;term separation experiments (over 100 cycles) under high&#8208;humidity (75% RH). Gas adsorption isotherms, single&#8208;crystal analysis, selectivity calculations, and contrastive breakthrough experiments comprehensively validate this artful H2O immobilization strategy in MOFs for efficient CO2 capture in humid flue gas, satisfying the application requirements of high selectivity, rapid regeneration, and long&#8208;term stability.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents bulk heterojunction organic photosynapses (BHJ&#8208;OPS) for neuromorphic electronics, enabling ultra&#8208;broadband photodetection and low&#8208;energy near&#8208;infrared perception with bio&#8208;synaptic features. A neuromorphic visual system based on BHJ&#8208;OPS that can sense visual information and coordinate movements in response to environmental stimuli is successfully achieved.








Abstract
The emergence of electronics influenced by visual neural perception and action is increasingly crucial for enhancing interactive human&#8208;machine interfaces and advancing the capabilities of intelligent robots. There is an urgent demand for a system that incorporates neuromorphic environmental information encoding, synaptic signal processing, and motion control. Taking inspiration from the polychromatic visual system, it is initially employed bulk heterojunction organic photosynapses (BHJ&#8208;OPS) to replicate the functionalities of human&#8208;like visual nerve system. The BHJ&#8208;OPS, utilizing a two&#8208;terminal architecture, exhibits an ultra&#8208;broadband photodetection range (365&#8211;1060&#160;nm). For near&#8208;infrared (NIR) perception, an optical energy consumption as low as 0.2 fJ per synaptic event is demonstrated, which is the lowest energy consumption achieved so far with NIR light stimulation. By combining the photovoltaic effect in heterojunctions with electron trapping in the buffer layer, BHJ&#8208;OPS displays bio&#8208;synaptic characteristics such as short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term memory, as well as experiential learning, which endows the synapse array with multispectral color&#8208;discrimination capabilities. Finally, it is implemented miniature insect robots capable of night&#8208;time foraging and predator evasion based on a simulated 26 &#215; 26 memristor network. This demonstrates significant potential for the development of miniature insect robots with self&#8208;regulation and adaptability, particularly in exploration, monitoring, and rescue missions.

         <title>Surface Fluorination Shielding of Sulfide Solid Electrolytes for Enhanced Electrochemical Stability in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile surface fluorination using XeF2 significantly enhances the electrochemical stability of Li6PS5Cl while preserving 82.8% of its initial Li+ conductivity, which is attributed to the formation of a uniform and ultrathin (&#8776;37.3&#160;nm) fluorinated layer. The underlying fluorination mechanisms are also elucidated. The effectiveness of this strategy is further demonstrated by the outstanding performance of both the LiNi0.90Co0.05Mn0.05O2||(Li&#8208;In) half&#8208;cells and pouch&#8208;type LiNi0.90Co0.05Mn0.05O2||Li full cells.








Abstract
Despite their high Li+ conductivity and deformability, sulfide solid electrolytes suffer from limited electrochemical stability, which prevents all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) from reaching their full performance potential. Herein, a facile surface fluorination strategy is presented for Li6PS5Cl using XeF2 as a solid&#8208;state fluorinating agent, enabling a scalable dry process at moderate temperatures. An &#8776;37.3 nm&#8208;thick uniform fluorinated layer is coated on an Li6PS5Cl surface, preserving 82.8% of the initial Li+ conductivity (from 2.9 &#215; 10&#8315;3 only to 2.4 &#215; 10&#8315;3 S cm&#8315;&#185; at 30 &#176;C). The underlying fluorination mechanism, deduced through systematic investigations using X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray Rietveld refinement, nuclear magnetic resonance, and density functional theory calculations, involves the formation of surface oxidative byproducts and F substitution within the lattice. When applied to LiNi0.90Co0.05Mn0.05O2 electrodes in LiNi0.90Co0.05Mn0.05O2||(Li&#8208;In) half cells at 30 &#176;C, the fluorinated Li6PS5Cl substantially improves the electrochemical performance, delivering superior discharge capacities (e.g., 186.9 vs 173.6&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.33C), capacity retention, and safety characteristics compared to unmodified Li6PS5Cl. This enhancement is attributed to the formation of a robust fluorinated cathode electrolyte interphase that mitigates Li6PS5Cl oxidation. Finally, the stable operation of a pouch&#8208;type LiNi0.90Co0.05Mn0.05O2||Li ASSB is demonstrated, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach.

         <title>Eliminating Nearfield Coupling in Dense High Quality Factor Phase Gradient Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for fully suppressing nearfield coupling is reported between subwavelength separated meta&#8208;atoms with arbitrarily large resonant quality factors, opening the door to dynamic high resolution wavefront shaping with vanishingly small refractive index biasing. The platform provides a route for densely arrayed high Q metasurfaces with independently addressable meta&#8208;atoms, paving the way for highly efficient nonlinear and dynamic wavefront shaping.








Abstract
High Q phase gradient metasurfaces are promising for revolutionizing light manipulation, but near&#8208;field coupling typically forces a trade&#8208;off between quality factor and resolution. Here, a strategy for eliminating coupling&#8208;based nonlocal effects in wave shaping metasurfaces composed of meta&#8208;pixels is presented with arbitrarily long resonant lifetimes arranged with sub&#8208;diffraction spatial resolution. By working at a zero&#8208;coupling regime introduced by the interference between enhanced longitudinal and transverse electric fields, the tradeoff between Q and resolution no longer exists. Numerical demonstrations show that metasurfaces with quality factors of a few million and resolution &lt;&#955;/1.6 can produce beam&#8208;splitting to angles of &#177;53&#176; and beam&#8208;steering to an angle of 33&#176; with diffraction efficiencies over 90% via refractive index modulations of just 2 &#215; 10&#8722;6 and 7 &#215; 10&#8722;6, respectively. Experimentally, the signature of a zero&#8208;coupling regime is discovered in the form of a sign flip in the angular dispersion with resonant wavelength, which validates the scheme. Aside from triangulating a perfect decoupling configuration, one of the fabricated nanofin&#8208;isolated metasurfaces with Q&#8208;factor &gt;870 has a resonant wavelength that stays within the half linewidth for incident angles of &#8722;20&#176; to 20&#176;. This platform paves the way for combining precise wavefront shaping with highly efficient nonlinearity and rapid programmability.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough Single&#8208;Network Hydrogels via the Synergy of Defect Elimination and Dual Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of tough hydrogel in single&#8208;network is developed by leveraging nanostructures as crosslinkers and initiators within free radical reactions to optimize the network imperfections, including spatial inhomogeneities and dangling&#8208;chain defects. The integration of dangling chains and dual crosslinking into the network offers substantial enhancements in the fracture toughness and fatigue resistance without compromising its low hysteresis.









Abstract
Network imperfections, such as multi&#8208;dispersed junctions and dangling chains, significantly impair the mechanical performance of hydrogels and elastomers synthesized via free radical reactions (FRRs). Great efforts have been made to introduce sacrificial structures to enhance toughness but cause pronounced hysteresis, leaving a comprehensive solution elusive. Herein, a class of robust single&#8208;network hydrogels with minimal imperfections is reported by employing nano&#8208;crosslinkers and nano&#8208;initiators to produce monodispersed crosslinking points and eliminate dangling&#8208;chain defects, in the formation of dual crosslinking of thiolate&#8208;Au bond and chemically covalent bond in the network. As a result, the hydrogel achieves a maximum fracture toughness (78&#8201;500 J m&#8722;2) and fatigue resistance (2480 J m&#8722;2), with over 13 and 55 fold increases attributed to the incorporation of dangling chains and dual crosslinking, respectively, without compromising its low hysteresis (0.07). Eliminating dangling chains also improves interfacial contact and osmotic pressure resistance, enabling exceptional underwater self&#8208;healing and swelling properties. Even with a high water&#8208;uptake of up to 95 wt.%, the swollen hydrogel exhibits stretchability exceeding 2000%, without obvious mechanical degradation after one month of water incubation. This work demonstrates a model system for developing resilient polymers with minimized imperfections derived from FRRs, showing numerous potential applications in underwater applications.

         <title>Crystallinity&#8208;Induced Ion Rectification in Polymer/Zn Interphases for Stable Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a macromolecular ordering&#8208;tuned interphase by leveraging the phase&#8208;separated hierarchical ion tunnels in semicrystalline polymers to address Zn/electrolyte interfacial issues. The PVA interphase, with lamellar orientation parallel to the Zn anode, achieves a balance between electrode protection and ionic conductivity, enabling rapid yet uniform Zn2+ transport and interfacial stability.








Abstract
The energy density and cycle life of aqueous zinc metal batteries are hindered by inherent chemical and mechanical instabilities at the Zn/electrolyte interface, causing uncontrolled dendrite formation and side reactions. Here, an anisotropic crystalline polymer interphase by leveraging the hierarchical structure to stabilize the interface is designed. The stabilization effect strongly depends on the crystallinity of polymer chains, where the one with optimal ion transfer possesses a preferred orientation of nanocrystals parallel to the Zn anode. This topological structure creates fast tunnel for ion transport that significantly enhances the kinetics and reversibility of electrochemical transformations. The ordered crystalline phase and disordered amorphous phase respectively blocks H&#8322;O penetration and provides Zn2&#8314; transport channels, reaching an optimum between electrode protection and ion transfer. Symmetric cells with the crystallinity&#8208;tuned interface demonstrate an exceptionally long lifespan exceeding 3000&#160;h at elevated current density and capacity of 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, with a cumulative plated capacity of 7500&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. The Zn/AC hybrid ion supercapacitor exhibits outstanding stability, enduring over 10&#160;000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. The work unveils new ordering&#8208;dependent ion transport in solid&#8208;state polymer interphase/electrolyte and provides a feasible approach for advancing grid&#8208;scale aqueous batteries.

         <title>Bilateral Anchoring for Enhanced Mechanical Stability and Efficiency in Flexible all&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bilateral anchoring strategy using 2&#8208;bromoethylamine hydrobromide (2&#8208;BH) at PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface enhances interfacial adhesion and charger transfer in flexible Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cells. The introduction of 2&#8208;BH additionally mitigates Sn2+ oxidation, thereby improving the film morphology and crystallinity. Overall, such optimized flexible all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells achieve a power conversion efficiency of 24.1% and present superior mechanical durability.








Abstract
Flexible all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs) feature an outstanding power&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio, rendering them perfect for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic, wearable electronics, and aerospace applications, owing to their adaptability to flexible and lightweight substrates. However, the weak mechanical adhesion between the perovskite and adjacent functional layers, combined with tin (Sn) oxidation at the buried interface in tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) perovskites solar cells (PSCs), substantially hampers the durability and performance of device. Herein, a bilateral anchoring strategy is proposed by employing 2&#8208;bromoethylamine hydrobromide (2&#8208;BH) at the NBG perovskite/ hole transporting layer (PEDOT:PSS) interface. The incorporation of 2&#8208;BH establishes robust bonds with both PEDOT:PSS and the perovskite layer, thereby enhancing interfacial adhesion and charge transfer. Meanwhile, the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite films are also improved due to the mitigated oxidation of Sn2+. Thus, this approach yields flexible single&#8208;junction NBG &#160;with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.5%, maintaining its 95% efficiency after 3000 bending cycles. When integrated into monolithic flexible all&#8208;perovskite TSCs, a certified PCE of 24.01% is achieved.

         <title>3D Printing&#8211;In Situ Curing of Soft Organogels Using Frontal Polymerizable Inks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A frontal polymerization&#8211;3D printing&#8211;in situ&#8208;curing strategy is developed to construct soft organogel materials with various architectures. The printed patterns are produced with high fidelity and integrity while saving energy.








Abstract
3D printing has gained immense recognition owing to its fascinating ability for rapid prototyping and customization. However, the current methods usually require post&#8208;processing (direct ink writing) or continuous energy input (stereolithography) for polymer gel curing. The former lowers the fidelity and integrity of the printed layers, whereas the latter suffers from high energy consumption. To address these issues, a frontal polymerization (FP)&#8211;3D printing&#8211;in situ&#8208;curing method is developed to construct printable and polymerizable inks for acrylate&#8208;based monomers and soft organogel materials. Once initiated, no external energy supply is required, which allows for real&#8208;time conversion of monomers into polymers within seconds. Thus, the energy requirements are reduced by several orders of magnitude. More importantly, the printed structure is closely bonded, effectively avoiding the collapse and deformation of soft materials. The as&#8208;printed organogel is used as an evaporator and achieves a high water&#8208;evaporation rate of 3.77&#160;kg m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1. This FP&#8211;3D printing&#8211;in situ&#8208;curing strategy is an alternative, energy&#8208;saving method for fabricating soft materials, enabling high fidelity and integrity of printed patterns with wide applicability.

         <title>Magnetically Controlled Reversible Photomagnetic Nanoactuators for Dynamic Contrast Enhancement in Optical Coherence Tomography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photomagnetic nanoactuators with &#8776;90% scattering efficiency in the second near&#8208;infrared window are demonstrated to exhibit magnetic field&#8208;controlled modulation of optical scattering and optical coherence tomography signals. These nanoactuators are reversibly assembled and disassembled under the external magnetic field modulation, enabling enhanced particle&#8208;associated signal detection with suppressed background signal both in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high&#8208;resolution imaging modality that detects scattered optical signals from light&#8211;tissue interaction. However, the ability of OCT to visualize specific molecular and cellular events is hindered by the lack of effective exogenous contrast agents capable of producing noticeable imaging contrast. Here, photomagnetic nanoactuators with &#8776;90% scattering efficiency in the second near&#8208;infrared window, capable of reversible magnetic field&#8208;mediated modulation of optical scattering and, therefore, OCT signal, are proposed. These nanoactuators consist of a magnetite core and gold shell, functioning as a reversible magnetic actuator and an optical scatterer, respectively. When exposed to the external magnetic field, photomagnetic nanoactuators are assembled into chain structures via magnetostatic interactions between nearby nanoactuators, reducing their optical scattering and, consequently, the OCT signal. Upon removal of the magnetic field, the nanoactuators are disassembled, restoring their scattering property and OCT signal. It is demonstrated that this magnetically controlled OCT response allows enhanced particle&#8208;associated signal detection with suppressed background signal via image subtraction before and after magnetic field treatment, both in vitro and in vivo. The developed nanoactuator platform offers a strategy for dynamic enhancement of OCT contrast, potentially broadening the utility of OCT for noninvasive cell tracking and molecular diagnostic imaging.

         <title>Architected Liquid Crystal Elastomer Lattices with Programmable Energy Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Architected liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) lattices with programmed alignment, stiffness, and enhanced energy absorption are created by direct ink writing. Their energy absorption behavior is measured across strain rates spanning six orders of magnitude (10&#8722;3&#8211;103 s&#8722;1). LCEs exhibit a 18&#8208;fold improvement relative to non&#8208;mesogenic (silicone) lattices at the highest strain rate tested.








Abstract
Architected LCE lattices are fabricated with flow&#8208;induced alignment via direct ink writing and systematically characterized their shape morphing, stiffness, and energy absorption behavior across strain rates spanning six orders of magnitude from 10&#8722;3 to 103 s&#8722;1. It is shown that architected liquid crystal elastomer&#160;(LCE) lattices exhibit superior energy absorption compared to their non&#8208;mesogenic (silicone) counterparts. Importantly, the LCE&#8208;to&#8208;silicone energy absorption ratios are up to 18&#8208;fold higher at the highest strain rate tested. A finite element model that captures their shape&#8208;morphing response is developed, which exhibits excellent agreement with the experimental observations.

     alt="Architected Liquid Crystal Elastomer Lattices with Programmable Energy Absorption"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architected liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) lattices with programmed alignment, stiffness, and enhanced energy absorption are created by direct ink writing. Their energy absorption behavior is measured across strain rates spanning six orders of magnitude (10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). LCEs exhibit a 18-fold improvement relative to non-mesogenic (silicone) lattices at the highest strain rate tested.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architected LCE lattices are fabricated with flow-induced alignment via direct ink writing and systematically characterized their shape morphing, stiffness, and energy absorption behavior across strain rates spanning six orders of magnitude from 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. It is shown that architected liquid crystal elastomer&#160;(LCE) lattices exhibit superior energy absorption compared to their non-mesogenic (silicone) counterparts. Importantly, the LCE-to-silicone energy absorption ratios are up to 18-fold higher at the highest strain rate tested. A finite element model that captures their shape-morphing response is developed, which exhibits excellent agreement with the experimental observations. The work opens new avenues for designing and fabricating LCE lattices with programmable alignment, shape morphing, and mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ancestral Protein&#8208;Based Lighting</title>

The ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) method applied to a large dataset of modern fluorescent proteins (FPs) led to a bright ancestral&#8208;like FP suitable for photon down&#8208;conversion in bio&#8208;hybrid light&#8208;emitting diodes (Bio&#8208;HLEDs).









Abstract
Protein&#8208;optoelectronics is a paradigm toward eco&#8208;designed and sustainable technologies. The challenge is, however, how to preserve the native activity of proteins upon device fabrication/operation in non&#8208;native environments (solvents, organic/inorganic interfaces, and working temperatures/irradiations). Herein, a new vision to identify and design ancestral&#8208;like fluorescent proteins (FPs) is proposed. Using ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) out of a large dataset (221) of the best modern FPs suitable for photon down&#8208;conversion in bio&#8208;hybrid light&#8208;emitting diodes (Bio&#8208;HLEDs) a historical&#8208;genetic reconstruction (family tree) was obtained, identifying a possible common ancestral FP. This computationally designed protein is produced in bacteria, featuring outstanding photoluminescence quantum yields in solution (e.g., 90%/80% for green&#8208;/red&#8208;emitting forms) and a strong tendency to agglomerate in polymer coatings. This resulted in red&#8208;emitting Bio&#8208;HLEDs that outperformed the reference with &#8776;2&#8208;fold enhanced stabilities. The resplendent green&#8208;/red&#8208;emission of ancestral&#8208;like FP itself and its respective devices led us to coin this new protein as QuetzalFP. Overall, it is set in ASR as an effective concept to reshape protein&#8208;optoelectronics allowing us to identify i) many interesting ancestral FPs for lighting and ii) QuetzalFP as stepping&#8208;stone platform for protein engineering.

         <title>Designing Maximal Strength in Nanolamellar Eutectic High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study uses molecular dynamics simulations to guide the design of EHEAs with superior mechanical performance. The simulations reveal a peak tensile strength at a critical interphase boundary spacing. Below this spacing, the governing mechanism shifts from the Hall&#8211;Petch strengthening to dislocation multiplication&#8211;mediated softening.&#160; Guided by these insights, LPBF&#8208;fabricated EHEAs achieve a tensile strength of 1.8 GPa, approaching the theoretical limit and exceeding other as&#8208;printed high&#8208;entropy alloys.








Abstract
Eutectic alloys have driven technological advancements for centuries, from early bronze tools that marked the dawn of metallurgy to high&#8208;performance soldering materials. Building on this legacy, eutectic high&#8208;entropy alloys (EHEAs) have recently emerged to push the boundaries of mechanical performance. However, the strength potential of EHEAs remains largely untapped, primarily because of limitations in cooling rates, posing a significant challenge to the development of ultra&#8208;strong bulk EHEAs. This study employs large&#8208;scale molecular dynamics simulations to uncover key insights into the design of EHEAs with exceptional mechanical performance. Simulations reveal that the maximum tensile strength occurs at a critical interphase boundary spacing, an order of magnitude larger than that observed in conventional alloys. Below this spacing, the governing mechanism shifts from the Hall&#8211;Petch strengthening to dislocation multiplication&#8211;mediated softening. Guided by the simulation insights, a tensile strength of 1.8&#160;GPa is achieved for laser powder bed fusion&#8211;fabricated EHEAs. This strength approaches the theoretical limit and outperforms other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art as&#8208;printed high&#8208;entropy alloys. This work not only establishes a viable pathway for designing ultra&#8208;strong EHEAs but also provides a promising avenue for addressing the long&#8208;standing challenge of developing high&#8208;performance as&#8208;printed materials for aerospace and other demanding applications.

         <title>Unraveling the Complexity of the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya Interaction in Layered Magnets: The Full Magnitude and Chirality Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In layered magnets, the atomistic Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) depends critically not only on the orbital occupancy of the interface layer but also on the sequence of the atomic layers. The effect can be understood by analyzing the contributions of different orbitals to DMI. Both the chirality and the magnitude of the atomistic DMI can be controlled through interface engineering.








Abstract
Chirality is one of the inherent characteristics of some objects in nature. In magnetism, chiral magnetic textures can be formed in systems with broken inversion symmetry and due to an antisymmetric magnetic interaction, known as Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI). Here, aiming for a fundamental understanding of this chiral interaction on the atomic scale, several synthetic layered structures composed of alternating atomic layers of 3d ferromagnetic metals epitaxially grown on the Ir(001) surface are designed. It is demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically that the atomistic DMI depends critically not only on the orbital occupancy of the interface magnetic layer but also on the sequence of the atomic layers. It is shown that even large atomistic DMI values can result in a small effective DMI, and conversely. Furthermore, the dependence of the effective DMI on the number of atomic layers deviates from a simple scaling law. These observations are attributed to the complexity of the electronic structure and the contributions of different orbitals to the hybridization and DMI. The results are&#160;anticipated to provide guidelines for achieving full control over both the chirality and the magnitude of the atomistic DMI in layered materials.

         <title>Fueling IgA&#8208;Dominated Humoral Immunity with an Intranasal Hybrid Tumor Vaccine to Opsonize and Strike Epithelial Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the authors confirm that breast cancer cells can directly bind with IgA, dependent on polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR)&#8208;mediated transcytosis function, modulating tumorigenic phenotype and antitumor response. To harness this biology, an intranasal tumor vaccine is designed, which can effectively combat primary and metastatic breast cancer through at least two independent mechanisms, including PIGR&#8208;IgA interaction and antigen recognition.








Abstract
Humoral immunity&#8208;cancer crosstalk has gained attention recently owing to its impact on tumor immune responses and therapy responsiveness. Here, it is shown that epithelial breast cancer cells can directly bind with non&#8208;antigen&#8208;specific IgA, dependent on polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR)&#8208;mediated transcytosis function, modulating tumoral inflammatory genes and sensitizing antitumor response. To harness this biology, a hybrid tumor vaccine is designed by covering the adjuvant&#8208;loaded cancer cell vesicles with a calcium phosphate shell, which retains the antigen information of the original tumor cells and exhibits robust mucosal adhesion in nasal tissues. Following intranasal vaccination, such a hybrid vaccine preferentially activates germinal center responses in nasal&#8208;associated lymphoid tissues and drives the production of tumoral antigen&#8208;specific IgA&#8208;dominated humoral immunity in both serum and lung through the property of &#8220;common mucosal immune system&#8221;, thus coordinating cellular immune responses to prevent lung colonization of IgA&#8208;opsonized breast cancer. In the inoperable and postoperative breast cancer model, intranasal vaccination with the hybrid vaccine also enables the amplification of the therapeutic benefits of local/systemic therapies. In summary, this work presents insights into the antitumor biology of IgA in epithelial breast cancer and explores a highly effective vaccine strategy focused on governing IgA&#8208;dominated humoral immunity to combat breast cancer, especially lung metastasis.

         <title>Multifunctional Hollow Carbon Microspheres Enable Superior Electromagnetic Wave Response and Corrosion Barrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow carbon microspheres with superior EM wave absorption and anti&#8208;corrosion capability have been produced. As results, a minimum reflection loss of &#8722;57.5 dB and an absorption bandwidth of 5.67 GHz are achieved. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that dual passivation effects provide a barrier to hinder the access of corrosive species to the substrate surface.








Abstract
Electromagnetic (EM) wave absorbing materials with corrosion barrier exhibit immense potential in meeting the requirements of electronic defense technology in the complex marine environments, but still confront conflicts in disentangling the trade&#8208;off of multifunctional applications. Herein, hollow carbon microspheres (HCMs) that simultaneously possess superior EM wave absorption and anti&#8208;corrosion capability have been produced with the aid of self&#8208;sacrificing templates. During the pyrolysis, the reductive characteristic of Zn microspheres and thermal driving force promote magnetic domain evolution, which enables optimized hetero&#8208;interface resonance and strong magnetic interactions, facilitating a minimum reflection loss lower than &#8722;40 dB and a wide absorption bandwidth greater than 5 GHz. Furthermore, HCMs&#8208;900 with both anion&#8208;repulsion characteristics and better resistance can partially reduce the adsorption/accumulation of corrosive species and decrease the charge&#8208;carrying ability, and the inevitably generated by&#8208;products of layered double hydroxides with strong anion&#8208;capture ability can hinder the access of corrosive species to the substrate surface, resulting in superior anti&#8208;corrosion capability. This innovative strategy inspires us with a motivated pathway for the rational design of advanced multifunctional anti&#8208;corrosive EM absorbing materials.

         <title>Water Oxidation to Hydrogen Peroxide Over a Super&#8208;Aerophilic Graphite Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design of super&#8208;aerophilic graphite catalyst capable of trapping in situ produced oxygen gas on its surface under the electrolyte environment. By so doing, it is able to moderate intermediate species&#160;binding, which is critical to enabling the two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction to hydrogen peroxide.








Abstract
Two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (2e&#8208;WOR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an attractive anode reaction with several merits. It can be paired with several large&#8208;scale cathode reactions that produce valuable chemical substances in an electrochemical cell. However, high&#8208;performing and reliable 2e&#8208;WOR anodic catalysts are yet to be fully developed. In this work, a rationally designed, inexpensive, robust, and selective graphite catalyst electrode is presented, made by following the key principle mechanisms of 2e&#8208;WOR. First, an aerophilic graphite&#8208;based electrode is created to leverage the challenges posed by the four&#8208;electron WOR, where&#160;the generated O2 from this reaction is kept onto the electrode surface to shift the O intermediates binding on graphite in the direction of improved H2O2 generation. An initial improvement in H2O2 selectivity of seven fold is observed, albeit with no improved H2O2 generation rates. The stunted H2O2 generation is ascribed to poor activity from pristine graphite, courtesy of less active sites and low intrinsic O2 binding in the electrolyte environment. Second, to improve and balance graphite's activity and selectivity, the structure of graphite is altered via different elemental doping (with N, S, B, and P atoms), a method that allows the retention of the O2 on the graphite surface. The super&#8208;aerophilic B&#8208;doped graphite catalyst (optimum) reaches a maximum Faraday efficiency (FE) of 60.6 &#177; 2.6% with a production rate of 26.7 &#177; 0.6 &#181;mol min&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 (85.9 &#177; 2.2 mA cm&#8722;2 partial current density) and excellent stability of over 120 h. In tandem, cathodic H2 co&#8208;production is demonstrated with an FE of above 90%. This approach demonstrates a rational approach to designing inexpensive and robust 2e&#8208;WOR anode catalysts for H2O2 and the possibility of its use in chemical co&#8208;production at the cathode.

Employing an acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A'&#8208;D&#8208;A)&#160;structural motif, single&#8208;component small&#8208;molecule mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors with ion&#8208;dependent ambipolarity are first developed for organic electrochemical transistors and inverters featuring ultrathin channel layers. Their outstanding figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit, remarkable voltage gains, and adaptability for ternary/quaternary logic operations signify significant advances in this field, highlighting their potential as versatile platforms for organic (bio)electronics with high sensitivity and high&#8208;density integration.








Abstract
Single&#8208;component, ultrathin ambipolar organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) combined with multivalued logic (MVL) circuits offer new opportunities for advancing next&#8208;generation bioelectronic systems due to their low&#8208;power consumption, manufacturing simplicity, and high&#8208;density integration, central to which is the evolution of ambipolar organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) as channel materials. However, small&#8208;molecule analogues remain unexplored to date for lack of well&#8208;defined molecular strategies. Herein, first two acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type vinyl&#8208;linked bis&#8208;diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;core ambipolar small&#8208;molecule OMIECs are developed featuring multiple conformational locks. It is discovered that grafting shortened glycolated sidechains produces stronger solid&#8208;state aggregation, tighter lamellar stacking, and higher crystallinity, consequently elevating the ambipolar &#181;C* figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit by over fourfold. Furthermore, the skillful manipulation of anionic species to facilitate oxidation doping enables significant increasement in p&#8208;type &#181;C* (170 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and a record&#8208;high n&#8208;type &#181;C* of 360 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, especially at a channel thickness of sub&#8208;10&#160;nm. Crucially, single&#8208;component OECT&#8208;based inverters constructed therefrom are for the first time demonstrated to accommodate ternary/quaternary logic, achieving a remarkable gain of 135&#160;V/V. This work not only provides an effective molecular design strategy for creating high&#8208;performing ultrathin&#8208;film ambipolar small&#8208;molecule OMIECs, highlighting ionic doping effect on ambipolarity, but also demonstrates their potential in MVL circuits for organic bioelectronics applications.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Topological/Ferroelectric Bi2Te3/SnSe Hetero&#8208;Memristor for In Situ Bionic&#8208;Visual Semi&#8208;Hardware Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining the advantages of two&#8208;dimensional (2D)two&#8208;dimensional ferroelectrics and 2D topological insulators, the Bi2Te3/SnSe hetero&#8208;memristor is constructed to achieve ultra&#8208;high and stable optoelectronic sensing characteristics. The device shows an average 0.25 &#181;W on/off power and 32 controllable conductive states. The semi&#8208;hardware neuromorphic system based on it achieved a 97.68% classification accuracy in low orbit satellite image recognition tasks.









Abstract
As the application of artificial vision systems continues to grow, developing efficient and low&#8208;power visual sensing devices has become a key challenge. Memristors offer tunable conductivity and integrated in&#8208;situ storage and computation functions, making them ideal for low&#8208;cost visual systems. However, most memristors currently face the dual challenges of poor stability and limited optoelectronic synaptic plasticity. Here, a Bi2Te2.7Se0.3/SnSe hetero&#8208;memristor is designed, which combines the advantages of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) topological insulators and 2D ferroelectric materials. The hetero&#8208;memristor performance can be tuned by the SnSe ferroelectric polarization and Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 topological surface state, which improve the utilization and mobility of carriers, thereby significantly improving the performance. The high 104&#8208;cycle stability, average 0.25 &#181;W on/off power, and 25 conductive states are achieved. Under different signals, the hetero&#8208;memristor can enable in situ light&#8208;electric conversion and successfully simulate various optoelectronic plasticity behaviors, such as paired&#8208;pulse facilitation, post&#8208;tetanic potentiation, spike rate&#8208;dependent plasticity, etc. Mean while, an efficient in&#8208;situ bionic&#8208;visual semi&#8208;hardware system is constructed based on the 28 &#215; 28 perception hetero&#8208;memristor array. This system efficiently performs satellite image recognition and classification, achieving an accuracy of 97.68%. The research shows that the Bi2Te2.7Se0.3/SnSe hetero&#8208;memristor is with&#160;excellent optoelectronic performances and broad application prospects, particularly in brain&#8208;like computing, smart hardware, and storage technologies.

The device shows an average 0.25 &#181;W on/off power and 32 controllable conductive states. The semi-hardware neuromorphic system based on it achieved a 97.68% classification accuracy in low orbit satellite image recognition tasks.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the application of artificial vision systems continues to grow, developing efficient and low-power visual sensing devices has become a key challenge. Memristors offer tunable conductivity and integrated in-situ storage and computation functions, making them ideal for low-cost visual systems. However, most memristors currently face the dual challenges of poor stability and limited optoelectronic synaptic plasticity. Here, a Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2.7&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;/SnSe hetero-memristor is designed, which combines the advantages of two-dimensional (2D) topological insulators and 2D ferroelectric materials. The hetero-memristor performance can be tuned by the SnSe ferroelectric polarization and Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2.7&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt; topological surface state, which improve the utilization and mobility of carriers, thereby significantly improving the performance. The high 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-cycle stability, average 0.25 &#181;W on/off power, and 2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; conductive states are achieved. Under different signals, the hetero-memristor can enable in situ light-electric conversion and successfully simulate various optoelectronic plasticity behaviors, such as paired-pulse facilitation, post-tetanic potentiation, spike rate-dependent plasticity, etc. Mean while, an efficient in-situ bionic-visual semi-hardware system is constructed based on the 28 &#215; 28 perception hetero-memristor array. This system efficiently performs satellite image recognition and classification, achieving an accuracy of 97.68%. The research shows that the Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2.7&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;/SnSe hetero-memristor is with&#160;excellent optoelectronic performances and broad application prospects, particularly in brain-like computing, smart hardware, and storage technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cloud Inspired White and Grey Plasmonic Metasurfaces for Camouflaged Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by clouds' role in Earth's thermal management, this work presents disordered plasmonic metasurfaces that mimic their radiative effects. The white metasurface enhances backscattering, acting as a cooling layer with camouflage properties. The grey state suppresses backscattering and enhances light trapping, surpassing conventional black absorbers. These metasurfaces enable advancements in camouflage, low&#8208;emissivity coatings, and thermal infrared stealth technologies.








Abstract
Inspired by nature's color&#8208;driven thermal regulation mechanisms and the atmospheric radiative effects of cloud&#8208;aerosol interactions, this work presents the design of disordered metasurfaces capable of achieving white and grey plasmonic colors. This innovation advances light and thermal management technologies within the framework of stealth and camouflage applications. The white plasmonic metasurfaces emulate the cooling effects of clouds, reducing substrate temperatures by a relative &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C under standard solar illumination through backscattering. In contrast, transitioning to a grey state with a nanocomposite absorber suppresses backscattering and enables efficient light trapping, resulting in a relative +10 &#160;&#176;C temperature increase compared to conventional black absorbers. These findings introduce a novel approach to localized thermal management, distinct from traditional passive cooling strategies that rely on high&#8208;emissivity materials. The metasurfaces&#8217; low&#8208;emissivity properties and visible appearance open opportunities in advanced camouflage, stealth technologies, and thermal energy solutions. Additionally, the scalable, sustainable design, realized through all&#8208;in&#8208;chamber nanofabrication via sputtering, eliminates the need for chemically intensive synthesis methods while ensuring long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Fluorogen&#8208;Activating Human Serum Albumin for Mitochondrial Nanoscale Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorogen&#8208;activating HSA engineered via confinement fluorescence enhances brightness, minimizes phototoxicity, and achieves superior cell permeability for nanoscale mitochondrial imaging. Co&#8208;crystal structure reveals HSA immobilizes the fluorophore in hydrophobic cavities via &#945;&#8208;type binding, restricting torsional motions for high quantum yields. Theoretical calculations elucidate excited&#8208;state dynamics. AmpHecy@HSA enables low&#8208;phototoxicity super&#8208;resolution mitochondrial imaging in living cells, expanding fluorogenic toolkit for mitochondrial science.








Abstract
Fluorescence nanoscopy of living cells employs contrast agents to reveal intrinsic correlations between mitochondrial dynamics and functions at the molecular level. However, regular mitochondrial fluorophores usually present poor photostability, low brightness, non&#8208;specific inhibitory effects, high phototoxicity, and rapid photobleaching, which have hindered the use of these tools to capture the intricate dynamic features of mitochondria. Herein, we engineered a fluorogen&#8208;activating protein (FAP), AmpHecy@HSA, a non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly of HSA and amphiphilic hemicyanine (AmpHecy) fluorophore, with exceptional cell permeability, long&#8208;lasting photostability, high brightness/fluorogenicity, and minimal phototoxicity. Crystallography and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy techniques were combined to elucidate the structural and mechanistic intricacies of fluorescence activation. These findings revealed that fluorophore photoactivation happens through the molecular conformation&#8208;induced intramolecular charge transfer, whose kinetics is mainly determined by the hydrophobic interaction between the fluorophore and nearby amino acids. This aligns with classical molecular dynamics simulations and excited&#8208;state conformation quantum mechanics. It was further demonstrated that AmpHecy@HSA can be used for super&#8208;resolved images of mitochondria within living cells without apparent phototoxicity. This work expands the fluorescent toolkit based on FAP engineering for studying live&#8208;cell mitochondrial morphology and function, advancing the fields of chemistry and biomedicine.

         <title>Artesunate Nanoplatform Targets the Serine&#8211;MAPK Axis in Cancer&#8208;Associated Fibroblasts to Reverse Photothermal Resistance in Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The artesunate nanoplatform selectively targets ECM CAF, functioning as a GTPase inhibitor through disruption of intracellular serine homeostasis. This metabolic intervention effectively suppresses MAPK cascade activity, which consequently inhibits PTT&#8208;induced CAF to ECM CAF differentiation. By attenuating this phenotypic transition, the nanoplatform significantly reduces the formation of TRB structure, ultimately enhancing tumor sensitivity to PTT.








Abstract
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a pivotal role in inducing photothermal therapy (PTT) resistance of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC), but with unclear mechanism. Herein, aminoethyl anisamide&#8208;modified nano&#8208;biomimetic low&#8208;density lipoprotein (A&#8208;aLDL) is used to target deliver the PTT agent and artesunate (ARS) to both CAFs and cancer cells. Though CAFs are sensitive to PTT and notably transition to heat&#8208;resistant phenotype, the formed protective barrier is destroyed by ARS. Subsequently, the outstanding anti&#8208;tumor effects are achieved through PTT in multiple models with such kind of combination therapy. Interestingly, the mechanism is discovered that serine metabolism plays a major role in CAF resistance through spatially omics. ARS disrupts serine homeostasis, thereby attenuating the cascade activity of GTPases in MAPK pathway. Meanwhile, MAP2K7 is the most potential target for sensitizing PTT. By integrating ARS with PTT agents, the serine&#8208;MAPK axis in CAFs is successfully modulated, thereby overcoming PTT resistance in TNBC therapy.

         <title>Organic AIE Nanoradiosensitizer Potentiates X&#8208;Ray Triggered Continuous Reactive Oxygen Species Generation for Potent Cancer Radioimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a glutathione&#8208;responsive system (named THN) is prepared for X&#8208;ray&#8208;triggered sustained ROS generation for efficient antitumor immunotherapy. The double&#8208;promoting ROS generation of THN induced massive immunogenic cancer cell death and polarized M2 macrophages into the M1 phenotype for enhanced antitumor immunotherapy. Experiments revealed that THN&#8208;sensitized RT inhibited post&#8208;surgery tumor recurrence and increased memory T&#8208;cell proportion for long&#8208;term antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Organic radiosensitizers (ORSs), with structural versatility, hold promise for sensitizing radiotherapy (RT) by interacting with X&#8208;ray photons to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). They often consist of low&#8208;Z elements that have inherently low X&#8208;ray deposition capability. However, current ORSs suffer from short circulation half&#8208;lives and low tumor retention, contradicting their requirements for sustained ROS generation upon RT in tumor sites. Herein, a glutathione&#8208;responsive system is prepared, loaded with aggregation&#8208;induced emission molecules (TPEPy&#8208;I) and Ferriprotoporphyrin IX chloride (Hemin), to act as an ORS (named THN) for X&#8208;ray triggered sustained ROS generation for efficient antitumor immunotherapy. In detail, THN effectively deposited X&#8208;ray photons, which interact with water molecules to generate abundant ROS under external radiation. Subsequently, THN&#8208;mediated radiosensitization stimulated tumor cells to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by upregulating NOX4 protein, promoting the chemodynamic process of Hemin reacting with H2O2 to continuously produce hydroxyl radicals. The double&#8208;promoting ROS generation of THN induced massive immunogenic cancer cell death and polarized M2 macrophages into the M1 phenotype for enhanced antitumor immunotherapy. Experiments revealed that THN&#8208;sensitized RT inhibited tumor recurrence and increased memory T&#8208;cell proportion for long&#8208;term antitumor immunity. The developed ORS has great clinical potential as both a radiosensitizer and a post&#8208;RT immunomodulatory agent.

Subsequently, THN-mediated radiosensitization stimulated tumor cells to produce hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by upregulating NOX4 protein, promoting the chemodynamic process of Hemin reacting with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to continuously produce hydroxyl radicals. The double-promoting ROS generation of THN induced massive immunogenic cancer cell death and polarized M2 macrophages into the M1 phenotype for enhanced antitumor immunotherapy. Experiments revealed that THN-sensitized RT inhibited tumor recurrence and increased memory T-cell proportion for long-term antitumor immunity. The developed ORS has great clinical potential as both a radiosensitizer and a post-RT immunomodulatory agent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Materials Evolution by Programmed Twisting: a DNA&#8208;Inspired Ultrastrong Supercoiled Conformational Fiber for Energy&#8208;Storage and Buffering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the supercoiled conformational structures and behaviors of the DNA chain, a material evolution strategy via supercoiled conformational fibers (SCFs) is proposed to achieve a number of extra&#8208;ordinary properties/functions, including pseudo&#8208;entropic elasticity, high&#8208;performance torsional energy&#8208;storage, stimulus&#8208;triggered energy release, impact buffering, and self&#8208;reinforcement.








Abstract
The conformational folding/unfolding behaviors of DNA supercoils serve as a fundamental mechanism governing ultradense bio&#8208;information storage and precise genetic transcription. Mimicking those nanoscale dynamic conformational behaviors for macroscopic materials to achieve unusual functionalities will be of great interest but remains unexplored. Herein, a DNA&#8208;inspired materials evolution paradigm is presented to create multifunctional supercoiled conformational fibers (SCFs) by programmed twisting controlled self&#8208;buckling. Through the programmed twist&#8208;stress modulation, a low&#8208;density polyethylene strip is transformed into high&#8208;performance DNA&#8208;like SCF through a unique multiscale microstructure evolution process. This DNA&#8208;like SCF exhibits five hallmark characteristics unattainable before, including ultra&#8208;large elastic deformability (900 &#177; 50%), metal&#8208;level mechanical strength (330 &#177; 30&#160;MPa), unprecedented torsional energy&#8208;storage density (16.1 &#177; 0.6&#160;kJ&#160;kg&#8722;1), torsional energy release upon appropriate stimulations, and impact buffering through conformation&#8208;mediated energy&#8208;dissipation. Characterization reveals that these unexpected energy&#8208;related properties mainly are contributed by the multiscale twisting&#8208;reinforced microstructures and conformation mechanics. Potential applications of the SCFs are demonstrated finally by harvest&#8208;and&#8208;storage of wind energy and soft&#8208;landing. The DNA&#8208;like SCFs indicate a general platform for materials evolution with extraordinary mechanics and functions.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Polymer Brushes Enables Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Battery Stable Operation under Ultra&#8208;Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional polymer brush (G&#8208;pGMAAQ) is fabricated through molecular engineering strategies. G&#8208;pGMAAQ can act as a redox mediator to reduce the polysulfides conversion energy barriers, and its unique polar brush structure effectively inhibits polysulfides shuttling and homogenizes lithium&#8208;ion fluxes, enabling lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries for stable operation from &#8722;40 to 70&#160;&#176;C.









Abstract
Achieving stable operation under a wide temperature range is a critical target for the practical applications of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. However, intense lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttling at high&#8208;temperature, sluggish sulfur species conversion, and inhomogeneous Li+ deposition at low&#8208;temperature severely impair the cycle lifespan of batteries. Herein, the multifunctional polymer brushes are fabricated by grafting anthraquinone&#8208;functionalized poly(glycidyl methacrylate) brushes on graphene surfaces (G&#8208;pGMAAQ) to simultaneously regulate the evolution of sulfur and lithium species. Combining theoretical calculations and experiments, it is revealed that G&#8208;pGMAAQ serves as a redox mediator that reduces the LiPSs conversion energy barrier, and its unique polar brush&#8208;like structure effectively inhibits LiPSs shuttling and homogenizes Li+ flow. Hence, G&#8208;pGMAAQ facilitates lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries stable operation in an ultra&#8208;wide temperature range (&#8722;40&#8211;70&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell achieves an energy density of 417&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, demonstrating the commercial potential of polymer brushes for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Achieving Tunable Amplified Spontaneous Emission in Rb&#8208;Cs Alloyed Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskites with Low Threshold and Exceptional Spectral Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rb&#8208;Cs alloyed quasi&#8208;2D perovskites with low&#8208;threshold ASEs and exceptional spectral stability are synthesized. Tuning Rb&#8208;Cs ratio enables broad ASE tunability across blue and green regions. Alloying optimizes the inter&#8208;well energy transfer and suppresses Auger recombination, yielding a record&#8208;low ASE threshold, &#8776;50% lower than mixed&#8208;halide perovskites. Their micro&#8208;ring laser arrays exhibit high Q&#8208;factors and low thresholds, showcasing superior lasing performance.








Abstract
Blue&#8208;green lasers are essential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics. While GaN&#8208;InGaN lasers offer excellent performance, their complex fabrication and challenges in precise bandgap tuning remain significant limitations. Hybrid lead halide perovskites present a promising alternative, with tunable bandgaps and cost&#8208;effective solution processing. However, halide migration in these materials causes spectral instability and luminescence shifts under operational conditions. Here, a novel class of Rb&#8208;Cs alloyed quasi&#8208;2D perovskites is introduced that achieve both low amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) thresholds and exceptional spectral stability. By precisely tuning the Rb&#8208;Cs ratio, it realizes ASE across the blue&#8208;green spectrum (481&#8211;532&#160;nm). Rb&#8208;Cs alloying critically modulates the quantum well distribution, optimizes the energy landscape, and suppresses Auger recombination, resulting in a record&#8208;low ASE threshold of 1.94 &#181;J&#183;cm&#8722;2&#8212;over 50% lower than that of mixed&#8208;halide perovskites. These materials exhibit remarkable spectral robustness, with ASE spectra remaining stable even after prolonged thermal annealing, thereby overcoming halide migration&#8208;induced degradation. Furthermore, micro&#8208;ring laser arrays fabricated from these Rb&#8208;Cs alloyed perovskites demonstrate superior lasing characteristics, including high&#8208;quality whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode resonances and low lasing thresholds, underscoring their potential for advanced laser technologies.

         <title>Suppressing Metal Dissolution in Multi&#8208;Grained Catalysts Through Intragrain Atomic Ordering for Stable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel approach room&#8208;temperature ultrasound assisted atomic ordering method using to fabricate multi&#8208;grained NiPt nanoalloys with an intermetallic Ni3Pt5 phase. The resulting catalyst exhibits state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art durability and activity in all operational condition of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Structural and electrochemical analyses reveal direct the role of atomic ordering in mitigating metal dissolution, ensuring long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Rational design of catalytic nanomaterials is essential for developing high&#8208;performance fuel cell catalysts. However, structural degradation and elemental dissolution during operation pose significant challenges to achieving long&#8208;term stability. Herein, the development of multi&#8208;grained NiPt nanocatalysts featuring an atomically ordered Ni3Pt5 phase within intragrain is reported. Ultrasound&#8208;assisted synthesis facilitates atomic transposition by supplying sufficient diffusion energy along grain boundaries, enabling unprecedented phase formation. The Ni3Pt5 embedded nanocatalysts exhibit outstanding proton exchange membrane fuel cell performance under both light&#8208;duty and heavy&#8208;duty vehicle conditions, with significantly reduced Ni dissolution. Under light&#8208;duty vehicle conditions, the catalyst achieves a mass activity of 0.94 A&#160;mgPt&#8722;1 and a 421 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current density (@ 0.8 V in air), retaining 78% of its initial mass activity after long&#8208;term operation. Under heavy&#8208;duty vehicle conditions, the multi&#8208;grained nanocrystal demonstrates only an 8% decrease in Pt utilization, a 5% power loss, and a 13 mV voltage drop, surpassing U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)&#160;durability targets. This study underscores the critical role of the atomically ordered Ni3Pt5 phase in stabilizing multi&#8208;grained NiPt nanocrystals, enhancing both durability and catalytic activity. These findings establish Ni3Pt5 embedded nanocatalysts as promising candidate for next&#8208;generation PEMFC applications, addressing key challenges in long&#8208;term operation.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a 421 mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; current density (@ 0.8 V in air), retaining 78% of its initial mass activity after long-term operation. Under heavy-duty vehicle conditions, the multi-grained nanocrystal demonstrates only an 8% decrease in Pt utilization, a 5% power loss, and a 13 mV voltage drop, surpassing U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)&#160;durability targets. This study underscores the critical role of the atomically ordered Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pt&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; phase in stabilizing multi-grained NiPt nanocrystals, enhancing both durability and catalytic activity. These findings establish Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pt&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; embedded nanocatalysts as promising candidate for next-generation PEMFC applications, addressing key challenges in long-term operation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Ultrathin Membrane with Bubble&#8208;Raft&#8208;Inspired Single&#8208;Layer Nanofibrous Networks for Efficient and Low&#8208;Resistance Air Filtration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bubble&#8208;raft&#8208;inspired nanofibrous network membrane for efficient and low&#8208;resistance air filtration is fabricated via electrospinning and phase separation. Benefiting from the single&#8208;layer polysulfone nanofibrous network (&#8776;40 nm fiber diameter), the obtained membrane exhibits integrated structural features of small pore size, high porosity, and ultrathin thickness, which endows it with high filtration efficiency, low pressure drop, and high transparency.








Abstract
Airborne particulate matter (PM) is a major global safety concern, significantly straining the ecological environment, human health, and economy. Filtration membranes, essential for PM removal, are challenging in achieving both high efficiency and low air resistance, resulting in a high pressure drop during efficient filtration. Herein, inspired by bubble rafts, an ultrathinnanofibrous network membrane is fabricated by transforming a liquid film of polysulfonesolution on electrospun fibrous scaffold into a single&#8208;layer network via nonsolvent&#8208;induced phase separation. Tailoring of the polysulfone concentration in the liquid film supported by the scaffold and of the phase separation process induced by flowing nonsolvent allows the construction of the single&#8208;layer network with interconnected nanofibers (diameter of &#8776;40&#160;nm). Benefiting from the single&#8208;layer network, the membrane exhibits a small pore size (&#8776;270&#160;nm) at a high porosity of 90.3% and ultrathin thickness of &#8776;800&#160;nm. Consequently, the membrane shows high efficiency (99.8% removal of PM0.3) at an ultralow pressure drop (&lt;40&#160;Pa). Moreover, the membrane exhibits high transparency (&gt;83%) and allows the light breeze (wind speed of 3.2 m s&#8722;1) to pass through easily, enabling energy&#8208;efficient applications, such as window screens. This work provides new insights into designing membranes for efficient and low&#8208;resistance filtration and separation.

         <title>Magnetic Moment Descriptor&#8208;Guided Multifunctional Co Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Enable Wide&#8208;Temperature Uninterrupted Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of CoN4&#8208;X configurations are screened using density functional theory (DFT) simulations through second coordination sphere anion modulation (X = B, O, F, P, S, Cl). The magnetic moment is revealed as a critical descriptor for establishing dual volcano&#8208;type correlations with both chloride ion (Cl&#8722;) adsorption energy and Gibbs free energy of reaction&#8208;related intermediates.








Abstract
Developing chloride ion&#8208;resistant trifunctional catalysts is imperative and of great significance for application in renewable energy&#8208;driven seawater splitting systems (S&#8208;WSS). However, there is currently a lack of unified descriptors for the rational design of catalysts that possess both high corrosion resistance and excellent catalytic activity. Herein, the magnetic moment is proposed as the descriptor through second&#8208;coordination&#8208;shell anion engineering of CoN&#8324; moieties (named as CoN4&#8208;X, X = B/O/F/P/S/Cl). Systematic density functional theory calculations reveal that precisely modulating the spin states of CoN&#8324; centers via X&#8208;anion coordination establishes dual volcano&#8208;type relationships between magnetic moments and the adsorption energetics of Cl&#8315; ions or key reaction intermediates for oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, and hydrogen evolution reactions (ORR/OER/HER). Experimental validation demonstrates the optimized CoN&#8324;&#8208;B configuration&#8208;based catalyst (Co SAs&#8208;N/B&#8208;HCS) achieves minimized Cl&#8315; adsorption energy while delivering exceptional trifunctional ORR/OER/HER activity, as well as excellent stability in chloride ion&#8208;rich seawater&#8208;based environments (over 1000 h for seawater&#8208;based Zn&#8208;air batteries, over 800 h for seawater splitting). Notably, the Co SAs&#8208;N/B&#8208;HCS enables temperature&#8208;adaptive hydrogen production rates of 853 &#181;mol h&#8315;&#185; (60&#160;&#176;C), 616 &#181;mol h&#8315;&#185; (25&#160;&#176;C), and 397 &#181;mol h&#8315;&#185; (&#8722;30&#160;&#176;C). This work establishes a spin state engineering paradigm that simultaneously addresses catalyst corrosion and trifunctional synergy in marine energy systems.

By leveraging the faster kinetics and lower overpotential of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), hydrogen&#8208;coupled charging enables the zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) to achieve ultra&#8208;fast and stable cycling performance with superior safety, which positions hydrogen aided battery&#160;(HAB) as a promising solution for electric vehicles to address challenges such as range anxiety and prolonged charging times.








Abstract
Rechargeable metal&#8211;air batteries, despite their high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness, suffer from sluggish cathodic reaction kinetics, resulting in high overpotential and low energy efficiency. In this study, a hydrogen&#8208;aided battery (HAB) based on zinc&#8211;air battery (ZAB) technology, which retains the discharge process of ZAB while introducing hydrogen gas into the cathode during charging, is proposed. The introduction of hydrogen replaces the conventional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), significantly enhancing the electrochemical performance of ZAB. Leveraging the faster kinetics and lower overpotential of HOR, the hydrogen&#8208;coupled charging enables ultra&#8208;fast and stable charging (9 s to 1 mAh cm&#8722;2) with over 200 cycles. Compared to lithium&#8208;ion batteries and fuel cells, HAB exhibits superior safety by eliminating the need for flammable electrolytes and portable hydrogen storage devices. The simultaneous &#8220;refueling&#8221; of hydrogen and electricity offers rapid energy replenishment, positioning HAB as a transformative technology for electric vehicles to address key challenges such as range anxiety and prolonged charging durations. This work not only advances the performance of metal&#8211;air batteries but also provides an innovative strategy for integrating hydrogen energy into electrochemical systems.

         <title>Porogen&#8208;Integrated Rapid Oxidation Enables Structured Mesoporous Metal Oxide Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porogen&#8208;integrated rapid oxidation (PiRO) is a method for high throughput manufacturing of mesoporous metal oxide thin films. PiRO generates up to 500 nm thick layers with through&#8208;plane 5&#8211;10 nm spheroidal close&#8208;packed pores at 230&#160;&#176;C in 30 min or less. The reduced temperatures enable deposition on both rigid and flexible polymeric substrates using roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll compatible techniques.









Abstract
Structured metal oxide films have promise in optoelectronics, sensing, energy storage, and catalysis but their uptake is predominately limited due to their long and high&#8208;temperature syntheses. Here, a self&#8208;assembling polymer is used which can act as a chelating fuel source in a solution combustion reaction to generate highly structured mesoporous aluminum oxide films at &lt;250&#160;&#176;C in a matter of minutes through a process termed porogen&#8208;integrated rapid oxidation (PiRO). The resulting films with thicknesses up to 500 nm show an open&#8208;cell, face&#8208;centered cubic structure of spheroidal pores. Further, an additional ligand can be included to control the self&#8208;assembly step to yield both through&#8208;film ordering or tunable disordering for increased pore volume as confirmed by both grazing incidence small angle X&#8208;ray scattering and ellipsometry. Finally, roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturing with PiRO is demonstrated on flexible polymeric substrates. The method offers a tunable, scalable, low&#8208;temperature, and lower&#8208;cost method to generate large&#8208;area structured mesoporous metal oxide films.

Here, a self-assembling polymer is used which can act as a chelating fuel source in a solution combustion reaction to generate highly structured mesoporous aluminum oxide films at &amp;lt;250&#160;&#176;C in a matter of minutes through a process termed porogen-integrated rapid oxidation (PiRO). The resulting films with thicknesses up to 500 nm show an open-cell, face-centered cubic structure of spheroidal pores. Further, an additional ligand can be included to control the self-assembly step to yield both through-film ordering or tunable disordering for increased pore volume as confirmed by both grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering and ellipsometry. Finally, roll-to-roll manufacturing with PiRO is demonstrated on flexible polymeric substrates. The method offers a tunable, scalable, low-temperature, and lower-cost method to generate large-area structured mesoporous metal oxide films.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Broad Range of Aromatic Carboxylic Acids for Photocatalytic Methane Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>

Machine learning identifies key spectroscopic features of aromatic carboxylic acids that enable selective photocatalytic oxygen activation and oxidation of CH&#8324; to methyl trifluoroacetate.








Abstract
Photocatalytic methane (CH&#8324;) activation under mild conditions presents a sustainable strategy for converting methane into valuable chemicals. This study introduces a versatile class of conjugated aromatic carboxylic acids as efficient, metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for CH&#8324; oxidation in sodium chloride&#8208;trifluoroacetic acid (NaCl&#8208;TFA) media. Spectroscopic analysis and machine learning using spectroscopic features further elucidate key structural and electronic factors influencing catalytic activity, offering predictive insights for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts. The carboxyl group is important in generating electron&#8208;deficient carboxyl (RC(&#9552;O)O&#8226;) or carboperoxyl radicals (RC(&#9552;O)OO&#8226;), enabling selective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) for CH&#8324; functionalization. Mechanistic investigations indicate the role of acyl chloride intermediates in enhancing reactivity. This work highlights the potential of aromatic carboxylic acids to address the challenges of methane functionalization, paving the way for greener chemical transformations and the utilization of inert feedstocks in sustainable chemistry.

         <title>Bioinspired Heterogeneous Spheres with Tunable Helical Structure for Accurate and Efficient Control of Sugar Blood Level</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the morphology and helical motion of Phacus helicoides, millimeter sized spheres with an inner helical structure are designed. Phacus helicoides can &#8216;mix&#8217; their surrounding medium which facilitates the acquirement of nutrients from the environment and the excretion of metabolites into the environment. Similar to Phacus helicoides, HSs can generate mixing performance under magnetic field, which led to the enhancement toward the adsorption, catalyze, and release capacities of HSs.








Abstract
Oral antidiabetic drugs remain the primary therapeutic strategy for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to its convenience, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and non&#8208;invasive, while achieving glycemic control in &gt;60% of patients. However, compromised bioavailability of oral antidiabetic drugs frequently leads to drug&#8208;induced hypoglycemia (sulfonylureas like glibenclamide), posing significant clinical risks. To address this issue, microstirring oral pills are designed but various challenges remain, including uncontrollable release and low biocompatibility. Here, inspired by the morphology and helical motion of Phacus helicoides, millimeter&#8208;sized spheres with an inner helical structure are designed. Owing to their inner spiral structure, helical spheres (HSs) can simultaneously self&#8208;rotate and move circularly, giving them excellent and controllable mixing capacity via an external magnetic field. Moreover, HSs can imitate metabolic processes, including the adsorption, catalysis, and release capacity of Phacus helicoides, which can effectively reduce postprandial blood glucose levels (&lt;2&#160;h) in rats with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, these novel microstirring oral spheres with inner helical structure can reduce the incidence of hypoglycemia (14.2&#8208;18.6%) of the traditional sulfanilamide drug (glibenclamide) to 3.8%. Thus, it is anticipated that HSs have a potential for drug delivery as microstrring oral pills to improve bioavailability and avoid the drug&#8208;induced hypoglycemia of T2DM patients.

         <title>High Performance P&#8208;Channel Transistor Based on Amorphous Tellurium Trioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a breakthrough in p&#8208;channel transistors by transforming crystalline 2D tellurium into amorphous tellurium trioxide (a&#8208;TeO3) via UV&#8208;O3 treatment. This transformation enhances electronic properties, resulting in transistors with reduced hysteresis, superior on/off characteristics, and low barrier height, highlighting the potential of a&#8208;TeO3 as a novel semiconductor for future advancements in transistor technology.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance p&#8208;channel transistors remains a critical challenge in complementary logic circuits, despite significant advances in n&#8208;channel transistor technologies. While amorphous oxide semiconductors have revolutionized n&#8208;type transistors, achieving comparable performance for p&#8208;type counterparts has proven elusive. Here, this study demonstrates a breakthrough in p&#8208;channel technology by transforming crystalline 2D tellurium (2D&#8208;Te) into amorphous tellurium trioxide (a&#8208;TeO3) through UV ozone treatment. This structural transformation, directly observed via high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, induces dramatic changes in electronic properties, including significant bandgap widening and enhanced work function. The resulting a&#8208;TeO3&#8208;based p&#8208;channel transistors demonstrate remarkable improvements over crystalline 2D&#8208;Te transistors, featuring reduced hysteresis, superior on/off characteristics, and distinctive mobility behavior at different temperatures and gate fields. Most notably, these transistors achieve exceptionally low barrier height (10 meV) and sheet resistance values, while combining high hole mobility with excellent switching properties. The work not only introduces a novel high&#8208;performance p&#8208;channel semiconductor but also opens new avenues for phase engineering in advanced semiconductor development.

         <title>Synthetic Chromatophores for Color and Pattern Morphing Skins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cephalopods use chromatophore organs (muscle&#8208;actuated pigment sacs) to alter their skin color and pattern. Synthetic chromatophores, which closely mimic the mechano&#8208;optical process found in cephalopods using stimuli&#8208;responsive microscale hydrogel actuators, are reported. Hierarchical organization and morphological control of these synthetic chromatophores enable inherently stretchable skins with color and pattern morphing capabilities and rapid response times.








Abstract
The dynamic optical and mechanical properties of cephalopod skin cannot be mimicked using traditional display technologies. Soft materials (and systems thereof) have the potential to realize cephalopod&#8208;like color switching capabilities synthetically. This report describes the fabrication of stretchable arrays of microstructured, stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels, &#8220;synthetic chromatophores,&#8221; that emulate the mechano&#8208;dynamic action of color change found in cephalopods. By combining multiple layers of these synthetic chromatophores, soft skins with color and pattern morphing capabilities that leverage halftone absorption, optical interference, and microlensing are demonstrated. These skins, made entirely of soft materials, are inherently stretchable and can be programmed to respond to specific environmental stimuli, making them well&#8208;suited for applications in soft robotics and human&#8208;machine interfaces.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Bioinspired Rechargeable Cement&#8208;Based Batteries for Low&#8208;Carbon Self&#8208;Powered Buildings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired conifer&#8208;like rechargeable cement&#8208;based batteries for low&#8208;carbon self&#8208;powered buildings is reported. This direction pore structure enhances ionic conductivity by four times (32.7 mS cm&#8722;1), while maintaining high mechanical strength (41.6 MPa). The cement&#8208;based battery delivers a remarkable capacity of 114 mAh g&#8722;1 and retaining 63.2% of capacity after 300 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1.








Abstract

         <dc:description>
Utilizing net charges of NPs in nonpolar solvent, dielectrophoretic attraction and Coulombic modulation are combined to achieve distinct particle densities at oppositely charged surfaces. This selective assembly enables efficient submicron&#8208;scale separation of NP mixtures and forms complex binary NP patterns in one step, offering a powerful and direct route for assembling and integrating multiple NPs into advanced multifunctional nanodevices.








Abstract
Precise nanofabrication of diverse nanoparticles (NPs) with high spatial resolution is crucial for developing advanced nanodevices. While various bottom&#8208;up approaches have been developed, limitations such as complex overlay steps, contamination risks, and low spatial resolution still exist. Here, an approach is presented for sub&#8208;micron spatial resolution nanopatterning of binary NPs. By utilizing net charges of NPs dispersed in nonpolar solvent, dielectrophoretic attraction and sign&#8208;dependent Coulombic modulation are combined to achieve distinct particle densities at oppositely charged surfaces. This selective assembly enables efficient separation of NP mixtures at submicron scales, facilitating the formation of complex binary NP patterns in a single step. The technique offers a powerful and direct route for assembling and integrating multiple NPs, providing a new way for advanced multifunctional nanodevices.

         <title>Guiding Polaritonic Energy and Momentum Through 2D Bravais Lattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The monolayer MoS2 based Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot microcavity is used to form polaritons. The directional flow control of polaritonic energy and momentum is facilitated by designing five types of 2D Bravais lattices based on PMMA nanopillars, which are fabricated on top of monolayer MoS2, as demonstrated through angle&#8208;resolved reflectance measurements. The unique ability to control exciton&#8208;polariton dispersion will advance its applications in photonics and quantum technologies.








Abstract
Controlling polariton dispersion facilitates the study of various new physical phenomena, such as Bose&#8208;Einstein condensation, polariton lasing, and coherent quantum fluid dynamics, with manual control remaining an area of ongoing exploration. In this work, monolayer MoS2 based Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot microcavity is used to form polaritons. Five types of Bravais lattices based on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) nanopillars are intentionally designed. The energy overlap between the periodic PMMA scattering wave and the polariton establishes a coupling channel that controls the directional flow of polaritonic energy, as demonstrated through angle&#8208;resolved reflectance measurements. Back&#8208;space image measurements further demonstrate that the dispersion in reciprocal space can be directly and manually tuned, allowing for control over their number and their positions. The coupling between the polariton and PMMA scattering wave is further demonstrated by analyzing the reflectance using temporal coupled&#8208;mode theory. The symmetries of 2D Bravais lattices allow the angle between energy and momentum flow to vary widely, and the position of the dispersion branch in a specific direction can be fine&#8208;tuned via lattice constant, enabling full&#8208;range control over polariton dispersion. This work presents the first theoretical and experimental demonstrations of guiding the direction of polaritonic energy and momentum through Bravais lattice design.

         <title>Highly Efficient Cooling via Synergistic Electro&#8208;Thermal Phase Changes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Featuring low energy consumption and easy integration with modern electronic, electrocaloric polymer is a highly promising alternative to vapor&#8208;compression systems. Here, the synergistic electro&#8208;thermal phase change methodology boosted the performance of electrocaloric materials, achieving a dramatic temperature drop in simulated electronic chip cooling. This methodology opened up a new way for enhancing the entropy change of electrocaloric materials.








Abstract
Electro&#8208;phase change materials (electro&#8208;PCM), based on the electrocaloric effect, have attracted significant attention and achieved rapid development in the field of cooling technology owing to their environmental protection, low energy consumption, and miniaturization. However, due to their limited isothermal entropy change and thermal conductivity, the cooling capacity of the electro&#8208;PCM devices has severely limited their cooling effect on electronic devices. Here, with the synergistic electro&#8208;thermal phase changes, the entropy change and thermal conductivity of electro&#8208;PCM are significantly improved by stacking it with thermo&#8208;phase change materials (thermo&#8208;PCM). Compared with that of the electro&#8208;PCM, the entropy change and thermal conductivity of electro&#8208;thermal phase change materials (ETPCM) stack can be up to 4.68&#8208;fold (from 28.31 to 132.35 J kg&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at electric field of 100 MV m&#8722;1) and 2.39&#8208;fold (from 0.18 to 0.43&#160;W m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1), respectively. The practicality of this strategy has also been fully validated by cooling a simulated electronic chip (1.75&#160;W cm&#8722;2) with a temperature drop of 49.32 K after constructing ETPCM stack&#8208;based cooling device using the electrostatic actuation prototype. The synergistic enhancement of entropy change and thermal conductivity paves the way for the future direction of electrocaloric cooling toward interdisciplinary fusion.

         <title>Responsive Metasurface for Directional Control of Laser and Thermal Emission Dynamic Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multispectral&#8208;responsive metasurface simultaneously modulates directional laser reflection and dynamic infrared emissivity, enabling robust dual&#8208;band camouflage and dual&#8208;modal anti&#8208;counterfeiting. By synergistically integrating spatial and spectral control, this approach greatly expands capabilities for manipulating multiple physical parameters, providing a versatile approach for advanced information encryption, holography, and thermal management applications in complex scenarios.









Abstract
Responsive metasurfaces can efficiently control the propagation and spectral properties of electromagnetic (EM) waves, emerging as an attractive technology in energy and information fields. However, achieving non&#8208;interference manipulation of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser wavelength and mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) region with spatial and spectral responsive capabilities is a challenging and long&#8208;sought task for applications, such as multispectral adaptive camouflage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Here, a multispectral responsive metasurface is demonstrated that enables independent modulation of MIR thermal emission while maintaining robust, spatially directional control of NIR laser reflections. This metasurface simultaneously achieves superior ultralow specular reflectivity of 0.049 (0.8&#8211;1.2 &#181;m) and high thermal emission regulation capability of 0.51 (8&#8211;13 &#181;m), attributed to NIR reflection splitting and a photonically amplified metal&#8208;insulator transition, respectively. The metasurface's exceptional capability to realize temperature&#8208;invariant NIR laser and dynamic MIR camouflage is experimentally proved under significant fluctuating thermal environments, superior to existing laser&#8208;IR&#8208;compatible camouflage technologies. Dual&#8208;mode information anti&#8208;counterfeiting is further demonstrated through independent channels for detection angles and temperature responses. This work provides a new pathway for stimulus&#8208;responsive materials with spatial and spectral modulation toward diverse multispectral application scenarios.

This metasurface simultaneously achieves superior ultralow specular reflectivity of 0.049 (0.8&#8211;1.2 &#181;m) and high thermal emission regulation capability of 0.51 (8&#8211;13 &#181;m), attributed to NIR reflection splitting and a photonically amplified metal-insulator transition, respectively. The metasurface's exceptional capability to realize temperature-invariant NIR laser and dynamic MIR camouflage is experimentally proved under significant fluctuating thermal environments, superior to existing laser-IR-compatible camouflage technologies. Dual-mode information anti-counterfeiting is further demonstrated through independent channels for detection angles and temperature responses. This work provides a new pathway for stimulus-responsive materials with spatial and spectral modulation toward diverse multispectral application scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>All&#8208;Dielectric Ultra&#8208;Broadband Microwave Absorbing Aerogel with Optimized Dielectric Dispersion via Dielectric Relaxation Time Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating fluorinated graphene into MXene aerogels, hydrogen bonding, and interfacial charge separation extend the dielectric relaxation time, enabling ultrathin (2.54 mm), lightweight (34.4 mg cm&#8315;3) all&#8208;dielectric broadband microwave absorption (9.08 GHz) due to the optimized dielectric dispersion law. The composite also delivers high compressive strength, rapid Joule heating, and excellent thermal insulation.








Abstract
The limited conceptual understanding and lack of effective techniques for optimizing dielectric dispersion continue to hinder the development of all&#8208;dielectric broadband microwave&#8208;absorbing materials (MAMs) with minimal thickness. In this study, a strong theoretical correlation between dielectric relaxation time and dielectric dispersion behavior is established by applying the ideal dielectric dispersion law in conjunction with Debye theory. This led to a strategic approach aimed at extending the relaxation time to optimize dielectric dispersion and achieve broadband microwave absorption without incorporating magnetic components. To realize this, fluorinated graphene (FG) is engineered to stack with MXene nanosheets, resulting in the fabrication of MXene/fluorinated graphene/cellulose nanofibers (MXene/FG/CNFs) aerogels. This configuration significantly extended the dielectric relaxation time of interfacial dipoles from 9.2&#160;ps in MXene/CNFs to 19.5&#160;ps in MXene/FG/CNFs aerogels, corresponding to a fluorine content of 35% in FG. This extension is attributed to increased interfacial dipole moments from strong electronic delocalization induced by highly electronegatively fluorine atoms. The improved structure yield progressively optimized dielectric dispersion, resulting in a maximum effective absorption bandwidth (EABmax) of 9.08&#160;GHz at a thickness of 2.54&#160;mm and a low density of 34.4&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;3. Moreover, the hybrid aerogel also exhibited fascinating Joule heating, thermal insulation, and compressive strength.

         <title>Liquid Bridges Mediate Crack Initiation, Propagation, and Coalescence to Suppress Film Failure within Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold films deposited on capillary&#8208;stabilized fluidic cushion of ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;infused nanopillar arrays show enhanced stability under large strains (&#8764; 180%) by effective control, mediated through liquid bridges, of film cracking progress, combined with exceptional strain&#8208;responsive sensitivity of resistance change by the cracking mechanism, this strategy offers a fluid&#8208;mechanics&#8208;based approach for robust wearable devices and soft robotic systems operating under extreme mechanical deformation.








Abstract
Recent flexible electronics with conformal interfaces between devices and human bodies are prone to receive circuit failure caused by uncontrollable cracking during physiological movements. A structural engineering strategy is reported that utilizes capillary&#8208;stabilized liquid bridges to spontaneously mediate crack initiation, propagation, and coalescence for film reinforcement. Specifically, rigid nanowire array are decorated onto flexible polydimethylsiloxane substrates and the nanoscale gaps between the nanowires are filled with non&#8208;volatile ionic liquids to form well&#8208;regulated meniscus. Using metal films as a model, it is found that stretchability of an Au film deposited on this meniscus exceeds that of its flat counterpart (180 vs 30%). In&#8208;situ optical observations and fluid dynamics analyses show that liquid bridge forces mechanically hinder the propagating of crack fronts and simultaneously initiate new cracks in different locations, leading to dispersed small cracks at strains below 80%. This scattering of cracks prevents the concentrated propagation and merging of cracks into penetrating fractures, with effective electrical percolation of Au films even under a high strain of 160%, which contrasts sharply with the counterparts without liquids where penetrating cracks occur at a small strain of &#8776;10%. Results indicate fluid mechanics as a versatile approach to reprogram film cracking for high&#8208;performance electronics.

         <title>Time&#8208;Frequency Domain NO2&#8208;Humidity Sensor with Full&#8208;Range Tolerance Based on Pt Single&#8208;Atom Sensitized Nb2CTx Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a dual&#8208;mode NO2&#8208;humidity sensing platform based on Pt single&#8208;atom sensitized Nb2CTx nanosheets, enabling simultaneous high&#8208;performance time&#8208;domain NO2 and frequency&#8208;domain humidity sensing. Through elucidation of the resistance&#8208;capacitance orthogonal sensing mechanism and integration of PCB circuits with machine learning, the platform implements humidity localization, humidity&#8208;corrected NO2 alarms, and asthma pre&#8208;warning.









Abstract
Real&#8208;time in situ detection of NO2 is crucial for ensuring industrial safety and healthcare. However, conventional gas sensors face challenges from environmental humidity interference, limiting their reliability in practical applications. This study presents a dual&#8208;mode, full&#8208;range NO2&#8208;humidity sensing platform based on Pt single&#8208;atom&#8208;sensitized Nb2CTx nanosheets (Pt SA&#8208;Nb2CTx) integrated with TPU fiber mats (Pt SA&#8208;Nb2CTx@TPU). Combining resistive gas sensing and capacitive humidity sensing within a single device, this platform enables simultaneous NO2 and humidity detection with full&#8208;range humidity tolerance. The uniformly dispersed Pt single&#8208;atoms on the Nb2CTx nanosheets catalyze oxygen molecule dissociation and provide additional surface&#8208;active adsorption sites, achieving a 9.1&#8208;fold improvement in resistance response to 5&#160;ppm NO2 and a 25.7&#8208;fold increase in capacitance response at 95% relative humidity. Importantly, the unaffected capacitive response allows precise calibration of NO2 concentration using resistance and capacitance, ensuring accurate NO2 detection across diverse and fluctuating humidity. Leveraging time&#8208; and frequency&#8208;domain NO2&#8208;humidity sensing capability, the Pt SA&#8208;Nb2CTx@TPU sensor is successfully integrated into self&#8208;designed functional modules to realize humidity tracking, industrial NO2 concentration alarming in full&#8208;humidity range as well as asthma prevention and alarm applications. This study offers a novel solution for humidity&#8208;compensated NO2 detection, advancing the applicability of gas sensors in complex and dynamic environments.

         <title>Roll&#8208;To&#8208;Roll Twisted Aerogel Yarns with Reinforced Structure and Low Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aerogels have exceptional thermal insulation properties, but often exhibit less satisfactory mechanical properties in textile applications. This issue is addressed by processing aerogel particles into continuous macroscopic yarns based on a roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll format through a twist&#8208;induced fibrillation method using 2D nanofiber membranes as mediators. The resulting aerogel yarns show high strength, ideal flexibility, and impressive thermal insulation properties.








Abstract
Aerogels have been considered as super thermal insulators. However, they often exhibit less satisfactory mechanical properties for textile application due to their fragility and poor processability. These problems are overcome through a twisting&#8208;induced fibrillation method, using 2D nanofiber membranes as mediators, to process aerogel particles into continuous macroscopic yarns based on a roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll format. A low concentration of strong nanofiber host in twisted form provides structural support to the aerogel particles and preserves their porous architecture. Despite the high&#8208;volume ratio (&#8776;78%) of aerogel particles, the aerogel yarns show high strength, ideal flexibility, and impressive thermal insulation properties. Textiles woven with the aerogel yarns are warmer than cashmere. The aerogel textile is extremely stable under temperatures of &#8722;196 and 100&#160;&#176;C, mechanical deformation, and even washing. This technology provides a flexible platform to extend the function (e.g., dyeability, hydrophobicity, and Joule heating) of aerogel yarns and textiles to suit various use scenarios.

This technology provides a flexible platform to extend the function (e.g., dyeability, hydrophobicity, and Joule heating) of aerogel yarns and textiles to suit various use scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D&#8208;Architectured Acceptor with High Photoluminescence Quantum Yield and Moderate Crystallinity for High&#8208;efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Low Voltage Loss</title>

Strategic embedding of 3D norbornene units in fused&#8208;ring acceptors suppresses excessive aggregation, synergistically boosting photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and achieving a record&#8208;breaking power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.4% and an extremely low voltage loss (Vloss) of 0.548 V in organic solar cells.








Abstract
This study outlines a molecular design approach that entails integrating 3D structural motifs into the central core or terminal groups of fused&#8208;ring acceptor molecules, specifically, LLZ1, LLZ2, and LLZ3&#8211;by incorporating a 3D architecture unit of norbornene. The objective is to modulate the aggregation behavior of these molecules by modifying their molecular structure, thereby enhancing the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) values of the acceptor materials and reducing the non&#8208;radiative recombination voltage loss in the corresponding devices. Our research findings demonstrate that the introduction of norbornene units effectively suppresses excessive molecular aggregation and significantly improves the PLQY values of the acceptor molecules. Further research has demonstrated that only the acceptor molecule LLZ1, characterized by both high PLQY and moderate crystallinity, can strike an optimal balance between the dual requirements of reducing voltage loss and enhancing charge transport in the device. Utilizing the preferred molecule LLZ1, we achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.0% in binary system and 20.4% in ternary device with much&#8208;reduced voltage loss of 0.508V, which is among the highest values of current OSCs. In summary, this work provides novel insights and research directions for the development of OSCs with low voltage loss and high PCE.

         <title>Increasing the Stability of Deep Blue Phosphor&#8208;Sensitized OLEDs Using the Polariton&#8208;Enhanced Purcell Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polariton&#8208;enhanced Purcell (PEP) effect is demonstrated to enhance the stability of the deep blue phosphor&#8208;sensitized fluorescent (PSF) OLEDs by 3.1 X compared to PSF diodes lacking this effect. In addition, PSF&#8208;OLEDs exhibit reduced EQE roll&#8208;off and deep blue color emission. The PEP effect maximally extends PSF&#8208;OLED lifetimes in devices with the highest triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet energy transfer rates. This work suggests that the benefits of PEPs apply to all triplet&#8208;based OLEDs.









Abstract
The stability of efficient, deep blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) remains a major challenge in the field of organic electronics. Poor device stability originates from the high probability for destructive non&#8208;radiative triplet exciton annihilation events. Phosphor&#8208;sensitized fluorescence (PSF) is proposed to achieve an efficient, deep blue color by energy transfer from phosphors to fluorophores. Recently, the polariton&#8208;enhanced Purcell (PEP) effect is introduced to decrease the triplet radiative lifetime and density, resulting in an increase in blue phosphorescent OLED lifetime. Here, the PEP effect is introduced to enhance the stability of the PSF&#8208;OLEDs. It is shown that the PEP effect increases all radiative decay rates of the phosphors and fluorophores, leading to a reduction in the triplet annihilation events. Using a Pt&#8208;complex phosphor sensitizer and a so&#8208;called multi&#8208;resonance fluorescent emitter in a PEP cavity, a 3.1&#8208;fold lifetime increase is observed at a current density of J = 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, reduced EQE roll&#8208;off and deep blue color with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates of (0.13, 0.09). The PEP effect maximally extends PSF&#8208;OLED lifetimes in devices with the highest triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet energy transfer rates. Moreover, this work suggests that the benefits of PEPs apply to all triplet&#8208;based OLEDs.

         <title>Hair&#8208;Like Mechanoluminescent Structures with Ultralow Activation Threshold for Dynamic Force Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanoluminescence microcilia array film with a bionic hair&#8208;like structure achieves an ultralow activation threshold of just 10&#160;mN&#8212;the lowest reported to date&#8212;enabled by stress concentration. With excellent sensitivity to dynamic mechanical stimuli, mechanoluminescence&#8208;derived texture discrimination and Braille recognition with high accuracy is demonstrated for the first time via integration with an image&#8208;based machine learning approach.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML)&#8208;based sensing technology opens up new opportunities for photonic/electronic skin due to their self&#8208;powered nature, visible spatial mapping of mechanical stimuli, and intrinsic responses to dynamic forces. However, challenges such as weak brightness and high activation threshold have hindered their development. Inspired by hair&#8208;like structures of human skin, skin&#8208;bionic mechanoluminescent PDMS/ZnS:Cu microcilia array film (MLMCA) is fabricated using a magnetic field&#8208;assisted template method. The MLMCA exhibits tunable aspect ratios and ML intensity, with the underlying relationship between microcilia structure and ML performance clarified through finite element analysis. The MLMCA achieves an ultralow activation threshold at the micronewton level (&#8776;10 mN) owing to the stress concentration induced by high aspect ratio. With excellent sensitivity to dynamic mechanical stimuli, the MLMCA enables texture recognition with an accuracy of 99.95% when integrated with the image machine learning approach. Furthermore, an ML&#8208;based Braille&#8208;to&#8208;speech translation system is developed and achieved a high recognition accuracy of 96.74%. This study not only tackles the persistent limitation of high activation thresholds in ML&#8208;based sensing but also pioneers the practical use of ML&#8208;based tactile sensing in texture discrimination and Braille reading.

A broadband, self&#8208;powered photodetector is developed by integrating Cl&#8208;substituted 2D perovskites with MoS2/WSe2 heterostructures via interface engineering. The device enables weak&#8208;light detection down to 0.54&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2, offering enhanced carrier transport and photogating effects. This strategy highlights a general approach to boosting the performance of 2D material&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;weak light detection represents a critical enabling technology for next&#8208;generation imaging, remote monitoring, and autonomous systems, where efficient charge transfer is essential to achieve ultralow detection thresholds. Herein, an interfacial lattice&#8208;distortion engineering strategy is proposed by selectively substituting phenylethyl ammonium (PEA) cations with 4&#8208;chlorophenylethylammonium (Cl&#8208;PEA) at perovskite heterointerfaces. This substitution induces beneficial octahedral distortions, boosting hole transport efficiency in few&#8208;layer 2D perovskites by 26%. When integrated with MoS2/WSe2 heterostructures, the optimized van der Waals contact and enhanced energy&#8208;level alignment yield a high&#8208;performance photodetection, including a responsivity of 2.7 &#215; 104 A/W, a detectivity up to 5.26 &#215; 1014&#160;Jones, and an exceptionally low noise equivalent power of 0.42&#160;fW&#160;Hz&#8722;1/2. Notably, the device operates self&#8208;powered at incident power densities as low as 0.54&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2, enabling real&#8208;time, on&#8208;chip image processing even under dim&#8208;light conditions. This functionality is further utilized for noise reduction in traffic&#8208;light images prior to object detection with YOLOv11 network, establishing a direct bridge between device&#8208;level photodetection and machine&#8208;learning&#8208;driven recognition. This interfacial lattice distortion engineering paradigm in van der Waals&#8208;contacted 2D devices opens new avenues for designing ultrasensitive, low&#8208;noise, and functionally integrated optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Liver&#8208;Targeted Tolerogenic Vaccines: A Nano&#8208;Membrane Coupled Approach for Autoimmune Disease Therapies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tolerogenic vaccine based on a membrane&#8208;nanoemulsion is developed to specifically target hepatic antigen&#8208;presenting cells. These cells recognize signals such as phosphatidylserine on the membrane; while, reducing the expression of costimulatory molecules. This contributes to a deficiency in T cell activation signals and induces multiple subsets of regulatory T cells and regulatory B cells, protecting against autoimmune tissue damage.









Abstract
The co&#8208;delivery of auto&#8208;antigens and immunomodulators for tolerance induction holds great potential in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. However, their efficacy in enriching antigens within target cells remains limited, and the use of immunomodulators poses a risk for systemic immunosuppression. Here, an apoptotic erythrocyte&#8208;derived membrane is developed for the first time, demonstrating its strong abilities to target hepatic antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) and stimulate negative regulatory pathways. These apoptotic cell membranes are engineered onto the surface of intravenous lipid emulsions encapsulating disease&#8208;associated antigens to generate a tolerogenic vaccine. This nano&#8208;membrane coupled structure facilitates robust antigen loading, efficient liver delivery, and uptake by hepatic APCs; while, concurrently downregulating the expression of costimulatory molecules to promote immune tolerance. Intravenous administration of this tolerogenic vaccine induces multiple regulatory cell subpopulations, particularly IL&#8208;10 secreting T cells, regulatory B cells, and memory regulatory T cells, collectively conferring effective protection against celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes in murine models. More importantly, it is demonstrated that this vaccine induces antigen&#8208;specific immune tolerance without compromising the normal immune responses to other antigens. The findings provide solid support for the application of this hepatic APCs&#8208;targeted tolerogenic vaccine as a versatile and translatable platform for combating autoimmune diseases.

         <title>Breaking the Reversibility Barrier in Zn&#8208;Air Systems With Dual&#8208;Electrolyte Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A separated Zn&#8208;air system is proposed to suppress hydrogen evolution and dendrites via dual&#8208;electrolyte architecture, resolving anode passivation and cathodic catalyst degradation. Integrating iodine redox chemistry enables low&#8208;voltage charging and aligns energy storage with other sustainable and green applications. 








Abstract
In response to the escalating demand for advanced energy storage solutions and the pursuit of safer, more sustainable alternatives to conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries, addressing the reversibility and stability challenges of Zn anodes in Zn&#8208;air batteries has become imperative. To tackle these issues, particularly under alkaline conditions, a unique separated Zn&#8208;air system (SZAS) is demonstrated. This system conducts the charging process in a near&#8208;neutral electrolyte, significantly suppressing hydrogen evolution reactions and dendrite growth while discharging occurs in an alkaline electrolyte to maximize voltage output. This design effectively addresses passivation layer formation and prolongs cathode lifespan by preventing catalyst deactivation and element loss during high&#8208;voltage oxygen evolution reactions (OER). The SZASs demonstrate a 99.84% Coulombic efficiency over 5000 cycles in nearly neutral electrolytes and a discharging energy density reaching 218&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in alkaline electrolyte, showing promise in advanced energy storage techniques. Additionally, replacing OER with iodine oxidation reaction reduces charging voltage to 1.5&#160;V and achieves a 3.7&#160;V output via serial discharging. This work proposes the separation engineering of battery architectures, integrating benefits from diverse electrolyte environments, and paves the way for aligning advancements in energy storage, waste management, material recycling, and sustainable power solutions for electric vehicles.

         <title>Breaking Apoptosis&#8208;Induced Immune Silence: Ultrasound&#8208;Activated Nano&#8208;Oncolytic Therapy Reinvigorates Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasound (US)&#8211;activated nano&#8208;oncolytic system, cRGD&#8208;Lip@PFP is introduced, which induces necroptosis&#8208;like oncolytic cell death. This method triggers the explosive release of DAMPs and activates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, resulting in a more potent antitumor immune response than conventional apoptosis&#8208;based therapies. This innovative strategy markedly enhances tumor immunogenicity and remodels immunosuppression to effectively improve the efficacy of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Conventional tumor therapies typically depend on the apoptotic pathway, which often leads to inadequate immunogenicity. This limitation underscores the urgent need for innovative treatments that enhance immunogenicity. In this study, an ultrasound (US)&#8208;activated nano&#8208;oncolytic system (designated as cRGD&#8208;Lip@PFP), is presented and consists of nanoliposomes (Lip) modified with the cRGD peptide for targeted tumor delivery. This system features a perfluoropentane (PFP) core that undergoes US&#8208;triggered acoustomechanical effects, enabling controlled expansion from nanoscale to microscale, ultimately leading to rupture and the generation of cavitation effects. Intracellular cavitation further induces necroptosis&#8208;like oncolytic cell death. The efficacy of various treatments in stimulating immune responses is systematically compared and it is demonstrated that the nano&#8208;oncolytic system effectively enhances the release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Additionally, the release of DNA fragments activates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, resulting in an amplified immune response. Furthermore, this nano&#8208;oncolytic system alleviates the hypoxic tumor microenvironment and counteracts immunosuppression. Compared to traditional apoptosis, the necroptosis&#8208;like oncolytic cell death induced by this strategy exhibits enhanced immunogenicity. This approach presents an innovative paradigm for tumor immunotherapy based on acoustomechanical effects, offering a promising alternative to tackle the issue of insufficient immunogenicity often associated with conventional apoptosis therapies.

         <title>Anchoring Nickel and Stabilizing Oxygen in Coherent LiNiO2@LiFePO4 Composite Cathode Materials for Rechargeable Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LiNiO2@LiFePO4 composite material with coherent combination exhibits remarkable cyclability, rate capability and high first&#8208;cycle Coulombic efficiency. The coherent oriented channels favor the reversible and rapid lithium&#8208;ion transport with suppressed strain accumulation while phosphate anions anchored on the LiNiO2 surface stabilizes Ni sites, mitigating surface degradation.








Abstract
LiNiO2 is an appealing cathode material for Li&#8208;ion batteries because of high energy density and low cost but suffers from irreversible phase transition and surface instability. Herein, a ball&#8208;milled LiNiO2@LiFePO4 composite with oriented coherent combination is reported with enhanced structural stability and Li+ diffusion. The coherent oriented channels are demonstrated to favor the reversible and rapid Li+ intercalation during the H2&#8208;H3 phase transition, which significantly alleviates structural strain accumulation. The covalent P&#9472;O bonds anchored on the LiNiO2 surface stabilizes the Ni sites, mitigating surface reconstruction and lattice oxygen loss. The LiNiO2@LiFePO4 cathode exhibits a specific capacity of 210 mAh g&#8722;1 and an initial Coulombic efficiency of 93.7% at 0.1 C, along with a remarkable rate capability of 156 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C. Furthermore, the full cells pairing LiNiO2@LiFePO4 cathode and graphite anode deliver a considerable energy density over 280 Wh kg&#8722;1 and a remarkable capacity retention. This study offers an effective approach of phosphate coalesce to upgrade high&#8208;capacity nickel&#8208;rich oxide cathode materials.

         <title>Fluorine&#8211;Mediated Interfacial Microenvironment for Boosting pH&#8211;Universal CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni species (single atoms and atomic clusters) are successfully anchored onto fluorocarbon substrates (FC), forming a highly efficient and stable CO2RR electrocatalyst. The optimized Ni/FC exhibits excellent FECO in acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. More importantly, Ni/FC can maintain excellent FECO while operating at industrial currents density for 3000&#160;h. Mechanistic studies reveal that the high&#8211;electronegativity of F will cause the formation of a positive C&#948;+ center, which inhibits the adsorption of hydrogen and elevates the dissociation energy barrier of interfacial water, thereby suppressing the competitive HER process.








Abstract
Achieving highly efficient and stable conversion of carbon dioxide&#160;reduction reaction (CO2RR) into value&#8208;added chemicals at industrial current density is crucial but challenging due to its complex gas&#8211;solid&#8211;liquid interface. Here the local microenvironment of three&#8211;phase interface is successfully regulated to boost the CO2RR performance of Ni species in the universal pH range by introducing the highly electronegative F. The optimized Ni/FC achieves high&#8211;performance in converting CO2 to CO with Faraday efficiencies (FEs) over 90% in pH&#8211;universal conditions, while the main product of Ni/C is H2, especially under acidic conditions. Significantly, it can steadily operate at a high current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 3000&#160;h in a broad pH range, outperforming most recently reported CO2RR electrocatalysts. Detail in situ experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the presence of highly electronegative F will cause the formation of a positive C&#948;+ center, which inhibits the adsorption of hydrogen and increases the dissociation energy barrier of interfacial water, thereby suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work highlights the importance of regulating the local microenvironment of interfacial water, providing a new perspective in the field of electrocatalysis for suppressing competitive HER.

         <title>Neuron&#8208;Inspired Ferroelectric Bioelectronics for Adaptive Biointerfacing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovative ferroelectric bioelectronics (FerroE) that integrate neuron&#8208;preferred flexible and topographical properties and neuron&#8208;similar behaviors enable seamless integration and adaptive communication with both Peripheral Nervous System and Central Nervous System. These neuron&#8208;like interface materials and bioelectronics that possess indistinguishable features from neurons, will open new opportunities for next&#8208;generation brain&#8211;machine interfaces, tissue engineering materials, and biomedical devices.








Abstract
Implantable bioelectronics, which are essential to neuroscience studies, neurological disorder treatment, and brain&#8211;machine interfaces, have become indispensable communication bridges between biological systems and the external world through sensing, monitoring, or manipulating bioelectrical signals. However, conventional implantable bioelectronic devices face key challenges in adaptive interfacing with neural tissues due to their lack of neuron&#8208;preferred properties and neuron&#8208;similar behaviors. Here, innovative neuron&#8208;inspired ferroelectric bioelectronics (FerroE) are reported that consists of biocompatible polydopamine&#8208;modified barium titanate nanoparticles, ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) copolymer, and cellular&#8208;scale micropyramid array structures, imparting adaptive interfacing with neural systems. These FerroE not only achieve neuron&#8208;preferred flexible and topographical properties, but also offer neuron&#8208;similar behaviors including highly efficient and stable light&#8208;induced polarization change, superior capability of producing electric signals, and seamless integration and adaptive communication with neurons. Moreover, the FerroE allows for adaptive interfacing with both peripheral and central neural networks of mice, enabling regulation of their heart rate and motion behavior in a wireless, non&#8208;genetic, and non&#8208;contact manner. Notably, the FerroE demonstrates unprecedented structural and functional stability and negligible immune response even after 3 months of implantation in vivo. Such bioinspired FerroE are opening new opportunities for next&#8208;generation brain&#8211;machine interfaces, tissue engineering materials, and biomedical devices.

         <title>Reward Driven Workflows for Unsupervised Explainable Analysis of Phases and Ferroic Variants From Atomically Resolved Imaging Data</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reward&#8208;driven workflows enable fully unsupervised segmentation of atomically resolved STEM images, revealing phases and ferroic variants without any labels. By encoding domain&#8208;wall straightness and length as explicit rewards, the method automatically tunes clustering and variational&#8208;autoencoder hyperparameters. This physics&#8208;guided optimization yields robust, real&#8208;time mappings of polarization and structural domains for next&#8208;generation autonomous microscopy.








Abstract
Rapid progress in aberration corrected electron microscopy necessitates development of robust methods for the identification of phases, ferroic variants, and other pertinent aspects of materials structure from imaging data. While unsupervised methods for clustering and classification are widely used for these tasks, their performance can be sensitive to hyperparameter selection in the analysis workflow. In this study, the effects of descriptors and hyperparameters are explored on the capability of unsupervised ML methods to distill local structural information, exemplified by the discovery of polarization and lattice distortion in Sm &#8722; dopped&#8197;BiFeO3 (BFO) thin films. It is demonstrated that a reward&#8208;driven approach can be used to optimize these key hyperparameters across the full workflow, where rewards are designed to reflect domain wall continuity and straightness, ensuring that the analysis aligns with the material's physical behavior. This approach allows the discovery of local descriptors that are best aligned with the specific physical behavior, providing insight into the fundamental physics of materials. The reward driven workflow is further extended to disentangle structural factors of variation via an optimized variational autoencoder (VAE). Finally, the importance of well&#8208;defined rewards is explored as a quantifiable measure of the success of the workflow.

         <title>Anomalous Phonon Softening with Inherent Strain in Wrinkled Monolayer WSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces the first discovery of a new local strain indicator, A2&#8242;&#8242;(&#915;)$A_2^{^{\prime\prime}}( \Gamma )$ mode, for monolayer WSe2&#8208;based excitonic applications including single photon emitter by using tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy. The correlative investigation with density functional perturbation theory provides the origin of the anomalous appearance of A2&#8242;&#8242;(&#915;)$A_2^{^{\prime\prime}}( \Gamma )$ mode, as well as the applicability for strain engineering.








Abstract
Local deformation is a control knob to dynamically tune the electronic band structure of 2D semiconductors. This study demonstrates the local strain&#8208;dependent phonon properties of monolayer tungsten diselenide, which are investigated by using the scanning tunneling microscopy&#8208;based tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy. The anomalous appearance and softening of the Raman&#8208;inactive out&#8208;of&#8208;plane A2&#8242;&#8242;(&#915;)$A_2^{^{\prime\prime}}( \Gamma )$ mode are first revealed, which exhibits equivalent behavior to other principal phonons of tungsten diselenide. Local strain calculations unveiled the linear proportionalities of A2&#8242;&#8242;(&#915;)$A_2^{^{\prime\prime}}( \Gamma )$ phonon nature on strain and it facilitates the derivation of Gr&#252;neisen parameter by experimental and theoretical approaches. Additionally, the origins of the anomalous appearance of the Raman&#8208;inactive A2&#8242;&#8242;(&#915;)$A_2^{^{\prime\prime}}( \Gamma )$ mode are clearly proved in both classical physics and quantum mechanics. Especially quantum mechanical calculations have precisely described strain&#8208;induced selection rule relaxation by polarizability changes. The first discovery provides a fundamental understanding of the strain&#8208;dependent phonon properties, as well as suggesting a new distinct strain indicator, A2&#8242;&#8242;(&#915;)$A_2^{^{\prime\prime}}( \Gamma )$ mode, for strain engineering.

         <title>Dendritic Cell&#8208;Based Biohybrid Immunomodulator Alleviates Intestinal Inflammatory Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based biohybrid immunomodulator to alleviate intestinal inflammation. The biohybrid immunomodulator is engineered by conjugating resolvin E1&#8208;loaded liposomes with Fas ligand (FasL)&#8208;transfected DCs. The immunomodulator effectively reduces inflammation by selectively eliminating Fas+CD8+ T cells and neutrophils, showing efficient therapeutic potential in both mouse and rabbit models of IBD. This study presents a feasible and customizable strategy for mitigating intestinal inflammation, offering a promising advancement in the treatment of IBD.








Abstract
Inflammation is a key driver of intestinal inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While biologics have demonstrated notable success in treating some patients, there remains a critical need for alternative therapeutic strategies to address primary and secondary non&#8208;responders. In this study, a dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based biohybrid immunomodulator is developed to alleviate intestinal inflammation, demonstrating remarkable efficacy in combating IBD. This biohybrid immunomodulator is engineered by conjugating resolvin E1&#8208;loaded liposomes with Fas ligand (FasL)&#8208;transfected DCs. Elevated Fas expression is observed in intestinal tissue samples from IBD patients, and the immunomodulator effectively reduced inflammation by selectively eliminating Fas+CD8+ T cells and neutrophils. The therapeutic potential of this approach is validated in both mouse and rabbit models of IBD, where it exhibites significant anti&#8208;inflammatory effects. Furthermore, the immunomodulator can be manufactured using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bone marrow&#8208;derived DCs, demonstrating a robust capacity to induce T cell apoptosis. This study presents a feasible and customizable strategy for mitigating intestinal inflammation, offering a promising advancement in the treatment of IBD.

         <title>Selective Electrosynthesis of Methanol from CO2 Over Cu/Cu2P2O7 Via the Formate Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu/Cu2P2O7&#8208;based hybrid catalyst delivers over 50% Faradaic efficiency and &gt;100 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 partial current density for methanol electrosynthesis from CO2. The synergy between Cu (111) facets and Cu2P2O7 promotes HCOOH&#8208;mediated pathways, offering a scalable route for sustainable liquid fuel production.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to methanol offers an eco&#8208;friendly approach to reducing carbon emissions while producing versatile liquid fuels and feedstocks. However, achieving high selectivity for methanol, especially at high current densities, remains challenging due to competing reactions that favor methane and hydrogen formation. Here, the tailored synthesis of Cu/Cu2P2O7&#8208;based hybrid catalysts is reported for efficient and selective methanol production through the discharge of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The catalyst exhibits a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 50% in both H&#8208;cells and gas&#8208;diffusion electrode cells, achieving one of the highest reported methanol partial current densities of over 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Experimental and computational analyses reveal a synergistic effect between Cu nanoparticles with a predominant (111) surface and Cu2P2O7 nanoparticles, which enhances selective methanol production via the HCOOH intermediate pathway. These findings provide insights into designing cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for selective methanol production.

         <title>Microscopic&#8208;Level Anion &amp; Diluent Chemistry in Electrolyte for Aqueous Supercapacitors Operating at High Voltage and Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscopic&#8208;level anion &amp; diluent chemistry strategy is proposed to develop an advanced Ca(ClO4)2/H2O&#8208;acetonitrile (AN) electrolyte that can operate at high voltage and low temperature. The weak interaction of H2O with ClO4&#8722; guarantees strong intramolecular O&#9472;H bonds and resulting electrolyte stability. The AN serves as a solvation diluent capable of weakening electrostatic Ca2+&#8208;ClO4&#8722; attraction, preventing salt precipitation, and finally yielding a high&#8208;performance supercapacitor.








Abstract
Aqueous supercapacitors, serving as safe and green high&#8208;power energy storage devices, hold significant potential in various applications. Exploring advanced electrolytes beyond traditional electrolytes is essential for achieving stable high&#8208;voltage and low&#8208;temperature operations. Herein, a hybrid electrolyte with a high electrochemical stability window (3.29&#160;V) and sufficient ionic conductivity (1.5 mS cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C) is developed via hybridizing 8 m Ca(ClO4)2/H2O with acetonitrile (AN) diluent. The charged Ca2+ cations anchor the oxygen atoms in H2O molecules, preventing them from being hydrogen acceptors. Meanwhile, the ClO4&#8722; anions weakly interact with hydrogen atoms, which ensures strong intramolecular O&#9472;H bonds in 8 m Ca(ClO4)2/H2O. The used AN can contribute to decreased salt dosage, without any compromise to electrochemical stability and safety. Furthermore, the AN with a higher donor number than ClO4&#8722; can replace the ClO4&#8722; in Ca2+ solvation sheaths, which reduces Ca2+&#8722;ClO4&#8722; clusters, accordingly suppressing salt precipitation even at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C. Resultantly, a symmetric supercapacitor assembled with 4.2 m Ca(ClO4)2/H2O&#8208;AN electrolyte presents high&#8208;voltage and temperature&#8208;adaptability features, with excellent rate capability and high long&#8208;term cycling stability from 25 to &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C at 2.3&#160;V.

         <title>Interface Topology Driven Loss Minimization in Integrated Photonics: THz Ultrahigh&#8208;Q Cavities and Waveguides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compact, robust, and ultralow&#8208;loss on&#8208;chip photonic devices are essential for densely integrated photonic chips. Here, the underlying radiation mechanism in topological valley edge states is unveiled and a new methodology of interface topology driven bandgap and wavevector engineering is proposed to thoroughly suppress their radiation losses, thereby unleashing their full potential for robust, low&#8208;power, and densely integrated photonic chips.









Abstract
Compact, robust, and ultralow&#8208;loss on&#8208;chip photonic devices are essential for densely integrated photonic chips. Conventional designs struggle to achieve these properties due to their inherent trade&#8208;offs among compactness, robustness, and low loss. Topological valley photonic crystals (VPCs) offer a promising solution, as their valley&#8208;vortex&#8208;protected edge states are capable of robustly guiding light through sharp bends and structural perturbations with negligible loss. Notably, exhaustive control over all loss channels is crucial for minimizing undesired losses. However, the intrinsic loss mechanisms in valley edge states remain largely unexplored, severely limiting their full potential. Here, we unveil that radiation is the dominant&#160;loss mechanism in valley edge states and propose a new methodology of interface topology driven bandgap and wavevector engineering to thoroughly suppress their radiation losses in chip&#8208;scale waveguides and cavities. The methodology minimizes the radiation losses of topological cavities by &#8776;104&#8208;fold through readily tailoring interface geometry without compromising their compactness, ultimately achieving a measured loaded Q&#8208;factor of 31231.2 in the terahertz (THz) frequency regime. Furthermore, the enhanced Q&#8208;factor significantly strengthens light&#8208;matter interactions, enabling efficient spectral modulation with ultralow&#8208;power photoexcitation. These findings enable topological VPCs to realize ultra&#8208;compact and ultralow&#8208;loss devices across diverse frequencies, unleashing their full potential for robust, low&#8208;power, and densely integrated photonic chips.

The MXene derived&#8208;TiO2 and high&#8208;entropy alloy heterojunction can effectively enhance the oxygen evolution reaction kinetics with solar energy assistance, reducing the charging potential of zinc&#8211;air batteries and improving the charge&#8211;discharge efficiency.









Abstract
Photo&#8208;assisted zinc&#8211;air batteries have garnered significant attention for applying solar energy to decrease the charge voltage and improve energy efficiency. However, the uniform and rapid synthesis of highly active, stable, and low&#8208;cost photoelectrocatalysts for zinc&#8211;air batteries remains a significant challenge. Herein, a pulsed laser method is reported for the rapid preparation of MXene&#8208;derived TiO2/high&#8208;entropy alloy heterojunctions (M&#8208;TiO2/HEAs) as photoelectrocatalysts. Benefiting from the exceptional photo&#8208;thermal conversion capability of MXene, the local temperature reaches up to 2800&#160;K under laser irradiation, along with ultra&#8208;fast heating and cooling rates (&#8776;106&#160;K&#160;s&#8722;1), enabling the successful synthesis of M&#8208;TiO2/HEAs. Zinc&#8211;air batteries incorporating&#160;M&#8208;TiO2/HEAs exhibit a low charge voltage of 1.87&#160;V at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 under light irradiation. In addition, it exhibits exceptional cycle stability, maintaining stable cycling for 1000&#160;h at a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that M&#8208;TiO2/HEAs heterojunctions exhibit strong electronic interactions. These interactions effectively promote the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and the conversion of electrochemical intermediates, thereby enhancing oxygen evolution reaction activity under light irradiation. This work offers valuable insights into the rapid fabrication of photoelectrocatalysts, providing new perspectives for developing light&#8208;enhanced energy storage systems.

         <title>Dynamic Gradient Oxygen Layer Enables Stable Sn Anode for Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
During lithiation/delithiation, SnOx helped to form a stable solid electrolyte interface film. In addition, the disordered SnOx lamellar structures can release stress to prevent particle pulverization during its transformation into a denser amorphous layer. Its mechanism of lithium storage in the intercalation layer and dynamic oxygen concentration gradient can enable the rapid exchange of lithium ions.









Abstract
Sn&#8208;based anodes are of significant interest due to their high capacity and resource abundance for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, incomplete lithiation and severe volume expansion result in their low capacity and electrode pulverization. Here, a rationally designed coating layer, composed of disordered SnOx (x = 1, 2) lamellar structures, on the Sn particles surface (Sn@SnOx) is proposed. This coating effectively mitigates volume expansion and minimizes lithium consumption owing to the intercalation behaviors of SnOx. During lithiation and delithiation, a dense, amorphous, mechanical coating with a dynamic gradient of oxygen forms in situ, providing excellent protection against continuous pulverization of the Sn particles. The intercalation&#8208;type dynamic gradient oxygen with high ionic conductivity enables rapid exchange of lithium ions, thus promoting the deep lithiation of Sn to form Li4.4Sn. Such gradient oxygen protection mechanism of the oxide layer in Sn@SnOx brings a high reversible capacity after 900 cycles with a capacity retention of 84%. This work offers a new strategy to design a protective coating layer on alloy&#8208;based anodes for high&#8208;performance lithium storage.

         <title>Scalable Low&#8208;Carbon Ambient&#8208;Dried Foam&#8208;Like Aerogels for Radiative Cooling with Extreme Environmental Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable low&#8208;carbon ambient&#8208;dried foam&#8208;like aerogel with integrated radiative cooling and fire/harsh&#8208;conditions resistance is fabricated via green ambient&#8208;drying process without complex freezing and hazardous solvent exchange, which overcomes critical scalable green fabrication and durability challenges in cooling aerogels, providing new insights to maximize the efficiency in striving against global warming.









Abstract
Aerogels have emerged as promising passive radiant cooling materials, offering a sustainable solution to mitigate global warming. However, the energy&#8208; and resource&#8208;intensive fabrication processes and insufficient environmental durability of current aerogels pose significant challenges for industrial scalability and long&#8208;term energy&#8208;saving applications. Here, a scalable low&#8208;carbon ambient&#8208;dried foam&#8208;like aerogel (GMSx) with integrated radiative cooling and fire/harsh&#8208;conditions resistance is reported. Thermoresponsive physicochemical interactions among gellan gum, melamine&#8208;formaldehyde resin, and fumed silica facilitate the transformation of scalable emulsion&#8208;templated hydrogels into structurally ordered GMSx via a green ambient&#8208;drying process without complex freezing and solvent exchange. The foam&#8208;like aerogel exhibits high porosity (96.2%) and record specific modulus (323 m2/s2). Optimized optical properties with 93% solar reflectance and 94% infrared emissivity yield subambient cooling of 4.8 &#176;C. Crucially, the robust crosslinked networks impart remarkable durability under extreme conditions, including exposure to hot water, strong acids/alkalis (pH 1&#8211;13), various chemicals, and 1300 &#176;C flame. Furthermore, GMSx can be customized into various shapes via extrusion or spraying techniques and applied as protective coatings using scalable brushing or dipping methods, accommodating diverse substrate geometries. This work overcomes critical scalable green fabrication and durability challenges in passive cooling aerogels, demonstrating practical potential for energy&#8208;efficient thermal management in harsh environments.

         <dc:description>
Honeycomb&#8208;structured (Ti3C2Tx/Fe3O4/CCMC)&#8211;(AgNW/CCMC) aerogels with tunable EMI shielding performance up to 80 dB are fabricated via DIW 3D printing, achieving compression&#8208;driven shielding adjustability, infrared stealth, and reversible thermal insulation&#8211;conduction conversion for dynamic thermal management in harsh environments.








Abstract
Achieving both structural precision and tunable performance in electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials remains a critical challenge, particularly for adaptive applications. Herein, a strategy is proposed that integrates calcium chloride (CaCl&#8322;)&#8208;induced elastic activation of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with direct ink writing (DIW) 3D printing to address the limitations in structural design and performance adjustability of EMI shielding materials. By leveraging CaCl&#8322;&#8208;crosslinked CMC (CCMC) as a flexible matrix, honeycomb&#8208;structured (Ti&#8323;C&#8322;Tx/Fe&#8323;O&#8324;/CCMC)&#8211;(Ag nanowire (AgNW)/CCMC) aerogels is fabricated with precise architecture and tunable shielding effectiveness under mechanical compression. With a 35% printing fill density, 40 wt% Ti&#8323;C&#8322;Tx, and 60% compressive strain, the aerogel achieves an optimal shielding effectiveness of 80&#160;dB. Additionally, the aerogel exhibits reversible infrared stealth and dynamically switchable thermal properties (from 0.08 to 0.67 W&#183;m&#8315;&#185;&#183;K&#8315;&#185;) in response to environmental humidity variations. This work demonstrates a versatile approach for structurally adaptive EMI shielding materials with self&#8208;regulating thermal behavior, offering promising applications in harsh environment protection, intelligent thermal camouflage, and adaptive shielding for next&#8208;generation aerospace and communication technologies.

This study develops a muscle atrophy evaluation and rehabilitation system utilizing rare earth oxide&#8208;enhanced triboelectric sensors integrated with a multi&#8208;channel signal collector and machine learning algorithms, enabling precise assessment of ulnar nerve injury recovery. The system demonstrates high sensitivity, accuracy, and visualization capability, offering significant advances in grip strength rehabilitation monitoring and biomedical sensing applications.








Abstract
Ulnar nerve injuries often lead to muscle atrophy and reduced hand function, necessitating precise monitoring and effective rehabilitation strategies. Current grip strength measurement tools rely on rigid mechanical equipment, which is inconvenient and requires frequent calibration. To address this, a muscle atrophy evaluation and rehabilitation system (MUERS) is presented, featuring a highly sensitive rare earth oxide&#8208;enhanced triboelectric sensor (RETS). Utilizing the unique electrochemical properties of rare earth oxides, RETS demonstrates a linear voltage&#8208;force response in the range of 8&#8211;80 kPa, with a maximum linear error of 1.5%. Integrated with a multi&#8208;channel STM32 signal collector, RETS enables real&#8208;time grip strength monitoring across all five fingers. Combining sensor output with an SVM algorithm, the system achieves 98.61% accuracy in identifying finger grip strength injuries and classifies damage into three levels with an average accuracy of 96.67%. MUERS evaluates rehabilitation progress by scoring grip strength and providing feedback to clinicians. Over a four&#8208;week cycle, it consistently captures improvements in muscle recovery, aiding individualized rehabilitation plans. This system offers fine&#8208;grained assessment capabilities for diagnosing and monitoring nerve injury&#8208;induced muscle atrophy, paving the way for advanced biomedical sensing and personalized rehabilitation.

A multi&#8208;DoF processor is designed to perform versatile inference tasks, including single&#8208;/dual&#8208;digit and single&#8208;/dual&#8208;fashion product classification, logic operations, and image transformation. Moreover, a high&#8208;security information transmission framework is experimentally demonstrated that transforms a large volume of input data&#8212;encoded across multiple channels&#8212;into Morse code, with the true information subsequently synthesized through further decoding.








Abstract
All&#8208;optical diffractive deep neural networks (D2NNs) offer significant advantages in processing speed and power consumption, thereby accelerating the development of optical computing and artificial intelligence (AI). Integrating multiple degrees of freedom (multi&#8208;DoF) into D2NNs is a pivotal role in improving information processing and task&#8208;loading capacity, an enormous challenge in current all&#8208;optical diffractive computing/processors. Here, a multi&#8208;DoF diffractive processor is proposed and experimentally demonstrated that leverages a metasurfaces&#8208;based approach to integrate polarization, distance, and rotation channels for versatile inference tasks and information encryption. The approach is validated using three&#8208;layer metasurfaces that enable high task&#8208;capacity tasks, including single&#8208;/dual&#8208;digit and single&#8208;/dual&#8208;fashion&#8208;product classification, logic operators, and image transformation. Moreover, by mapping large volumes of input data into multi&#8208;DoF channels and encoding the information in Morse code with our D2NNs framework, a high&#8208;security information transmission system is experimentally implemented. The integration of polarization, distance, and rotation channels into an all&#8208;optical diffractive processor with multifunctional capabilities paves the way for multifunctional integrated devices and communication.

         <title>Ternary Inert Element Co&#8208;Doping: a New Approach to Stable 4.7&#160;V LiCoO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al&#8211;Mg&#8211;Ni inert co&#8208;doping synergistically enhances structural stability of LiCoO2 at highly delithiated state, with Mg/Ni stabilizing Li layers and suppressing oxygen loss, while Al reinforcing Co&#8211;O octahedra, giving a capacity retention of 58.6% after 600 cycles at 4.7&#160;V.








Abstract
LiCoO2 (LCO) has long dominated the cathode materials in portable electronic batteries due to its high volumetric energy density. However, the pursuit of higher voltages to achieve larger capacities remains a challenge due to severer structural degradation. Herein, a ternary inert element co&#8208;doping strategy that can greatly improve the structure stability of LCOs at elevated voltages is reported. Mg and Ni doping at Li site support the layered structure in the highly delithiated state, while Ni also facilitates the separation of O 2p and Co 3d orbits, thereby suppressing oxygen loss. Meanwhile, Al doping at Co site suppresses the distortion of Co&#8211;O octahedra and stabilizes the Co layers. The synergistic effects of Al, Mg and Ni co&#8208;doping inhibit the irreversible H3&#8211;H1&#8208;3 phase transitions and mitigate internal stress accumulation. The Al&#8211;Mg&#8211;Ni co&#8208;doped LCO exhibits a capacity of 221&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 65.5% after 1500 cycles at 4.6&#160;V. At a higher voltage of 4.7&#160;V, it delivers a capacity of 225.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 58.6% after 600 cycles. This multiple inert elements co&#8208;doping strategy gives an effective method for stabilizing the high&#8208;voltage LCO and other related layered oxide materials.

         <title>Amidation&#8208;Retarded Synthesis of Perovskite Quantum Dots with Low Defect Density and Enhanced Carrier Transport for Efficient Light Emitting Diodes and Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent metal halides are introduced to react with amide and retard amidation process, thereby releasing free ligands and preventing PbI2 precipitation at 200 &#176;C. The synthesized perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) show lower defect density and better charge transport capacity, realizing highly efficient CsPbI3 PQD LEDs (28.71%) and SCs (16.20%). Such strategy is universal in red/green/blue PQDs.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are promising for both solar cells (SCs) and light emitting diodes (LEDs) for their excellent optoelectronic characteristics and solution&#8208;processable fabrication. One of the general limitations for these two kinds of devices is that high defect density and poor charge transport, resulting from the unavoidable amidation&#8208;induced PbX2 precipitation at high reaction temperature. In this work, an amidation&#8208;retarded synthesis strategy is proposed to prevent the PbX2 precipitation and subsequent defect formation. Covalent metal halides are introduced to interrupt amidation by reacting with deprotonated oleic acid/protonated oleylamine. Then, free acids/amines are released to coordinate with PbX2 and form regular lead&#8208;halide octahedra during nucleation&#8208;growth process. The synthesized CsPbI3 PQDs exhibit lower defect density (5.1 &#215; 1017 cm&#8722;3), higher PLQY (92%) and better charge output capacity (&#8776;8 times improvement). As a result, the LEDs and SCs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 28.71% and power conversion efficiency of 16.20%, respectively, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance. Furthermore, the universality of such strategy has been demonstrated in red/green/blue LEDs, and could be expected in other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>An Elastomeric Electrolyte Based on Lithium&#8208;Ion&#8208;Selective Transmembrane Transport for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of fiber&#8208;network&#8208;based elastomeric solid electrolytes is formed through electrospinning&#8208;induced phase separation combined with in situ polymerization, featuring a structure in which an elastomeric layer with Li+&#8208;selective permeability encapsulates fibrous plastic crystals. With the merits of the interconnected ion transport channels, the lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;selective permeability, and the conformal interface, the assembled solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries incorporating this electrolyte demonstrate desirable electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (SSLSBs) exhibit advantages such as high specific energy, safety, and low cost, making them an ideal candidate for next&#8208;generation batteries. However, the current mechanical and electrochemical properties of solid&#8208;state electrolytes do not meet the requirements of the practical application of SSLSBs. Herein, a construction strategy of fiber&#8208;network&#8208;based elastomeric solid electrolytes (FESE) based on electrospinning&#8208;induced phase separation is proposed. The FESE features a structure in which an elastomeric layer with Li+&#8208;selective permeability encapsulates a fibrous plastic crystal electrolyte (PCE).

     alt="An Elastomeric Electrolyte Based on Lithium-Ion-Selective Transmembrane Transport for Solid-State Lithium-Sulfur Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A class of fiber-network-based elastomeric solid electrolytes is formed through electrospinning-induced phase separation combined with in situ polymerization, featuring a structure in which an elastomeric layer with Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-selective permeability encapsulates fibrous plastic crystals. With the merits of the interconnected ion transport channels, the lithium-ion-selective permeability, and the conformal interface, the assembled solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries incorporating this electrolyte demonstrate desirable electrochemical performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state lithium-sulfur batteries (SSLSBs) exhibit advantages such as high specific energy, safety, and low cost, making them an ideal candidate for next-generation batteries. However, the current mechanical and electrochemical properties of solid-state electrolytes do not meet the requirements of the practical application of SSLSBs. Herein, a construction strategy of fiber-network-based elastomeric solid electrolytes (FESE) based on electrospinning-induced phase separation is proposed. The FESE features a structure in which an elastomeric layer with Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-selective permeability encapsulates a fibrous plastic crystal electrolyte (PCE). This structure originates from the phase separation and fiberization of a hydrogenated nitrile rubber (HNBR) stabilized emulsion, driven by electrostatic jetting. Subsequently, in situ polymerization of methoxy polyethylene glycol is performed within the battery to achieve void filling. Benefiting from the interconnected ion transport channels, the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-selectivity, and the conformal interface, the as-prepared FESE electrolyte achieves a high room-temperature ionic conductivity of 1.11 mS cm&#8315;&#185; and a Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number of 0.77. The as-assembled SSLSB delivers a high initial discharge capacity (1188 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), remarkable rate capability (356 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 4C), and excellent cycling performance (71.2% capacity retention after 800 cycles). This research presents a constructive strategy for the elastomeric electrolytes for high-performance solid-state batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bimetallic Nanocluster&#8208;Based Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes With High External Quantum Efficiency and Saturated Red Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the fabrication of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LED) using self&#8208;emissive bimetallic gold&#8208;copper nanoclusters (NCs) is reported. The NC&#8208;LED shows a maximum brightness of 1246 cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and the highest external quantum efficiency (EQE; 12.60%) value with pure red emission among the solution&#8208;processed and non&#8208;doped NC&#8208;based LEDs.








Abstract
Self&#8208;emissive atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs) are emerging as promising emissive layer material for next&#8208;generation light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), thanks to their solid&#8208;state luminescence, well&#8208;defined structures, photo/thermal stability, low toxicity, and unique excited&#8208;state properties. However, achieving high external quantum efficiency (EQE) in solid&#8208;state NCs remains a formidable challenge. In this study, a highly stable bimetallic gold&#8208;copper NC forming [Au2Cu6(Sadm)6(DPPEO)2] stabilized with 1&#8208;adamantanethiol (HSadm) and 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (DPPE) as the primary and secondary ligands, respectively is reported. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and spectroscopic analyses suggest that the as&#8208;synthesized NC contains one phosphine bound to gold and the second phosphine has oxidized to phosphine oxide (P&#9552;O). The presence of such P&#9552;O moieties in the NC facilitated C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions along with C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and H&#183;&#183;&#183;H interactions between ligands, promoting rapid crystallization. Due to the exceptional photo/thermal stability and enhanced solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), [Au2Cu6(Sadm)6(DPPEO)2] NC is utilized to fabricate the NC&#8208;based LED (NC&#8208;LED) via the solution&#8208;processed technique, without using any additional host materials. The fabricated NC&#8208;LED shows a maximum brightness of 1246 cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and an EQE of 12.60% with a pure red emission &#8776;668 nm. This EQE value coupled with saturated pure red emission is the best among solution&#8208;processed and non&#8208;doped NC&#8208;LEDs, suggesting the enormous potential of the NCs for electro&#8208;optical devices.

         <title>Manganese&#8211;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Coordination for Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Ion Batteries With Varying Mechanical Adaptability and Machine Learning&#8211;Assisted Performance Decoding</title>

By rationally designing &#960;&#8722;conjugated anthraquinone&#8722;based redox&#8722;active ligands (DHAQ/DAAQ), a series of layered, flower&#8211;like MnMOC structures are synthesized. Comprehensive characterization techniques are employed to systematically investigate the reaction mechanisms of these MnMOCs in AZIBs. Importantly, a machine learning&#8722;based model is developed to predict specific capacity. Notably, the MnMOCs demonstrates excellent performance in practical applications, offering strong support for the advancement of MOC materials in the field of energy storage.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;ion batteries (AZIBs) have garnered significant attention owing to their high safety and low cost; however, their development is hindered by the poor cycling stability and low capacity of traditional inorganic cathode materials. This study innovatively utilizes dihydroxy/diamino anthraquinone (DHAQ/DAAQ) ligands featuring &#960;&#8211;conjugated systems and quinone&#8211;based redox activity. By precisely regulating the substitution sites (1,2&#8211;/1,4&#8211;/1,5&#8211;) and coordinating them with Mn2+, layered flower&#8722;cluster Manganese&#8211;based metal&#8211;organic coordination is successfully constructed. The experimental results indicated that in the Mn&#8722;1,4&#8722;DHAQ cathode, the symmetric structure of the 1,4&#8211;dihydroxy substitution promoted electron delocalization and formed stable coordination bonds with Mn2+, thereby providing excellent electrochemical performance. Furthermore, both in situ and ex situ characterizations elucidated the Zn2+ storage mechanism during charge&#8211;discharge processes. Notably, this work incorporated machine learning techniques to develop a specific capacity prediction model, laying a methodological foundation for future research in the field of energy storage. Theoretical calculations are employed to gain deeper insight into the underlying reasons for the outstanding performance of Mn&#8722;1,4&#8722;DHAQ. In addition, Mn&#8722;1,4&#8722;DHAQ is successfully applied as a cathode material in soft&#8722;pack batteries, gel electrolyte devices, and screen&#8722;printed devices, demonstrating excellent mechanical adaptability and practical application potential. Novel strategy for high&#8722;performance MOC&#8211;based AZIBs boosts practical energy storage applications.

         <title>In Situ Dual&#8208;Ionic Charge Compensation for CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 Perovskite Quantum Dot Solar Cells with Over 18% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 35, September 4, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile dual&#8208;ion charge compensation strategy is reported for in situ reinforcement surface lattices of CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 perovskite quantum dot solar cells with a record power conversion efficiency of 18.17%. The formed dual&#8208;ionic ligands can effectively compensate for the surface vacancies of perovskite quantum dots, enhancing crystal morphology and electronic coupling of perovskite quantum dots while eliminating trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination.








Abstract
Cesium&#8208;formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite quantum dots (CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs) receive increasing attention for new&#8208;generation solar cells due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties and solution processibility. However, during the synthesis of CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs, PQDs seriously suffer from the ligand detachment from the PQD surface under the polar antisolvent, leaving numerous surface vacancies that significantly compromise the surface lattice integrity and optoelectronic properties of PQDs. A facile dual&#8208;ionic charge compensation strategy is introduced through the bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) to reinforce the surface lattice of CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQDs. The dual&#8208;ionic ligands produced during the SN2 reaction could in situ fill the surface vacancies of PQDs in the nonpolar solvent, which significantly improves the surface lattice integrity and thus the optoelectronic properties of PQDs, substantially diminishing trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination. Consequently, the PQDs solar cells show a power conversion efficiency of up to 18.17%, representing the highest efficiency in CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 PQD solar cells. The remarkable photovoltaic performance is attributed to the reinforced surface lattice of PQDs, suppressing the energy losses induced by the nonradiative recombination. This study provides crucial design principles for optimizing the crystalline structure integrity of PQDs, which also paves a new avenue for developing high&#8208;performance solar cells or other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Unprecedented Superelasticity in Mo17O47/MoS2 Core&#8211;Shell Nanowires</title>

[001]&#8208;oriented Mo17O47/MoS2 core&#8211;shell nanowires exhibit remarkable superelasticity. Three&#8208;point bending tests confirm Young's modulus (103 GPa) matching DFT predictions. In situ scanning electron microscopy bending reveals 35% recoverable strain, unprecedented in inorganic nanowires. First&#8208;principles calculations attribute this superelasticity to reversible transitions between chemical bonding and van der Waals interactions, showing potential for flexible electronics.








Abstract
Inorganic materials are usually known with high modulus and brittleness. Here the finding of a [001]&#8208;oriented Mo17O47 nanowires (NWs) material is reported with a thin MoS2 shell that exhibits superelastic deformability superior to the reported inorganic NWs. Three&#8208;point bending tests reveal that the elastic modulus of Mo17O47 crystals in the [001] direction is 103&#160;GPa, consistent with the density functional theory (DFT)&#8208;predicted results. Furthermore, in situ bending tests via scanning electron microscopy, accomplished with finite element simulations, demonstrate that the NWs can sustain bending strains up to 35% repeatedly without showing appreciable residual deformation. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that this extraordinary superelasticity results from the smooth transformation between the chemical bonding and physical binding (van der Waals) in the [001] direction of Mo17O47 crystal. The remarkable superelasticity of Mo17O47 NWs may offer enormous potential in flexible electronics and photonic devices.
