      <title>Epitaxially Strained CeO2/Mn3O4 Nanocrystals as an Enhanced Antioxidant for Radioprotection</title>
      <dc:description>
Inducing surface strains of CeO2/Mn3O4 nanocrystals produces highly catalytic antioxidants that is powerful enough to protect intestinal stem cells from irradiation&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species damage. Only a small dose of the CeO2/Mn3O4 nanocrystals prevents acute radiation syndrome in a human intestinal organoid model and increased survival rate of mice treated with a lethal dose of total body irradiation.








Abstract
Nanomaterials with antioxidant properties are promising for treating reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;related diseases. However, maintaining efficacy at low doses to minimize toxicity is a critical for clinical applications. Tuning the surface strain of metallic nanoparticles can enhance catalytic reactivity, which has rarely been demonstrated in metal oxide nanomaterials. Here, it is shown that inducing surface strains of CeO2/Mn3O4 nanocrystals produces highly catalytic antioxidants that can protect tissue&#8208;resident stem cells from irradiation&#8208;induced ROS damage. Manganese ions deposited on the surface of cerium oxide (CeO2) nanocrystals form strained layers of manganese oxide (Mn3O4) islands, increasing the number of oxygen vacancies. CeO2/Mn3O4 nanocrystals show better catalytic activity than CeO2 or Mn3O4 alone and can protect the regenerative capabilities of intestinal stem cells in an organoid model after a lethal dose of irradiation. A small amount of the nanocrystals prevents acute radiation syndrome and increases the survival rate of mice treated with a lethal dose of total body irradiation.

Manganese ions deposited on the surface of cerium oxide (CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) nanocrystals form strained layers of manganese oxide (Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) islands, increasing the number of oxygen vacancies. CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals show better catalytic activity than CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; alone and can protect the regenerative capabilities of intestinal stem cells in an organoid model after a lethal dose of irradiation. A small amount of the nanocrystals prevents acute radiation syndrome and increases the survival rate of mice treated with a lethal dose of total body irradiation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>
In article number 1908007, Jia Ding, Cheng Zhong, David Mitlin, and co&#8208;workers review emerging potassium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Like the mountains, potassium&#8208;metal batteries are an exciting new challenge, waiting to be explored. Potassium&#8208;metal anodes are extremely susceptible to dendrite growth, giving relevance to the jagged alpine topography. This drawing also explores the topical theme of spiritual connectedness at a time of physical solitude. It may be achievable through hiking alone or through writing reviews with friends.

A flexible photodetector based on ultrathin graphdiyne nanosheets is constructed and applied in a three&#8208;electrode photoelectrochemical (PEC)&#8208;type system to study its photoresponse behaviors. As described by Xiuwen Zhang, Jialiang Xu, Han Zhang, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2001082, the prepared PDs show excellent photoresponse after bending or twisting for 1000 cycles. Moreover, the PDs exhibit pronounced long&#8208;term stability after being kept in an alkaline electrolyte for more than 1 month.

      <title>Flat Lenses Based on 2D Perovskite Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>
Flat lenses based on 2D perovskite nanosheets with a subwavelength focusing capability (&#8776;0.5&#955;) are reported, which are fabricated by using a cost&#8208;effective mask&#8208;free femtosecond direct laser writing system. Halide elemental substitution could further reveal potential tunable focus capability (0.5&#8211;0.9&#955;).








Abstract
Ultrathin flat lenses based on metasurfaces or metamaterials have shown great promise in recent years as essential components in nano&#8208;optical system, with capability of abrupt changes of light wavefronts. However, such structural designs require complex nanopatterns and a time&#8208;consuming nanofabrication process. In this regard, flat lenses are developed based on 2D perovskite nanosheets, using a cost&#8208;effective mask&#8208;free femtosecond direct laser writing system. The optical properties of the 2D perovskite are rationally adjusted through facile composition engineering as well as thickness&#8208;dependent quantum&#8208;size confinement.

     alt="Flat Lenses Based on 2D Perovskite Nanosheets"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flat lenses based on 2D perovskite nanosheets with a subwavelength focusing capability (&#8776;0.5&#955;) are reported, which are fabricated by using a cost&#8208;effective mask&#8208;free femtosecond direct laser writing system. Halide elemental substitution could further reveal potential tunable focus capability (0.5&#8211;0.9&#955;).


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrathin flat lenses based on metasurfaces or metamaterials have shown great promise in recent years as essential components in nano&#8208;optical system, with capability of abrupt changes of light wavefronts. However, such structural designs require complex nanopatterns and a time&#8208;consuming nanofabrication process. In this regard, flat lenses are developed based on 2D perovskite nanosheets, using a cost&#8208;effective mask&#8208;free femtosecond direct laser writing system. The optical properties of the 2D perovskite are rationally adjusted through facile composition engineering as well as thickness&#8208;dependent quantum&#8208;size confinement. A diffraction theory model is derived to understand the focusing mechanism of the 2D perovskite nanosheets flat lenses. The as&#8208;fabricated lenses exploit the tunable material property variations to effectively manipulate not only the amplitude but also the phase of the incident light to focus into a 3D focal spot with a sub&#8208;wavelength resolution in the range of 0.5&#8211;0.9&#955;. The results pave the way toward low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale high&#8208;resolution imaging applications in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>External Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 24% with CIEy Value of 0.08 using a Novel Carbene&#8208;Based Iridium Complex in Deep&#8208;Blue Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
      <dc:description>
A high external quantum efficiency for deep&#8208;blue&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes is developed using a novel carbene&#8208;based Ir(III) complex, which enhances the carrier balance in the emission layer. A high quantum efficiency of 24% with a deep&#8208;blue CIE(x, y) coordinate of (0.149, 0.085) is achieved, which satisfies the stringent National Television System Committee (NTSC) requirements with high efficiency.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;blue triplet emitters remain far inferior to standard red and green triplet emitters in terms of exhibiting high&#8208;color&#8208;purity Commission International de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) y values of &#8804;0.1, external quantum efficiencies (EQEs), and high electroluminescent brightnesses in phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. In fact, no deep&#8208;blue triplet emitter with color purity and high device performance has previously been reported. In this study, a deep&#8208;blue triplet emitter, mer&#8208;tris(N&#8208;phenyl, N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;pyridoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)iridium(III) (mer&#8208;Ir1) is developed, which meets the requirements of the National Television System Committee (NTSC) CIE(x, y) coordinates of (0.149, 0.085) with an extremely high EQE of 24.8% and maximum brightness (Lmax) of 6453 cd m&#8722;2, by a device with a 40 vol% doping ratio. Moreover, another device demonstrates an EQEmax of 21.3%, an Lmax of 5247 cd m&#8722;2, and CIE(x, y) coordinates of (0.151, 0.086) at a 30 vol% doping ratio. This is the first report of a high&#8208;performance, deep&#8208;blue phosphor, carbene&#8208;based Ir(III) complex device with outstanding CIE(x, y) color coordinates and a high EQE. The results of this study indicate that the novel dopant mer&#8208;Ir1 is a promising candidate for reducing power consumption in display applications.

      <title>Biradical&#8208;Featured Stable Organic&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Photothermal Materials for Highly Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Water Evaporation</title>
      <dc:description>
A stable croconium derivative, &#8220;CR&#8208;TPE&#8208;T&#8221;, is designed to exhibit the unique biradical property and strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in the solid state, which facilitate not only broad absorption spectrum from 300 to 1600 nm for effective sunlight harvesting, but also highly efficient photothermal conversion by boosting nonradiative decay, enabling a high solar&#8208;energy&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency of 87.2% under one sun irradiation.








Abstract
With recent progress in photothermal materials, organic small molecules featured with flexibility, diverse structures, and tunable properties exhibit unique advantages but have been rarely applied in solar&#8208;driven water evaporation owing to limited sunlight absorption resulting in low solar&#8211;thermal conversion. Herein, a stable croconium derivative, named CR&#8208;TPE&#8208;T, is designed to exhibit the unique biradical property and strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in the solid state, which facilitate not only a broad absorption spectrum from 300 to 1600 nm for effective sunlight harvesting, but also highly efficient photothermal conversion by boosting nonradiative decay. The photothermal efficiency is evaluated to be 72.7% under 808 nm laser irradiation. Based on this, an interfacial&#8208;heating evaporation system based on CR&#8208;TPE&#8208;T is established successfully, using which a high solar&#8208;energy&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency of 87.2% and water evaporation rate of 1.272 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under 1 sun irradiation are obtained, thus making an important step toward the application of organic&#8208;small&#8208;molecule photothermal materials in solar energy utilization.

      <title>Photonic Multishells Composed of Cholesteric Liquid Crystals Designed by Controlled Phase Separation in Emulsion Drops</title>
      <dc:description>
Photonic multishells are created by controlled phase separation of cholesteric liquid crystals and hydrophilic liquid confined in emulsion drops. The material exchange between the dispersed and continuous phases triggers the consecutive steps of phase separation, through which onion&#8208;like drops are formed. Multiple photonic stopbands are spontaneously developed by uneven partitioning of the chiral dopant, which provides advanced photonic functionality.








Abstract
Cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs), also known as chiral nematic LCs, show a photonic stopband, which is promising for various optical applications. In particular, CLCs confined in microcompartments are useful for sensing, lasing, and optical barcoding at the microscale. The integration of distinct CLCs into single microstructures can provide advanced functionality. In this work, CLC multishells with multiple stopbands are created by liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) in a simple yet highly controlled manner. A homogeneous ternary mixture of LC, hydrophilic liquid, and co&#8208;solvent is microfluidically emulsified to form uniform oil&#8208;in&#8208;water drops, which undergo LLPS to form onion&#8208;like drops composed of alternating CLC&#8208;rich and CLC&#8208;depleted layers. The multiplicity is controlled from one to five by adjusting the initial composition of the ternary mixture, which dictates the number of consecutive steps of LLPS. Interestingly, the concentration of the chiral dopant becomes reduced from the outermost to the innermost CLC drop due to uneven partitioning during LLPS, which results in multiple stopbands. Therefore, the photonic multishells show multiple structural colors. In addition, dye&#8208;doped multishells provide band&#8208;edge lasing at two different wavelengths. This new class of photonic multishells will provide new opportunities for advanced optical applications.

      <title>High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells Enabled by n&#8208;Type Polymers with an Ultranarrow Bandgap Down to 1.28 eV</title>
      <dc:description>
n&#8208;Type polymer semiconductors with a broad absorption and ultranarrow bandgap down to 1.28 eV are synthesized. When applied as electron acceptor materials, a power conversion efficiency of over 10% with a photoresponse reaching 950 nm is realized for all&#8208;polymer solar cells.








Abstract
Compared to organic solar cells based on narrow&#8208;bandgap nonfullerene small&#8208;molecule acceptors, the performance of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) lags much behind due to the lack of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers, which should have low&#8208;aligned frontier molecular orbital levels and narrow bandgap with broad and intense absorption extended to the near&#8208;infrared region. Herein, two novel polymer acceptors, DCNBT&#8208;TPC and DCNBT&#8208;TPIC, are synthesized with ultranarrow bandgaps (ultra&#8208;NBG) of 1.38 and 1.28 eV, respectively. When applied in transistors, both polymers show efficient charge transport with a highest electron mobility of 1.72 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 obtained for DCNBT&#8208;TPC. Blended with a polymer donor, PBDTTT&#8208;E&#8208;T, the resultant all&#8208;PSCs based on DCNBT&#8208;TPC and DCNBT&#8208;TPIC achieve remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 9.26% and 10.22% with short&#8208;circuit currents up to 19.44 and 22.52 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. This is the first example that a PCE of over 10% can be achieved using ultra&#8208;NBG polymer acceptors with a photoresponse reaching 950 nm in all&#8208;PSCs. These results demonstrate that ultra&#8208;NBG polymer acceptors, in line with nonfullerene small&#8208;molecule acceptors, are also available as a highly promising class of electron acceptors for maximizing device performance in all&#8208;PSCs.

Blended with a polymer donor, PBDTTT&#8208;E&#8208;T, the resultant all&#8208;PSCs based on DCNBT&#8208;TPC and DCNBT&#8208;TPIC achieve remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 9.26% and 10.22% with short&#8208;circuit currents up to 19.44 and 22.52 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. This is the first example that a PCE of over 10% can be achieved using ultra&#8208;NBG polymer acceptors with a photoresponse reaching 950 nm in all&#8208;PSCs. These results demonstrate that ultra&#8208;NBG polymer acceptors, in line with nonfullerene small&#8208;molecule acceptors, are also available as a highly promising class of electron acceptors for maximizing device performance in all&#8208;PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Strain&#8208;Engineered Anisotropic Optical and Electrical Properties in 2D Chiral&#8208;Chain Tellurium</title>
      <dc:description>
The strain&#8208;engineered anisotropic optical and electrical properties in solution&#8208;grown, sub&#8208;millimeter&#8208;size 2D Te are systematically investigated through designing and introducing a controlled buckled geometry in its intriguing chiral&#8208;chain lattice. The results suggest the potential of 2D Te as a promising candidate for designing and implementing flexible and stretchable devices with strain&#8208;engineered functionalities.








Abstract
Atomically thin materials, leveraging their low&#8208;dimensional geometries and superior mechanical properties, are amenable to exquisite strain manipulation with a broad tunability inaccessible to bulk or thin&#8208;film materials. Such capability offers unexplored possibilities for probing intriguing physics and materials science in the 2D limit as well as enabling unprecedented device applications. Here, the strain&#8208;engineered anisotropic optical and electrical properties in solution&#8208;grown, sub&#8208;millimeter&#8208;size 2D Te are systematically investigated through designing and introducing a controlled buckled geometry in its intriguing chiral&#8208;chain lattice. The observed Raman spectra reveal anisotropic lattice vibrations under the corresponding straining conditions. The feasibility of using buckled 2D Te for ultrastretchable strain sensors with a high gauge factor (&#8776;380) is further explored. 2D Te is an emerging material boasting attractive characteristics for electronics, sensors, quantum devices, and optoelectronics. The results suggest the potential of 2D Te as a promising candidate for designing and implementing flexible and stretchable devices with strain&#8208;engineered functionalities.

      <title>Deep&#8208;Learning&#8208;Enabled Fast Optical Identification and Characterization of 2D Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Microscopy data of nanomaterials often contains rich yet complicated information that reflects the material properties, but is mostly overlooked by researchers. Deep learning is an ideal approach to finding these highly correlated and non&#8208;linear features. As a case study, a neural network model called &#8220;2DMOINet&#8221; is trained for optical identification and characterization of exfoliated 2D materials.








Abstract
Advanced microscopy and/or spectroscopy tools play indispensable roles in nanoscience and nanotechnology research, as they provide rich information about material processes and properties. However, the interpretation of imaging data heavily relies on the &#8220;intuition&#8221; of experienced researchers. As a result, many of the deep graphical features obtained through these tools are often unused because of difficulties in processing the data and finding the correlations. Such challenges can be well addressed by deep learning. In this work, the optical characterization of 2D materials is used as a case study, and a neural&#8208;network&#8208;based algorithm is demonstrated for the material and thickness identification of 2D materials with high prediction accuracy and real&#8208;time processing capability. Further analysis shows that the trained network can extract deep graphical features such as contrast, color, edges, shapes, flake sizes, and their distributions, based on which an ensemble approach is developed to predict the most relevant physical properties of 2D materials. Finally, a transfer learning technique is applied to adapt the pretrained network to other optical identification applications. This artificial&#8208;intelligence&#8208;based material characterization approach is a powerful tool that would speed up the preparation, initial characterization of 2D materials and other nanomaterials, and potentially accelerate new material discoveries.

      <title>Thermal Management by Engineering the Alignment of Nanocellulose</title>
      <dc:description>
A summary of how nanocellulose can be used to fabricate bioinspired building materials, including thermally super&#8208;insulating transparent and translucent aerogels and designable photonic reflectors, like the ones found in cuticles of beetles, is presented. These materials promise a boost of the energy efficiency of building envelopes, especially windows, so that no or very little supplemental energy would be needed to provide year&#8208;round occupant comfort.








Abstract
One of the grand current research challenges is to improve the energy efficiency of residential and commercial buildings, which cumulatively consume more than 40% of the energy generated globally. In addition to improving the comfort of the inhabitants and mitigating the growing energy consumption problem, new building materials and technologies could provide a safe strategy for geoengineering to mitigate global climate change. Herein, recent progress in developing such advanced materials from nanocellulose, which is often derived from wood or even dirty feedstocks like waste, is reviewed. By using chemical and bacteria&#8208;enabled processing, nanocellulose can be used to fabricate broadband photonic reflectors, thermally super&#8208;insulating aerogels, solar gain regulators, and low&#8208;emissivity coatings, with potential applications in windows, roofs, walls, and other components of buildings envelopes. These material developments draw inspiration from advanced energy management found in nature, such as the nanoporous photonic structures that evolved in cuticles of beetles. Fabrication of such materials takes advantage of mesoscale liquid crystalline self&#8208;assembly, which allows for pre&#8208;designed control of cellulose nanoparticle orientations at the mesoscale. With the potential fully realized, such materials could one day transform the current energy&#8208;lossy buildings into energy plants on Earth and possibly even enable extraterrestrial habitats.

      <title>Ferroelectric Exchange Bias Affects Interfacial Electronic States</title>
      <dc:description>
A 2D superconductor is formed at the interface between a ferroelectric insulator and a polar oxide. Transport properties at low temperatures are anomalous and hysteretic as a function of external electrostatic gating. Imaging of the spatial distribution of the current flow is combined to show that an intrinsic electrostatic bias (analogous to the magnetic exchange bias) explains the observations.








Abstract
In polar oxide interfaces phenomena such as superconductivity, magnetism, 1D conductivity, and quantum Hall states can emerge at the polar discontinuity. Combining controllable ferroelectricity at such interfaces can affect the superconducting properties and sheds light on the mutual effects between the polar oxide and the ferroelectric oxide. Here, the interface between the polar oxide LaAlO3 and the ferroelectric Ca&#8208;doped SrTiO3 is studied by means of electrical transport combined with local imaging of the current flow with the use of scanning a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). Anomalous behavior of the interface resistivity is observed at low temperatures. The scanning SQUID maps of the current flow suggest that this behavior originates from an intrinsic bias induced by the polar LaAlO3 layer. Such intrinsic bias combined with ferroelectricity can constrain the possible structural domain tiling near the interface. The use of this intrinsic bias is recommended as a method of controlling and tuning the initial state of ferroelectric materials by the design of the polar structure. The hysteretic dependence of the normal and the superconducting state properties on gate voltage can be utilized in multifaceted controllable memory devices.

      <title>Spider&#8208;Web&#8208;Inspired PM0.3 Filters Based on Self&#8208;Sustained Electrostatic Nanostructured Networks</title>
      <dc:description>
A spider&#8208;web&#8208;inspired network generator (SWING)&#8208;based air filter constructed from 2D electrostatic nanostructured networks is created by a unique electrospraying&#8211;netting technique. Due to the self&#8208;sustained electrostatic adhesion driven by aeolian vibration and Steiner&#8208;tree&#8208;structured pores (size 200&#8211;300 nm) consisting of nanowires (diameter 12 nm), the SWING filters achieve &gt;99.995% PM0.3 removal, &lt;0.09% atmosphere pressure, &gt;82% transmittance, and remarkable bioprotective activity.








Abstract
Particulate matter (PM) pollution has become a serious public health issue, especially with outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. However, most present filters are bulky, opaque, and show low&#8208;efficiency PM0.3/pathogen interception and inevitable trade&#8208;off between PM removal and air permeability. Here, a unique electrospraying&#8211;netting technique is used to create spider&#8208;web&#8208;inspired network generator (SWING) air filters. Manipulation of the dynamic of the Taylor cone and phase separation of its ejected droplets enable the generation of 2D self&#8208;charging nanostructured networks on a large scale. The resultant SWING filters show exceptional long&#8208;range electrostatic property driven by aeolian vibration, enabling self&#8208;sustained PM adhesion. Combined with their Steiner&#8208;tree&#8208;structured pores (size 200&#8211;300 nm) consisting of nanowires (diameter 12 nm), the SWING filters exhibit high efficiency (&gt;99.995% PM0.3 removal), low air resistance (&lt;0.09% atmosphere pressure), high transparency (&gt;82%), and remarkable bioprotective activity for biohazard pathogens. This work may shed light on designing new fibrous materials for environmental and energy applications.

      <title>Wettability&#8208;Guided Screen Printing of Perovskite Microlaser Arrays for Current&#8208;Driven Displays</title>
      <dc:description>
Large&#8208;scale multicolor perovskite microlaser arrays with controllable physical dimensions and spatial locations are rapidly constructed with a universal and robust strategy, which is subsequently utilized to develop high&#8208;performance display panels. The results provide new opportunities to explore the concepts and device architectures of flat&#8208;panel laser display technology.








Abstract
Halide perovskites have shown tremendous potential for next&#8208;generation flat&#8208;panel laser displays due to their remarkable optoelectronic properties and outstanding material processability; however, the lack of a general approach for the fast growth of perovskite laser arrays capable of electrical operations impedes actualization of their display applications. Herein, a universal and robust wettability&#8208;guided screen&#8208;printing technique is reported for the rapid growth of large&#8208;scale multicolor perovskite microdisk laser arrays, which can serve as laser display panels and further be used to realize current&#8208;driven displays. The perovskite microlasers are precisely defined with controlled physical dimensions and spatial locations by such a printing strategy, and each perovskite microlaser serves as a pixel of a display panel. Moreover, the screen&#8208;printing procedure is highly compatible with light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) device architectures, which is favorable for the mass production of micro&#8208;LED arrays. On this basis, a prototype of a current&#8208;driven display is demonstrated with desired functionalities. The outstanding performance and feasible fabrication of screen&#8208;printed perovskite microlaser arrays embedded in LEDs provide deep insights into the concepts and device architectures of electrically driven laser display technology.

      <title>Liquid&#8208;Metal&#8208;Templated Synthesis of 2D Graphitic Materials at Room Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>
A liquid metal establishes an ultrasmooth liquid&#8211;liquid interface that catalyses the dissociation of organic precursors into interfacial graphitic carbon films. The electrochemical synthesis of these 2D graphitic films is accomplished at room temperature (with only a small energy input, an onset voltage of 0.45 V) and they self&#8208;exfoliate from the nonpolar surface of the liquid metal by applying higher voltages.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature synthesis of 2D graphitic materials (2D&#8208;GMs) remains an elusive aim, especially with electrochemical means. Here, it is shown that liquid metals render this possible as they offer catalytic activity and an ultrasmooth templating interface that promotes Frank&#8211;van der Merwe regime growth, while allowing facile exfoliation due to the absence of interfacial forces as a nonpolar liquid. The 2D&#8208;GMs are formed at low onset potential and can be in situ doped depending on the choice of organic precursors and the electrochemical set&#8208;up. The materials are tuned to exhibit porous or pinhole&#8208;free morphologies and are engineered for their degree of oxidation and number of layers. The proposed liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based room&#8208;temperature electrochemical route can be expanded to many other 2D materials.

      <title>Perovskite Single&#8208;Crystal Microwire&#8208;Array Photodetectors with Performance Stability beyond 1 Year</title>
      <dc:description>
MAPbBr3 single&#8208;crystal microwire arrays with designable shape, controllable size, and high crystalline quality are fabricated. The combination of the hydrophobic molecular protective layer, high crystalline quality, and highly ordered microstructures, improve the intrinsic stability of MAPbBr3 single&#8208;crystal microwire arrays. Thus, a flexible photodetector with long&#8208;term performance stability of more than 1 year is achieved.








Abstract
Compared with thin&#8208;film morphology, 1D perovskite structures such as micro/nanowires with fewer grain boundaries and lower defect density are very suitable for high&#8208;performance photodetectors with higher stability. Although the stability of perovskite microwire&#8208;based photodetectors has been substantially enhanced in comparison with that of photodetectors based on thin&#8208;film morphology, practical applications require further improvements to the stability before implementation. In this study, a template&#8208;assisted method is developed to prepare methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) micro/nanowire structures, which are encapsulated in situ by a protective hydrophobic molecular layer. The combination of the protective layer, high crystalline quality, and highly ordered microstructures significantly improve the stability of the MAPbBr3 single&#8208;crystal microwire arrays. Consequently, these MAPbBr3 single&#8208;crystal microwire&#8208;array&#8208;based photodetectors exhibit significant long&#8208;term stability, maintaining 96% of the initial photocurrent after 1 year without further encapsulation. The lifetime of such photodetectors is hence approximately four times longer than that of the most stable previously reported perovskite micro/nanowire&#8208;based photodetector; this is thought to be the most stable perovskite photodetector reported thus far. Furthermore, this work should contribute further toward the realization of perovskite 1D structures with long&#8208;term stability.

      <title>Bioinspired Ionic Sensory Systems: The Successor of Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
To narrow the gap between biological and artificial systems and to accomplish direct human&#8211;computer interfaces, electronic/ionic couplers are needed. The recent advances in ion&#8208;transport&#8208;based sensory systems, including ionic sensors, ionic processors, and ionic interfaces are reviewed.

Abstract
All biological systems, including animals and plants, communicate in a language of ions and small molecules, while the modern information infrastructures and technologies rely on a language of electrons. Although electronics and bioelectronics have made great progress in the past several decades, they still face the disadvantage of signal transformation when communicating with biology. To narrow the gap between biological systems and artificial&#8208;intelligence systems, bioinspired ion&#8208;transport&#8208;based sensory systems should be developed as successor of electronics, since they can emulate biological functionality more directly and communicate with biology seamlessly. Herein, the essential principles of (accurate) ion transport are introduced, and the recent progress in the development of three elements of an ionic sensory system is reviewed: ionic sensors, ionic processors, and ionic interfaces. The current challenges and future developments of ion&#8208;transport&#8208;based sensory systems are also discussed.

      <title>Magnetic Structure and Metamagnetic Transitions in the van der Waals Antiferromagnet CrPS4</title>
      <dc:description>
The magnetic structure of CrPS4 is determined. CrPS4 shows an antiferromagnetic ground state formed by out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferromagnetic monolayers with interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling along the c axis below TN = 38 K. The low&#8208;field metamagnetic transitions, that is, a spin&#8208;flop transition at &#8776;0.7 T and a spin&#8208;flip transition of 8 T, can be realized for H&#8741;c.








Abstract
In 2D magnets, interlayer exchange coupling is generally weak due to the van der Waals layered structure but it still plays a vital role in stabilizing the long&#8208;range magnetic ordering and determining the magnetic properties. Using complementary neutron diffraction, magnetic, and torque measurements, the complete magnetic phase diagram of CrPS4 crystals is determined. CrPS4 shows an antiferromagnetic ground state (A&#8208;type) formed by out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferromagnetic monolayers with interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling along the c axis below TN = 38 K. Due to small magnetic anisotropy energy and weak interlayer coupling, the low&#8208;field metamagnetic transitions in CrPS4, that is, a spin&#8208;flop transition at &#8776;0.7 T and a spin&#8208;flip transition from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic under a relatively low field of 8 T, can be realized for H&#8741;c. Intriguingly, with an inherent in&#8208;plane lattice anisotropy, spin&#8208;flop&#8208;induced moment realignment in CrPS4 for H&#8741;c is parallel to the quasi&#8208;1D chains of CrS6 octahedra. The peculiar metamagnetic transitions and in&#8208;plane anisotropy make few&#8208;layer CrPS4 flakes a fascinating platform for studying 2D magnetism and for exploring prototype device applications in spintronics and optoelectronics.

      <title>Switchable Cavitation in Silicone Coatings for Energy&#8208;Saving Cooling and Heating</title>
      <dc:description>
Silicone coatings that can be switched between radiative cooling and solar heating state are reported. The switching mechanism is based on mechanocontrolled dynamic cavities. In the cavity&#8208;open state, the coatings exhibit 93% solar reflection with 94% infrared emission for cooling, while in the cavity&#8208;closed state, they show 95% solar absorption for heating.








Abstract
Space cooling and heating currently result in huge amounts of energy consumption and various environmental problems. Herein, a switching strategy is described for efficient energy&#8208;saving cooling and heating based on the dynamic cavitation of silicone coatings that can be reversibly and continuously tuned from a highly porous state to a transparent solid. In the porous state, the coatings can achieve efficient solar reflection (93%) and long&#8208;wave infrared emission (94%) to induce a subambient temperature drop of about 5 &#176;C in hot weather (&#8776;35 &#176;C). In the transparent solid state, the coatings allow active sunlight permeation (95%) to induce solar heating to raise the ambient temperature from 10 to 28 &#176;C in cold weather. The coatings are made from commercially available, cheap materials via a facile, environmentally friendly method, and are durable, reversible, and patternable. They can be applied immediately to various existed objects including rigid substrates.

      <title>Bioinspired Multifunctional Organic Transistors Based on Natural Chlorophyll/Organic Semiconductors</title>
      <dc:description>
Bioinspired multifunctional organic transistors based on natural chlorophyll and organic semiconductors are fabricated. Phototdetection and light&#8208;stimulated synaptic transistor function can be realized by the single device under gate&#8208;voltage control. The devices show excellent photoresponsivity up to 2 &#215; 106 A W&#8722;1 as photodetectors and ultralow operating voltage of 10&#8211;5 V as synaptic devices.








Abstract
Inspired by the photosynthesis process of natural plants, multifunctional transistors based on natural biomaterial chlorophyll and organic semiconductors (OSCs) are reported. Functions as photodetectors (PDs) and light&#8208;stimulated synaptic transistors (LSSTs) can be switched by gate voltage. As PDs, the devices exhibit ultrahigh photoresponsivity up to 2 &#215; 106 A W&#8722;1, detectivity of 6 &#215; 1015 Jones, and Iphoto/Idark ratio of 2.7 &#215; 106, which make them among the best reported organic PDs. As LSSTs, important synaptic functions similar to biological synapses are demonstrated, together with a dynamic learning and forgetting process and image&#8208;processing function. Significantly, benefiting from the ultrahigh photosensitivity of chlorophyll, the lowest operating voltage and energy consumption of the LSSTs can be 10&#8722;5 V and 0.25 fJ, respectively. The devices also exhibit high flexibility and long&#8208;term air stability. This work provides a new guide for developing organic electronics based on natural biomaterials.

      <title>Iron Oxide Nanoparticles as T1 Contrast Agents for Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Fundamentals, Challenges, Applications, and Prospectives</title>
      <dc:description>
The fundamentals of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) as T1 contrast agents, the past advances, and current challenges in developing IONPs are reviewed. The key material properties and environmental variables influencing T1 and T2 contrast, and their relationships are discussed. Strategies for improving T1 contrast enhancement and directions for future research are provided.








Abstract
Gadolinium&#8208;based chelates are a mainstay of contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the clinic. However, their toxicity elicits severe side effects and the Food and Drug Administration has issued many warnings about their potential retention in patients' bodies, which causes safety concerns. Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) are a potentially attractive alternative, because of their nontoxic and biodegradable nature. Studies in developing IONPs as T1 contrast agents have generated promising results, but the complex, interrelated parameters influencing contrast enhancement make the development difficult, and IONPs suitable for T1 contrast enhancement have yet to make their way to clinical use. Here, the fundamental principles of MRI contrast agents are discussed, and the current status of MRI contrast agents is reviewed with a focus on the advantages and limitations of current T1 contrast agents and the potential of IONPs to serve as safe and improved alternative to gadolinium&#8208;based chelates. The past advances and current challenges in developing IONPs as a T1 contrast agent from a materials science perspective are presented, and how each of the key material properties and environment variables affects the performance of IONPs is assessed. Finally, some potential approaches to develop high&#8208;performance and clinically relevant T1 contrast agents are discussed.

      <title>Artificial Chemist: An Autonomous Quantum Dot Synthesis Bot</title>
      <dc:description>
Fully autonomous colloidal synthesis studies implementing a self&#8208;driving microfluidic platform with machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based experiment selection achieve unassisted material exploration. Halide&#8208;exchanged cesium lead bromide quantum dots are optimized simultaneously for photoluminescence quantum yield, polydispersity, and peak emission energy, independent of user intervention.

Abstract
The optimal synthesis of advanced nanomaterials with numerous reaction parameters, stages, and routes, poses one of the most complex challenges of modern colloidal science, and current strategies often fail to meet the demands of these combinatorially large systems. In response, an Artificial Chemist is presented: the integration of machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based experiment selection and high&#8208;efficiency autonomous flow chemistry. With the self&#8208;driving Artificial Chemist, made&#8208;to&#8208;measure inorganic perovskite quantum dots (QDs) in flow are autonomously synthesized, and their quantum yield and composition polydispersity at target bandgaps, spanning 1.9 to 2.9 eV, are simultaneously tuned. Utilizing the Artificial Chemist, eleven precision&#8208;tailored QD synthesis compositions are obtained without any prior knowledge, within 30 h, using less than 210 mL of total starting QD solutions, and without user selection of experiments. Using the knowledge generated from these studies, the Artificial Chemist is pre&#8208;trained to use a new batch of precursors and further accelerate the synthetic path discovery of QD compositions, by at least twofold. The knowledge&#8208;transfer strategy further enhances the optoelectronic properties of the in&#8208;flow synthesized QDs (within the same resources as the no&#8208;prior&#8208;knowledge experiments) and mitigates the issues of batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch precursor variability, resulting in QDs averaging within 1 meV from their target peak emission energy.

By genetic means, the angiogenin&#8208;binding peptides and tumor&#8208;homing peptides are displayed on the side wall and at the tip of filamentous phages, respectively. The resultant phage nanofibers are then intravenously injected into breast&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice. They are found to home to the tumors, suppress tumor angiogenesis, and inhibit tumor growth significantly.








Abstract
Antiangiogenesis is a promising approach to cancer therapy but is limited by the lack of tumor&#8208;homing capability of the current antiangiogenic agents. Angiogenin, a protein overexpressed and secreted by tumors to trigger angiogenesis for their growth, has never been explored as an antiangiogenic target in cancer therapy. Here it is shown that filamentous fd phage, as a biomolecular biocompatible nanofiber, can be engineered to become capable of first homing to orthotopic breast tumors and then capturing angiogenin to prevent tumor angiogenesis, resulting in targeted cancer therapy without side effects. The phage is genetically engineered to display many copies of an identified angiogenin&#8208;binding peptide on its side wall and multiple copies of a breast&#8208;tumor&#8208;homing peptide at its tip. Since the tumor&#8208;homing peptide can be discovered and customized virtually toward any specific cancer by phage display, the angiogenin&#8208;binding phages are thus universal &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;play&#8221; tumor&#8208;homing cancer therapeutics.

      <title>Designing Champion Nanostructures of Tungsten Dichalcogenides for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
Atomically curved 2H&#8208;WS2 nanosheets with precisely tunable strain and sulfur vacancies are synthesized by a simple one&#8208;step procedure based on confined epitaxy growth in mesoporous graphene derived from self&#8208;assembled Fe3O4 nanocrystal superlattices. Fine&#8208;tuning the WS2 layer number, strain, and sulfur vacancies enables arguably the best&#8208;performing 2H&#8208;WS2 electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction ever reported.








Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning strain and vacancies in 2H&#8208;phase transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides, although extremely challenging, is crucial for activating the inert basal plane for boosting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, atomically curved 2H&#8208;WS2 nanosheets with precisely tunable strain and sulfur vacancies (S&#8208;vacancies) along with rich edge sites are synthesized via a one&#8208;step approach by harnessing geometric constraints. The approach is based on the confined epitaxy growth of WS2 in ordered mesoporous graphene derived from nanocrystal superlattices. The spherical curvature imposed by the graphitic mesopores enables the generation of uniform strain and S&#8208;vacancies in the as&#8208;grown WS2 nanosheets, and simultaneous manipulation of these two key parameters can be realized by simply adjusting the pore size. In addition, the formation of unique mesoporous WS2@graphene van der Waals heterostructures ensures the ready access of active sites. Fine&#8208;tuning the WS2 layer number, strain, and S&#8208;vacancies enables arguably the best&#8208;performing HER 2H&#8208;WS2 electrocatalysts ever reported. Density functional theory calculations indicate that compared with strain, S&#8208;vacancies play a more critical role in enhancing the HER activity.

      <title>Ammonia Thermal Treatment toward Topological Defects in Porous Carbon for Enhanced Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
      <dc:description>
NH3 thermal treatment on N&#8208;enriched carbon materials is adopted for creating a high density of topological defects by eliminating pyrrolic&#8208;N and pyridinic&#8208;N dopants from carbon materials. It is found that content of pyridinic&#8208;N and pyrrolic&#8208;N in the carbon precursor and the NH3 thermal&#8208;treatment temperature play critical roles in the creation of topological defects during the NH3&#8208;induced removal process, determining the CO2RR performance.








Abstract
Topological defects, with an asymmetric local electronic redistribution, are expected to locally tune the intrinsic catalytic activity of carbon materials. However, it is still challenging to deliberately create high&#8208;density homogeneous topological defects in carbon networks due to the high formation energy. Toward this end, an efficient NH3 thermal&#8208;treatment strategy is presented for thoroughly removing pyrrolic&#8208;N and pyridinic&#8208;N dopants from N&#8208;enriched porous carbon particles, to create high&#8208;density topological defects. The resultant topological defects are systematically investigated by near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure measurements and local density of states analysis, and the defect formation mechanism is revealed by reactive molecular dynamics simulations. Notably, the as&#8208;prepared porous carbon materials possess an enhanced electrocatalytic CO2 reduction performance, yielding a current density of 2.84 mA cm&#8722;2 with Faradaic efficiency of 95.2% for CO generation. Such a result is among the best performances reported for metal&#8208;free CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the edge pentagonal sites are the dominating active centers with the lowest free energy (&#916;G) for CO2 reduction. This work not only presents deep insights for the defect engineering of carbon&#8208;based materials but also improves the understanding of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on carbon defects.

Abstract
Deep tissue imaging in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window holds great promise for widespread fundamental research. However, inhomogeneous signal attenuation due to tissue absorption and scattering hampers its application for accurate in vivo biosensing. Here, lifetime&#8208;based in situ hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) detection in NIR&#8208;II region is presented using a tumor&#8208;microenvironment (peroxynitrite, ONOO&#8722;)&#8208;responsive lanthanide&#8211;cyanine F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) nanosensor. A specially designed ONOO&#8722;&#8208;responsive NIR&#8208;II dye, MY&#8208;1057, is synthesized as the FRET acceptor. Robust lifetime sensing is demonstrated to be independent of tissue penetration depth. Tumor lesions are accurately distinguished from normal tissue due to the recovery lifetime. Magnetic resonance imaging and liver dissection results illustrate the reliability of lifetime&#8208;based detection in single and multiple HCC models. Moreover, the ONOO&#8722; amount can be calculated according to the standard curve.

      <title>Low&#8208;Loss Organic Hyperbolic Materials in the Visible Spectral Range: A Joint Experimental and First&#8208;Principles Study</title>
      <dc:description>
A natural, low&#8208;loss organic hyperbolic material (OHM) in the visible spectral range is investigated. Hyperbolic dispersion is controlled by changing the alignment of the crystalline domains. The highly tunable optical properties make it possible to control the wavelength, which has a high figure of merit. Evidently, the OHM outperforms traditional hyperbolic materials in the visible spectral range.








Abstract
Hyperbolic media strengthen numerous attractive applications in optics such as super&#8208;resolution imaging, enhanced spontaneous emission, and nanoscale waveguiding. Natural hyperbolic materials exist at visible frequencies; however, implementations of these materials suffer substantial compromises resulting from the high loss in the currently available candidates. Here, the first experimental and theoretical investigation of regioregular poly(3&#8208;alkylthiophenes) (rr&#8208;P3ATs), a naturally low&#8208;loss organic hyperbolic material (OHM) in the visible frequency range, is shown. These hyperbolic properties arise from a highly ordered structure of layered electron&#8208;rich conjugated thiophene ring backbones separated by insulating alkyl side chains. The optical and electronic properties of the rr&#8208;P3AT can be tuned by controlling the degree of crystallinity and alkyl side chain length. First&#8208;principles calculations support the experimental observations, which result from the rr&#8208;P3AT's structural and optical anisotropy. Conveniently, rr&#8208;P3AT&#8208;based OHMs are facile to fabricate, flexible, and biocompatible, which may lead to tremendous new opportunities in a wide range of applications.

      <title>Infrared Permittivity of the Biaxial van der Waals Semiconductor &#945;&#8208;MoO3 from Near&#8208; and Far&#8208;Field Correlative Studies</title>
      <dc:description>
The IR permittivity of &#945;&#8208;MoO3 is extracted by correlative far&#8208; and near&#8208;field measurements using FTIR reflectance spectroscopy and s&#8208;SNOM polariton interferometry, thus providing a novel approach to extracting dielectric functions of nanomaterials. Moreover, through density functional theory, insights into the vibrational states dictating such permittivity are revealed.








Abstract
The biaxial van der Waals semiconductor &#945;&#8208;phase molybdenum trioxide (&#945;&#8208;MoO3) has recently received significant attention due to its ability to support highly anisotropic phonon polaritons (PhPs)&#8212;infrared (IR) light coupled to lattice vibrations&#8212;offering an unprecedented platform for controlling the flow of energy at the nanoscale. However, to fully exploit the extraordinary IR response of this material, an accurate dielectric function is required. Here, the accurate IR dielectric function of &#945;&#8208;MoO3 is reported by modeling far&#8208;field polarized IR reflectance spectra acquired on a single thick flake of this material. Unique to this work, the far&#8208;field model is refined by contrasting the experimental dispersion and damping of PhPs, revealed by polariton interferometry using scattering&#8208;type scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy (s&#8208;SNOM) on thin flakes of &#945;&#8208;MoO3, with analytical and transfer&#8208;matrix calculations, as well as full&#8208;wave simulations. Through these correlative efforts, exceptional quantitative agreement is attained to both far&#8208; and near&#8208;field properties for multiple flakes, thus providing strong verification of the accuracy of this model, while offering a novel approach to extracting dielectric functions of nanomaterials. In addition, by employing density functional theory (DFT), insights into the various vibrational states dictating the dielectric function model and the intriguing optical properties of &#945;&#8208;MoO3 are provided.

      <title>Canonic&#8208;Like HER Activity of Cr1&#8211;xMoxB2 Solid Solution: Overpowering Pt/C at High Current Density</title>
      <dc:description>
An unusual canonic&#8208;like behavior of the c lattice parameter in the AlB2&#8208;type solid solution Cr1&#8211;xMoxB2 is found to directly correlate to its hydrogen evolution reaction activity in 0.5 m H2SO4 solution. The best catalyst, Cr0.4Mo0.6B2, outperforms Pt/C at high current density. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the (110) mixed metal/B layer promotes hydrogen evolution more efficiently for x = 0.6, supporting the experimental results.








Abstract
Abundant transition metal borides are emerging as substitute electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts for noble metals. Herein, an unusual canonic&#8208;like behavior of the c lattice parameter in the AlB2&#8208;type solid solution Cr1&#8211;xMoxB2 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.75, 1) and its direct correlation to the HER activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution are reported. The activity increases with increasing x, reaching its maximum at x = 0.6 before decreasing again. At high current densities, Cr0.4Mo0.6B2 outperforms Pt/C, as it needs 180 mV less overpotential to drive an 800 mA cm&#8722;2 current density. Cr0.4Mo0.6B2 has excellent long&#8208;term stability and durability showing no significant activity loss after 5000 cycles and 25 h of operation in acid. First&#8208;principles calculations have correctly reproduced the nonlinear dependence of the c lattice parameter and have shown that the mixed metal/B layers, such as (110), promote hydrogen evolution more efficiently for x = 0.6, supporting the experimental results.

      <title>Chiral Materials: Chiral Surface Lattice Resonances (Adv. Mater. 22/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Optical activity of surface lattice resonances is demonstrated by Nicolas Vogel and co&#8208;workers in article number 2001330. The controlled arrangement of chiral crescent&#8208;shaped nanoantennae allows a selective response of the surface lattice resonances to the handedness of incident circularly polarized light. Modified colloidal lithtography enables the fabrication of cm2&#8208;scale substrates using a self&#8208;assembled poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide)&#8211;silica core&#8211;shell system as particle masks.

&lt;p&gt;Optical activity of surface lattice resonances is demonstrated by Nicolas Vogel and co&#8208;workers in article number &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.2020013302001330&lt;/a&gt;. The controlled arrangement of chiral crescent&#8208;shaped nanoantennae allows a selective response of the surface lattice resonances to the handedness of incident circularly polarized light. Modified colloidal lithtography enables the fabrication of cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;scale substrates using a self&#8208;assembled poly(&lt;i&gt;N &lt;/i&gt;&#8208;isopropylacrylamide)&#8211;silica core&#8211;shell system as particle masks.

      <title>Cancer Therapy: Harnessing the Formation of Natural Killer&#8211;Tumor Cell Immunological Synapses for Enhanced Therapeutic Effect in Solid Tumors (Adv. Mater. 22/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2000020, Won Jong Kim and co&#8208;workers describe a reinforced natural killer (ReNK) system, adopting the formation of NK&#8211;tumor cell immunological synapses (IS) as a trigger for delivery of tumor&#8208;specific chemotherapeutics. NK cells are decorated with the IS environment&#8208;responsive micellar system to ensure the release of drug when they attack cancer cells. The strategy enables the NK cells to inhibit the growth of solid tumors by efficient penetration of the delivered drug into the tumor tissue; otherwise, its penetration is hindered by the dense extracellular matrix of the tumor tissue.

      <dc:description>
Patterned magnetic nanostructures are foundational to magnetic memory and logic devices. In article number 2001080, Antonio B. Mei, Gregory D. Fuchs, and co&#8208;workers design a platform for reconfigurable magnetic nanostructures in FeRh by tuning the transition temperature from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic such that both phases are stable at room temperature. Focused laser heating is used to write ferromagnetic patterns of arbitrary shape at ultrafast speeds, which can be erased by cooling below room temperature.

      <title>A Zeolitic&#8208;Imidazole Frameworks&#8208;Derived Interconnected Macroporous Carbon Matrix for Efficient Oxygen Electrocatalysis in Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
An interconnected macroporous carbon matrix is prepared by the pyrolysis of a silica&#8208;templated zeolitic&#8208;imidazole framework assembly. The interconnected macroporous structure with abundant accessible active sites significantly improves the mass transport and accelerates the diffusion of reactants, thus contributing to efficient and robust bifunctionality for oxygen electrocatalysis and achieving long&#8208;life rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Nanostructures derived from zeolitic&#8208;imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) gain much interest in bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis. However, they are not satisfied well for long&#8208;life rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries due to the limited single particle morphology. Herein, the preparation of an interconnected macroporous carbon matrix with a well&#8208;defined 3D architecture by the pyrolysis of silica templated ZIF&#8208;67 assemblies is reported. The matrix catalyst assembled zinc&#8211;air battery exhibits a high power density of 221.1 mW cm&#8722;2 as well as excellent stability during 500 discharging/charging cycles, surpassing that of a commercial Pt/C assembled battery. The synergistic effect from the interconnected macroporous structure together with abundant cobalt&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon active sites justify the excellent electrocatalytic activity and battery performance. Considering the advanced nanostructures and performance, the as&#8208;synthesized hybrid would be promising for rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries and other energy technologies. This work may also provide significant concept in the view of electrocatalysis design for long&#8208;life battery.

      <title>A Flexi&#8208;PEGDA Upconversion Implant for Wireless Brain Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Biocompatible upconversion hydrogel implants synergistically conserve the light guiding and near&#8208;infrared transducing properties into a wireless light&#8208;delivery implant. Such hydrogel&#8208;based upconversion designs are explored to activate clinically relevant photosensitizer in wireless photodynamic therapy of glioblastoma multiforme. Upconversion implantable is potentially translatable to other phototherapies and as medical implants.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) activatable upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) enable wireless&#8208;based phototherapies by converting deep&#8208;tissue&#8208;penetrating NIR to visible light. UCNPs are therefore ideal as wireless transducers for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of deep&#8208;sited tumors. However, the retention of unsequestered UCNPs in tissue with minimal options for removal limits their clinical translation. To address this shortcoming, biocompatible UCNPs implants are developed to deliver upconversion photonic properties in a flexible, optical guide design. To enhance its translatability, the UCNPs implant is constructed with an FDA&#8208;approved poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) core clad with fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP). The emission spectrum of the UCNPs implant can be tuned to overlap with the absorption spectra of the clinically relevant photosensitizer, 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (5&#8208;ALA). The UCNPs implant can wirelessly transmit upconverted visible light till 8 cm in length and in a bendable manner even when implanted underneath the skin or scalp. With this system, it is demonstrated that NIR&#8208;based chronic PDT is achievable in an untethered and noninvasive manner in a mouse xenograft glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) model. It is postulated that such encapsulated UCNPs implants represent a translational shift for wireless deep&#8208;tissue phototherapy by enabling sequestration of UCNPs without compromising wireless deep&#8208;tissue light delivery.

Abstract
The progress of the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things in the past few years has necessitated the support of high&#8208;performance sensors. Schottky&#8208;contacted nanowire sensors have attracted considerable attention owing to their high sensitivity and fast response time. Their progress is reviewed here, based on several kinds of important nanowires, for applications such as bio/chemical sensors, gas sensors, photodetectors, and strain sensors. Although Schottky&#8208;contacted nanowire sensors deliver excellent performance in these fields, they can be further improved by various methods, including defect engineering, surface modification, the piezotronic effect, and the piezophototronic effect, all of which are discussed here. With regard to practical applications, further efforts are required to address challenges such as the stability, selectivity, ultrafast response, multifunctionality, flexibility, distributed energy supply, and sustainability of Schottky&#8208;contacted nanowire sensors. Finally, future perspectives and solutions are discussed.

Abstract
Wood is a sustainable and renewable material that naturally has a hierarchical structure. Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are the three main components of wood. The unique physical and chemical properties of wood and its derivatives endow them with great potential as resources to fabricate advanced materials for use in bioengineering, flexible electronics, and clean energy. Nevertheless, comprehensive information on wood&#8208;derived carbon and light&#8208;emitting materials is scarce, although much excellent progress has been made in this area. Here, the unique characteristics of wood&#8208;derived carbon and light&#8208;emitting materials are summarized, with regard to the fabrication principles, properties, applications, challenges, and future prospects of wood&#8208;derived carbon and light&#8208;emitting materials, with the aim of deepening the understanding and inspiring new ideas in the area of advanced wood&#8208;based materials.

      <title>Tunable Magnetic Antiskyrmion Size and Helical Period from Nanometers to Micrometers in a D2d Heusler Compound</title>
      <dc:description>
The size of an antiskyrmion in a D2d Heusler compound is observed to vary significantly by more than one order of magnitude as the thickness of the host material is varied. Experiments establish that the antiskyrmion is preserved even in micrometer&#8208;thick samples. These properties are a result of an interplay between Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya exchange and magnetic dipolar interactions.








Abstract
Skyrmions and antiskyrmions are magnetic nano&#8208;objects with distinct chiral, noncollinear spin textures that are found in various magnetic systems with crystal symmetries that give rise to specific Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya exchange vectors. These magnetic nano&#8208;objects are associated with closely related helical spin textures that can form in the same material. The skyrmion size and the period of the helix are generally considered as being determined, in large part, by the ratio of the magnitude of the Heisenberg to that of the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya exchange interaction. In this work, it is shown by real&#8208;space magnetic imaging that the helix period &#955; and the size of the antiskyrmion daSk in the D2d compound Mn1.4PtSn can be systematically tuned by more than an order of magnitude from &#8776;100 nm to more than 1.1 &#181;m&#8197;by varying the thickness of the lamella in which they are observed. The chiral spin texture is verified to be preserved even up to micrometer&#8208;thick layers. This extreme size tunability is shown to arise from long&#8208;range magnetodipolar interactions, which typically play a much less important role for B20 skyrmions. This tunability in size makes antiskyrmions very attractive for technological applications.

      <title>Disorder&#8208;Induced Signal Filtering with Topological Metamaterials</title>
      <dc:description>
Contrary to the general intuition that disorder is detrimental to analog devices, it is shown that, in certain topological systems, strong randomness can be leveraged as an asset to trigger desired analog filtering operations.








Abstract
Disorder, ubiquitously present in realistic structures, is generally thought to disturb the performance of analog wave devices, as it often causes strong multiple scattering effects that largely arrest wave transportation. Contrary to this general view, here, it is shown that, in some wave systems with nontrivial topological character, strong randomness can be highly beneficial, acting as a powerful stimulator to enable desired analog filtering operations. This is achieved in a topological Anderson sonic crystal that, in the regime of dominating randomness, provides a well&#8208;defined filtering response characterized by a Lorentzian spectral line&#8208;shape. The theoretical and experimental results, serving as the first realization of topological Anderson insulator phase in acoustics, suggest the striking possibility of achieving specific, nonrandom analog filtering operations by adding randomness to clean structures.

      <title>Confinement of Dyes inside Boron Nitride Nanotubes: Photostable and Shifted Fluorescence down to the Near Infrared</title>
      <dc:description>
Templating fluorescent dyes into specific aggregation states using dye encapsulation into small&#8208;diameter boron nitride nanotubes (dyes@BNNT), this study unlocks the concept of a luminescent hybrid nanomaterial exhibiting bright emission, low toxicity, and resistance to chemical degradation and photobleaching. The dyes@BNNTs are used in the design of multimodal nanoprobes for bioimaging in a wide optical range from visible to near infrared.








Abstract
Fluorescence is ubiquitous in life science and used in many fields of research ranging from ecology to medicine. Among the most common fluorogenic compounds, dyes are being exploited in bioimaging for their outstanding optical properties from UV down to the near IR (NIR). However, dye molecules are often toxic to living organisms and photodegradable, which limits the time window for in vivo experiments. Here, it is demonstrated that organic dye molecules are passivated and photostable when they are encapsulated inside a boron nitride nanotube (dyes@BNNT). The results show that the BNNTs drive an aggregation of the encapsulated dyes, which induces a redshifted fluorescence from visible to NIR&#8208;II. The fluorescence remains strong and stable, exempt of bleaching and blinking, over a time scale longer than that of free dyes by more than 104. This passivation also reduces the toxicity of the dyes and induces exceptional chemical robustness, even in harsh conditions. These properties are highlighted in bioimaging where the dyes@BNNT nanohybrids are used as fluorescent nanoprobes for in vivo monitoring of Daphnia Pulex microorganisms and for diffusion tracking on human hepatoblastoma cells with two&#8208;photon imaging.

      <title>Recent Advances in Conjugated Polymers for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecular design strategies of various conjugated polymers for photocatalytic water splitting are reviewed. The structure&#8211;property relationships between functional groups, building blocks, and photocatalytic water splitting in a variety of conjugated polymers are explored. Furthermore, key factors that contribute to a highly efficient polymer photocatalyst in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven water splitting are outlined.








Abstract
With the ambition of solving the challenges of the shortage of fossil fuels and their associated environmental pollution, visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen using semiconductor photocatalysts has emerged as a promising technology to provide environmentally friendly energy vectors. Among the current library of developed photocatalysts, organic conjugated polymers present unique advantages of sufficient light&#8208;absorption efficiency, excellent stability, tunable electronic properties, and economic applicability. As a class of rising photocatalysts, organic conjugated polymers offer high flexibility in tuning the framework of the backbone and porosity to fulfill the requirements for photocatalytic applications. In the past decade, significant progress has been made in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven water splitting employing organic conjugated polymers. The recent development of the structural design principles of organic conjugated polymers (including linear, crosslinked, and supramolecular self&#8208;assembled polymers) toward efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, and overall water splitting is described, thus providing a comprehensive reference for the field. Finally, current challenges and perspectives are also discussed.

      <title>Photoprogrammable Mesogenic Soft Helical Architectures: A Promising Avenue toward Future Chiro&#8208;Optics</title>
      <dc:description>
Photoprogrammable mesogenic helical soft materials with both photosensitive and mesogenic moieties in molecules possess typical chiro&#8208;optical properties, showing handedness dependency on the transmission, reflection, and absorption of an incident circularly polarized light (photonic bandgap and circular dichroism). This can be modulated readily by light irradiation, thus paving the way toward future chiro&#8208;optical devices and systems.








Abstract
Mesogenic soft materials, having single or multiple mesogen moieties per molecule, commonly exhibit typical self&#8208;organization characteristics, which promotes the formation of elegant helical superstructures or supramolecular assemblies in chiral environments. Such helical superstructures play key roles in the propagation of circularly polarized light and display optical properties with prominent handedness, that is, chiro&#8208;optical properties. The leveraging of light to program the chiro&#8208;optical properties of such mesogenic helical soft materials by homogeneously dispersing photosensitive chiral material into an achiral soft system or covalently connecting photochromic moieties to the molecules has attracted considerable attention in terms of materials, properties, and potential applications and has been a thriving topic in both fundamental science and application engineering. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies are described in terms of the material design, synthesis, properties, and modulation of photoprogrammable chiro&#8208;optical mesogenic soft helical architectures. Additionally, the scientific issues and technical problems that hinder further development of these materials for use in various fields are outlined and discussed. Such photoprogrammable mesogenic soft helical materials are competitive candidates for use in stimulus&#8208;controllable chiro&#8208;optical devices with high optical efficiency, stable optical properties, and easy miniaturization, facilitating the future integration and systemization of chiro&#8208;optical chips in photonics, photochemistry, biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, and beyond.

      <title>Emerging Bioinspired Artificial Woods</title>
      <dc:description>
Artificial woods have emerged as a novel kind of wood&#8208;inspired engineering material with almost exactly the same channel microstructures and similar wall components. The performances of artificial woods depend on both the oriented channel and wall designs. The rational combination of other engineering polymers and channel&#8208;making techniques hold promise to develop more useful artificial woods.








Abstract
As an abundant natural resource, wood has gained great attention for thousands of years, spanning from the primitive construction materials to the modern high&#8208;added&#8208;value engineering materials. The unique delicate microstructures and the wonderful properties (e.g., low&#8208;density, high strength and stiffness, good toughness, and environmental sustainability) have made wood a natural source of inspiration that guides researchers to invent various wood&#8208;inspired materials. Herein, as an emerging material system, bioinspired artificial wood, with similar cellular structures and comparable mechanical properties, is discussed in the view of the design concept, fabrication strategy, properties, and possible applications. The present challenges and further research opportunities are also presented for artificial woods to thrive. To achieve the final eco&#8208;friendly artificial wood, more endeavors should be made in biomaterials and biodegradable or recyclable engineering of polymers to gain high mechanical properties and environmental sustainability simultaneously.

      <title>Ultralong&#8208;Range Energy Transport in a Disordered Organic Semiconductor at Room Temperature Via Coherent Exciton&#8208;Polariton Propagation</title>
      <dc:description>
Long&#8208;range excitation energy transport over 100 &#181;m is demonstrated in an amorphous organic thin film on a distributed Bragg reflector. The exciton exhibits ultrastrong coupling with a Bloch surface wave photon, overcoming short exciton diffusion lengths of disordered material systems. The halo&#8208;like polariton propagation pattern is explained by self&#8208;interference.








Abstract
Amorphous molecular solids are inherently disordered, exhibiting strong exciton localization. Optical microcavities containing such disordered excitonic materials have been theoretically shown to support both propagating and localized exciton&#8208;polariton modes. Here, the ultrastrong coupling of a Bloch surface wave photon and molecular excitons in a disordered organic thin film at room temperature is demonstrated, where the major fraction of the polaritons are propagating states. The delocalized exciton&#8208;polariton has a group velocity as high as 3 &#215; 107 m s&#8211;1 and a lifetime of 500 fs, leading to propagation distances of over 100 &#181;m from the excitation source. The polariton intensity shows a halo&#8208;like pattern that is due to self&#8208;interference of the polariton mode, from which a coherence length of 20 &#181;m is derived and is correlated with phase breaking by polariton scattering. The demonstration of ultralong&#8208;range exciton&#8208;polariton transport at room temperature promises new photonic and optoelectronic applications such as efficient energy transfer in disordered condensed matter systems.

      <title>MXene Materials for Designing Advanced Separation Membranes</title>
      <dc:description>
The current status and future potential of MXene&#8208;based separation membranes is reviewed. After providing a basis on MXene synthesis and membrane design, separation applications of MXene&#8208;based membranes are introduced, namely gas separation, water treatment (e.g., solute removals and bacterial disinfection), desalination, and organic solvent purification. As future perspectives, polymer nanocomposites, electroresponsive/reactive membranes, and simulation&#8208;driven membrane design are discussed.








Abstract
MXenes are emerging rapidly as a new family of multifunctional nanomaterials with prospective applications rivaling that of graphenes. Herein, a timely account of the design and performance evaluation of MXene&#8208;based membranes is provided. First, the preparation and physicochemical characteristics of MXenes are outlined, with a focus on exfoliation, dispersion stability, and processability, which are crucial factors for membrane fabrication. Then, different formats of MXene&#8208;based membranes in the literature are introduced, comprising pristine or intercalated nanolaminates and polymer&#8208;based nanocomposites. Next, the major membrane processes so far pursued by MXenes are evaluated, covering gas separation, wastewater treatment, desalination, and organic solvent purification. The potential utility of MXenes in phase inversion and interfacial polymerization, as well as layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly for the preparation of nanocomposite membranes, is also critically discussed. Looking forward, exploiting the high electrical conductivity and catalytic activity of certain MXenes is put into perspective for niche applications that are not easily achievable by other nanomaterials. Furthermore, the benefits of simulation/modeling approaches for designing MXene&#8208;based membranes are exemplified. Overall, critical insights are provided for materials science and membrane communities to navigate better while exploring the potential of MXenes for developing advanced separation membranes.

      <title>Cathode Architectures for Rechargeable Ion Batteries: Progress and Perspectives</title>
      <dc:description>
High areal energy and power are mutually exclusive in thin&#8208;film electrodes but can be simultaneously acquired through designing 3D electrode architectures. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress of cathode architectures in various rechargeable ion battery technologies is summarized, focusing on different production strategies, areal loading, and mechanical understanding, and future research directions and prospects in this exciting field are discussed.








Abstract
To satisfy the rising demand for energy, battery electrodes with higher loading, to simultaneously increase areal energy and power, are necessary. Nevertheless, in conventional thin&#8208;film electrodes, there is mutual exclusion between energy (capacity) and power. Increasing the thickness of electrodes alone is not feasible since this will lead to reductions in ion&#8208;diffusion efficiency, as well as electrode flexibility. To address this difficulty, 3D electrode architectures, especially cathode architectures, are proposed to pave a new path for the design and optimization of battery devices. Recent research suggests that 3D cathode architectures may optimize the configuration and engineering processes of battery technologies. Herein, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress of cathode architectures in various rechargeable&#8208;ion&#8208;battery technologies is summarized. Emphasis is placed on the different architecture strategies, areal loading, and mechanical understanding of 3D electrodes. Upcoming research directions are further outlined for future development in this field.

      <title>Spatiotemporal Dielectric Metasurfaces for Unidirectional Propagation and Reconfigurable Steering of Terahertz Beams</title>
      <dc:description>
A spatiotemporal dielectric metasurface for unidirectional beam steering of terahertz radiation is experimentally demonstrated at an ultrafast timescale. Backscattering is eliminated under Kerker's condition, enabling highly directional terahertz beams. The optically tunable silicon&#8208;based spatiotemporal metasurface holds promise for designing low&#8208;loss, reconfigurable terahertz meta&#8208;antennas for sixth&#8208;generation wireless communication, ultrafast beam&#8208;forming, and data processing.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation devices for low&#8208;latency and seamless communication are envisioned to revolutionize information processing, which would directly impact human lives, technologies, and societies. The ever&#8208;increasing demand for wireless data traffic can be fulfilled by the terahertz band, which has received tremendous attention as the final frontier of the radio spectrum. However, attenuation due to atmospheric humidity and free&#8208;space path loss significantly limits terahertz signal propagation. High&#8208;gain antennas with directional radiation and reconfigurable beam steering are indispensable for loss compensation and terahertz signal processing, which are associated with spatial and temporal dimensions, respectively. Here, experimental demonstration of a spatiotemporal dielectric metasurface for unidirectional propagation and ultrafast spatial beam steering of terahertz waves is shown. The spatial dimension of the metasurface provides a solution to eliminate backscattering of collimated unidirectional propagation of the terahertz wave with steerable directionality. Temporal modulation of the spatial optical properties enables ultrafast reconfigurable beam steering. Silicon&#8208;based spatiotemporal devices amalgamate the rich physics of metasurfaces and technologies that are promising for overcoming the bottlenecks of future terahertz communication, such as high&#8208;speed and secure wireless data transmission, beamforming and ultrafast data processing.

Abstract
Spintronic elements based on spin transfer torque have emerged with potential for on&#8208;chip memory, but they suffer from large energy dissipation due to the large current densities required. In contrast, an electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven magneto&#8208;electric storage element can operate with capacitive displacement charge and potentially reach 1&#8211;10 &#181;J cm&#8722;2 switching operation. Here, magneto&#8208;electric switching of a magnetoresistive element is shown, operating at or below 200 mV, with a pathway to get down to 100 mV. A combination of phase detuning is utilized via isovalent La substitution and thickness scaling in multiferroic BiFeO3 to scale the switching energy density to &#8776;10 &#181;J cm&#8722;2. This work provides a template to achieve attojoule&#8208;class nonvolatile memories.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spintronic elements based on spin transfer torque have emerged with potential for on&#8208;chip memory, but they suffer from large energy dissipation due to the large current densities required. In contrast, an electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven magneto&#8208;electric storage element can operate with capacitive displacement charge and potentially reach 1&#8211;10 &#181;J cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; switching operation. Here, magneto&#8208;electric switching of a magnetoresistive element is shown, operating at or below 200 mV, with a pathway to get down to 100 mV. A combination of phase detuning is utilized via isovalent La substitution and thickness scaling in multiferroic BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to scale the switching energy density to &#8776;10 &#181;J cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work provides a template to achieve attojoule&#8208;class nonvolatile memories.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Programmable Reversible Shape Transformation of Hydrogels Based on Transient Structural Anisotropy</title>
      <dc:description>
Programmable reversible shape transformation is realized in copolymer hydrogels comprising thermoresponsive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) segments and hydrophobic aggregation domains. The programmable nature allows easy access to diversified transformation of macroscopic shapes, extending the scope beyond the current hydrogel systems. The mechanism relies on the oriented globule&#8208;to&#8208;coil transition of PNIPAM chains along the deformed hydrophobic domains induced via programming.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive shape&#8208;transforming hydrogels have shown great potential toward various engineering applications including soft robotics and microfluidics. Despite significant progress in designing hydrogels with ever more sophisticated shape&#8208;morphing behaviors, an ultimate goal yet to be fulfilled is programmable reversible shape transformation. It is reported here that transient structural anisotropy can be programmed into copolymer hydrogels of N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide and stearyl acrylate. Structural anisotropy arises from the deformed hydrophobic domains of the stearyl groups after thermomechanical programming, which serves as a template for the reversible globule&#8208;to&#8208;coil transition of the poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) chains. The structural anisotropy is transient and can be erased upon cooling. This allows repeated programming for reversible shape transformation, an unknown feature for the current hydrogels. The programmable reversible transformation is expected to greatly extend the technical scope for hydrogel&#8208;based devices.

      <title>A Lithium Metal Anode Surviving Battery Cycling Above 200 &#176;C</title>
      <dc:description>
A Li5B4/Li composite is explored as a stable anode for rechargeable high&#8208;temperature Li metal batteries. Benefiting from the effect of capillary and physical confinement of the porous lithiophilic Li5B4 framework for liquid metallic Li, the Li5B4/Li composite maintains its initial structure and shows stable electrochemical cycling at 200 &#176;C with a regular cell configuration.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal electrode cannot endure elevated temperature (e.g., &gt;200 &#176;C) with the regular battery configuration due to its low melting point (180.5 &#176;C) and high reactivity, which restricts its application in high&#8208;temperature Li metal batteries for energy storage and causes safety concerns for regular ambient&#8208;temperature Li metal batteries. Herein, this work reports a Li5B4/Li composite featuring a 3D Li5B4 fibrillar framework filled with metallic Li, which maintains its initial structure at 325 &#176;C in Ar atmosphere without leakage of the liquid Li. The capillary force caused by the porous structure of the Li4B5 fibrillar framework, together with its lithiophilic surface, restricts the leakage of liquid metallic Li and enables good thermal tolerance of the Li5B4/Li composite. Thus, it can be facilely operated for rechargeable high&#8208;temperature Li metal batteries. Li5B4/Li electrodes are coupled with a garnet&#8208;type ceramic electrolyte (Li6.5La3Zr0.5Ta1.5O12) to fabricate symmetric cells, which exhibit stable Li stripping/plating behaviors with low overpotential of &#8776;6 mV at 200 &#176;C using a regular sandwich&#8208;type cell configuration. This work affords new insights into realizing a stable Li metal anode for high&#8208;temperature Li metal batteries with a simple battery configuration and high safety, which is different from traditional molten&#8208;salt Li metal batteries using a pristine metallic Li anode.

      <title>Highly Thermotolerant Metal Halide Perovskite Solids</title>
      <dc:description>
Superior thermo&#8208;tolerant and highly emissive perovskite solids are attained via a straightforward heterogeneous interfacial method. The resultant materials maintain high quantum efficiency even after heating over 150 &#176;C for 22 h. The constructed w&#8208;LED exhibits recorded long temperature sustainable lifetime over 1100 h and its working current can go up to 300 mA.








Abstract
By virtue of their narrow emission bands, near&#8208;unity quantum yield, and low fabrication cost, metal halide perovskites hold great promise in numerous aspects of optoelectronic applications, including solid&#8208;state lighting, lasing, and displays. Despite such promise, the poor temperature tolerance and suboptimal quantum yield of the existing metal halide perovskites in their solid state have severely limited their practical applications. Here, a straightforward heterogeneous interfacial method to develop superior thermotolerant and highly emissive solid&#8208;state metal halide perovskites is reported and their use as long&#8208;lasting high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;input&#8208;power durable solid&#8208;state light&#8208;emitting diodes is illustrated. It is found that the resultant materials can well maintain their superior quantum efficiency after heating at a temperature over 150 &#176;C for up to 22 h. A white light&#8208;emitting diode (w&#8208;LED) constructed from the metal halide perovskite solid exhibits superior temperature sustainable lifetime over 1100 h. The w&#8208;LED also displays a highly durable high&#8208;power&#8208;driving capability, and its working current can go up to 300 mA. It is believed that such highly thermotolerant metal halide perovskites will unleash the possibility of a wide variety of high&#8208;power and high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state lighting, lasing, and display devices that have been limited by existing methods.

      <title>Identifying Dense NiSe2/CoSe2 Heterointerfaces Coupled with Surface High&#8208;Valence Bimetallic Sites for Synergistically Enhanced Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Heterostructured NiSe2/CoSe2 nanohybrids with different interfacial densities are synthesized via an innovative strategy of successive ion injection. Advanced synchrotron techniques and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the dense nanointerface structure can enhance the performance for oxygen electrocatalysis via increasing the intrinsic reactivity of metallic atoms and introducing the synergistic effect with surface electrochemically in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed oxides/hydroxides.








Abstract
Constructing heterostructures with abundant interfaces is essential for integrating the multiple functionalities in single entities. Herein, the synthesis of NiSe2/CoSe2 heterostructures with different interfacial densities via an innovative strategy of successive ion injection is reported. The resulting hybrid electrocatalyst with dense heterointerfaces exhibits superior electrocatalytic properties in an alkaline electrolyte, superior to other benchmarks and precious metal catalysts. Advanced synchrotron techniques, post structural characterizations, and density functional theory (DFT) simulations reveal that the introduction of atomic&#8208;level interfaces can lower the oxidation overpotential of bimetallic Ni and Co active sites (whereas Ni2+ can be more easily activated than Co2+) and induce the electronic interaction between the core selenides and surface in situ generated oxides/hydroxides, which play a critical role in synergistically reducing energetic barriers and accelerating reaction kinetics for catalyzing the oxygen evolution. Hence, the heterointerface structure facilitates the catalytic performance enhancement via increasing the intrinsic reactivity of metallic atoms and enhancing the synergistic effect between the inner selenides and surface oxidation species. This work not only complements the understanding on the origins of the activity of electrocatalysts based on metal selenides, but also sheds light on further surface and interfacial engineering of advanced hybrid materials.

      <title>Designing Outside the Box: Unlocking the Geometric Freedom of Melt Electrowriting using Microscale Layer Shifting</title>
      <dc:description>
Melt electrowriting with offsets in printing trajectory can control layer&#8208;on&#8208;layer placement to fabricate tilted and even horizontal walls without support structures. Microscale layer shifting enables complex 3D printed designs, such as sinusoidal walls with adjustable mechanical properties, overhangs, branching and texturing of walls, and a variety of novel scaffolds, ultimately providing a powerful design tool for plethora of applications.








Abstract
Melt electrowriting, a high&#8208;resolution additive manufacturing technology, has so far been developed with vertical stacking of fiber layers, with a printing trajectory that is constant for each layer. In this work, microscale layer shifting is introduced through deliberately offsetting the printing trajectory for each printed layer. Inaccuracies during the printing of sinusoidal walls are corrected via layer shifting, resulting in accurate control of their geometry and mechanical properties. Furthermore, more substantial layer shifting allows stacking of fiber layers in a horizontal manner, overcoming the electrostatic autofocusing effect that favors vertical layer stacking. Novel nonlinear geometries, such as overhangs, wall texturing and branching, and smooth and abrupt changes in printing trajectory are presented, demonstrating the flexibility of the layer shifting approach beyond the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The practice of microscale layer shifting for melt electrowriting enables more complex geometries that promise to have a profound impact on the development of products in a broad range of applications.

     alt="Designing Outside the Box: Unlocking the Geometric Freedom of Melt Electrowriting using Microscale Layer Shifting"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melt electrowriting with offsets in printing trajectory can control layer&#8208;on&#8208;layer placement to fabricate tilted and even horizontal walls without support structures. Microscale layer shifting enables complex 3D printed designs, such as sinusoidal walls with adjustable mechanical properties, overhangs, branching and texturing of walls, and a variety of novel scaffolds, ultimately providing a powerful design tool for plethora of applications.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melt electrowriting, a high&#8208;resolution additive manufacturing technology, has so far been developed with vertical stacking of fiber layers, with a printing trajectory that is constant for each layer. In this work, microscale layer shifting is introduced through deliberately offsetting the printing trajectory for each printed layer. Inaccuracies during the printing of sinusoidal walls are corrected via layer shifting, resulting in accurate control of their geometry and mechanical properties. Furthermore, more substantial layer shifting allows stacking of fiber layers in a horizontal manner, overcoming the electrostatic autofocusing effect that favors vertical layer stacking. Novel nonlinear geometries, such as overhangs, wall texturing and branching, and smooth and abrupt changes in printing trajectory are presented, demonstrating the flexibility of the layer shifting approach beyond the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The practice of microscale layer shifting for melt electrowriting enables more complex geometries that promise to have a profound impact on the development of products in a broad range of applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A General Hypoxia&#8208;Responsive Molecular Container for Tumor&#8208;Targeted Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Carboxylated azocalix[4]arene is designed as a hypoxia&#8208;responsive molecular container, which affords strong binding toward a series of chemotherapeutic drugs, and improves the drugs' solubility and stability, demonstrating its universality as a supramolecular drug carrier. Taking one supramolecular prodrug as an example, the efficacy of this hypoxia&#8208;targeted therapy is validated in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Enhanced drug delivery can improve the therapeutic efficacy of drugs and help overcome side effects. However, many reported drug&#8208;delivery systems are too complex and irreproducible for practical use. In this work, the design of a hypoxia&#8208;responsive molecular container based on calixarene, called CAC4A, which presents a significant advance in practical, hypoxia&#8208;targeted drug&#8208;delivery, is reported. CAC4A enables a wide variety of clinical drugs to be quantitatively loaded to improve their solubility and stability, as well as enable the administration of reduced doses. Furthermore, as a result of its azo functional groups, which are sensitive to reduction within a hypoxic environment, it is possible to achieve tumor&#8208;targeted drug&#8208;release with reduced side effects. CAC4A fulfils all essential requirements for a drug&#8208;delivery system in addition to multiple advantages, including facile preparation, well&#8208;defined molecular weight, and structure, and universal applicability. Such features collectively enable supramolecular prodrugs to be formulated simply and reproducibly, with potential for bench&#8208;to&#8208;bedside translation. Moreover, CAC4A is amenable to other therapy modalities and can be facilely decorated with functional groups and hybridized with nanomaterials, providing ample possibilities for its role in future drug&#8208;delivery systems.

      <title>Chemical Bonding in Chalcogenides: The Concept of Multicenter Hyperbonding</title>
      <dc:description>
The concept of multicenter (three&#8208;center/four&#8208;electron) hyperbonding is introduced to elucidate the unique properties of (telluride&#8208;based) chalcogenides, in particular, used for phase&#8208;change memory applications. The characteristic features of hyperbonding, induced by the stabilization interaction of a lone pair with an adjacent antibonding orbital, establish a structure/property relationship from which a diversity of the material properties can be comprehensively understood.








Abstract
The precise nature of chemical&#8208;bonding interactions in amorphous, and crystalline, chalcogenides is still unclear due to the complexity arising from the delocalization of bonding, and nonbonding, electrons. Although an increasing degree of electron delocalization for elements down a column of the periodic table is widely recognized, its influence on chemical&#8208;bonding interactions, and on consequent material properties, of chalcogenides has not previously been comprehensively understood from an atomistic point of view. Here, a chemical&#8208;bonding framework is provided for understanding the behavior of chalcogenides (and, in principle, other lone&#8208;pair materials) by studying prototypical telluride nonvolatile&#8208;memory, &#8220;phase&#8208;change&#8221; materials (PCMs), and related chalcogenide compounds, via density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory molecular&#8208;dynamics (DFT&#8208;MD) simulations. Identification of the presence of previously unconsidered multicenter &#8220;hyperbonding&#8221; (lone&#8208;pair&#8211;antibonding&#8208;orbital) interactions elucidates not only the origin of various material properties, and their contrast in magnitude between amorphous and crystalline phases, but also the very similar chemical&#8208;bonding nature between crystalline PCMs and one of the bonding subgroups (with the same bond length) found in amorphous PCMs, in marked contrast to existing viewpoints. The structure&#8211;property relationship established from this new bonding&#8208;interaction perspective will help in designing improved chalcogenide materials for diverse applications, based on a fundamental chemical&#8208;bonding point of view.

      <title>Assembly of Foldable 3D Microstructures Using Graphene Hinges</title>
      <dc:description>
Graphene is demonstrated to be able to form essential structures in complex, 3D micro/nanostructures with features that cannot be easily achieved with conventional materials and processes. Specifically, graphene serves as &#8220;hinge&#8221; features that enable reversible transformation of 2D precursors into 3D&#8208;folded micro/nanostructures that have embedded conductive features, without an adverse effect on the electrical properties.








Abstract
Origami/kirigami&#8208;inspired 3D assembly approaches have recently attracted attention for a variety of applications, such as advanced optoelectronic devices and biomedical sensors. The results reported here describe an approach to construct classes of multiple foldable 3D microstructures that involve deformations that typical conductive materials, such as conventional metal films, cannot tolerate. Atomically thin graphene sheets serve as folding hinges during a process of 2D to 3D conversion via a deterministic buckling process. The exceptional mechanical properties of graphene enable the controlled, geometric transformation of a 2D precursor bonded at selective sites on a prestretched elastomer into folded 3D microstructures, in a reversible manner without adverse effects on the electrical properties. Experimental and computational investigations of the folding mechanisms for such types of 3D objects reveal the underlying physics and the dependence of the process on the thickness of the graphene/supporting films that define the hinges.

Abstract
Wearable interfaces are central to multiple healthcare and wellness strategies encompassing diet and nutrition, personalized health monitoring, and performance optimization. Specifically, the advent of flexible electronic formats coupled with microfluidic interfaces has resulted in sophisticated conformal devices for biofluid sampling and quantification. Here, a complementary approach is presented to wearable sensing by using a large&#8208;scale, conformal, distributed format that relies on the use of biomaterial&#8208;based inks to print and stabilize deterministic patterns of biochemical reporters with high resolution.

      <title>Engineering Co2MnAlxSi1&#8722;x Heusler Compounds as a Model System to Correlate Spin Polarization, Intrinsic Gilbert Damping, and Ultrafast Demagnetization</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;crystalline&#8208;quality Heusler compounds Co2MnAlxSi1&#8211;x are grown. Correlation between the degree of spin polarization at the Fermi energy (ranging from 60% to 100%) and the Gilbert damping (ranging from 1.1 &#215; 10&#8722;3 to 4 &#215; 10&#8722;4) is obtained. An inverse relationship between demagnetization time and Gilbert damping is established.








Abstract
Engineering of magnetic materials for developing better spintronic applications relies on the control of two key parameters: the spin polarization and the Gilbert damping, responsible for the spin angular momentum dissipation. Both of them are expected to affect the ultrafast magnetization dynamics occurring on the femtosecond timescale. Here, engineered Co2MnAlxSi1&#8208;x Heusler compounds are used to adjust the degree of spin polarization at the Fermi energy, P, from 60% to 100% and to investigate how they correlate with the damping. It is experimentally demonstrated that the damping decreases when increasing the spin polarization from 1.1 &#215; 10&#8722;3 for Co2MnAl with 63% spin polarization to an ultralow value of 4.6 &#215; 10&#8722;4 for the half&#8208;metallic ferromagnet Co2MnSi. This allows the investigation of the relation between these two parameters and the ultrafast demagnetization time characterizing the loss of magnetization occurring after femtosecond laser pulse excitation. The demagnetization time is observed to be inversely proportional to 1 &#8211; P and, as a consequence, to the magnetic damping, which can be attributed to the similarity of the spin angular momentum dissipation processes responsible for these two effects. Altogether, the high&#8208;quality Heusler compounds allow control over the band structure and therefore the channel for spin angular momentum dissipation.

It is experimentally demonstrated that the damping decreases when increasing the spin polarization from 1.1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; for Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnAl with 63% spin polarization to an ultralow value of 4.6 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; for the half&#8208;metallic ferromagnet Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnSi. This allows the investigation of the relation between these two parameters and the ultrafast demagnetization time characterizing the loss of magnetization occurring after femtosecond laser pulse excitation. The demagnetization time is observed to be inversely proportional to 1 &#8211; &lt;i&gt;P &lt;/i&gt; and, as a consequence, to the magnetic damping, which can be attributed to the similarity of the spin angular momentum dissipation processes responsible for these two effects. Altogether, the high&#8208;quality Heusler compounds allow control over the band structure and therefore the channel for spin angular momentum dissipation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A High&#8208;Performance Carbonate&#8208;Free Lithium|Garnet Interface Enabled by a Trace Amount of Sodium</title>
      <dc:description>
The lithium|garnet interface challenge is addressed by melt&#8208;casting 0.5 wt% sodium&#8208;doped lithium onto a garnet electrolyte surface. The doped lithium melt phase&#8208;transfers the Li2CO3 from the grain boundaries of the garnet electrolyte pellet surface to the top of the doped lithium melt and therefore facilitates the wetting process.








Abstract
Garnet&#8208;type solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are promising for the realization of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries. However, a critical issue associated with the garnet electrolytes is the poor physical contact between the Li anode and the garnet SSE and the resultant high interfacial resistance. Here, it is reported that the Li|garnet interface challenge can be addressed by using Li metal doped with 0.5 wt% Na (denoted as Li*) and melt&#8208;casting the Li* onto the garnet SSE surface. A mechanistic study, using Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) as a model SSE, reveals that Li2CO3 resides within the grain boundaries of newly polished LLZTO pellet, which is difficult to remove and hinders the wetting process. The Li* melt can phase&#8208;transfer the Li2CO3 from the LLZTO grain boundary to the Li*&#8217;s top surface, and therefore facilitates the wetting process. The obtained Li*|LLZTO demonstrates a low interfacial resistance, high rate capability, and long cycle life, and can find applications in future all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (e.g., Li*|LLZTO|LiFePO4).

      <title>Giant Piezospintronic Effect in a Noncollinear Antiferromagnetic Metal</title>
      <dc:description>
A giant piezospintronic effect is discovered in a hexagonal noncollinear antiferromagnet, Mn3Ga. Furthermore, it is found that its Fermi surface and density of states are very sensitive to the spin structure perturbation. Consequently, a nanoscale antiferromagnetic tunnel junction built on Mn3Ga and operated by piezoelectric strain exhibits a more than 10% tunneling resistance modulation at room temperature.








Abstract
One of the main bottleneck issues for room&#8208;temperature antiferromagnetic spintronic devices is the small signal read&#8208;out owing to the limited anisotropic magnetoresistance in antiferromagnets. However, this could be overcome by either utilizing the Berry&#8208;curvature&#8208;induced anomalous Hall resistance in noncollinear antiferromagnets or establishing tunnel&#8208;junction devices based on effective manipulation of antiferromagnetic spins. In this work, the giant piezoelectric strain modulation of the spin structure and the anomalous Hall resistance in a noncollinear antiferromagnetic metal&#8212;D019 hexagonal Mn3Ga&#8212;is demonstrated. Furthermore, tunnel&#8208;junction devices are built with a diameter of 200 nm to amplify the maximum tunneling resistance ratio to more than 10% at room&#8208;temperature, which thus implies significant potential of noncollinear antiferromagnets for large signal&#8208;output and high&#8208;density antiferromagnetic spintronic device applications.

      <title>Efficient Nitrate Synthesis via Ambient Nitrogen Oxidation with Ru&#8208;Doped TiO2/RuO2 Electrocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel Ru&#8208;doped TiO2/RuO2 composite catalyst is designed and applied to the electrochemical nitrogen oxidation reaction, which enables the efficient conversion of nitrogen gas to aqueous nitrate under ambient condition. The optimized Ru&#8208;doped TiO2/RuO2 catalyst shows a considerable nitrate yield rate of 161.9 &#181;mol h&#8722;1 gcat&#8722;1 and a highest nitrate Faradaic efficiency of 26.1%.








Abstract
A facile pathway of the electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) to nitrate is proposed, and Ru&#8208;doped TiO2/RuO2 (abbreviated as Ru/TiO2) as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept catalyst is employed accordingly. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that Ru&#948;+ can function as the main active center for the NOR process. Remarkably doping Ru into the TiO2 lattice can induce an upshift of the d&#8208;band center of the Ru site, resulting in enhanced activity for accelerating electrochemical conversion of inert N2 to active NO*. Overdoping of Ru ions will lead to the formation of additional RuO2 on the TiO2 surface, which provides oxygen evolution reaction (OER) active sites for promoting the redox transformation of the NO* intermediate to nitrate. However, too much RuO2 in the catalyst is detrimental to both the selectivity of the NOR and the Faradaic efficiency due to the dominant OER process. Experimentally, a considerable nitrate yield rate of 161.9 &#181;mol h&#8722;1 gcat&#8722;1 (besides, a total nitrate yield of 47.9 &#181;g during 50 h) and a highest nitrate Faradaic efficiency of 26.1% are achieved by the Ru/TiO2 catalyst (with the hybrid composition of RuxTiyO2 and extra RuO2 by 2.79 wt% Ru addition amount) in 0.1 m Na2SO4 electrolyte.

      <title>Graded 2D/3D Perovskite Heterostructure for Efficient and Operationally Stable MA&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
The efficiency and operational stability of MA&#8208;free FA0.95Cs0.05PbI3 perovskite solar cells can be simultaneously enhanced by the incorporation of the &#946;&#8208;guanidinopropionic acid (&#946;&#8208;GUA) molecule. The introduction of &#946;&#8208;GUA forms a 2D/3D hybrid perovskite phase, which effectively passivates the surface defects, resulting in an impressive power conversion efficiency of 22.2% with a substantial increase in Voc (from 1.01 to 1.14 V).








Abstract
Almost all highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of greater than 22% currently contain the thermally unstable methylammonium (MA) molecule. MA&#8208;free perovskites are an intrinsically more stable optoelectronic material for use in solar cells but compromise the performance of PVSCs with relatively large energy loss. Here, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) deficit is circumvented by the incorporation of &#946;&#8208;guanidinopropionic acid (&#946;&#8208;GUA) molecules into an MA&#8208;free bulk perovskite, which facilitates the formation of quasi&#8208;2D structure with face&#8208;on orientation. The 2D/3D hybrid perovskites embed at the grain boundaries of the 3D bulk perovskites and are distributed through half the thickness of the film, which effectively passivates defects and minimizes energy loss of the PVSCs through reduced charge recombination rates and enhanced charge extraction efficiencies. A PCE of 22.2% (certified efficiency of 21.5%) is achieved and the operational stability of the MA&#8208;free PVSCs is improved.
